<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Amendment 17, at the end of section 29B, add:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Particulars of any requests from the Natural Heritage Ministerial Board to the Committee under this section in a financial year must be included in the annual report about the Reserve for that year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Amendment 17, at the end of section 29D, add:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Minister must cause the minutes of the Natural Heritage Trust Advisory Committee to be made available on request to any member of the public and to be laid before each House of the Parliament at the time when the Minister tables the annual report about the Reserve.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments will help the public. The first amendment requires that the annual report include for public information any 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> requests that the ministers&mdash;Senator Hill and Mr Anderson&mdash;have made to this advisory board so that the public can see what is going on between the ministers who totally control this fund and the advisory board which is able to give advice when and if asked for by the ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said last night, we are very concerned that this advisory board will not be able to free range. It will not be able to look into those matters that it thinks are necessary for the good running of this billion&hyphen;dollar fund from the sale of Telstra. It is going to be trammelled by the conditions which specifically outline the functions of the committee. That includes the first function, which is to advise the two ministers about the integration of the objectives of environmental protection, natural resources management and sustainable agriculture; and the second function, which is to achieve integrated outcomes for the operations of the reserve&mdash;that is, the spending of the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In both those cases I am concerned about the limitations of the word `integration'. It seems that the committee will be able to advise how to integrate the various components aimed at in the spending of this money&mdash;for example, natural resources management, environmental protection and sustainable agriculture but not on those features themselves. When we get to section 3, we find that this committee, when requested by the natural heritage ministerial board&mdash;that is the two ministers&mdash;can advise those ministers about other matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the face of it, that means the environmental experts on this board will not be able to advise the ministers about anything the ministers do not ask for. They have a very closed circle which is very restrictive indeed. The first amendment would enable the public to see what the ministers have asked the advisory council to do. The second amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Minister must cause the minutes of the Natural Heritage Trust Advisory Committee to be made available on request to any member of the public and to be laid before each House of the Parliament at the time when the Minister tables the annual report about the Reserve. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3270"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That means the minutes of this advisory committee will be publicly available. That is pure public accountability. I do not think the minister would have any objection to that. I doubt that Senator Lees will have any worry with it either. I hope that the committee will be able to decide in favour of these two minor improvements in terms of public accountability of a very constricted advisory committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME><STATE> (New South Wales&mdash;</STATE><ROLE>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(9.36 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me very briefly indicate to the committee that the opposition will support these amendments. I said yesterday that the advisory committee, in our view, is not the answer. I do not think the advisory committee removes the real potential for the Natural Heritage Trust Fund to be used as a political slush fund, which does certainly appear to be becoming the modus operandi of this government. The opposition will support the two amendments because they open up the operations of the trust fund a little. They make the operations of the trust fund slightly more transparent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition supports all the requests between the ministerial board and the advisory committee to be included in the annual report, and I think the suggestion that the advisory board's minutes be made available to the public is a reasonable one. We say the operation of the trust should be public, because without public scrutiny the trust is open to abuse. I think there will be a real need for this parliament to scrutinise very closely the operations of all the government's slush funds, and we will be doing just that.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="3270" TIME="9.38 a.m." SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened carefully to the argument of Senator Brown, and I am not convinced that any benefit would flow from it. The annual report provisions within the bill are quite comprehensive. The requests that flow from the board to the committee are really internal matters. It just seems to me to be odd to include the communications between the board and the committee, as they occur during the year, within the annual report. The annual report will set out the workings of the trust for the year. In relation to the second amend 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment, the fact that the minutes could be required at any time by any member of the public just seems to me to be an unnecessary intrusion upon the workings of the committee.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am rather surprised the minister has problems with minutes of a committee designed to open up the process and to make sure that the various programs under the trust fit together. We talked yesterday about the aims of the advisory committee, so I find it most concerning that the minister feels the minutes of the meetings are something that do not need to be available. I thought it would have been something that would cause no-one any great problem. The minutes will be kept as a matter of process. It is not as though there is any extra work to do. They would be available to those people who are interested and concerned about the programs being run, what the priorities of the ministerial board are and tracking where the money is going. So I do not have any difficulty with these two amendments.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="3270" TIME="9.40 a.m." SPEAKER="Brown, Sen Bob" NAMEID="QD4" ELECTORATE="TAS" PARTY="AG" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME><STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.40 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it quite extraordinary that the minister wants to cover up already. His control of this money&mdash;along with fellow Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson&mdash;is going to be total. He is already treating this effort to get an advisory council as a bit of a show. It is nothing more than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He does not even want the minutes of that meeting available to the public&mdash;even though this is public money; even though it is being spent on so-called environmental projects, which are publicly competitive; even though the ministers are going to, on behalf of and in the public interest, refer matters to this council for its deliberation; and even though, I suspect, all members of that council are going to be very happy to be transparent&mdash;not this minister. He wants to cover up from the outset. He wants to put a blanket of secrecy over what this committee is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key to it is, he says, `When we&mdash;' that is, I as the Minister for the Environment, and  Mr Anderson as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, `send a directive to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3271"> this committee to look at any matters that we may want them to look at, and I suspect there will be precious few of them, it is an internal matter.' I submit to you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that it is not an internal matter; it is a matter for the Australian public to be involved in. It is the Australian public's money and it is, of course, the Australian public's environment. When these ministers send requests and messages to this advisory council, it ought to be open and transparent and available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just last night this minister and the government in general were talking about transparency in the budget. They are holding up transparency as a virtue. By the way, I could not see it. The transparency that the minister is talking about came across to me as obfuscation and an ability to hide, but here we have him on test. Is he good and true to this word of transparency when it comes to the public interest? What he is saying is, `These are internal matters. They are secret. The directives that we as ministers are going to give to this advisory committee, and the correspondence in the reverse direction, we want to keep hidden. As the minister, I want to keep total control.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It simply adds fuel to the fire of alarm that this is going to be a slush fund, that this is going to be a fund directed by the ministers with political bias, that it is going to end up favouring those who have the best connections with the government and with coalition members. If that is not the case, let us have it fully open.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister last night, along with coalition members and Senator Harradine, voted against the amendment that the Greens put forward for the whole of this fund to be disbursed by an independent panel. So be it. The minister is keeping total control. The Democrats have come along with a worthwhile effort to at least have some proper environmental advice going into the workings of this fund. It is a pretty modest advisory council set-up. It is totally limited, if you ask me&mdash;it is even hogtied&mdash;by the need to only be instigatory in terms of what it looks at when the ministers so direct.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment, for opaqueness, not transparency, saying, `I don't want my letters to this council open to the gaze of the public. I don't trust the public of Australia to see what I'm doing. I have designs on this money. I am going to use it with fear and favour and I don't want the public to know about that.' This cannot be read any other way. It is part of the pattern of this minister of putting the environment second to his own political interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it was ever very clear that that is what is going on, it is clear in him saying, `I don't want these modest amendments to have the minutes of this advisory council made available to the public, and I particularly don't want&mdash;because it's an internal matter&mdash;to have my letters and correspondence to and from this committee open to public view.' It is an extraordinary snubbing of the public, thumbing of the nose at the public, thumbing of the nose at the public interest and thumbing of the nose at proper due public commitment to good and open government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the record, I do not think it is necessary for this to be part of a statutory regime&mdash;it would be unusual and I think it is unnecessary. But I say to Senator Brown, if he ever wants copies of any formal requests&mdash;I presume he is talking about formal requests rather than just normal communications&mdash;in terms of the legislation, then I would be happy to let him have them. Similarly, I am sure that, if anyone approached us and asked if they could have copies of the minutes of the committee, we would ensure that they have copies of the minutes. But, again, you do not normally include these things within a legislative regime, and it just seems to me to be overdone.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Hill. To have this in a legislative regime is setting a precedent which is not a good precedent as ministers could then say, in respect of requests in other particular areas, `It's not in the legislation so you cannot have the minutes.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3272">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know what the argument is all about. Senator Hill has spoken. Personally, I was thinking of voting for the amendment, but now we have had the assurance from Senator Hill that, presumably, if any honourable senator makes a formal request for the minutes or the other matters referred to in the particular amendment, they would get it. If you think about this for a minute, it is a bit of an unfortunate precedent if you have to have this sort of provision in legislation before ministers cough up with minutes of a whole range of statutory advisory bodies and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is our right, whether it is in the legislation or not. I think all honourable senators should consider what the minister has said and hold him to it not only in this particular area, but also in respect of other matters of information that we desire and are entitled to have, whether or not provisions such as the one that has been moved by Senator Brown are in the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine exclaims about that, but he has not been listening. What the minister said at the outset was that he believed the communications between him and this committee were internal matters&mdash;that is, secret; that is, ought not to be readily available to be seen by the public. Senator Harradine has spoken with Senator Hill, because there was the possibility here that he would vote for this amendment and put the government in the position where it was required to do these things. Senator Hill has given an assurance. I do not accept it. The fact is that he may be minister now but he may not be minister next week or next year. Senator Harradine has been in this place long enough to know that the word given by one minister is not necessarily going to be that of another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is good enough for there to be an open agreement about these matters being available to the public, let's write it in; no harm done. The very fact that the government, and apparently Senator Harradine, are now going to vote against this amendment means that they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do not have total commitment to the words in the amendment&mdash;that is, to allowing these minutes and these messages passed between the advisory council and these two ministers to be, with assurance, available to the public as we go along. It is simply a good housekeeping measure. It is simply a good measure to ensure that future ministers and future communications between the ministers and the council are available to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the way, we are talking about two ministers. We do not have the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) here. We do not have a commitment from him. Even if we did, the giving of that commitment simply endorses the idea of the amendments. The government ought to be voting for this. I would have thought Senator Harradine, who is something of a stickler for transparency, for open government and for the flow of information to the public, would have been supporting this instead of blocking it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that concerns me greatly about this fund is the provision in the farm forestry program for $22 million, plus an unspecified additional amount from the national vegetation initiative, to encourage the incorporation of commercial tree growing and management into farming systems for the purpose of wood and non&hyphen;wood production. The problem here is that the loss of woodlands and forests leads directly to soil and water degradation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would appear that the minister is satisfied to have money spent from this fund actually assisting native vegetation clearance and the loss of woodlands and forests on farmlands. Then he will provide the money out of the Natural Heritage Trust Fund to plant trees to make up for that. It can be seen as an incentive to degrade water and soil through native vegetation clearance. It brings to point this amendment to ensure that the processes leading to land and water degradation are not actually assisted out of this fund. This fund is meant to be for the protection of the environment, not for the degradation of the environment.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like the minister to give the committee an assurance here and now that money from this fund will not be spent on tree plantation schemes which are following on the heels of natural vegetation clearance, and that money from this fund will not be allowed to actually encourage the loss of woodlands or forests into the logging industry or through the sheer impulse to clear native vegetation, through the incentive of then giving money to the people who are involved in those processes to get on with the tree planting scheme. We have to be very careful about this. One of the things that is worrying environmentalists right around this country is that this trust fund is, in its worst applications, going to be able to lead to despoliation of the environment, not to the fixing of it.</PARA></SPEECH>

Currently in Western Australia, the Department of Conservation and Land Management who, as far as we know, do not actually have in their legislative charter anything to do with organising or coordinating salinity programs, seem to be positioning themselves to try to get a fairly substantial chunk of the natural heritage fund. Would the government consider it proper to actually hand over money from the fund to an agency whose legislative role does not actually legally have an element of salinity protection? Would that be what the Commonwealth government would be prepared to do?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment it seems that the Department of Conservation and Land Management are renaming programs so that it looks like they are putting in their bit but they are perhaps taking money out of programs to do with species and other areas where they are meant to be involved in order to position themselves to attract federal funding.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not relevant to this part of the committee consideration but Senator Brown is again just reflecting that he is stuck in this time warp. His views on these matters are really reflective of what were the popularly accepted views 20 years ago when what we were doing to protect biodiversity and the like was to try and lock up more of our natural resources basically through national parks and the like. The real challenge today is not what occurs on reserve but what occurs off reserve.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I put it again to the minister that the farm forestry program, which may receive $22 million&hyphen;plus out of the Natural Heritage Trust Fund has the aim not of environmental considerations pure and simple, as he would have it, but to encourage `the incorporation of commercial tree growing and management into farming systems for the purpose of wood and non&hyphen;wood production'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a crop, and it may well be displacing native vegetation. We in this country are in the deplorable situation that in Queensland, in the latest year for which there are figures, nearly half a million hectares of natural vegetation was bulldozed into oblivion. It is a rate that approaches that of the forest clearances in the Amazon as far as area concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In much of this vegetation clearance area the work has not been done to see that biodiversity is maintained. In fact, when I last visited Ayr in the sugar growing area of coastal Queensland, large areas of woodland&mdash;bushland containing rare and endangered orchids, amongst other things&mdash;were being bulldozed into oblivion without any proper environmental impact assessment and without any of the checks that probity would say that we ought to have as a nation if we

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have got the situation where, on the face of it, money from the Natural Heritage Trust Fund may well go in as an incentive to clearing of native vegetation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have another question for the minister. He said in answer to Senator Margetts that he is very pleased that state governments and instrumentalities, like the notorious CALM in Western Australia, are readjusting what they are doing to get their hands on money from the Natural Heritage Trust Fund. When we get to this natural vegetation clearance, why is it that the minister has not insisted that state governments have natural vegetation clearance controls in place before getting their hands on this money?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3277">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, why is it that the minister is so ready to be handing money across to Queensland government instrumentalities when there is this awesome rate of native vegetation clearance going on in that state? Why is it that the minister is so happy to be handing large components of the money to the Tasmanian government where, as I said last night, the advisory committee on the disbursement of these funds is not in the Department of the Environment but in the Department of the Premier and headed up by a logger from Forestry Tasmania? If that does not set the alarm bells ringing, what does?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no native vegetation clearance ordinances in Tasmania. There is not even a proper biodiversity protection system in place. What we do know is that the regional forest agreement process is coming to a head. Already it is very clear, as was said last week by a major independent assessor in the form of Professor Jamie Kirkpatrick, a professor of geography at the University of Tasmania, that this process is going off the rails; that it is not sticking to environmental excellence. Professor Kirkpatrick has also said that he is very concerned that we are not going to see biodiversity, particularly on private lands in Tasmania, protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the crux of this problem. The minister is not putting in place the environmental checks and balances. He is not using the leverage that this money gives to ensure state governments do protect the spectrum of wildlife&mdash;flora and fauna&mdash;in this country which is threatened by agricultural, logging and mining processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing the public becoming increasingly concerned that this money is simply going to foster the greenwash, which has become standard as far as this minister is concerned and as far as many of the applicants for this money are concerned. The minister has turned down an independent environmental committee to determine where this money should go. He is not going to put pressure on state governments to ensure that they do it right thing before they get the money. He will not give an assurance to the committee that this money will not simply be used for commercial purposes, for economic 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ends. He will not give an assurance to this committee that it will not be used as an incentive for the destruction of woodlands and, therefore, the degradation of soils and waters&mdash;and that is the point of Senator Lees's amendment here, to help tighten up on that just a little.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole thing is becoming a total disappointment, to put the least spin on it.

<PARA STYLE="Para">After lengthy discussions with the government to try to improve this legislation, we have withdrawn quite a number of our amendments and are no longer pursuing them. I believe this is one that does need to be pursued. What it does is tighten up this clause by adding a time line&mdash;that is, we must focus on a time by which we establish a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, `to assist with' basically leaves us with the year 2000, 2020 or the year 3000. While it is obviously an important part of this legislation that we look at establishing that reserve system, we are well behind at the moment when it comes to our rangelands and woodlands, and particularly in East Gippsland when it comes to forests. For the government to leave it open ended is a major concern and therefore we are seeking to actually focus the mind on a particular date or a particular time and hopefully speed up the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we do not move now we will continue to allow clearing of land for agricultural purposes or wholesale felling, as is going on in East Gippsland, and the establishment of pseudo plantations on what was native forest land. They are finding in Errinundra Plateau that the rainforest is not regenerating. They are now moving in and planting and trying to develop plantations up there to provide yet another generation of trees for the woodchip mill. We cannot sit back and leave this to some time towards infinity so far as the current wording of this bill is concerned. That is why we are persisting with this particular amendment. We think that time is against us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Urban expansion is important to consider when it comes to some of our coastal areas and reserving areas along the coast. I note that the New South Wales government has moved at last to designate a large part of Nadgee as a wilderness area. That is it as far as the New South Wales coast is concerned. There are no other areas they can move to put into an adequate reserve system. Unless we move fairly quickly and impress upon state governments that time is of the essence, I really see some major problems for some of  the repre

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the sentiment of what Senator Lees says even though I cannot agree with the amendment. The reason I do not agree with the amendment is that we have recognised all along that the contribution of this fund, even though it would be the largest re&hyphen;investment of capital in the natural environment in Australia's history, will nevertheless only partly fix the problem. What is going to be needed is further capital, further cooperation from the states, as you mentioned, and further contributions from the non-government sector. Ultimately, I hope we will be able to achieve something for this country that we can all stand by and say is a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the marine environment, we are really only just starting on the challenge. What we are doing through this trust is directly investing a further $80 million towards these objectives. In terms of clause 13, which sets out that the prime objective of the reserve system is to assist with the establishment and maintenance of a comprehensive, adequate and representative system of reserves, we will put $80 million in to assist with that. By the year 2000 we will not be able to achieve everything that you would like to see and I would like to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But our objective is to more than make a start&mdash;it is to contribute more than has been contributed in the past. Hopefully, as we continue to build public enthusiasm for the project and public involvement, we will do even better.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only touch of unreality about this is the minister's inactivity and his failure to rise to the challenge that is put into the amended clauses put forward by Senator Lees. In 1974, consequent on the flooding of Lake Pedder by the Tasmanian Labor government of the time, supported by the Liberal opposition with the hydroelectricty commission at 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the height of its power, the Whitlam government decided that there ought to be an Australian heritage commission set up with the aim of effectively establishing a comprehensive, adequate and representative system of reserves for this nation. A quarter of a century ago that aim was brought to the fore. It was found necessary to have a national viewpoint on this and not leave it to state governments because places of national importance like Lake Pedder would, if left to regional governments, from time to time be lost&mdash;to the loss of the national and the international community as a whole. Lake Pedder was of world heritage significance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have, 23 years down the line, a minister for the environment sitting at the desk here in the Senate saying that he hopes that this will come to be some time in the future but that he cannot and will not make a commitment to a full reserve system being established in the nation under the auspices of the national government by the end of this century. We know in the budget that a billion dollars are being set aside for great national projects for the centenary of Federation. But we cannot put in place, because of the lack of political will and a failure of vision by this Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), a system of proper national parks and protected areas to ensure that this nation's natural heritage is handed on to future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will have the minister getting up and saying that that is an old&hyphen;fashioned point of view. I would like to add to that by reading from a letter the Humane Society International has written to a number of us, including the minister, expressing concern about this Natural Heritage Trust in that it is a timely weapon to be used as leverage on state governments doing the wrong thing about the environment. In summary, it says quite sensibly that before the states get this money they ought to be obliged, amongst other things, to put in vegetation clearance controls to ensure that we do keep an adequate system of reserves and that we do protect the nation's extraordinarily rich and wonderful diversity of plants and animal life.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3280">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Director of the Humane Society International, Michael Kennedy, wrote to the minister just a week ago saying this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This brief note is to express our extreme concern at the implications for the conservation of biological diversity that may arise from the Commonwealth, State and Territory actions in response to the Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This concern stems from Government's proposals that may see some 42% of the country converted from leasehold to freehold status&mdash;exchanging government controls in pastoral leases (minimal as the are) for ownership that would permit a new range of primary production developments that may not be ecologically sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was particularly alarming to read in yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the letter is dated 7 May&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the Queensland Government is already moving ahead to convert an area covering some 22 million hectares to freehold, relinquishing as the Government will, any powers it has to effectively protect biodiversity. The ill consequences for the natural environment in Queensland may be catastrophic in breadth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Kennedy goes on further to say to this minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was also alarming to note that between January and November, 1996, the Queensland Minister for Natural Resources, Mr Howard Hobbs, has issued licences to clear 497,000 hectares of native vegetation. The Minister was also quoted in the SMH article as saying (in relation to the conversion of leasehold properties), "<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">What this is about is providing security, so a future Labour Government can't come in with stupid things like land&hyphen;clearing controls or whatever.</EMPHASIS> "'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the recently published 1996 State of the Australia Environment Report noted, vegetation clearance is the greatest threat to the loss of biological diversity in the country today. We urge you&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, environment minister Senator Hill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">therefore to do all that you can to ensure that such wholesale leasehold conversions do not become a national feature of the Commonwealth's response to the Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will be asking the Biological Diversity Advisory Council (BDAC) to write to you along similar lines in regard to this matter, when it meets in Canberra next week.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is this week. His final paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">May we also suggest, in the wake of the Queensland Government's attitudes towards land clearance, that any monies being sought by the Queensland Government under the guise of the Natural Heritage Trust, or indeed any other State or Territory Government that cannot 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> demonstrate adequate land clearance controls (NSW for example is about to exempt rural land clearing controls from the provisions of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Threatened Species Conservation Act, 1995</EMPHASIS> ) be denied pending the adoption of policies that have been publicly debated, and widely agreed to be effective.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are not my words; they are the words of an independent organisation concerned specifically with biological diversity. It has an international reputation and it is working to protect the species of this country in a world in which the loss of species is calculated to be some 50 to 100 a day, primarily due to the loss of natural vegetation cover, including forest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister says, `Oh, it is unreal to expect us to be involved in a process leading to a comprehensive, adequate and representative system of reserves by the year 2000.' Minister, you are unreal in this. You are getting in the way of the expectations of this country that you, as chief environment advocate, because that is your responsibility as minister, will represent the aspirations of people who do want a comprehensive national park and reserve system to protect our magnificent range of species of creatures in this country, including flora, by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every government comes along and says that it cannot be done in our time and now we have the minister saying the same thing. He is sitting there with his chin in his hand saying, `I don't want to commit myself to this. I am the Minister for the Environment. Why should I have vision as far as the environment is concerned? Why should I have a commitment as far as the environment is concerned. I have other parameters in this age of economic rationalism which I want to put first.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only reiterate that the responsible position would be for the minister to accept the challenge coming from Senator Lees in this very worthwhile amendment. Instead, there is no leverage being used out of this billion dollar fund of public money to ensure that state governments do the right thing by protecting the nation's biological treasures.  There is no leverage at all. In fact, as we have discovered in the last half hour or so, the minister is quite content to totally fail in his 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3281"> responsibility to ensure that the worst excesses of this fund are mitigated against while we have the opportunity to do so in this committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a pretty shameful process. I feel disgusted as an environmentalist to be confronted by what I see as a dereliction of obligation and duty to the environment by a minister and by a government which has enormous leverage through this fund to do the right thing. Senator Harradine, of course, is pivotal in this matter. If he were to use the position he has, we would be seeing these amendments getting up instead of being lost and we would not see the minister being able to get away with his obfuscation, his failure, and his wimpish attitude to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worse than that; he is actively against the interests of the environment because he is toadying to the economic rationalist impulses of the wider cabinet, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer of the day. They are, in turn, being very easily pressured into the dictates of the rich and the powerful, the stock exchange and the corporate sector which does not want to see clearance controls. Is Mr Packer, with his extensive leasehold interests in this country, going to want to see clearance controls, the protection of the nation's biodiversity or regulations that are going to trammel his economic interests? Of course he is not. The same can be said for a large number of other millionaires and billionaires in this country and, indeed, land controlling interests which are outside the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is where the pressure comes from which is leading to this minister sitting there failing to answer challenges coming from the committee and certainly failing to rise to the occasion to use this opportunity to get something very positive and progressive done for the environment. As Senator Faulkner said, all that we are seeing established is a slush fund, an opportunity for green wash and window dressing, as the nation's natural vegetation cover and its grand forests in all those forested states of this country get clobbered at the greatest rate in history under licence from the very same minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Brown, as his piece de resistance, said that I voted against the word `ecological' last night.

Yet here we have Senator Harradine saying, `I'm not going to back that. I don't have the fibre, the strength or the commitment to make sure that this government is held to a clear and definitive plan instead of a lot of wish and wash.' The Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) has made it clear that he is not going to support it either. So Senator 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3283"> Harradine's pivotal vote is going to fail the environment again on this score. It is a pretty sad reflection on the role of the Senate, if you ask me, but there you go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Lees is to be congratulated for this amendment, as with other amendments she has brought forward. I think we are going to see a continuing process of such excellent amendments, which tighten this legislation up, defeated by the pivotal vote of Senator Harradine, who assists the government wherever he may by sticking to the loose, wishy washy, unspecified legislation that we have in the disbursement of these funds&mdash;a lost opportunity. And not least a lost opportunity to put leverage on state governments like those in Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia, in particular, to put an end to the open slather destruction of native vegetation cover, including our forests, which is the greatest threat to biodiversity in this country, and to ensure that that reserve system is put in place at least a quarter of a century after the national parliament took up the challenge of the national responsibility of governments to define where the Australian heritage was, to define its values and to take up the onus of protecting it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do want to ask the minister briefly&mdash;understanding the points he makes about what might be the restrictions and constraints of placing a time frame or a limit on the establishment of the reserve system; appreciating the points he makes about the need for flexibility, and also the environmental challenges beyond the year 2000 as the reserve system may develop&mdash;what interrelationship he believes there is between that time frame and the capacity of his department to be able to meet such a time frame, given the very significant cuts to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service that are outlined in the budget?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the reason that you make that contribution, Minister, is because of a resource issue, if it is because of your government's own budget cuts in this area which are limiting the capacity of the government to move towards the establishment of the reserve system, then I think it does, in fact, diminish the strength of your arguments quite considerably and I would quite seriously ask you to make a contribution. When I read in the budget papers that the 1996&hyphen;97 appropriation for the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service goes from $43,378,000 to $35,858,000 this financial year, I am interested in the interrelationship between that cutback, in terms of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, and the capacity of the government to move towards the establishment of a reserve system by the year 2000.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, there is some need for us to tighten administration of our parks structure, and that is being done through the budget, as Senator

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts would support me in drawing his attention to the fact that the Giblett block of grand karri and jarrah trees in Western Australia is only being defended by a band of citizens against his injunction to the logging companies to go ahead, against the advice of his own Heritage Commission, because he has failed to come to the defence of those forests, though it is his responsibility.</PARA>

That is compounded by his failure to act now when he has the opportunity to use leverage to protect ecosystems against other state governments which are willy-nilly allowing the destruction of this nation's panoply of species, its natural heritage. He just mouths the public relations key words that seem to say that he is sincere and he is concerned. When it comes to action, he is on the side of the chainsaws and bulldozers. His own actions show that. That is why I have no concerns about saying that he is the worst Minister for the Environment in the history of this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will be supporting this amendment. It is very similar to one that the Democrats persisted with earlier on when we initially started debating this bill. Our concern then and now with the government's wording is that economics is there again up at the top. While I listened to what the minister had to say about farming communities certainly improving their understanding of what is ecologically viable, the fact that the government again has economics ahead of all the rest does ring some alarm bells.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Economic viability for many of our farming communities has really meant economic survival in the short term. Their definition of economic viability unfortunately has been, `Can we hold off the banks and manage to put food on the table for another season?' Hopefully this bill is going to be working with and supporting those farmers, particularly many of those in landcare organisations, who at last understand that that is a very short&hyphen;term view of the world and of their property and who understand that they have to undo the practices of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, it may cost them money in the short term to put back the trees and to remove some of the works that were put in years ago&mdash;perhaps, once we look at some of the salinity problems, dams will have to go. To again have this economic viability, they may need considerable economic support in the short term to get to the point where the farm 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is actually ecologically sustainable and the community socially viable. So while I understand that the minister has been saying the right words and certainly understands where the farming community should be heading, I think the government's wording of this particular section 16, which is the definition of sustainable agriculture, is still sending the wrong message to many people out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to congratulate those farmers who have made the sacrifice, because they knew they had to destock and they knew they had to give some breathing space between crops. But that has put enormous pressure on them economically. Indeed, if they go and ask their bank, the bank says to them, `Sorry. You shouldn't be doing that. You've got this interest payment due, and that payment due next June.' To put the economic viability issue in the definition again really confuses what this bill should be all about.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I had intended to move a motion to delete clause 17, which is the definition of natural resources management. Instead of that, I move the amendment now circulated which amends the wording of this clause by deleting the words, `management of the use, development or' where those words twice appear. Again, it is pretty simple, basic environmental logic that, if you are going to spend money on the environment and on natural resources management, you do it on activities relating to the conservation of soil, water and vegetation&mdash;and that is your focus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the minister is providing for in this clause is that, before conservation, you can spend money on the management of the use and development of soil, water and vegeta 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion. That is totally around the wrong way. This is an environmental trust fund. It is not a development or use of resources trust fund. It is not meant to foster mining corporations which might be able to show that they are in the business of the use and development of the soil; dam building operations that are in the business of the use and development of water, or agricultural operations that are in the business of, for instance, the clearance of vegetation. It is about conservation, so let us make it about conservation. It is as simple as that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and Senator Harradine&mdash;whose vote is pivotal to these amendments, which we are losing serially here today&mdash;ought to lift their focus and get back to the environment, which is what this fund is supposed to be about. It is pretty awful that, instead of that, the primary meaning of natural resources management in the clause as it stands&mdash;as far as Senator Hill, no doubt influenced by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, and Prime Minister Howard, are concerned&mdash;is the use and development of our lands, our waters and our vegetation. The woodchippers will love that. So will the Packer corporation and other big land&hyphen;holding investments which are in the business of potential land clearance further down the line. The dam builders, who see parts of our wild and natural remnant domain in this country as targets, will love it too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very rare piece of legislation devoted to the environment. Day after day, week after week, month after month we see going through here pieces of legislation aimed at fostering development and use. Here we have a piece of legislation about the environment, yet the minister has managed to put the environment last after development and use.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly the point. It comes out of previous legislation which is to do with the financial assistance act of 1992. This is the environment assistance act of 1997. Get your focus right. We are talking about the environment here. Let us put the environment back on the frontburner. What you are doing is putting it on the backburner. The Minister for the Environment knows what he is doing. The government knows what it is doing. On the one hand, the government, along with Senator Harradine, is beating its chest and telling the public, `We've got all this Telstra money we are spending on the environment; it is unprecedented in history'. But, on the other hand, its policies are actually leading to a degradation of the environment&mdash;unprecedented in history&mdash;at a time when there is public alarm, particularly amongst the young people of this country. It is unprecedented in history as far as the environment is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some excellent projects that have come out of land care, but there has been a lot of money frittered away as well, as many of the rural people who contact me tell me. The people who do the right thing ought to be encouraged. We should tighten up these definitions so that we see that it does go in the right direction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Brown has made a very good point. Despite the clear concerns that the community had, the government kept asking again and again why the Greens were not pleased to support the sale of Telstra because there was going to be all this extra money going to the environment. It is becoming patently clear as this debate is proceeding that the money is not going to the environment. The money is going to many different 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> places. The environment is the least of the government's concerns and, as Senator Lees suggested, an afterthought. The fact that the word `ecological' is not in there suggests it is not about maintaining biodiversity but about using it, whatever that means, from the government's point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Specifically, what I wanted to ask the minister followed on from my previous questions about the proposal to hand a big chunk of money to a lead agency in Western Australia, the Department of Conservation and Land Management.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point is that the objectives of the bill in this particular clause are the use and development, before conservation, of soil, water and vegetation. Anybody who is at school today would tell this minister that an environmental trust fund ought to be aimed at the conservation of land, soil and vegetation. What the minister is doing is putting the priority on development and the use of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3291"> biodiversity, but that includes in Western Australia a land management agency that is notorious for its destruction of forests and ecosystems and for the mismanagement of its environmental responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts is saying that a large amount of money will come out of this fund for the ostensible purpose of offsetting increasing salinity&mdash;it is an awesome problem in Western Australia due largely to agricultural and logging clearances&mdash;and it will go to CALM, the conservation and land management authority, which has not got in its charter the management of salinity. The minister says, `I will do it in consultation with state governments.' Let us not be diverted into the record of the Court state government. But, as we sit here today, let me repeat that that government along with this minister, who purports to be for the environment and has the label of Minister for the Environment, gave the licence to the chainsaws and the bulldozers to move in on the Giblett block in Western Australia and destroy a particularly valuable patch of it which the Australian Heritage Commission had told the minister in 1994 was of particular value and had put on the interim listing for the National Estate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who could have faith after that dereliction of duty? Who could have faith in this warped set of priorities that puts conservation last in a piece of legislation that is about conservation excellence? It is an appalling set&hyphen;up. It is an affront to people in this country who are alarmed about the loss of our natural heritage and about the loss of our flora and fauna&mdash;wildlife, habitats, ecosystems and environmental amenity. It is simply an invitation for those who are in positions of influence with this government to get their hands on some money for the use and development of our natural resources with a glib throw&hyphen;in of some conservation motive which all the worst of the environmental despoilers these days know how to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment that the Greens have put forward specifically focuses on this minister's responsibilities because otherwise he is going to have total control&mdash;he has rejected having environmental experts make these decisions, and he is going to make them himself, with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the minister for agriculture. The amendment would specifically direct his attention to the definition of natural resources management as being an activity relating to conservation of soil, water and vegetation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our preferred option is that the environment minister be the minister with the final say on all matters relating to what is supposedly an environment fund. The government's amendment is basically giving the okay for the minister for primary industries to make decisions independent of the environment minister and we would have great difficulty in voting on this first. While we have been assured that there will be cabinet level consultation, there is no guarantee of that in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving the government's amendments ahead of ours causes a considerable amount of difficulty for us. We are mindful of the fact that the government amendment is an improvement on the legislation. We welcome joint initiatives. That is our third option. Ahead of that is that the environment minister has the final say in all matters. Second to that is amendment No. 19, which I will move later, which gives him a veto if there is any conflict and gives him the final decision. This is a third option. It is certainly a lot better than simply leaving it to one or other of the ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As noted on the running sheet, government amendments Nos 1 and 2 on BA340 are being moved first.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill laughs. The situation is that we have a bill before us that effectively means that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, without an involvement of the Minister for the Environment, can make important decisions in relation to the future of the natural environment in this country. That is of concern to me. I am making the point Senator Hill that I am putting aside the personalities involved. It is possible in the instance we face at the moment that Mr Anderson may have more interest in protecting the environment than you have.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regardless of that, regardless of the individuals that currently and temporarily occupy the positions of Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and Minister for the Environment, the principle is that the Minister for the Environment ought to have a clear role in making decisions in relation to these matters. Anything that ensures that the Minister for the Environment exercises his or her responsibilities in relation to this I think is an improvement. I stress that this is supposed to be an environment trust fund and, therefore, I believe it is proper that the environment minister be involved. In the view of the opposition, Senator Lees's amendments improve the drafting of the bill and ensure that both ministers have to enter into an agreement on behalf of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge Senator Hill to be far more serious about the exercise of his responsibilities in this regard; to take his responsibilities much more seriously than he has. It is disappointing to me that an environment minister could come before the parliament and propose that he not have a role in the administration of the Natural Heritage Trust in this way. That, in itself, says it all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though you do not appear to be willing to protect yourself, Senator Hill, I hope that the Senate will agree to ensure that you have a role. Then the ball will be in your court for you to take up the cudgels on behalf of the protection of the environment in this country, and to exercise some responsibilities in the administration of your portfolio. It is a heavy responsibility that you have and we are all disappointed to see that you have abdicated it to Mr Anderson and the National Party.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lees, you do not understand. The problem here is that the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) wants to divest himself of responsibility and power, and your amendment, Senator Lees, is giving him the appropriate responsibility to ensure that this money is spent on the environment. He does not want to take that. He wants to make himself even weaker than he is; he wants to wimp out on his responsibilities; and he wants

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments that you are bringing forward, Senator Lees, would make him responsible as Minister for the Environment for the environment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is going up with those tiny sectional interests that wield the power&mdash;and let the Australian people go jump. That is what Senator Hill says, in effect. Goodness me, here is Senator Lees from the Democrats saying that Senator Hill should have his signature and authority on the disbursement of all these funds. Senator Hill has a different plan. He wants the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson)&mdash;the minister for land degradation, if you like to see it that way&mdash;to be given the authority. That is the fox in charge of the chook house while the lame duck Minister for the Environment quacks on the outside hoping that nobody will notice that he is totally incapable and that he is effectively the agent of the fox and not the protector of the fowls.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What an extraordinary situation. You could skirt close to laughing about it if it were not so serious. Taking a more serious line on it, Senator Lees, of course you are absolutely right: commonsense would dictate that this minister would be making sure that he had the authority to look after the interests of the environment instead of divesting himself of it, and he would be endorsing your amendment&mdash;in fact, he would have written it that way in the first place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real power here is going to be with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The economically rationalist government of this country, whose performance on the environment is irresponsible, not only is disappointing the people who are concerned about the environment within this country but is increasingly leading to Australia getting an awful reputation internationally as a developed country which is turning its back on its environmental responsibilities. It is more about kowtowing to the coal and woodchip industries and the big agricultural corporations than it is about having the responsibility for the Australian people carried into cabinet through this minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He sits there and makes little comments on the side; he fails to get up when challenged on key points; he fails to get up and defend his role in selling the environment out. He is going to sell out as well on the opportunity which Senator Lees presents here for him to put a bit of muscle and fibre into his responsibilities&mdash;no doubt aided by Senator Harradine, who, if there is a division on the matter, will support the government, because that is consistently what he has done throughout this pretty tawdry sell&hyphen;out of the environment against the expectations of the people who voted for this government on the basis that this much vaunted Natural Heritage Trust Fund was really going to be about protecting and enhancing Australia's environmental fortunes.</PARA>

It is a new concept but we think it is time that Australia developed this concept in relation to its natural resources&mdash;that is, a cooperative approach towards these issues between those who have a particular focus on the environmental outcomes and those who have a particular focus on the primary industry outcomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does give those of us who have the environment focus a greater input to primary production decision making in this country than has ever been the case in the past. To include a provision such as in this amendment would be inconsistent with that spirit of cooperation. It would send a wrong signal in fact. But, to use your hypothetical example, if you want to ask a question about that in this place then, as I am responsible for the legislation, I would be the appropriate minister to receive the question.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interpreting the question technically because in terms of wanting to get the best answer you may prefer to ask the other minister depending on the question. In terms of technical responsibility, I think it is the environment minister because the environment minister is responsible for the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the questions are specifically related to a program that was primarily administered by the primary industries minister, such as landcare, you might prefer to ask that minister the question. But if you got up and said, `I want to ask it of Hill because Hill is responsible for the legislation,' then I will do my best to answer. Because I will now have a greater degree of input into the landcare program, particularly towards the biological diversity objectives, than has ever been the case in the past, I think I would probably be in a better position to answer the question than any previous environment minister.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the point made by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill). I thank him for his answer because it basically confirms that what we are trying to do is not in conflict with the legislation; that we are only putting up this amendment to say that the final decision&mdash;should there be a problem&mdash;lies with the Minister for the Environment. If the environment minister is happy for the other minister to deal with the issue, to make decisions on the issue, to sign off on a state agreement, to sign off on a landcare agreement, that is fine, but we are talking about times when we need a final decision and somebody finally responsible. That is why this amendment, I believe, covers one of the very important issues that we really do need to come to terms with. It is not as threatening

Again, we offer the hand of friendship here to Senator Hill to assist him in the battles that we would like him to have within government to protect the environment, the battles that it appears he will just shy away from or turn his back on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support that sentiment, Madam Chair. Can you imagine what the outcry would be if there were a piece of legislation or a suite of pieces of legislation dealing with economic development where the Minister for the Environment had a veto or a full equal say on the outcome? Of course, it would be a sensible thing to do, but it is so far from the unreal way in which the economic rationalists think and the pressures they have to respond to that there would be outrage. But here we have a piece of environmental legislation over which Senator Lees is proposing that the minister have ultimate authority and that it not be left to ministers whose direction can be totally against the environmental good, and the minister says, `I won't have it.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Faulkner says, the minister is not going to rise to the occasion. He can sit and swivel in his chair and occasionally smile, as he looks down, about his failure to defend the environment and his failure to uphold his ministerial responsibilities. Once again, Senator Lees has found that the minister cannot rise to the occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us be clear about this: it is not a matter of the government wanting him to act in this way. This is a matter of a minister who does not have any fight for the environment in him, who is not an advocate for the environment and who is a handservant of people 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whose interests are inimical to the environment. We are seeing that pattern unfold in a pretty gruesome and totally unsatisfactory way here today in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is part of the face of this government that is being exposed here. It is part of the harsh, cold face it is turning against the warmth which Australians feel towards their environmental amenity. What we are doing a little of is presenting to that public the new age of environmental irresponsibility as the economic rationalists and materialists have full sway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we can have a minister for development and primary resource extraction and interests&mdash;and National Party interests. In Queensland, among other things, they advocate broadscale clearance of native vegetation, and laugh and scoff about rare and endangered species. In New South Wales they have wanted on occasions in the recent past to invade national parks and log them. In Tasmania, besides eulogising Pauline Hanson last weekend, they are terribly in favour of the woodchip industry as it marauds the rainforests and tall eucalypt forests which should have world heritage or national park protective status. Those interests are overriding this weak and irresponsible minister who is selling out, who cannot even stand the potential of being ultimately responsible for employing a veto over another minister who wants to spend money out of this fund in a direction that is not in the interests of the environment.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3299">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments 10 and 11 are stronger amendments which would have given this minister far greater power. You would not have simply been relying on cooperatively working towards common goals. I believe it is really important to tie the states in both to stop cost shifting and to stop them doing things which are directly in opposition to the thrust of the aims and objectives of this fund. Two states&mdash;and Senator Brown has mentioned that Tasmania is one of those states&mdash;are still wholesale land clearing. Why are we going to give Tasmania money to plant trees, which they are legitimately entitled to apply for&mdash;and no doubt a number of landcare groups already have applications in&mdash;when we are going to allow the state government to keep signing licences for people to do whatever they like?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no protection for the vast amount of native forests on private land. Tasmania is in a unique position&mdash;and I stand to be corrected by either Senator Harradine or Senator Brown&mdash;because I think at least 50 per cent of its remaining significant forests are on private land. There is nothing in this bill to prevent wholesale clearing. Indeed, previous actions by this government, including opening up private forests for woodchipping, are encouraging this very thing to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were trying to give this government some power to say to the states, `If you want to get money under this fund, if you want to get money out of the trust, then you do not allow your farmers or your landholders to do anything that is in direct contradiction with the aims and objectives of what we are supposedly setting up as an environment fund.' Again, I acknowledge that in No. 9 the government is happy to talk about working cooperatively. Obviously that is the prime objective and that is the preferred outcome. But we are talking about two states&mdash;Queensland, in particular&mdash;which show absolutely no interest in stopping the clearing of between 500,000 and 800,000 and maybe even a million hectares a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether we talk about its impact on greenhouse, salinity or erosion, the impact is huge. We are setting up a fund to help farmers 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> manage their land properly to undo some of the damage inflicted by previous generations, who came from a country that has much higher rainfall and totally different soils to us and presumed they could farm it using the same practices. The current generation of farmers is left with a mess to clean up at huge expense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of all the amendments we retain that the government is not supporting&mdash;and I think there is only another half a dozen&mdash;Nos 10 and 11 are really critical ones. It was not going to stop the states wholesale land clearing; they can keep doing that under state legislation. But it would have had a financial disincentive put in place to discourage them from doing that if they wanted money under this fund. It went beyond just land clearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 11 provides that an agreement under subsection 2 must include an undertaking that the state receiving the grant must not do anything contrary to the principles of this act. If we go back to the principles in the act, we see that it goes well beyond just looking at native vegetation; it goes to endangered species, coasts and marine acquisitions. As the minister has said time and again in this debate, it goes right across a whole range of environment initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the amount of money allocated for the Murray-Darling Basin initiative. Queensland is one of the biggest remaining problems as it is clearing land that is within the basin. I believe its intention to put yet more dams on rivers that flow down into the basin is a problem that this federal government should be concerned about. While we cannot stop it doing that under this legislation or indeed under any Commonwealth legislation, we can at least discourage it by not saying, `Come on in, be part of all this and get money for this.' Under the Murray-Darling Basin initiative, they are entitled to money. It is an ongoing concern that this government and future governments will have, particularly with the Queensland government and to some extent with the Tasmanian government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3300"> been said, I agree with Democrats amendment No. 9, but I am unable to support amendments 10 and 11, although we agree with the spirit of the amendments. It is similar to the debate we have been having in regard to a number of other clauses. That is, whether you progress an objective through a cooperative arrangement&mdash;in this instance, a cooperative arrangement with the states&mdash;or whether you seek to pursue that objective through legislative prescription. We believe the former is more consistent with the spirit of the partnership agreements that we are establishing and is a better way of doing business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The negotiations we have been having with the states have been cooperative. They have not always been easy. Some of the difficulties that we are seeking to overcome through those negotiations have been mentioned in this debate. Senator Lees mentioned one, and that is the practices in Queensland which might affect the flow into the Murray-Darling system. As you know, Queensland is now cooperating within the Murray-Darling mechanisms. Within that, there are certain obligations that Queensland will have to face up to. I think that will be the subject of some discussion at the next ministerial council meeting to be held in a week or two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will progress that matter, and it is a matter of making the case. What we recognise&mdash;although some in here have not been prepared to accept it today&mdash;is that this fund does give us a certain amount of leverage that we can use towards these better environmental outcomes. We do not start from the premise that the states are evil; we start from the premise that all Australians want to see a better environmental outcome. Now, through a cooperative arrangement, we have a funding base to help achieve it, but that is only part of the answer as well. The other part of the answer is the adoption of better practices, and we think we can influence better outcomes in that regard through a cooperative response.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will support the Australian Democrats' amendment No. 9, which comes about as a result of a compromise between the government and the Australian Democrats. It is an attempt to ensure that some cross-compliance mechanism is included in the bill to ensure that the trust's funds are not granted to states which are pursuing policies that are contradictory to the stated purposes of the trust. We say that&mdash;and I do not want to be unkind to Senator Lees&mdash;this amendment is tokenism. We say that it should be stronger, but I appreciate this is the best you have been able to negotiate in difficult circumstances with a recalcitrant government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the fact that, when you consider Queensland's clearing laws being in contradiction to the trust vegetation initiative, it really does provide a good example of why these mechanisms should be stronger in the bill. So we say that the amendment is weak but we also say that we will support it because it is an improvement on the first draft of the bill, which included no reference to cross-compliance at all. The issue of cross-compliance was considered to be a very important issue by the Senate committee, which recommended, in fact, that the bill be  amended to include measures to ensure that no project receive funding where existing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3301"> regulations worked against the achievements of the goals of the trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also acknowledge the fact that Senator Lees has proposed other amendments which go further. The Australian Democrats' amendment No. 11 inserts subclause (3D), which requires states to give an undertaking not to do anything contrary to the purpose of the act, which effectively rules out state programs that undermine the intent of the trust. So that would mean, in the example that I used before in relation to Queensland, that they would not receive funds under the vegetation initiative while they continued to allow land clearing. Again, I think this is a good amendment. I am disappointed the government will not support it, but it will have the support of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats' amendment No. 10 that stands in Senator Lees's name, which is before the chair at the moment, also will be supported by the opposition. We think this amendment is important to ensure that the trust is accountable. It inserts a new subclause to ensure new funds are not only applied to new projects. It aims to avoid cost shifting between the states and the Commonwealth, as I understand it. It is unclear to me if such an amendment would actually prevent cost shifting. Nevertheless, on the information I have before me, I think it is worthy of support, and I inform the committee that it will receive the opposition's support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes left, I will speak for the last time on these three amendments, and that is to amendment No. 10 regarding cost shifting. I wonder if this minister is aware of how inventive the states can be. Perhaps I can give you an example in health. It is pretty blatant when they start charging people against the Medicare agreement for emergency treatment in public hospitals. It is perhaps not so obvious when they start letting people out of hospital with only one night's medication and saying to them, `Look, just pop down to your doctor in the morning and get the rest of your antibiotics.'</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to comment on a unique sporting opportunity currently being staged in the Northern Territory. The fourth Arafura Games commenced last Saturday, 10 May, and will run for a week through to this coming Saturday, 17 May. The Arafura Games began in 1991 and have proven an outstanding success, growing more successful with each biennial games. The games provide 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3302"> top level competition for developing athletes from all around the Asia-Pacific region and, perhaps more importantly, a forum in which Australia can develop relations with our close South-East Asian neighbours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first games saw 1,500 athletes compete from seven countries. By 1995, this had grown to 4,072 participants from 18 countries. This year, the impressive participation from 1995 will be further increased with a record of 5,253 participants involved from 26 countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be 26 sports contested at the games consisting of&mdash;and let me take a few minutes to list them&mdash;athletics, Australian Rules football, badminton, baseball, basketball, boxing, clay target, cricket, golf, gymnastics, hockey, lawn bowls, netball, pistol shooting, rugby union, sepak takraw, softball, squash, swimming, table tennis, tenpin bowling, touch, tennis, triathlon, volleyball and water polo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The crowd favourite is sepak takraw. This volleyball-like game is a study in skill and coordination as it is played only with the feet. Athletes make spectacular overhead kicks to `spike', and this event alone is worth the price of admission, notwithstanding the many other high standard sports being played.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to acknowledge that the Defence Force personnel make an important contribution to the games, with a participating team of 265 this year. I am pleased that the Commonwealth government so actively supports this important event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the feature that makes the Arafura Games so unique is the atmosphere. Competition is of a very high standard but is played in the true sporting tradition. People from all over the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region come not only to compete but also to develop new regional links, renew old friendships and make new ones. The emphasis is on friendly competition and happily, unlike many other international sporting events, the Arafura Games has maintained and propagated this atmosphere between participants, spectators and the general population of Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This aspect of the Arafura Games is particularly important at the present time with an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unfortunate and misguided atmosphere of xenophobia and racism being fostered by some people in Australia. The Arafura Games and the people of Darwin act as important ambassadors to the people of the Asia-Pacific region. The open, friendly and multicultural atmosphere of Darwin demonstrates to the participants of the Arafura Games that these views are held by a misguided few and are not the views of the vast majority of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very make-up of Darwin with its cosmopolitan population of over 80,000 people comprising people from over 70 different ethnic groups shows the value of a multicultural society. They help contribute to a modern, vibrant, tropical city that could be used as a model of racial and social harmony for the rest of Australia, indeed the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to its wonderful and unique population, Darwin is lucky to have sports facilities of the highest quality. The facilities which are used for the Arafura Games include the Marrara sports complex, which is located in Darwin's northern suburbs close to the international airport. This complex consists of the Marrara indoor stadium, a world class hockey field, a state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art synthetic athletics track, soccer pitch, rugby field, baseball diamond, gun club, turf cricket wicket and a 25,000 capacity football stadium lit to television standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of the sports played at the Arafura Games are played at the Marrara sports complex and this contributes immensely to the success of the games. Spectators and athletes are able to wander from event to event with ease that this close proximity allows. Transport to and from events is made as simple as possible with extensive use of public transport facilities and the general ease of commuting around Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The quality of these facilities and the general growth and potential of Darwin is demonstrated by Darwin's recent bid to host the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Whilst that bid was unsuccessful, the Australian Commonwealth Games Association representatives were very impressed with the bid, the existing facilities and the 10&hyphen;year master plan 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3303"> for Marrara. I am sure it now also exceeds the dream and the vision of the architect of that proposal, the now federal member for the Northern Territory, Nick Dondas, when he was an important minister for sport in the Northern Territory government. The master plan showed the potential of Marrara and is being implemented to enhance the facilities for Darwin residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the Darwin community are enthusiastic supporters of the Arafura Games. Perhaps the best example of this support is the attendance at the opening ceremony. The opening ceremony spectacular is held at Darwin's international stadium at Football Park, Marrara. This year, the opening ceremony of the Arafura Games was witnessed by a crowd of 12,000 people. This is almost 15 per cent of Darwin's population, which is quite an amazing level of attendance for any event and shows the willingness and desire of the people of Darwin to view and support top level competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attendance at the games for all events is a tribute to the organisers of the games and the people of Darwin. It also indicates the preferred way of life for most people in Darwin, which is outdoor living and making the best of the wonderful dry season climate. The climate during the Arafura Games is perfect for sport, with temperatures ranging from 18 degrees Centigrade overnight to 30 degrees Centigrade at midday. Most sporting events are held late in the afternoon and at night enabling participants to avoid the heat of the day and the maximum number of spectators to enjoy the games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Arafura Games enjoy significant support from the people of Darwin and also receive substantial assistance from the Northern Territory government. This includes providing a major events unit and funding for the 1997 event totalling $1.4 million. I would like to congratulate the Northern Territory minister responsible for the coordination of the Arafura Games, the Hon. Steve Hatton MLA, on the success of this year's games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The staff at the Arafura Games office must also be thanked and congratulated for their hard work and for making the games such a well organised and friendly event. Particular 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mention must be made of the Arafura Games office's General Manager, Wally Mauger, and his staff for their untiring efforts to make the games a focus for sport in the Asia-Pacific region. They are an example of what can be achieved with vision, cooperation and hard work between government and the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of the Northern Territory must also be recognised for the large part they play in the continuing success of the Arafura Games. Many visitors comment on the friendly, relaxed and accepting attitude of Territorians and the support they provide for all competitors and officials. It is this aspect of the Territory character which makes the Arafura Games unique and creates the atmosphere that visitors and locals alike so enjoy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I acknowledge the outstanding achievement of the Northern Territory team participating in the games. To date, the Territory's medal tally stands at 42 gold, 26 silver and 38 bronze&mdash;a total of 106 medals, which is 76 clear of the nearest rival, the Indonesian team, with a total of 30 medals. I wish all competitors in the fourth Arafura Games the greatest of luck and fortune and thank them for their participation.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="3303"><TITLE>Office of Government Information Technology</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to talk about a matter which is of grave interest to the people not only of the ACT but of many people and businesses involved in the area of information technology. I make these comments in light of the budget statement that confirmed what we already believed to be so in the outsourcing of Commonwealth information technology services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing I would like to say with respect to this decision is to put information technology in the context in which it belongs. When we talk about the communications structures and the way in which a government department or indeed any private business communicates with others and delivers services to others, it is central to their purpose and to their business.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3304">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the smooth running and smooth operation of communication and information technology services in any organisation, whether it be public or private sector, is a central feature of their competitiveness, of their state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art position in industry, and of whether or not they are actually leaders in their field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also becoming a major economic consideration for private businesses, as it obviously has become in the context of the public sector and hence the budget considerations. Private sector firms now make decisions on where they base themselves&mdash;based on telecommunications costs, the infrastructure, connection costs, call costs, et cetera. So we  see departments now being forced by this government to lose control of their ability to make decisions about their efficient management, their efficient running and indeed the very services that are there between themselves and the clients that they serve&mdash;the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you must question the motivation of a government that is prepared to outsource all of these services in a blanket approach when information technology and the way that these organisations and departments actually communicate are an essential tenet of their strength, their capability to compete and to provide a good, reasonable and accessible service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the government's decision to outsource information technology is thereby flawed. They have removed the ability of the government departments in the Commonwealth Public Service to control the efficiency with which they deliver services and the efficiency with which they communicate with each other within different sections of the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has made the decision to outsource them completely. In doing so, they have compromised not only the departments' ability to manage this crucial resource but they are also cancelling out a number of developments within those departments that could look at innovative ways to communicate more efficiently&mdash;not just based on the hardware but based on the application of the various software products and innovative 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thinking from the policy makers on how services can be delivered. This has introduced another layer&mdash;potentially a very convoluted and complex contractual layer&mdash;between the department and an IT services contractor in the delivery of the bread and butter services of these departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the efficiency in that? Let us have a look at the evidence. Evidence shows that the savings in this regard are not guaranteed; they are erratic. The government points only to the Department of Veterans' Affairs's IT outsourcing and claims that as a success. But when asked what else they are basing their assumptions of these savings on they say, `Well, we looked at the US model and the departments of veterans affairs are saving 20 to 30 per cent.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am paraphrasing, of course, but in questions asked in additional estimates only last week we know that the Office Of Government Information Technology, the office charged with handling this process, is not looking towards the South Australian model of outsourcing, which is a multi&hyphen;departmental&mdash;in fact a whole of government&mdash;model; they are not looking towards what is happening in other countries, according to them. They say there is a general trend but they are not prepared to even assess and gather evidence from the Australian situation in their decision making and modelling for how this process should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To go back to the Department of Veterans Affairs' model, it depends who you talk to as to how successful that is. The government holds up the bottom line savings, but if you talk to the people within that particular department, you start to get a picture of a lower level of service actually being delivered to the clients, of longer waiting periods to get issues addressed and of more inefficiencies being introduced in the department. This is by virtue of the fact that there is another layer of red tape within the bureaucracy in the delivery of these services. Where are the efficiencies in that? Indeed, where are the savings in that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Office of Government Information Technology, who are managing this whole process, were not able to point to a definitive model on which they are basing their process. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3305"> They were able to point to the US arrangement, which is central to creating a group of departments based on a specific size called clusters. They are intending to initiate some sort of competitive tendering process relating to clusters of Commonwealth departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately in this process, the Office of Government Information Technology has not embarked upon a wide scope of information gathering either with the private sector industry or even looking to other Australian examples of where outsourcing has occurred. They are taking advice from a very predictable source; that is, the private sector that has the most experience in this area. That is, of course, the larger end of the IT sector, the vast amount of which are what I term multinational companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the Office of Government Information Technology were not prepared to table the list of 21 companies that they say they have had extensive consultations with, it has become very clear to all of us on the opposition benches that the Office of Government Information Technology has set up a process which serves the purpose of these larger companies and effectively excludes the involvement of Australian information technology companies of a smaller scale, unless their involvement is introduced by a benevolent multinational.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this do for the innovative and vital sector that has so far certainly been one of the major growth sectors here in Canberra? It is certainly an industry which really does hold the key for our involvement on a global scale of the telecommunications and communications revolution. Why would you give away such an innovative industry and a role for the public sector in that process? Why would you give it away unless you had no regard for our industry development here? Why else would you give it away than if the dollar bottom line for one budget was more important than the future income stream from a growing industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other issues in relation to the outsourcing of information technology which add to the complexity of the issue and which explain why, now that the government has made this decision, they must proceed with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> extreme caution. Privacy is one of them&mdash;privacy of the data that is stored inside the blocks of computer banks, inside those central computing units within the government departments. That will go somewhere other than completely held within the confines of a department and therefore managed with the public interest at the forefront. How that is managed will be very interesting and worthy of close scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is now talking about amending the Privacy Act to pick up the private sector. Whilst that is one step that can attempt to address some of these issues, it certainly leaves far too much ambiguity for the security of that very personal information to be in the hands of the private sector. I am not talking about just who has access to this information; I am talking also about what happens when something goes wrong. And things do go wrong with information technology. Mistakes happen. Who is liable when mistakes happen and that information is held by the private sector?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of Commonwealth liability for services contracted out by the Commonwealth is yet unresolved. It has been raised by the ombudsman and there is currently an inquiry being conducted into these matters, but as yet that inquiry has not reported to government. But their timetable for resolving these issues precedes that of the outcome of that inquiry. These questions must be answered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue is where this will take us. Let us imagine for a minute that the contracts have been signed, that there are a number of clusters&mdash;perhaps four or five major contracts. We are already seeing a situation where an existing contract that has been let is being used as a base to expand to another particular department. The words we hear about a competitive tender process do not ring so true when you start to see piggyback contracting occurring. Of course it was initially based on a competitive tender but, by virtue of the fact that those contracts can be expanded to the point where they pick up whole departments, this really exposes the piggyback tender process as being one that is quite insidious to departments becoming captive to the provid ers 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3306"> of these services. Where is the competition in that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a two-year transition phase for most of the larger information technology contracts. It takes two years for them to be fully implemented. How competitive is the transition to the next contractor if the services provided by that one are unacceptable and there are too many mistakes? Is this going to happen in the blink of an eye? What sorts of pressures will the Commonwealth be under to inflict upon itself greater cost by virtue of the fact that they need to change the contractor because the service is just not up to scratch?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This points to two areas. It points to the true competitive nature of IT outsourcing and just how competitive it will be. It also points, once again, to the actual nature of the contract that the Commonwealth has or the department has with the particular service providers. Those issues are yet to be answered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Office of Government Information Technology has been charged with the role of standardising and managing this whole process. Where is the scope for individual departments to work on their own strengths and build on their own efficiencies? Where is the scope for that flexibility to be introduced to the point where perhaps what suits one department will not suit another? This goes to the point I made earlier about the outcomes in IT outsourcing elsewhere being very erratic. They are not always consistent. There is no flexibility, therefore, in what is currently proposed by the Office of Government Information Technology on this outsourcing process. That needs to be considered up front, before any contractual arrangements are entered into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This process will deny Australian industry some of the vitality and innovation that it has shown in the past. It will hand over to multinational corporations control one of our most valuable assets, which is our ability to communicate as a government, as departments, as the providers of public service to members of the general public. I do not think that is a wise move and I think the Australian public will be the  losers out of this exercise.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following on from the recent decision of the Federal Court on the status of East Timorese refugees in Australia, I believe it is crucial to place certain concerns not addressed in this decision on the public record. Since the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975, it is estimated that at least 200,000 East Timorese peoples, almost one-third of the pre-invasion population, have died in what is one of the worst attempted genocides in postwar history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not surprisingly, many East Timorese people continue to flee the Indonesian military regime and seek international protection as refugees, particularly those politically active in the struggle for the people's internationally recognised right of self-determination. Although Australia has historically granted refugee status to some East Timorese, this act of support has been persistently fractured by a contradiction. Since 1975, successive Australian governments have granted political and economic support to Indonesia's so-called absorption of East Timor, the very reason that refugee status is sought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past few years, this contradiction has been stretched to breaking point. Australia's desire to increasingly secure the good graces of the Indonesian government has spawned the government's push to demand that East Timorese be denied asylum on the grounds that many East Timorese in fact have Portuguese nationality and therefore should be denied refugee status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The political opportunism of such a position has been widely condemned, particularly given the Australian government's strenuous arguments in the International Court of Justice that Portugal's current lack of connection with East Timor meant that it had no legal authority to represent the East Timorese in international fora.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The full bench of the Federal Court recently ruled on the question of the refugee status of one East Timorese man in Jong Kim Koe v. Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, a landmark decision which has implications for the 1,300 East Timorese currently seeking refugee asylum in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3307">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The court affirmed the submission of the government that, as a matter of Portuguese law, the East Timorese applicant had acquired and retained Portuguese nationality. However, it noted that for a nationality to be operative within the context of the refugee convention it must provide effective protection from the persecuting authorities in Indonesia. Subsequently, the court has remitted the case to the Refugee Review Tribunal for this factual question of effectiveness to be determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From evidence presented to the court, it appears that it will be difficult for the tribunal to substantiate that Portugal can offer effective protection to the East Timorese currently in Australia. Most pertinently, the Portuguese embassy has stated that it will not process applications for Portuguese nationality within Australia. The Victorian Refugee Advice and Case Work Service has stated that this position means that the East Timorese will need to travel to Portugal and apply for at least two official documents, reliant on specific identification documents&mdash;a process which can take up to a year, during which time the East Timorese are forbidden to obtain employment in Portugal. The lack of certainty as to whether this onerous evidentiary regime will result in Portuguese status and the precarious financial situation of those even able to travel to Portugal suggests that such protection is less than effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the Federal Court decision has been greeted as a potential victory for the East Timorese, the court's resistance to embracing international human rights principles in the judgment has resulted in a much more limited victory than the East Timorese had hoped for and what they clearly deserve from this country. In particular, the court rejected key arguments from international refugee law experts as to the status of nationality within the fraught context of East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of nationality is not a flimsy or shallow concept within international law. It connotes a unique bond between the individual and her state of citizenship, so that the state stands in the position of trustee of the basic human rights of its citizens. Nationality is therefore a judicial and political link that unites an individual with a state.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first instance, nationality is a matter determined by the domestic law of the state in question. However, as noted by Professor James Hathaway, a leading international expert on refugee law, in order for nationality to be recognised at international law, there must be both an effective and genuine link between the state and its putative citizens so as to avoid sham nationality. There must be no international legal impediment to recognition of a grant of nationality per article 2 of the United Nations Convention on Certain Questions Relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both of these issues were generally rejected by the Federal Court. However, I would like to elaborate on them for the information of the Senate. A central aspect of the necessity of a genuine and effective link between a sovereign and its national is that the sovereign is able to grant protection to its people, both domestically and abroad. Leaving aside the question of the lack of evidence of any social or political allegiances of the peoples of East Timor to Portugal, the fact that Portugal is clearly disabled from exercising protection of the East Timorese in East Timor due to the Indonesian invasion makes it rather ridiculous to suggest that the East Timorese are Portuguese nationals to whom Portugal, through its bond of citizenship, is entitled to extend diplomatic protection when the East Timorese are abroad in East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Simple comparisons of this situation with other instances of dual nationality are therefore inappropriate. More critical, however, is the interaction with the recognition of nationality in light of the United Nations human rights regime, particularly the legal duty of all states to take action to advance `peaceful and friendly relations amongst nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and the self&hyphen;determination of people'. That is from the United Nations charter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right of self&hyphen;determination is therefore a pre&hyphen;emptive norm of international law which the International Court of Justice has stated `permits no acts derogating from it and no rules endeavouring to exist alongside it'. The right of self&hyphen;determination of East Timorese peoples has been consistently 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3308"> reaffirmed by  central United Nations bodies, by the International Court of Justice in the recent case concerning East Timor, and by Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two key human rights covenants suggest the impropriety of either a colonial power or the United Nations administering power automatically imposing its citizenship on populations which have the right to self&hyphen;determination. Therefore, unless the East Timorese choose to seek national protection from Portugal by pursuing nationality, states cannot ascribe that nationality when determining refugee status. Similarly, customary international law makes it clear that the principle of self&hyphen;determination posits a relationship between the people and a territory. Thus, an incident of the right is that the people's connection with the territory is not permanently severed. As Pene Matthew, an expert in refugee law from Melbourne University, has noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nationality must therefore be considered in relation to the links of East Timorese with the territory of East Timor, not with Portugal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Australian government, in its submission to the International Court of Justice, has affirmed this by commenting that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the right to self&hyphen;determination is not to protect, far less legally entrench, the powers and rights of a former colonial power over a former colony.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Any attempt at the coerced transfer to and absorption of the East Timorese as nationals in the territory of Portugal effectively severs the link between a people having the right of self&hyphen;determination and their territory in a way that recognition of refugee status does not. Refugee status is necessarily temporary; it is able to be rescinded when the threat of persecution to the refugee has ceased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From a different angle, a suggestion that the East Timorese people can be simply transferred to Portugal reflects the demographic manipulation which has occurred in East Timor, wherein the Indonesian government has instituted a policy of population transfer of Indonesians to East Timor as a way of establishing further foundations to deny the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> East Timorese their rights to self&hyphen;determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commenting on this phenomenon in the context of refugee policy, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has noted that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Return of displaced persons and refugees to places other than their places of origin should not be a process of ethnic relocation so as to consolidate and complement ethnic depopulation and population transfers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These arguments, based on the right of self&hyphen;determination, challenge nationality. They are separate from questions of sovereignty and, therefore, Australia's position on East Timorese as Portuguese nationals. They are consistent with Australia's recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor. The very reason for the existence of East Timorese refugees is directly entangled with their ongoing and bloody struggle for sovereign right of self&hyphen;determination in the light of an invasion which has been politically and economically supported by Australia. Their right to refugee status is enmeshed with international jurisprudence concerning self&hyphen;determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the Dili massacre in East Timor, these questions are attracting increasing international attention, culminating in the granting of the Nobel Peace Prize to two leaders of the East Timorese resistance movement. With the recent resolution in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights condemning human rights violations in East Timor, Australia's benevolent stance towards Indonesia is increasingly isolating Australia from the international community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Domestically, the distance between the government's stance on East Timor and community views of the rights of the East Timorese are reaching crisis point, with nuns organising to hide possible deportees. The local political ramifications of such action would be significant for this government's credibility in the eyes of its constituency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More generally, if we as a nation are to truly engage with human rights concerns, it is necessary to clearly name the structures which generate increasing flows of refugees within the world. Primarily, that would mean coming 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3309"> to grips with the fact that the vast majority of refugees flow from the countries in the eco nomic and political south. Unless we are to continue to engage in neo&hyphen;colonialist mentality that says such people are a little more violent, a little more backward and a little less able to politically control their territories than we are in the north, then it has to be acknowledged that the structures which create refugees are intimately linked to international economic power and political might. East Timorese refugees, coming from a territory which provided access to potentially huge oil reserves, are symptomatic of such situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a country which has profited from the exploitation of such natural resources, it is about time that Australia repaid its debt to East Timor. Granting refugee status to those East Timorese fleeing a brutal regime is one very small step in this process.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="3309"><TITLE>Green Corps</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In last year's budget, the government allocated some $42 million to a great program in recognition of a commitment it had made prior to the election. That commitment was to young Australians for the environment, otherwise known as the green corps.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought it might be appropriate, after almost a year, to give an update of the green corps projects and the great work that the young Australians have done for the environment. You might recall that the campaign commitment by the coalition was for young people to volunteer for work in the environment and, while doing that, to receive training in environmental management and sciences. The projects operate in groups of 10 young people between the ages of 17 and 20&mdash;all volunteers. The government engaged the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers to be the project manager, so that the selection of the people and projects was sort of removed from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was to be a strong emphasis on linking the green corps to quality career opportunities. The participants who volunteer are paid a training wage, ranging from about 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $150 to $250, reflecting the number of years schooling the young person has completed and the time spent since leaving school. At the end of the program, people involved in the green corps will be eligible to receive a grant of $500 to assist with further educational expenses if they wish to pursue a career in the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This exciting initiative of the coalition has become a reality and earlier this year the first 24 projects were launched right around Australia. I had the honour of being present at a couple of those launches&mdash;one in Malanda on the Atherton Tableland and one in Townsville&mdash;and it was tremendous to be able to talk to the young people involved, to get caught up in their enthusiasm, to talk with their project leaders and the partner agencies, and to generally see the sort of work that was being done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lot of community support for these projects and these groups. That was part of the rules&mdash;that was essential. All of the people involved&mdash;landcares, councils, different other partner agencies&mdash;have indicated to us what a tremendous program this is, so much superior to the LEAP program, which most of them will concede never really worked. This one, as a volunteer program, is one which really does involve committed young people and they do tremendous work in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In mid&hyphen;March, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) officially launched the program at the Tinchi Tamba wetlands on the northern outskirts of Brisbane. We have recently announced the next 40 projects for the Green Corps. Perhaps it is instructive to mention a couple of them, mainly to indicate who the partner agencies are and some of the objectives, to give senators an idea of the very broad nature of this program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For one program in New South Wales, on the Dorrigo plateau, the partner agency was Greening Australia, an environmental volunteer group that would be well known to those interested in the environment. That involved a farm forestry pilot project. In Queensland, some of the partner agencies for various of the projects include the Queensland Department of the Environment, the Noosa District 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3310"> Landcare Group, the Worldwide Fund for Nature, the Barong Landcare Association and  the Mountains to the Mangroves Advisory Committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these partner agencies assist ATCV in getting these Green Corps projects operating. They involve a great number of projects, including restoration of reserves and littoral rainforest, surveying and construction of walking tracks, riparian rehabilitation, surveying of threatened vine forest remnants, and protection and enhancement of remnant bushland. So there are a lot of good projects being done by committed young people with support and finance from the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those projects will continue. Each six months a new round of projects will be announced. We have invited input from all parliamentarians, amongst others. I invite honourable senators, if they have an idea or a suggestion on what could be looked at by ATCV, to contact ATCV with their proposals. In addition, community groups, landcare groups, conservation groups, councils&mdash;any sort of community groups&mdash;have been encouraged to think of projects and to put them forward to ATCV for consideration. It is a program we are very proud of. We think it will do great things for the participants and, of course, at the same time it is doing real work for the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought the Senate might be interested in some of the statistics on the participants in the first 24 Green Corps projects. It was interesting to see that, of those involved, 23 per cent were 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, 27 per cent were 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, 30 per cent were 18&hyphen;years&hyphen;olds and 20 per cent were 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. So we have got a fairly even spread of people right across the four age groups involved. In terms of their education level, 61 per cent had done year 12 or better, 20 per cent had done year 11, 17 per cent had completed year 10 and two per cent had not completed year 10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of gender, 43 per cent of the participants in the first round were female. That, of course, means that 57 per cent were male. Those of ethnic background were only one per cent and those of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent, four per cent. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Twelve per cent of the participants were long&hyphen;term unemployed immediately prior to commencing a Green Corps placement; seven per cent of the participants were unemployed for less than 12 months but more than six months; 30 per cent were unemployed for less than six months immediately prior to commencing the Green Corps placement; but 51 per cent of the participants identified themselves as non&hyphen;unemployed immediately prior to the commencement of the Green Corps placement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This perhaps emphasises that this is a program of young Australians committed and volunteering for the environment. It is not a make&hyphen;work scheme, as some of our opponents have, regrettably, not understood. It is a genuine commitment to the environment and it involves some training in those fields. As I say, 51 per cent of the participants identified themselves as non&hyphen;unemployed immediately prior to commencing work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that people volunteer does show that they have a commitment. They are not forced into this job or program. For that reason, it means that they have their hearts in it. They are doing it because they want to and because they have a real commitment to the environment. This is one of this government's most exciting initiatives. It represents the fulfilment of yet another election promise. It shows that, whilst the previous government talked a lot about the environment and made a lot out of votes from the environment sector, they really did nothing. This government has converted their rhetoric into actual action on the ground. It again shows this government's green and environmental credentials. We do not go out talking about it, as the previous government did. We do not rail endlessly about it, as the Greens in this chamber do, and vote against any sensible project the government has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remain disappointed that the Greens, the Democrats and the Labor Party opposed to the bitter end the means whereby this government could implement the Natural Heritage Trust, in respect of which we are pouring over a billion dollars into the environment. I sometimes wonder how the Greens can keep talking and talking about the environment and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3311"> what needs to be done but, when the crunch comes, they vote against it. You only have to  see what is happening in the chamber at the present time to know that the Greens are all about grandstanding and have little real interest in the environment and what happens to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought all honourable senators might be interested in that brief update on the Green Corps project. I again invite all honourable senators to contact the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers if they have some suggestions to make as to the projects that the Green Corps might look at. It is a tremendous program that is great for young people and very beneficial to our environment.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="3311"><TITLE>Higher Education: University Staff</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise a very serious issue that goes to the interference in the legitimate freedoms of universities to select staff and to conduct their affairs without being dragooned by governments to support the prevailing political dogma of the day. I speak specifically of the case where the Victorian minister for education and training, Dr Phil Honeywood, made comments regarding Melbourne University's decision to employ Professor Arief Budiman as the university's foundation chair of Indonesian studies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the host of political atrocities and the political jackbooting of Liberal leaders throughout this country, perhaps we should not be surprised to hear that some people regard this as a relatively minor issue. I am sure some would argue that if we were to look at it in the context of the string of abuses that are being undertaken by conservative governments across this country&mdash;the string of abuses to basic political freedoms long held to be important by Australians&mdash;the actions that the minister in Victoria has undertaken might be perceived to be unimportant. It is not a view I share. In my view, these actions go to the very basis of the ethos of accountability, the very important principles of academic freedom, and the important role that universities play in our nation's history and in the development of our political culture.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do acknowledge that Dr Honeywood's blunt attempts at intimidation may be minor when compared with other actions undertaken by the Kennett Government. Look at, for instance, the blatant political paybacks that have been directed at the Auditor&hyphen;General in that state, paybacks which effectively strip important responsibilities and tasks away from the Auditor&hyphen;General and his capacity to hold that government accountable in terms of its financial probity and capacity to undertake its affairs in an honest manner. It might then seem, in that context, that Dr Honeywood's statements are minor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And, of course, when you do you look at the Auditor&hyphen;General's exposure of the criminal handling of the Intergraph ambulance service contract by this government in Victoria, perhaps, there is a point. But it was, nonetheless, important to understand that what Dr Honeywood has been arguing is a very dangerous escalation of attempts to intimidate universities, and to attempt to undermine basic human rights and freedoms in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It comes at a time when this federal government is imposing, through the budget that was announced last night and through last year's budget, a range of measures which are seeking to undermine the quality and the breadth of services provided through our educational institutions. This is a strategy which is essentially aimed at reinforcing disproportionate power and privilege to particular sectors in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may well be that some would say, `Hang on a minute. You've got a government in Queensland, such as that of the Borbidge government, which is attempting to use fairly unsophisticated and very crude mechanisms to undermine Aboriginal rights in terms of their legitimate claims, as the High Court has found in terms of their native title entitlements.' And you see cases with other state governments, where similar patterns are emerging. But I still say that, given all of these matters, it is important to draw public attention to attempts being made by Dr Honeywood to undermine academic freedom in this country, which is, in itself, an important principle.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3312">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is it that Dr Honeywood has done? I am sure that not all members of the Senate  would be aware that Dr Honeywood has made the claim that Melbourne University was being used as a safe haven for the critics of the Suharto regime, and he has called upon the federal government to investigate Dr Honeywood's appointment. This is a ludicrous claim. As a former student of Melbourne University, I can assure senators that it is not a centre of real radical study. In fact, it is a bastion of conservatism. It is an institution that in many respects actually reinforces the power structures of our society. It does not really undermine the foundations of society as we know it but allows, nonetheless, for a quality education in many respects and a range of views to be expressed. But to suggest that it was a safe haven for critics of the Suharto regime seems to me to be a ludicrous proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not coincidental that Dr Honeywood made his public criticisms of the appointment while he was leading a Victorian education delegation to Jakarta. Clearly, his motives were designed to try to placate what he perceived to be criticisms within the Indonesian regime. I wonder just how sensitive the Indonesian education administrators are and whether his criticisms reflect the opinions of the Indonesian government, or whether Dr Honeywood is undertaking actions that he believes will ingratiate him with our neighbour, Indonesia. I do not know the answer to that, but I do not think that it can be presumed that he is acting in a manner that was suggested by the Indonesian government. I have no doubt that Dr Honeywood may well have taken it upon himself to act in this most extraordinary, intolerant and offensive manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Budiman is not only a leading Indonesian dissident&mdash;which of course is the basis for the claims against him by Dr Honeywood&mdash;but he is also a very important scholar in that country. He is highly regarded internationally as an outstanding scholar. He is a sociologist who resigned some two years ago from the Satya Wacana Christian University, after criticising the Indonesian govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment, after advocating greater democracy for the Indonesian regime and after advocating greater democracy for Indonesians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was appointed to the position of Foundation Chair of Indonesian Studies, not for his outspoken criticism of the Indonesian government but because he was the best candidate for the job. This was a view publicly confirmed both by Professor Tony Stephens, the head of the Melbourne University School of Languages, which oversees the Indonesian section, and by the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of Melbourne University, Professor Alan Gilbert.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Gilbert has stated that `Professor Budiman is an outstanding scholar with an international reputation who was, on purely academic or scholarly grounds, the best candidate for the job.' Professor Gilbert has described Dr Honeywood's claims of a `safe haven'&mdash;that is, that Melbourne University is a safe haven for dissidents&mdash;as `preposterous.' Of course, Professor Gilbert is only too correct in that regard. Professor Gilbert also stated that Dr Honeywood's reported remarks were `contrary to the deepest most universally respected principles of institutional autonomy and of academic freedom.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In defending Professor Budiman, Professor Gilbert said: The only politicians who have voiced such views in modern times are African dictators or members of totalitarian regimes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Professor Gilbert's outrage is, of course, well understood. He is to be congratulated for standing up to the thuggish tactics of the Victorian government. It is a real pity that the Commonwealth minister for education, Senator Vanstone, did not have the same courage. Perhaps it is because she fears upsetting the Prime Minister in this regard or perhaps it is because she fears upsetting those in the Victorian government. It is nonetheless wrong that she has not undertaken the defence of academic freedom in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would very much appreciate hearing what the Prime Minister has to say on this matter. I believe that Dr Honeywood's statements are quite clearly inappropriate and totally out of keeping with the political traditions of this country. Dr Honeywood has said that if this course was receiving federal government

What an extraordinary proposition&mdash;that a state minister for education, in any capacity, should  be saying that there should be a political censorship on the use of Commonwealth money for academic programs in this country. It is extraordinary for a minister in any government to be making that sort of an assertion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only presume, since there has been no response from the Commonwealth government on these matters, that there is in fact a level of support for the attitude that is being expressed by Dr Honeywood.

I enjoy meeting her every time we go to functions and appear together. I get on with her very well. I perfectly understand that Angela has her own political agenda, and that it is one which is not necessarily sympathetic to the coalition. It might be sympathetic to your side of politics, Senator Woodley, or to Senator Conroy's side of politics, but it is not sympathetic to ours. I think you would accept that, Stephen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we had in the press release that was cited by Senator Woodley was in fact a long traverse of things on which Ms Chan alleged the coalition was doing to give succour to Ms Hanson. In fact, many of these decisions were not included in this budget. Many of these 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decisions had been announced and already implemented in the previous budget and were not influenced in any way by anything in which the member for Oxley has been involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that the coalition is as concerned as anybody else is about some of the absurd statements that we have been receiving of late. Our concern is not because of my particular ethnic background or that of anyone else in this parliament. Good political decision making is predicated on access to the facts. Access to the facts is something with which we are hoping to assist the member for Oxley. At the moment, it does not seem that the offer of assistance has been taken up with the same fulsome good intent with which it was made. That is the concern that we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to that, Senator Woodley is off the mark, just as he is off the mark in relation to the comments that he has made about the electoral process at the next election. Senator Woodley, we are two years away from the next election. Given the track record of the Democrats since the election, I would not be wanting&mdash;if I were you&mdash;to hasten the next election. You people on the other side have a long way to go before you would want to hasten the next federal election. I say that as somebody who has a very high personal regard for you, Senator; I enjoy having you around. But, on your current track record, there is not much reason that you should want to hasten the next election. Quite frankly, the electoral performance of the Democrats has been patchy, to say the least. The last time the electoral performance of the Democrats was as patchy as this, you changed your leader.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have to seriously ask, `What do the Democrats stand for'? I know that Senator Woodley has been busy trying to portray himself as a friend of the bush. The facts are that all of the Democrat policies are anti&hyphen;bush, anti&hyphen;farmer and anti anybody who lives outside the capital cities. You do not have to go to the detail of the Democrat policies. Senator Kemp, I have taken your lead and have gone into them of late and I have found some of the Democrat policies to be particularly interesting.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3316">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know what the Democrats have done. In fact, I found a speech by Senator Woodley in which he said in the Senate that the Democrats strongly supported increasing fuel taxation. Of course, strongly supporting increased fuel taxation&mdash;as honourable senators on this side of the chamber would know&mdash;means only one thing: higher prices for everything that people buy in the bush. So people in the bush who read Senator Woodley's letters&mdash;and writing letters to the newspapers is now the only way in which Senator Woodley gets a run, because nobody takes his press releases seriously to heart&mdash;would have to take them all with a very large bag of salt.</PARA>

I am suggesting that you might want to revise some of your policies, Senator Woodley, so that you may have a chance of being returned at the next election. At the moment, I would not want to encourage an early election, if I were you. That is all I will say on the matter, Madam President. I know that the time is hastening on to 2 o'clock, when there are other diversions in this chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I really should get out the hearts and violins after listening to that sad little exercise. The answer to the first part of your question, Senator Faulkner, is yes, the Prime Minister has drawn my attention to the letters from the church leaders. In fact, I have had ongoing and continuing contact with those selfsame church leaders who believe that the government's direction on reform is to be encouraged, supported and to be moved along as soon as we possibly can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you would be aware from your contact with the minister for housing in New South Wales, he comes out and attacks this government on the public record when it suits him while at the same time he is saying privately that he is in favour of reform to public housing and that a cut of the order of $50 million, together with certainty for the remaining years of this interim housing agreement, will be pretty okay by him. That is the view obviously expressed by the Victorian government: the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3317"> minister for housing there has today put out a press release endorsing just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I think that you are a bit misguided, Senator. We are all in favour of housing reform. The $50 million that you are talking about is coming out of a budget of about a billion dollars, and it is well within the ability of the states to find those efficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw to your attention, Madam President, that the overheads, you might say, for public housing in New South Wales are something of the order of 31 per cent. That includes some debt reduction; it includes, very seriously, the administration costs, and it is something which I think Mr Knowles for one might be concentrating on doing something about. In other words, an awful lot of the money that goes to New South Wales is not providing housing and could be providing housing if Mr Knowles was as committed in practice to producing public housing and to reforming low income housing for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am committed to improving housing outcomes for Australians. The church leaders that you mentioned are also wanting to move in the same direction. I believe in fact that so are the housing ministers. But I would make it clear to you that the $50 million was the amount of the special purpose payments that were negotiated at the Premiers Conference. They are not a new sum. They are old news. The states found that a better alternative than other savings that could be made by them, and in a $1 billion budget it is pretty small beer. It is not going to, in fact, reduce the number of houses built for low income Australians. There are opportunities for Mr Knowles and the other housing ministers to do better than they are currently doing with the money they are currently getting from the Commonwealth.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Lining the pockets of unionists, as Senator Alston helpfully contributes. It is amazing that at this stage now, after we have had a government in place for a year that is trying to undo the harm of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> past, we get these nit-picking questions about what provision we are making for child care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few days ago we had the shadow minister responsible, Mrs Macklin, going around Tasmania saying that we had targeted 12 child&hyphen;care centres for closure&mdash;and what did it turn out to be? First of all, there were none targeted for closure at all. Secondly, two had closed in the last couple of years: one during the Keating government, and one during our government when a new child-care centre opened up and took the children from them. If that was not an indication of the lack of planning and foresight we inherited about the provision of child-care places where they are needed, I would be very surprised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have done in this budget is a continuation of finding savings where they properly can be found. For instance, we had the taxpayer subsidising child care for non-work related purposes for over 20 hours a week. It is very important for families that parents at home have the respite opportunity that that child care offers. But it does not necessarily mean that it has to be 20&hyphen;odd hours a week. You were hypocritical enough to try 12 hours a week when you were in government, and you thought that was good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that there is a purpose in respite care for parents at home. But 20 hours a week, or about five four&hyphen;hour sessions, is perfectly okay&mdash;except where the family is in crisis and emergency situations, and then that can be extended. We have put money into playgroups, which for many families at home is a very important option. There has been a substantial increase in funding there: an increase of 60 per cent on the current funding&mdash;$1 million over three years. That is badly needed for those at home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But on the one hand we have the Labor opposition saying that we are trying to send everybody home, and on the other hand we have them now obviously thinking that we are harming those at home. The point is that we need a child&hyphen;care system that is affordable; that is well planned; that provides for the needs, as I have said, of the child with special needs, with disabilities or who is in rural areas, et cetera. I know you do not like to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3320"> hear that, but this is a rational planning of child care to meet the needs of Australian families. I think it is something that Australians will endorse&mdash;and all your nit-picking, Senator, will come to nothing.</PARA></ANSWER>

I do appreciate the benefit that can be obtained from an additional $1 million for playgroups, and I am sure that those playgroups are very much appreciated. But my question was how you explain the cut of 27,000 places in private centres around Australia and, more particularly, a total cut of $840 million over two budgets?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is obvious that the senator is a little deaf. She obviously does not understand what some of these reforms that we are putting into place will mean. The change to non-work related child care is estimated, for example, to free up about another 6,000 places for long&hyphen;day care. In addition, the government is providing for another 7,000 child-care places for this current year. So there are an extra 13,000 places for child care for this coming year, on top of the 31,000 extra child-care places that we provided in this financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator VANSTONE</EMPHASIS> &mdash;I thank Senator Eggleston for the question. The answer is very simple. Firstly, the budget reduces the deficit, taking the pressure off interest rates. The people on the other side never understood the value of doing that, but it does encourage small business to create jobs. I quote Masters Builders Australia, who have indicated that the budget reduction strategy, which we have followed:  . . . will</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">remove upward pressure on the deficit, on interest rates, benefiting businesses, including housing and construction, and further stimulating economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the key to getting more jobs. Secondly, there is the savings initiative, reducing our reliance on foreign debt which will in turn lay the basis for steady economic growth. Thirdly, there are the federation and heritage funds totalling $2 billion. The focus is on employment creation as we celebrate 100 years of federation. These three things together are the centrepiece of a budget that will generate more real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that there is not money in there to splash around for fake training programs that people participate in for six months and then find at the end of the six months that there is not a real job there for them. This is the budget of a government that is prepared to make the tough decisions and prepared to get the economic settings right so that the flow through of real jobs will come from the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are going to be spending about $1.6 billion this year on labour market assistance. We are spending about $17 million on work for the dole in 1997-98. We have a package for small business. We are reforming the way employment services are delivered. We have reformed the industrial relations system. The Prime Minister announced yesterday a $10 million package to assist the Hunter region in the wake of the BHP decision. We also have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3321"> about $41.6 million over three years for the green corps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted that early on in the answer senators opposite sought to criticise these decisions. But with a record like theirs they have no place and no credibility to be offering any comment at all. They should stand back and applaud a government that has had the guts and determination to take all of the hard decisions that they simply refused to make and that they meekly walked away from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the party opposite under Keating that drove us head on into the recession we allegedly had to have. That recession was a disaster. It was a hit and run with no apologies. Labor has never apologised for doing what it did in terms of unemployment in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see that the opposition is having a desperate time today trying to do something about a budget which Australians recognise was fair, appropriate and needed. It is a vitally important matter for the truth to be told to Australians. Through the years of your government we had all sorts of devices which kept the truth from Australians. I remember some years ago when I was the spokesman on health that former Senator Richardson had to be dragged kicking and screaming to do something to implement Labor policy on generic drugs. I know that his party was very unwilling to do the right thing but eventually he did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this budget the government has moved to take more action in the area of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme because it has been growing at a rate of knots and it is complete unsustainable for the taxpayer to manage. I think that a lot of safeguards have been put into the proposals which the minister has announced. Pensioners, unemployed people and low income earners are particularly advantaged in respect of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme subsidies through much lower co-payments and safety net thresholds. In fact, about 80 per cent of government outlays on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is for concessional payments. So anybody listening to the broadcast of this parliament should be aware that, despite the puny efforts of the opposition to try to bring the budget measures into fear and loathing among voters, they will not success because the facts belie their claims.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3322">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three measures which the federal government has decided upon to ensure the ongoing value of money for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and to support quality cost effective prescribing of medicines. They are the introduction of the therapeutic group premiums for a limited number of groups, the establishment of a national prescriber service and the deletion of some less important medicines from the  pharmaceutical benefits scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to ensure that the people who use the system, both patients and doctors, take cost into account when they are reaching treatment decisions. That is a cost decision between the doctor and the patient. We are not, in fact, moving to take action which will harm patients. The doctor with the patient will decide which drug will be used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of therapeutic group price premiums maintains the rights of patients to freedom of choice, and it properly limits the taxpayers' liability to subsidise the choice only to the level of the lowest priced drug within the group. That is what currently happens when patients chose a proprietary brand medicine rather than its generic equivalent. Most patients are going to use the cheapest drug in the therapeutic group, and therapeutic group premiums are expected to settle around the $2 mark rather than the highly exaggerated figures being bandied about in the media. For example, the average brand premium is about $1.70.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will be seeking expert advice on situations where some individuals must stay on a more expensive alternative, and will consider exceptions in their cases so they do not have to pay more. However, such cases are expected to be very uncommon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Together with the new national prescriber service for doctors, the government anticipates that this policy will lead to a greater emphasis on more rational and cost conscious prescribing. The corollary is that this should in turn lead to reduced costs to taxpayers and a reduction in the pressures to introduce more radical cost control measures. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SENATOR ALLISON&mdash;My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Family Services. Minister, the Council of Intellectual Disability told a New South Wales parliamentary committee yesterday that almost 1,000 young disabled people in New South Wales are forced to live in nursing homes with elderly residents. Minister, do you consider nursing homes to be appropriate permanent accommodation for young people with disabilities and mental illness? Minister, how many young disabled people are there throughout Australia in such accommodation? Why does the Aged Care Bill not mention people with disabilities or how they will be affected by the nursing home entry fees?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Newman&mdash;I do not believe personally that they are ideal places for people with severe disabilities, if they are young, to spend years in. However, that has been a point of last shelter, you might say, for many years for people for whom there was no other appropriate accommodation. That means that under the previous government that was the situation too.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know that Mrs Moylan has been having a lot of discussion in recent times with the states to see what we can do better for people in Australia with disabilities. I know that this government has been across portfolios focusing very much on improving the lot of people with disabilities and their carers. Beyond that, obviously, at this stage of the day, I am not able to say any more.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SENATOR ALLISON&mdash;I thank the minister for her response. However, we would like to know what the government is prepared to do, particularly in the case where we end up with a two tier system in nursing homes, as many people believe we will with your so&hyphen;called reform? What sort of accommodation and services can we expect for the young people? </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Newman&mdash;I am happy to take that on notice to the minister responsible, Madam President.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Answer 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3331"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accommodation for younger people with a disability is the responsibility of the States under the Commonwealth State Disability Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nursing homes principally provide care for the frail aged. Younger people with a disability are only placed in aged persons nursing homes if suitable accommodation is unavailable and as a last resort. There were 882 younger people, aged less than 50 years of age, and 21 people under 20 years of age in aged persons nursing homes, nationally as at 31 December 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, I (Moylan) agree that this is not a desirable situation and believe that younger people with a disability should be in a setting which is more appropriate to their age and care needs. However, there may be a variety of reasons why, as a last resort, younger people with a disability seek entry to a nursing home. For example, it can sometimes be the only viable arrangement to enable a person to remain close to their family, particularly in a rural area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, the residential aged care system should retain the flexibility to respond to these situations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Younger people with a disability will remain eligible for entry to aged care facilities under the new arrangements where entry is the most appropriate response to their care needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Younger people with a disability currently pay 87.5 per cent of their pension in fees with the Commonwealth paying an additional amount to meet any shortfall. A parallel arrangement will be maintained under the hardship provisions of the new funding arrangements to ensure that younger people are not disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As most younger people with a disability will have only limited assets in their own right it is expected that they will qualify as concessional residents and not be required to pay an accommodation bond. As concessional residents, they will have access to a proportion of places reserved for concessional residents with providers paid a higher subsidy on their behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is expected that a large number of those who do not meet the concessional resident requirements will be in receipt of a compensation payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Younger people with a disability will have the same standard of accommodation and care services as other residents. This will be ensured through the new quality assurance arrangements which will apply to all facilities irrespective of the resident profile.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of new arrangements in residential aged care will not mean any fundamental change in access for younger people with a disability or reduction in the quality of their care.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday in question time I made some references to Senator Stott Despoja's comments about enrolments in universities. The senator took exception to those comments and took the opportunity to make some remarks after question time and, as I understand it, later last night on the adjournment. I understand the senator concluded her remarks by saying that she looked forward to me coming in and apologising for misleading the parliament and the public because it was a broadcast day. Saving the point that the senator does not realise that, whether it was a broadcast day or not, question time is, in the end, broadcast, I nonetheless have no intention of apologising for misleading the Senate, because I did not do so.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The senator feels hard done by through my use yesterday of her press release of 7 February, and she apparently takes it very hard when she is reminded that she has got it wrong. Let me clarify what the senator did say in her press release of 7 February. She said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today's figures from NSW highlighted further reductions in enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, Senator, before you jump up and down in your seat, you are simply wrong. You made the call too early. You did not wait for the  facts to emerge. You simply jumped in and assumed you knew the story. It is not appropriate for you to come in here and claim that I have got it wrong, because it has been pointed out that you jumped the gun.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3332">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, you did not say `potential enrolments' or `likely enrolments' or qualify your statement by saying `enrolments may or should be down'. You, in fact, said they were down. It could not be any clearer. Senator Stott Despoja went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Total university offers in NSW and ACT have fallen by about 2 500. This means enrolments are down in NSW, Victoria, WA and SA.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What the figures actually show on a state by state basis&mdash;and I am advised that South Australia has increased, but I will check that because it does surprise me nonetheless&mdash;is that the largest increases in enrolments occurred in New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland, with enrolments maintained at last year's level in Victoria, whereas Senator Stott Despoja was claiming that enrolments were, in fact, down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The misrepresentation is simply this. Senator Stott Despoja can say as she wants in February, March or April but, if she wants to say that actual enrolments are down when figures for enrolments are not available, she is destined to make a mistake. That mistake is going to be pointed out. Obviously I do not mind pointing out the mistake, but the problem is that the senator simply does not like being pointed out. What I take offence at is that she comes in and says that I have misled. These are the things that the senator chose to say. I have gone back to quotes from her press release. She was simply wrong. Then she comes in here yesterday and says that I was, in fact, wrong. She apparently indicates now that she was talking about enrolment applications, not enrolments. Perhaps she could explain why in her release she consistently used the word `enrolments', not `applications'. It is as clear as a bell. She did refer to applications in that press release once, just as she referred to offers. She made the clear inference to enrolments on the basis of evidence in relation to applications and offers.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, to a question without notice asked by Senator Ferguson today, relating to budget matters.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The alleged centrepiece of the budget that was handed down last night was the document relating to savings. If it had been an appropriate form of savings, it should have been the centrepiece of the budget, and I will refer to that perhaps in some detail a little later. But what was obviously missing as the centrepiece of the budget last night were initiatives designed to tackle unemployment, which is the most pressing economic and social condition that faces this country today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since this government was elected, even though it continues to assert and claim that Labor had a poor record with respect to unemployment, unemployment has been steadily increasing and it is now close to 8.75 per cent nationally. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is much more serious in a range of regional centres around Australia. None is worse than my own home state of Tasmania where unemployment is hovering 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> around 11 per cent and would be much higher if it was not for the significant number of people leaving the state because they cannot get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the budget speech that Senator Hill so proudly acclaimed in question time today, what is significant, as I have said, is the notable absence of any positive approach with respect to unemployment. Prior to the budget being announced, Mr Costello, the Treasurer, and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) were trumpeting what would be centrepieces to encourage growth development and employment in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this rural and regional Australian section on pages 6 and 7, two initiatives are announced that are supposed to help improve employment prospects. One is a comprehensive rural policy package of $200 million over four years, but there is no additional money; it is to replace the apparently ineffective rural adjustment scheme. I think it will be news to the National Party how ineffective the rural adjustment scheme is in this country. But I think perhaps this has been dropped in as the sort of `save Tim Fischer's leadership' plan. It looks like it has just been lobbed in at the last minute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was some noticeable reference to quarantine. Indeed, as I have noted, quarantine is mentioned five times; unemployment gets three mentions in the budget. I think quarantine is very important but it is a sign of the priorities of this government that unemployment rates less of a focus and less of a mention than quarantine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony of the quarantine initiative announced in this part of the budget&mdash;$76 million over four years; the Prime Minister said $75 million and Mr Costello says $78 million but it does say $76 million in this budget paper&mdash;to encourage rural and regional employment in Australia is that half the money is going to fund the redundancy payouts to the 700 meat inspectors that are to be made redundant over the next four years. And this is the real centrepiece for creating employment in the budget. I particularly wanted to draw this aspect to the Senate's attention. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3335">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a few brief comments&mdash;and I am sure we will have opportunity to debate on this matter later on&mdash;with respect to savings choice and incentive. I think there are two fundamental problems with the approach announced by the Treasurer last night. Firstly, he has not delivered on his promise, the Liberal and National parties' promise&mdash;and indeed, it was not just a commitment they made; it was actually put in the forward estimates&mdash;on funding for the so&hyphen;called co&hyphen;government three per cent contribution. It was in the forward estimates. And what did we get last night? We got less than half that money devoted to a savings vehicle in the form of a rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the critical problems is that that three per cent and the matching co&hyphen;contribution delivered into all working Australian savings accounts would have led to a significant increase in their retirement saving and their retirement income. But by delivering it in the way it has been done, only half the money is committed to this package. Goodness knows where the rest of the money has been allocated to; perhaps this federal initiative holds part of the answer. It is very regrettable because that will mean less retirement income. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to take note of the answer Senator Hill gave in terms of the general thrust of the budget. I am particularly impressed by the way the budget provides help and assistance to regional Australia. In particular, I am very excited about the impact of the federal fund and what that could mean for infrastructure in regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the north&hyphen;west of Western Australia, for example, it could mean that the Tanami Desert Road, which connects Alice Springs to the Kimberley, could be sealed as a result of the funding provided under the federal plan. The Tanami Desert Road, which has been there for many years, is becoming a major highway, even though it is not sealed, and is used by a high number of trucks carrying produce from the horticultural areas of the Kimberley and cattle from the Kimberley to the south&hyphen;eastern Australian markets.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this kind of project which will be funded by the $1 billion federal fund announced in this budget. I am sure that people in the three northern regional development commissions in Western Australia and local government in the north of Western Australia will be beginning even today to prepare lists of infrastructure projects which this federal fund will provide finance for.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L6">Senator EGGLESTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As it happens, they are all Labor seats in the Kimberley and Pilbara, and it shows what a generous approach we have to regional development in Australia that, unlike Kelly and the whiteboard, we will provide funds in areas where they are really needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other great initiatives in the budget is the $17.4 million boost to rural health services, which will improve health services and specialist medical training in rural areas and increase specialist services in rural areas. That will be a great boost to the health standards in country Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, there is $5 million for a pilot study to develop obstetric services in country areas of Australia, so that women who are having babies do not need to go to regional centres and to capital cities but can have their babies in the country as they used to and where most of them would still prefer to to this day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the states and territories are going to be provided with $14 million over four years to buy the hepatitis B vaccine as part of a program to ensure that greater numbers of people in country Australia are vaccinated against hepatitis B. I think that is a very important initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other initiative that I would like to refer to is that there will be a $5.2 million boost to regional tourist development. Tourism is very important in many areas of regional Australia, and it is particularly important because it creates jobs and more particularly important to Aboriginal communities in providing jobs. Of course, if we can have Aborigines working in enterprises, it means that they will be generating their own income and will be less dependent on welfare. Once 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3336"> that happens, many of the problems which the Aboriginal community faces in Australia will end as a matter of natural course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, of course, many other initiatives in the budget which are boosting regional Australia. The allocation of $1.6 billion to roads will create some 19,000 jobs around the country, and I am told that of these funds 90 per cent of the money spent on national highway programs will be spent in regional Australia. One of the other great centrepieces of the budget is the natural heritage trust fund which is the largest investment the Australian government has ever made in conservation and natural resource management. This will, of course, as these programs are developed, boost employment in regional Australia also. The regional telecommunications infrastructure fund will provide $250 million to raise regional communications standards, and that will provide a real boost to business and, more importantly, employment in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the introduction of the dedicated $20 million assistance program to depressed regions will mean that regions that are experiencing adjustment pressures, high levels of unemployment and/or are disadvantaged by their remoteness will benefit under that program. So, Madam Deputy President, one can see that this budget is very good for regional Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the same matter. Senator Hill indicated that he thought this budget was good news. For all those persons who are actually unemployed at the moment, the last thing you would say is that this is a good news budget. You are not even predicting growth rates sufficient to bring down the level of unemployment. For young people, there is no good news in this budget as far as unemployment is concerned. For middle&hyphen;aged people who are actually trying to get a job, there is no good news in this budget in terms of trying to improve the employment situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here today is the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) reciting similar words to those uttered by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) who, on 2 May, said that this budget would be good news for the education sector and that there would be no bad news. The proposition that I put is that there is, in fact, lots of bad news in this budget&mdash;lots of bad news for the universities, lots of bad news for the TAFE sector and lots of bad news for public education in our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of this budget we have seen measures being taken by this government to reduce Commonwealth funding towards the higher education Commonwealth&hyphen;industry places scheme. Some 4,700 university places that have traditionally been funded will have funding taken away. What you will see is a very savage impact on regional universities in particular. I ask senators opposite who cry and bleat about their concern for regions in the country: what are you doing about the regional universities? What are you doing to defend public education in the regions and towns of this country? What are you doing to ensure that people in this society actually get a fair go when they in fact live in the country? What are you doing to protect young people in the regions of this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a similar pattern in vocational education with a further $72 million cut to the TAFE sector in particular. This is, of course, on top of the $183 million cutback announced last year for the TAFE sector. There are further cuts to the universities. A further one per cent cut has been announced in this budget for the year 2000. There is more bad news for education. There are further cuts to language training in this country with the phasing out of moneys to Language Australia&mdash;more bad news for people who are trying to learn a multitude of languages to further Australia's place within the region. There are further cuts right across the board in this budget. It is bad news for education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today the minister expressed concerns about how complicated the youth allowance is. There are no announcements in this budget with regard to the youth allowance, and this is despite the fact we were told in the last budget that there would be a major announcement and that, operating from 1 January 1998, there would be a new reform package in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3337"> regard to the youth allowance&mdash;changes to income support payments which will affect some 630,000 young Australians. But we have seen nothing from this government. We were told by the minister on 20 August 1996 that there would be an announcement early in 1997 in terms of the fine detail of the youth allowance. But there is not a word of that in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is that so important? It is important because there is a great deal of concern in our community about the proposals by this government to introduce a new package of measures which may in fact see substantial cuts to assistance for young people. Substantial cuts will put at risk measures undertaken by this government to help young people who are currently on the youth training allowance or the jobsearch allowance and who currently enjoy support from Austudy or from Abstudy. In this budget we see an eight per cent cut in Abstudy. So there is a great deal of uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a measure the government said&mdash;and hailed with great glory&mdash;that it was going to introduce to reflect the changing labour market, to provide flexibility and to provide simplification. Of course, we understand what this government means by simplification, flexibility and by taking into account changes in the labour market: it means more unemployment and less support for people who need it the most. This is a budget that actually gives to the wealthy and reinforces the tendency of this government to take away from the people who are most in need of support from the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a budget that is full of bad news, particularly in education; it is full of bad news for the young people of this country and it is full of bad news for the economy. It is full of bad news because it takes away opportunities for people to go to university, for people to go into the TAFE sector and for people to enjoy the benefits of a full education. It takes away real choice for people in this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

You will really be looking forward to the week up, as we will be so we can go out and sell this budget, because it is a good news budget. The budget has been well received. It has to be conceded, even in your most private thoughts, that this budget has been well received.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is because the government has maintained the discipline that it brought in in its first budget. It has maintained the strategy of reaching a balanced budget within three years before 1999. We have produced efficient management for the first time in 13 years in Canberra, and we are on track to bring in a balanced budget. The first budget laid the groundwork. The second budget has built upon that so we are on track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry, glibly in passing, has been the only person to mention regional Australia, but what he and the opposition should understand is that what has seared the souls of regional Australia and the farming industry more than anything else over the past 13 years was the high interest rate regime during the eighties and nineties. That did the worst damage possible to the rural and regional areas of Australia. So our two budgets thus far have produced a discipline in government which puts a downward pressure&mdash;that is the strategy&mdash;on interest rates, and we are already seeing that effect cascading through the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is our first priority&mdash;to reduce debt&mdash;and that is exactly what we have done. In this budget, $5 billion comes off the government debt and, by 1999, when we will balance our budget, the government debt will be halved&mdash;halved in three years. You kept jacking it up because of your lack of discipline in expenditure. You kept jacking it up and letting others 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3338"> pay for your wasted expenditure through high interest rates. Others had to pay and suffer because of that and, more than anything, rural and regional Australia suffered through the regime of the eighties and nineties. What was most striking during question time was that there was not one question on rural and regional Australia and, as I said, it was only glibly mentioned in passing during the five minutes that Senator Sherry graced this chamber with his presence.</PARA>

In it there are two key&mdash;to use the latest coinphrase&mdash;centrepieces of the budget that particularly deliver to the much needed and long neglected infrastructure of rural and regional Australia. That of course is the Federation Fund. One billion dollars has been put into the Federation Fund and, as the Treasurer said last night, there will be a reasonable and geographic spread of projects around Australia.

People caring for children under 16 years of age with profound disability are big winners out of this budget. But did Senator Carr mention that? No, he was not game enough to mention those sorts of things, because the Labor Party let those people go for years, 13 years, with little or no assistance.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Petition of the undersigned shows that only one group have been excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) where such group has performed honourable overseas `active service'. That group being members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 which were excluded under `Operational Service' at Section 6. (1)(e)(ii) of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various claims made in Statements to the House and the Senate and the contents of correspondence from various Ministers to maintain the exclusion are answered as follows, the answers are from documents obtained under FIO and from public record:

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) `They were never allotted for operational service', (contained in a letter from the Hon. Con Sciacca Minister for Defence Science and Personnel 1995). A letter from the Secretary Department of the Navy to Treasury dated 11 November 1955 stated `the date that the Navy were allotted for operational  service was 1 July 1955'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) `Members of the RAN were only doing the duty for which they had enlisted', (October 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). This applies to all Service personnel everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) `They were in no danger', (November 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). They shared the same danger as all other Australian Service personnel serving in Malaya at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) `They were not on Special Overseas Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop Minister for Defence Industry Science and Personnel to Mrs Williams of Adelaide dated October 1996). Requirement for Special Overseas Service was introduced in 1962 without retrospective conditions, therefore has no relevance to events of 1960.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Commonwealth of Australian Gazette of 5 June 1952 included a declaration concerning `persons subject to military law'. The Gazette notice referred only to Army personnel and the purpose of the declaration was that Army's disciplinary code at the time, the Australian Military Regulations and Orders did not have extraterritorial application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">When outside Australia, Army personnel were subject to the Imperial Army Act. This Act had certain provisions that only applied when persons subject to the Act were on active service. Section 4 of the Defence Act 1903 defined `active service' for the purposes of the Army Act. Service with the Far East Strategic Reserve fell within the scope of `active service' for the purposes of discipline only in relation to those persons subject to `military law'. Naval personnel were not subject to `military law' in the sense used, but were subject to the Naval Discipline Act.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Act, unlike the Australian Military Regulations and Orders, had extraterritorial jurisdiction, and was not reliant on any declaration such as those required for enforcing discipline in the Army.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further confirmation that only Army personnel were declared to be on `active service' is included in a letter from the Chairman, Repatriation Commission to the Secretary of the Prime Minister's Department in response to a request dated 20 March 1953 to define properly the description of Australian operations in Malaya, which states inter alia:&hyphen;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In looking at this budget it is imperative that I do take the opportunity to be the first speaker on this matter of public importance. What is this matter of public importance? It is that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and his Treasurer, Mr Costello, who claim to be working for Australia and working for Australian families, have added in this budget $321 million more cuts to the $500 million cuts they made to child care last year&mdash;over $800 million out of child care in just two budgets. Yet they keep saying that they are a government and this is a budget that will help Australian families. It will not. The way the cuts in child care are affecting Australian families is already very savage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These cuts come on top of the impact of the $500 million from last year's child&hyphen;care cuts that are already seeing the closure of at least 10 community based child&hyphen;care centres in Western Australia. Senator Newman acknowledged two closures in her own state today, one of which she says was before her government's time in office&mdash;not that I remember, Minister, that it was closed when I was minister. I will certainly chase that one up because I was never told of a child&hyphen;care centre closing in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community based child&hyphen;care centres are closing thick and fast across the country because of your specific and deliberate deci 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sion to see them do so. You are seeing the closure of community based child&hyphen;care centres because you have removed the operational subsidies, in the face of a promise that you would not do so; you have seen the fees go up $20 to $40 a week per place, in the face of promises that you would not attack child care; and you have also seen the assessment for child&hyphen;care assistance fixed so that not only are the fees going up but assistance to families in most cases is going down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there are dramatic cuts in the number of child&hyphen;care places. In this budget you have added to that by restricting the forward estimates of child&hyphen;care places from about 21,000 to 7,000 in the next 12 months and similar figures in the out year beyond that. Why are you doing that? So as to shore up the private child&hyphen;care centres already in existence. That is what you are doing&mdash;the most counter to free market, which you people advocate, proposals ever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, what you are doing is restricting the access to child care for families of Australia. The costs have gone through the roof. The child&hyphen;care community based centres are closing and you say that you are trying to help families. In March, over 50,000 women withdrew from the work force in this country. That is directly correlated to the costs of child care for so many of those families. You are  anti-family. You are anti-working mothers. You are anti-working families. It is now obvious what you are, if there was any doubt before&mdash;and I never thought there was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the second tory budget following on a first tory budget that aids the rich and does not give a damn for the poor&mdash;savings that are going to benefit the top end of town. What working class family, I ask you, is going to be able to salt away $60,000 to enjoy the savings benefit? They cannot even pay for their child care. The savings benefit in this budget is not going to help the struggling families in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is no longer even a thinly veiled attempt to encourage women to move back into the home. This is a completely blatant exercise in encouraging women back into the home. While I do commend some of the increased payments for carers, modest and all 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3346"> as they are, that is also just another recognition of the role you have for women&mdash;at home, looking after and doing all the caring for very, very few dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget is the exercise in two&hyphen;facedness to take the cake. You are introducing a restriction of 20 hours child care for non&hyphen;work related child care. Let me quote Sally Loane in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In taking child-care services back to its primary purpose, a labour market tool designed to enable women to re-enter the workforce, the Government has done what it prevented the previous Labor Government doing just three years ago. Then, when Labor tried to put a cap on the exploding outlays on recreational child care, the Liberal and the National Parties, aided by powerful private sector lobby groups, stopped the cuts. Then, the Coalition argued that the battler parents should get all the access to publicly-funded child care they wanted.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what Sally Loane said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  today&mdash;and very succinctly said, too. I will now turn to a few quotes which were made at the time of that debate. I thought Senator Minchin deserved a recollection; I note that he is in here to defend himself&mdash;keen anticipation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You're not, Senator Minchin? Oh well, let me see whether I can provoke you. Certainly, Senator Troeth will be up, so I thought I would quote her, too. Senator Minchin said that the 12&hyphen;hour restriction was a matter of bureaucrats deciding what was work related. He does not understand the legislation. He didn't then; he doesn't now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The facts are that Senator Mackay only within the last hour said that I did not live in Tasmania and that I did not understand or care about Tasmania. The facts are that I have not only produced the Tasmania package, which has now been implemented in two budgets, but I have also been congratulated in the editorial recently of the Launceston <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS>  for what this government has done for Tasmania through my efforts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that Ms Macklin, the shadow spokesman, said that 12 centres in Tasmania have been targeted by this government to close. There are none targeted to close, so she is wrong again. The shadow minister also said that this government was sending women home and they were not to be in the work force. That was also repeated by Senator Reynolds the other night during the adjournment debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble is that Labor women have trouble with figures as well as facts. The March figure which she was quoting includes all females, not just females with dependent children under the age of 15. In the single month of March, which was being quoted by Ms Macklin, with the exception of sole parents, employment of women with children actually rose. The major falls were for students and non-family groups. Let us make it clear that you cannot take the facts you are given by Labor women as gospel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get the facts straight on child care. Far from making savage cuts to child care, this government has increased and will continue to increase both the number of child-care places and expenditure on child care. Did 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you get that? We will continue to increase and have increased both the number of child-care places and expenditure on child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last year of the Keating government, $1.003 billion was outlaid on child care. Last year, the first year of the Howard government, we spent $1.102 billion&mdash;that is an increase of around $100 million or a 10 per cent increase on the Keating government's last year. This year spending on child care will be $1.146 billion. Over the next four years, this government will spend $4.8 billion. Child care will continue to grow at three per cent real growth in each of the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since coming to office we have created over 31,222 new child-care places at a full year cost of around $86 million. Over the next four years, 83,000 additional places will be provided. Senator Crowley was keen to make allegations about numbers, but she is not prepared to listen to that. Forty-four thousand of those additional places will be in the private sector and 39,000 will be in community long day care, family day care and after school hours care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, we have also made available a further $31 million over four years to ensure that children with high levels of additional needs get appropriate access to child-care options. These are hardly the actions of a government which has made `savage cuts to child care', and they are the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has demonstrated its commitment to child care with tangible policy initiatives aimed at fixing the aftermath of Labor's lack of coordinated planning of the child-care system. I draw the Senate's attention to a press release I have just received from the Australian Federation of Child Care Associations, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see this budget as a reasonable and carefully considered plan which reflects the listening that Government has done through the consultations that have taken place since the previous government budget in August 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The control on supply of Private Childcare services capped at 7,000 new places for 1998 and 1999 is a welcome initiative that will slow growth and encourage more thoughtful and rational decisions regarding Private childcare provision. For existing services in areas of oversupply this measure has shown that the Government 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3349"> is concerned about the long-term viability of Private services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Child care under Labor was characterised by oversupply in some areas and undersupply in others. As I said in question time, under Labor there was a proliferation of child&hyphen;care centres in many urban areas. The consequent underutilisation of places has created viability problems for a number of child-care centres. In other areas there are insufficient places. So Labor's unplanned and unchecked child-care system was unsustainable and threatened the entire child-care system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition there have been excessive charging practices in place by a number of services. It is not the government's role to subsidise child-care centres whose charging practices are in some cases excessive or inefficient. It is not the government's role to expend endless amounts of money on a child-care system that is expanding out of control and which has lacked any coordinated planning or control and, in many cases, does not meet the needs of families, especially in rural and remote Australia. I understand that Senator Mackay was talking about that earlier. If I have time, I will go through some details about what we are doing for rural and regional Australia. It is very substantial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are determined to establish a high quality child-care system that remains flexible, affordable and accessible to families to enable parents to participate in the work force if that is their choice and at the same time provide a reasonable amount of subsidised child care for those not in the paid work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it clear that, unlike our predecessors, we have consulted widely with parents, child-care providers&mdash;as you heard from the quote that I gave just before&mdash;and other interested parties. We have developed a national planning framework for child care which is based on these consultations and research. We have listened and we have put in place what needs to be done. It is a plan which is going to provide a sound foundation for the development of an affordable and sustainable child-care system. We will work with local and state governments in planning 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for the future development of a sustainable child-care system and an appropriate balance of facilities. This child-care package will give Australian families fair and equitable access to subsidised child care and it will provide more even distribution of child-care places, especially in rural and remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to stress that in the budget announced yesterday there have been no changes to eligibility for child-care assistance or the child-care cash rebate. We have preserved every benefit for working families. It is also important to stress that 85 per cent of the savings come from managing future growth. That seems to be the big problem that those on the other side have to come to grips with. It is savings coming from managing the future growth&mdash;not stopping it, but managing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eligibility for child&hyphen;care assistance for new private long day care services will be limited to 7,000 places in 1998 and 1999 consistent with the number of places required to meet the expected growth in labour force participation of parents with young children. In addition, the government will provide 2&half; thousand new family day care places in recognition of the fact that families are seeking greater access to family day care which provides flexible hours, care for family groupings, and quality care in a home setting. As I mentioned earlier, in total, around 83,000 new child&hyphen;care places are expected to be established over the next four years, allowing  access for an additional 136,000 children. Did you hear that, Senator?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the next four years the Commonwealth government will increase the number of outside school hour care places by 28,500 to meet the unmet demand for school&hyphen;age care which was ignored by the previous government. Over four years an additional $11 million will be injected into outside school hours care. This will improve the equity and the affordability of care for school age children by making many low and middle income families eligible for a higher rate of child&hyphen;care assistance from January next year. This new child&hyphen;care assistance for school&hyphen;age children will benefit an estimated 70,000 families. Again, that does not sound like savage cuts to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3350"> child care to me and, in your heart of hearts, you must understand that, Senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just look at the 20&hyphen;hour per week limit on access to child&hyphen;care assistance to families using care for non&hyphen;work related reasons. I well recognise the need, as I said in question time, and the value of non&hyphen;work related child care to enable children to experience a range of social and developmental opportunities and to enable parents to participate in community or voluntary activities and have a break for themselves. Child&hyphen;care centres play an important role in early childhood development and preschool education, but the 20&hyphen;hour limit recognises that on average families using care for non&hyphen;work related reasons use around 14 hours of care a week. There will be exemptions to the limit available to assist families in crisis and children at risk of abuse or neglect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude by making some of the points about rural and regional Australia. Funding totalling $9.5 million over four years has been provided to support community centres&mdash;still to be established under the child&hyphen;care strategy&mdash;to target family needs which are not being met by private operators, particularly in rural and regional Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to begin by putting on the record the fact that the Democrats have been critical of the way that this government slashed funding for child care in last year's budget. The government should be condemned for the cuts made in the 1996 budget. Many of these changes were just awful. Some have not even started yet. For example, the effects of abolishing operational subsidies for community child&hyphen;care centres does not even begin to be felt until after this measure comes into effect on 1 July this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats fought very hard to prevent many of the changes which were announced in last year's budget from coming into effect. We voted against&mdash;after a hiccup, I agree&mdash;the abolition of operational subsidies for community based long day care centres; the capping of child&hyphen;care assistance at 50 hours per week per child; the payment of child&hyphen;care assistance directly to parents; the abolition of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the additional income allowed dependent children when assessing a family's eligibility for child&hyphen;care assistance; and the freezing of child&hyphen;care assistance and child&hyphen;care cash rebate from indexation for two years. But we should not let last year's cuts be confused with this year's budget which, while it makes savings, is not nearly so savage as the 1996 attack on families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am surprised that former minister Senator Crowley is complaining about the proposed 20&hyphen;hour limit, because she championed for months and months&mdash;although I believe that personally she did not support it&mdash;a 12&hyphen;hour limit. Not only that, it was a 12&hyphen;hour limit in isolation from other needed actions like national planning. The Democrats give the new minister credit for listening to our concerns, and the concerns of child&hyphen;care organisations, and coming up with what seems to be an acknowledgment of the need for planning. We certainly want to see the details of that before we sign off. But let us give the minister a tick for that. We did say right through the 12&hyphen;hour debate that there was a place for limits on non&hyphen;work related care, but not 12 hours and not in isolation from a national plan. So we will not sign off on the 20&hyphen;hour figure just yet&mdash;we have more consultation to do&mdash;but it is much more the ballpark figure than Labor's proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are concerned, however, about other effects, particularly the effect of withdrawing operational subsidies from school&hyphen;age care services. It is difficult to read  the budget papers in regard to this, but I must say that that would be a disaster, so let us see what the proposal really means. Also, we will monitor the capping of places to 7,000 in 1998 and 1999. It is a move that I believe will be supported by some of the providers of child&hyphen;care services. It is a move towards planning for this industry and that is certainly needed, even though some people think that that word `planning' is a terrible word. The previous government turned their back on it and this government always harps on the need for the market to decide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But at last there is an acknowledgment that we cannot allow wholesale unplanned expan 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3351"> sion of child&hyphen;care places in any suburb that a developer picks. All of us know stories about how in some parts of the country there is almost a child&hyphen;care centre on every corner. Market forces do come into play, sometimes tragically so, especially if there are too many places. Some or perhaps every child&hyphen;care centre is affected. Some, of course, go broke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will monitor how the 7,000 places are distributed and watch carefully to ensure that no rural or regional area suffers from this decision, because the imbalance affects rural and regional areas in the other direction where there are not enough places available. We will also be seeking further clarification on what the effects will be of paying child-care assistance to families in arrears from 1 January 1999. I would be particularly concerned about the problem for child-care providers and the effect on their ability to provide for adequate staff. I suspect that this will not be a progressive move. However, we are prepared to look at it further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats want it to be perfectly clear today that a lot of damage was done to child care as a result of cuts which were made in last year's budget. There have been closures of child-care centres around Australia. Surely that is sufficient evidence. Finally, given that the government has predicted a massive budget surplus, I call on the government to give the money taken from Australian families back to those families in order to undo some of the damage which was caused by child-care cuts contained in last year's budget.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion moved by Senator Crowley alleges savage cuts to child care by this government. I think Senator Newman has adequately put to the Senate the increases which have been introduced by this government. We had a figure of 10 per cent increased expenditure mentioned; that is, $1 billion under the prior government in its last year as opposed to $1.146 billion proposed under this expenditure. As well, under these proposals we also have a provision for ex 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> penditure of $1 million per annum on increasing services to play groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government stated in the budget released last night that it is committed to assisting low and middle income Australia to obtain affordable child care. That in turn will enable parents to participate in the work force should they choose to do so. This commitment recognises the need for some women to participate in the work force. However, I would suggest that the part of the proposal put by Senator Crowley which refers to the detrimental effects on women is somewhat narrow-minded, because what Senator Crowley fails to recognise is that there are some 33,400 men who are single parents with children under the age of 12. It is estimated that 48 per cent of those men are using child care. So when we talk about it being detrimental to women, let us talk about those single parents who are men as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might just add that this opposition has a hide when it talks about the government's lack of commitment to women. We thrashed the opposition in relation to representation of females in the House of Representatives, in this chamber and also on various Commonwealth bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legacy that Labor left us in relation to child care was abysmal. In fact, we have heard mentioned today the proliferation of child-care services in urban Australia. In fact, there were some 20,000 places added each year under the ad hoc growth approach by the previous government. Senator Crowley mentioned the 10 services that had closed in  Western Australia. Of course you are going to get closures where you have an oversupply of a service in a particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government did not plan any strategic growth in child-care services, so what you had was the proliferation of child-care services in areas where there was an oversupply. Of course they are going to end up being under&hyphen;utilised and in turn you will have closures. Senator Crowley failed to address that when she raised this point of the closures in Western Australia. The reality is that under the previous government the growth in child care was unplanned and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3352"> unchecked. Under Labor, child care was careering out of control, and the taxpayer was footing the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I go on to highlight the benefits of the government's child-care plan for both men and women, I would like to remind the opposition of its poor record in this area. Senator Crowley would remember that under the former Labor government there was this increase of child-care services in urban areas. Of course, the prior government's poor management of this led to an under-utilisation of places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast, the current government is committed to ensuring that child care can be available for all and that it will be available for all Australians in various geographic areas. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) said last night that child care is an area of unsustainable growth in government spending. In fact, it is one of the fastest growing areas of government expenditure. We see this when we look at an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of today's date which was written by Verona Burgess. She states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the Howard Government has put the brakes on the mushrooming of subsidised places in private long day-care centres.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Even the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  was recognising that this area was growing out of control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Costello explained last night in the government's budget that these measures would guarantee growth based on targeting areas with greatest needs. These measures represent an equity issue. More parents in lower economic areas will receive assistance, and more places will be located in areas where access is extremely difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1 January next year, a 20-hour per week limit on access to child-care assistance will be introduced for each child in care for non-work related purposes. The limit will apply to all day&hyphen;long care and school aged services. This will free around 6,000 places for work related care. Without these measures, the child-care assistance scheme would not remain viable in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of today's date, Mark Mallabone did a survey of some aver 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> age Australian battlers. He referred to Mr and Mrs Nortje in Ballajura, which is a marginal seat and represents middle Australia. Mrs Nortje said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the move to place restrictions on non-working mothers using child-care was a positive one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Day-care should be a priority for working mums and I can't see anything wrong with putting a 20-hour limit on other people who use it . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If that does not come from the area where it is most intended to help people, I do not know what is. The opposition fails to realise what middle Australia needs. It failed to realise that last year when it went to the election, and that is why it lost so horribly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has announced reforms to child care, which will see strategic and well&hyphen;planned growth in that sector. This budget has also mentioned improvements in outside school home care services which, as Senator Newman mentioned, would benefit some 70,000 families. In addition, the government believes that families should have available to them a service, no matter where they live. I note that the government has also mentioned that there will be an exemption for families in crisis in relation to the 20&hyphen;hour cap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1 October this year the government will work with states and local governments as well as the private sector, as Senator Newman mentioned. The government will work to establish new services in areas of greatest need and the private sector growth will be contained to 7,000 new places for each of the years 1998 and 1999. The government will increase the supply of family day care by 2,500 places at a cost of $11 million over the next four years. These additional  places will alleviate pressures in rural and remote areas where there is a great need for child care. In particular, I refer to my home state of Western Australia. An estimated 3,200 additional families will benefit from this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures build on reforms which were outlaid in last year's budget. They provide a sound foundation for the development of an affordable and sustainable child&hyphen;care system, unlike that offered by the prior government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also to speak on this matter of public importance. Before I start my contribution I would like to refute a number of the claims made by Senator Newman in her address on this matter, particularly her claim that her government is actually increasing funding for child care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman can quite clearly state that, on the books, every year there is an increase in the columns. But what Senator Newman does not inform this chamber and the Australian public is that those increases do not reflect the anticipated growth in child care. So what we are seeing in real terms is a decline in funding for child-care services in Australia. The $841 million cut over the last two budgets represents the absolute magnitude of the gap between the growth in child-care services the need for support of Australian families, and what this government is prepared to offer them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point I would like to make is that Senator Newman brags that there are no changes to eligibility in this year's budget. Well of course there are not because they were all made last year. All of the changes to eligibility were put in last year, whether it was with respect to child&hyphen;care assistance and having two or more children in care or whether it was with respect to the rebate. So, yes, Senator, you can stand up and say, `Isn't this wonderful. No changes to eligibility this year,' but it is because you put those things in place last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also very interested and quite relieved in some way to hear the senator bragging about savings coming from managing future growth. I think that is an acknowledgment of exactly what this government is doing. They say `managing future growth'. That is a euphemism for restricting future growth, and I will return to that point later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a general comment, it is very interesting to look at a snapshot of what Labor did with child care up to the election last year. Child&hyphen;care places grew from 46,000 to 300,000 places nationally during the time Labor was in government. That was not just because Labor thought child care was a great idea&mdash;I think it is a great idea as a working parent&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">but it was in response to a need of families in Australia. It was not something that Labor just drove because we thought it was a good idea; it was something in response to the needs of working families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this government does not operate like that. It does not look at Australian society and see what the needs of Australians are. It has a social model in its head. Its social model for the working family is that it likes to see one of those parents&mdash;be it the man or the woman, Senator Ellison&mdash;in the home looking after young children. What we have now is a government that is prepared to impose its social ideal on Australian society instead of responding to the needs, the demographics and the changes in the working patterns of Australian families who, for one reason or another, choose to both work or, in the case of single parent families, have to work to survive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The standard that we set as a party did recognise those changes in employment. Unlike the coalition, we know that the average Australian is already doing it really hard as a result of the child-care cuts last year. Growth in child care over the last six years has been 18 per cent. This growth has not been recognised by this government in its effort to impose its social ideal on Australian working families with children in care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The social outcomes of Labor's efforts in responding to community needs were not only the higher participation in the work force but also a service that provided what parents were looking for&mdash;that was, guaranteed quality and an affordable and accessible service. I find it so amusing, Senator Newman, that, when we were talking last year about the $500 million budget cuts to child care when you were cutting operational subsidies for community based child care, you stood up and argued and said, `Let the market decide,' or words to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your line last year, Senator Newman, and the line of this government was: the market must decide where the centres are needed. And this year we see a complete turnaround on that position. Suddenly it is no longer: let the market decide on where the private centres can be built and the services that they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3354"> provide. Suddenly, this year, the government has changed its tune completely and has said that unsustainable growth in child subsidisation is something that must be controlled. So instead of letting the market decide, this government has switched tracks completely and said, `We will impose restrictions on the growth of private centres. We will control where they are built. We will control the numbers of places they provide to the community with subsidisation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have a free market government turning the tables when it suits them to impose a social model that they choose and which they seek to put on Australian working families. That is a model that we all know dates back to the 1950s. There is nothing this government could say or do to move away from that position because the hypocrisy of their policy approach on child care has now been exposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to take the opportunity to say that in a mere 14 months the landscape for child care has changed completely and dramatically. To refresh the memories of my senatorial colleagues, let us have a look at what happened last year. Community long day care operational subsidies were cut, forcing parents in only a matter of weeks to be paying $20 or so a week more for each child in care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rebate and child&hyphen;care assistance maximum limit froze for two years, so again it is not recognising any growth and squeezing a few extra dollars out of the child care budget. Child&hyphen;care assistance was restricted to 50 hours per week and the child&hyphen;care cash rebate is now means tested&mdash;that came in earlier this year. There was also that little bit on the side that offered tax rebates to families with a child under five staying at home with a parent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the social outcomes that we have seen over the last 14 months or so as a result of last year's budget are that women&mdash;or one of the working parents&mdash;have been forced out of work and care has become a commodity. No longer is care an essential service that needs to be provided in response to a community demand. Care is now a commodity under this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government&mdash;a commodity to be controlled, a commodity to be manipulated and to be used to allow this government to make Australian families conform to their retrograde social ideals. I do not believe that is acceptable in any way, shape or form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the sweeteners attached in this year's budget, we have heard about the out of school hours care&mdash;although the operational subsidy has been cut to that&mdash;play group funding and so forth. Sure, they are all good, but it is all about restricting choice in some areas and then making it look good, putting a bit of sugar on top, in the other areas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate which, in the wording of Senator Crowley, simply reinforces the stereotypes that the Labor Party would like to present as to their view of who should be handling the child&hyphen;care debate. It is significant that Senator Crowley talked about the detrimental effects only  with regard to women. I am very glad that Senator Ellison saw fit to raise the point that the child&hyphen;care debate also has some effect on men.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor view of the world was only perpetuated in the adjournment speech of Senator Reynolds the other night when she asked time after time what the coalition women who came into the last parliament were doing about child care. There was not one mention of the extended role which many men look to play and choose to play in child care for their children. I would suggest that they remove the blinkers somewhat when they are talking on this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley, I can actually answer one of the queries you raised in regard to last year's budget. One of the changes in last year's budget which removed operational subsidies from community care centres simply righted the balance and put the outlook of private centres and community centres on an even playing field. Operational subsidies have never been available to private child&hyphen;care centres, and the removal of the operational 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3355"> subsidies simply placed them on a an equal footing with the private day care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be very interested to know of the evidence for child&hyphen;care centres closing, because it has been passed on to me that since July of last year in Western Australia only four centres have closed, mainly due to underutilisation. As a contrast to that, in Balcatta, which, I understand, is a Labor area of Perth, seven private sector centres have opened within walking distance of the community centre. And if, Senator Lundy, we are talking about child care as `an essential service'&mdash;and I am quoting your words here&mdash;`to be provided according to community demand'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Lundy interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GX5">Senator TROETH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, those were the words you used. What better example do you have of that than one centre closing because of underutilisation and seven private sector centres opening because of the demand that parents have. That is the way the market operates in a real business sense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If these changes that have been brought about as a result of last night's budget are so unfair and detrimental to parents, not just women, how then do we account for the words today from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in Melbourne&mdash;which is not a paper that is noted for its conservative views&mdash;where they interviewed a woman in Melbourne who is a mother at home in East Bentleigh with a two&hyphen;year&hyphen;old and a one&hyphen;year&hyphen;old? Her husband, Ross, works full time in a factory, and she was interviewed before and after the budget. After the budget, Mrs Walkear thought that changes to child care were fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To illustrate that, statistics show that the average amount of child care used in non&hyphen;working care is 14 hours per week. Certainly, we moved against the mean and inadequate 12&hyphen;hour limit proposed by Labor when they were in government, because we believed it was inadequate. By contrast, the 20 hours which we are proposing under our budget measures give a non&hyphen;working mother or father the equivalent of five days for four hours a day. That is a generous allowance, and Labor are being extremely hypocritical on this in view of the fact that they tried to cut it down 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to much less. On that basis, we would expect that they would be supporting our government's position on child&hyphen;care hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those senators who were in government for the Labor Party during the previous time of government would know that I asked many questions in estimates on the amount of planning that was being done by the Labor government to try to mould child&hyphen;care centres into some form of acceptable pattern. They know as well as I do that there was untrammelled expansion in some areas and relative underdevelopment in others. No amount of questioning by me and other coalition senators could elicit the fact that there was any planning going into this at all. By contrast to this, we would like to really use some measures to expand areas where child care has not been very prevalent, particularly in rural and regional Australia, which is an area dear to my heart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, we are looking to expand outside school hours care and we will have pilot and research projects going into rural and regional areas. We are providing ongoing funding of $15.7 million over four years to make services available in disadvantaged areas where there are no alternative funded services. Not only that; if Labor senators had taken the trouble to read the fine print of our budget documents, they would know that in areas where there are no other services the 20&hyphen;hour limit will not apply and parents will be able to access that for non&hyphen;work related care to use as they would any other sort of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every benefit&mdash;as both Senator Newman and Senator Ellison remarked&mdash;that existed up until last night has been preserved for working parents and for working families. Senator Crowley cannot have it both ways. We cannot be detrimental to working families and at the  same time be forcing parents back into their ideal of a very conservative home. What we are trying to do is establish a system of choice: if you work, you should have accessible, equitable and funded child care which is available for you to use as a working parent. That was the primary objective of child&hyphen;care services as they were set up by the Labor government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3356">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you do not work, you should also have access to care if you cannot find it within your extended family or in flexible working hours, which we hope will be the norm rather than the exception under our new industrial relations laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes which we have made to child care will provide a better&hyphen;organised service which is more accessible to more parents and will certainly not have detrimental effects on parents and families, other than those prescribed by the Labor Party.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to rise on this matter of importance, the issue of child care. It is an extraordinarily complex issue and I must confess that I do not think that every proposition that is put forward is a negative. But I think that, on balance, the changes that have been imposed by this budget on child care are negative for parents who do rely on child care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I first had my child and was seeking child care, I found that to guarantee a place for your child in a private child&hyphen;care centre you had to put your child on the waiting list 12 months before it was going to be born. I found this proposition extraordinarily difficult, but maybe that was possible for those who have perfect timing in terms of conception. Certainly it was extraordinarily difficult to get into a child&hyphen;care centre. Not only that; when I first re&hyphen;entered the work force after the birth of my child, I found that I had only $40 left in my pocket after payment of child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very proud to say that over the period of time that Labor was in power, we introduced 400,000 child&hyphen;care places, child&hyphen;care assistance and the child&hyphen;care rebate, which really gave working parents direct access to child care at a realistic cost. I think that was something that was applauded by the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, it was a slash and burn budget. There were major cuts in child&hyphen;care assistance, in operational subsidies and in the rebate. I do not wish to waste my time and go over them again, but I think most people are well aware of the detrimental effect those cuts 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have had on the services provided in child care. More importantly, a lot of the ill effects are still to come into place because they have not actually started operating yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I want to look at very clearly are some of the propositions that have been put in this budget and to see what the negatives are for parents who are trying to find child care. I think it is a rather simplistic proposition to say that the Labor Party is opposed to the restriction of hours to non&hyphen;working parents as a matter of principle, because certainly that is not the case. There is some sympathy for the view, in principle, that non&hyphen;working parents should have their hours restricted. But the difficulties that arise from this proposition being put in place were made very obvious to us in the Senate community affairs committee last year when we took evidence in relation to a restriction in hours down to 12.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very clear practical difficulty with this restriction is that non&hyphen;working parents, if they are entitled to only a limited number of hours, will normally seek care during the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. or thereabouts. The difficulty with that is that a child&hyphen;care centre that has a child in care between the hours of 10 and three is unable, generally, to find a child who is prepared to come in for the hours before 10 and after three. I think this is a serious problem that you will have to deal with, Minister, and one which you will need to take a rational approach to because it is certainly a problem that you will need to tackle when you impose these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area that I have to applaud is the introduction of greater planning in the child care area. I do see that as a positive step and we will be supporting it. But, in saying those two positive things, as I like to do, I have to say that overall I think this is a very negative thing for parents who rely on child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the next two years, there will be 27,000 fewer places available than there would be except for this budget. In fact, the additional cuts are $321 million, as has been stated over and over again, and that is on top of the $500 million last year.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3357">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Included in the budget is the abolition of the operational subsidy for before and after school care. It has already been estimated that the removal of that subsidy will mean additional charges of up to $20 per child for those who utilise that care. The trouble with this particular sector is  that it is probably the most poorly funded sector of child care in our community. The care is often in either unused school rooms or buildings donated by council that are no longer used&mdash;not the ideal. And certainly the staffing levels are not the same as those that many of the other child care centres and private long day care centres enjoy. It is very sad to see that this government is beating around the head a sector of child care which is very poorly off at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been an extension in the means test for those in before and after school care. The number of people who can receive child-care assistance for this type of child care has been extended, but the budget very clearly states that the level of assistance that is going to be provided to those utilising before and after school care will go down. If you are a low income earner earning less than $27,000, already utilising before and after school care, you will be not only $20 a week worse off but also worse off in the level of assistance that you will receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been an abolition of a number of things. The block grants to states for school care have been cut. This may well increase the cost of parents for vocation care. Alternatively, parents who cannot afford it may well leave their children unsupervised during vacations, which is not an option that I consider reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cruellest cut or the most sneaky cut is a small line item in the budget which will save the government the princely sum of $39 million: that is, the requirement that in future child-care assistance&mdash;which is presently paid in advance&mdash;be paid on a fortnightly basis in arrears. It seems to me that a large number of families that enjoy child-care assistance will not be assisted. In fact, they will have to pay the money up front and then get it back two weeks later.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It certainly will not meet the objectives that I think are important for child-care assistance, and that is to ensure that parents can afford child care and that child care is of a high quality. All in all, this is a damaging budget for child care. There are some minor positive elements contained in it. I initially gave the government credit for that. But, overall, those people in child care are worse off. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This report is very important. It should have been brought down and the inquiry held before the government took the decisions that  it took. This whole process has left a rather nasty taste in my mouth, given the importance of Senate inquiries and given the importance to the people of Australia of their Commonwealth railways.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3358">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee felt that it was acting under a cloud and certainly under some pressure because the government had already announced that it was going to sell the Commonwealth railways without any opportunity to debate the decision in public. However, we took evidence, and I was very grateful for the quality of the evidence which was given. I thank the people in Adelaide, Port Augusta, Broken Hill, Launceston and those whom we heard from in Canberra who gave a lot of quality evidence to this inquiry and who enabled this report to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also give thanks to the committee members. Despite the fact that politics was caught up in this&mdash;and I was as much involved in that as anyone else; we could not avoid that because of the decisions taken by the government before we even had a chance to meet&mdash;the committee members put their best foot forward and made a very good contribution. I think we all tried very hard to hear the evidence which was given and to allow that evidence to influence the way in which the report was written.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, there are two reports. I acknowledge that the government members were under a certain restriction in terms of their ability to endorse the majority report, given the decisions made by the government prior to the inquiry being held. Nevertheless, they cooperated very well with the inquiry. I certainly thank them for that. They made a very useful contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the members of the secretariat. I want to place their names on the record because of the work they did in a very quick time in making sure that this inquiry could proceed. I thank Andrew Snedden, the committee secretary, Pippa Carron, John O'Keefe, Maurice Chalmers and Judith Wuest, all of whom played a greater or lesser part in the hearings and in the presentation of this report. I think I said that we were very grateful to those who gave evidence at the various places where evidence was taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me, in setting a context for this report, speak about a concern that I have, which is a development that is very evident among governments in the Western democracies. It is illustrated very much by the process that I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have just described. That is the development of the corporate state. The corporate state is a state where decisions are not made by elected representatives so much as by government, and particularly executive government, dealing with powerful elites and individuals rather than using its elected representatives to inform it about decisions. It was a development under Labor, but it has certainly escalated under this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole process of the sale of our Commonwealth railways is a perfect example of how the corporate state operates. The government, without any reference to parliament, made the decision to sell the people's asset. Before any legislation was passed, the sale of the asset was advertised. Then we discover, particularly through the budget last night, that this whole process is now being delayed by the necessity of the Commonwealth government to consult with the states that are most affected. I am concerned that governments are using this process of the corporate state rather than using the processes of the parliament itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would remind the Senate that the corporate state was a concept developed by the Italian fascists in order to increase efficiency so that Mussolini could boast that he made the trains run on time. I am not implying that this government is fascist at all. I am not making that reference. The fascists believed that there was a role for government. I think this government believes that government should almost have no role in anything, so I am certainly not suggesting that it is fascist. But I am concerned about this development of the corporate state because I believe it is a development which takes away from the parliament its proper role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee's report is very clear, and it does cast doubt on the sale of the railways. It examined the evidence and the report by Mr John Brew, and recognised that he operated within a very narrow framework and probably could not have come to any other conclusions  than the ones that he came to. But the committee would say that there were other options and, if the terms of reference for Brew had not been so narrow, he could have considered other, I believe, more creative options. I am 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3359"> concerned about the continuing loss of jobs in Commonwealth railways, and the loss of transport to regional areas&mdash;or at least the possibility of that. I am also concerned that we have a need&mdash;and the government does not seem to take account of this&mdash;for a nationally integrated land transport strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee did criticise the Brew report. It found that it failed to focus on the effect of the loss of AN business on South Australia. It failed to consult with users of the interstate passenger network. The Brew report failed to focus on users of AN services and the AN work force, or consult them to any degree. The committee raised concerns about the accuracy of the calculations in the Brew report. It is concerned that Brew did not consider AN in the broader context of land transport policy, ecologically sustainable development and employment in regional areas, but it does recognise that Brew laboured under some difficulties given the narrow terms of reference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the report to the Senate. I recognise that certainly the government has a different opinion and that it is quite appropriate for the government to make decisions, but I would certainly warn that governments that make decisions outside the parliamentary process surely are treading on dangerous ground. I hope that the government will take account of the recommendations of this report. I recognise that the government members themselves have their own dissenting report. I am sure that the government will take note of what they say, but I hope it will take note also of the majority report. Now that the government has run into some trouble, it may find itself able to look at some other options.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Adelaide, the committee heard of the tragic and continuing demise of the South Australian rail network. Since 1982, 1,375 kilometres of railway line were closed or abandoned or, worse still, torn up and sold for scrap. So in 15 years 50 per cent of the South Australian rail network has been closed, most of it in regional areas. The most recent closure was at Eudunda in October 1995 when a South Australian minister, Diana Laidlaw, commendably, but sadly unsuccessfully, appealed to the then minister for transport, the Hon. Laurie Brereton, and asked that the line be left intact pending a discussion on its future. Not an unreasonable request, I would have thought, but interestingly enough it was completely ignored by the previous minister and so the line was dismantled and the rail stockpiled for sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But by far the greatest tragedy in South Australia's sorry saga with the railways is in Port Augusta, where thousands of people have lost their jobs. Forty of them lost their jobs on Christmas Eve. Can you imagine receiving a worse Christmas present than on Christmas Eve to be given notice that you have lost your job? What a legacy of the mismanagement of this network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to give a perspective on the South Australia rail network: in 1974 there were 2,157 men and women working in the South Australian Railways at Port Augusta; in June this year the figure was 618&mdash;and, sadly, the work force has since been further reduced. This was a devastating blow to the city of Port Augusta and was colourfully outlined to the committee in evidence by the mayor, Joy Baluch. She described to us the `pious platitudes' and `empty promises' of the previous government ministers on the railways' future. She said that she welcomed the Brew inquiry because the `rail industry in Port Augusta was being strangled and employment opportunities were being continually lost'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mayor Baluch&mdash;and she is a colourful woman&mdash;also told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You would have to be deaf, dumb and blind and with a labrador dog to suggest that AN should continue to be operated by Government. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3360"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">During the lunch break that day, some of the senators on the committee visited the railway workshops where an overwhelming sense of desolation and foreboding prevailed in those large empty buildings. The young men explained to us the great sense of helplessness and loss that they felt in their work environment. Moreover, they told me of the older family members who were taking redundancy to protect the jobs of their children. What a tragic decision to have to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, at last, these Australians now have a sense of optimism. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) has indicated that there have been more than 50 bidders and expressions of interest for parts of NR and AN&mdash;clear evidence that once again the remarks of the handwringers in the Labor Party about the future of the railways have been unfounded and misguided&mdash;and notably, very notably, and importantly, a number of short&hyphen;listed companies have expressed an interest in buying the whole of AN, lock, stock and barrel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These rail workers and their families at Port Augusta and at Islington in Adelaide can be heartened by the news that there is such strong interest in the sale of these very important federal government assets. Their optimism comes at the time when the level of interest is the best indicator of long-term employment in the rail sector. In fact, the strong interest by the private sector has totally vindicated the government's decision to sell the AN businesses and the Commonwealth's share of the National Rail Corporation. It also convincingly refutes the doom and gloom scenarios that Labor and the Democrats have tried to present in their report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that last night's budget contained the second half of a very generous $20 million rail reform transition program. It may turn out to be even more generous, looking at the number of people who are interested in buying the rail network. But this figure will be crucial, and this package will help enormously the rail employees' adjustment process at Islington and at Port Augusta. It is yet another sign that this government is commit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ted to helping rail communities get back on their feet and take control of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government senators who took part in this inquiry found clear evidence that there is good reason for optimism for the future of rail in Australia. The private sector, by its bids for the network, has confirmed it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the hope of those of us in the Labor Party that the government will reconsider its position in light of the flaws that have been found in the Brew report, and ensure that a plan for rail is developed which allows for significant consultation with all interested parties. We are not oblivious to the problems that confront AN and, indeed, National Rail. In fact, the Brew report does pull together many of the economic issues that must be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems with the report by John Brew, commissioned by Minister Sharp, relate to the solutions that he sees for rail, and the way that the government has dealt with this report. The Brew report was not released in a way that allowed for scrutiny and public debate. A small amount of information was released, but much of the Brew report was kept secret. The delay in full scrutiny of the report allowed a great deal of anxiety to develop within the AN work force.</PARA>

It is essential that the Australian people have an opportunity to examine the  issues that were explored by the Brew report. It is important that people can see the shortcomings of the findings, and the limitations of the terms of reference.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3361">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the hearings I discovered that the commissioning of the Brew report was welcomed by the mayor of Port Augusta, Joy Baluch. But the subsequent investigation by John Brew did not include any discussions with the city council or any consideration of the interests of the affected communities. What point was there in having an inquiry which does not canvass the views of the work force and the affected communities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rail and associated industries, and the people who work in these industries, face great uncertainty. Australian National has undergone much change&mdash;it had to. The rail unions were amongst the first to recognise that the future of rail depended on more efficiency and a well trained and forward thinking work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The workers that I have spoken to over a number of years have always been willing to accept the need for change. They have always been enthusiastic about explaining the developments in their operations to those who have visited the shop floor, and those of us with a strong interest in the maintenance of industry have long been impressed with the commitment of these workers. My association with rail workers in South Australia began long before I entered this place. As secretary of the Vehicle Builders Union, I worked for union members who built and maintained carriages in the Commonwealth railways, the South Australian railways and later AN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Workers in Port Augusta feel particularly vulnerable. Despite the views of the mayor, privatisation will be a real gamble for the people who work in this rail town. Many of the families have spent their entire lives working in this industry. The railways have been part of this region since last century and have provided stable employment for generations of Port Augusta, Stirling North, Quorn and Wilmington residents. So the implications of Mr Brew's recommendations are immense for workers in South Australia and Tasmania. The recommendations relating to the South Australian workshops, the closing of unprofitable lines and the privatisation of rail are the areas of most concern.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has approached the issue of AN  privatisation with a great deal of ideological zeal. They have not proved that there is a case for the sale of Australian National; they have merely set AN up for a predetermined fate. For a start the terms of reference were designed to make this matter a purely financial one. The aim was to isolate the debate about the viability of AN from the effect that its departure would have on the lives of the people and the economy of South Australia. The single&hyphen;minded pursuit of a bottom line outcome for the AN business denies the long-term plans that the previous government put in place and was committed to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Management received criticism in the hearings for exacerbating the problems within AN. It seems unfortunate that AN management accepted the Brew report and its implications without trying to explain its own actions that have led to this situation. The concerns about the way that Port Augusta operations were managed from Adelaide and the lack of communication between AN and the Port Augusta community should be noted with concern. I am aware of other concerns over AN management which have been raised by concerned constituents in my electorate office. I trust that AN is taking note of the issues that have been raised during this inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment is the major economic problem that this nation faces. This is at its most severe in regional Australia and amongst the work force that has been trained to work in a particular industry such as the rail industry. This government is showing no commitment to unemployed people. The lack of initiatives to tackle unemployment in the 1997-98 budget shows that this will not change in the foreseeable future. Unemployment in the northern and western regions of South Australia is at 9.3 per cent. Youth unemployment is over 30 per cent. A positive response to unemployment by the Howard government is needed and this response must include a commitment in real and long-term jobs for regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a great deal of concern out there in the community about the apparent desire of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3362"> this government to privatise industries like AN for the sake of it. There is no demonstrated need for privatisation in the case of Australian National. It is true that some feel that maybe things will be better or different if AN is sold off, but I believe that this is hardly a sound and rational reason for changing the ownership of an important industry in South Australia and Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence it is the view of the majority on the committee that the government must carefully plan its response to the questions that arise from the debate on our rail system. There must be a land transport strategy that defines the role of this form of transport. It is not in the best interests of our community to allow for a hotchpotch approach which is based on some rigid concept of competition. It is not appropriate to just accept the experiences of other nations when our circumstances are so unique, our distances great and our historical experiences so different. I hope that this inquiry sparks a real assessment of where we are going in terms of the development of a future for rail.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The solution that has been put forward by the Democrats and the Labor opposition would result in more jobs being lost and more taxpayers' money being lost. I will deal with a couple of points that I think are very important. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, Mr Brew disclosed that in recent years there had been 7,000 jobs lost, mainly in South Australia, that taxpayers were subsidising every remaining employee $30,000 per year and that this subsidy would increase to $220,000 in just four years . . . 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the situation. Nobody questioned the validity of the figures put before us by Mr Brew. There were criticisms with regard to the width and breadth of the terms of reference, but nobody could shoot holes in those figures. That was what we were faced with. That was the legacy of the previous Labor government&mdash;that lot over there&mdash;the 13 years of mismanagement. We had no option but to look at a new way; there is no question about that. I also bring to the attention of the chamber that the coalition has proposed a $2 billion reform package to rejuvenate rail operations and services in Australia. From the actions that we have already taken, it has been revealed that over 50 operations have shown an interest in taking up the option of providing rail services in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At long last those people in the rail industry can look forward to an opportunity to get back to do what they do best. Let me quote from Mr Carter, Executive Officer of Rail 2000, a rail lobby group&mdash;certainly not a friend of our side of politics. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have lobbied extensively against rail closures in this state and for the preservation of rail infrastructure when lines have been closed. Unfortunately, our efforts have been only moderately successful and in the main, the Federal Government, through the auspices of the Australian National, has ripped up these taxpayer funded assets and sold them for scrap metal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He is talking about that lot over that side. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rail 2000 believes many of these lines that have been closed could have remained open had the opportunity been given to alternative operators . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the rural rail network in South Australia has been decimated over the last decade or so and over 1,300 kilometres of track has been lifted. If we delay this process any further&mdash;for whatever reasons&mdash;even with the best will in the world, what you are going to see is that there will be no rural rail services left in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what was said there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me deal with some of the comments made in regard to Mr Brew. There was criticism of the terms of reference, and I accept that. But when Brew went outside the terms of reference and made recommenda tions, he was also criticised. So regardless of what he did he was damned. He could not win. It would not satisfy any of you lot over that side whatever way he went because he 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3363"> did not come up with the recommendations you wanted. He, in fact, gave a correct financial analysis of the serious state that our rail system was in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It needs to be noted that in the 13 years of Labor in office AN ran up a debt of almost $1 billion, and over 7,000 rail jobs in urban and regional South Australia and Tasmania were lost. That is the legacy that was left to National Rail. With the formation of the National Rail Corporation and the assets stripping that was done of Australian National, what hope did they have? The assets were taken away&mdash;fundamentally given to National Rail&mdash;and they were left with the debt. That was the situation they were confronted with.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I welcome the report on what is a most important issue for the parliament. It is an important issue also for the people of Australia, particularly for the health sector. The report, which is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medifraud and inappropriate practice</EMPHASIS> &mdash;a report by the Australian National Audit Office on efforts by the Health Insurance Commission to reduce, stamp out, health Medicare fraud and inappropriate practice&mdash;is one which finds that the efforts being undertaken by the Health Insurance Commission to do this are working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report notes, as I think is well known to all senators and the public at large, that the expenditure by government on payments under the Medicare system and in terms of pharmaceutical benefits run to the order of $8.3 billion per year. That is a heck of a lot of taxpayers' funds in anyone's language. Of course expenditure on the health budget, ensuring that Australians have access to universal health care, that we have an equitable system and a high quality system&mdash;indeed, a world's best health system&mdash;takes up a significant proportion of the overall level of government expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it has been recognised on all sides of politics that it is important that that expenditure be properly accounted for and that the system is one which taxpayers can have faith in and that will deliver what it is intended to do. So when you have around $8.3 billion of public funds being paid out as benefits in one form or another under the health system, as I said, particularly through Medicare benefits, we need to ensure that the level of fraud, the level of overservicing, the level of inappropriate practice, is kept to a minimum, if not ideally removed all together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This study by the audit office arises out of an earlier report conducted in 1992&hyphen;93 which found problems within the system. It found there was an unacceptable level of fraud. The audit office consequently made a number of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> major recommendations as to how to deal with that situation. This report looks back at what has occurred since its earlier report in 1992&hyphen;93. It examines how successful the measures have been which were put in place by the Health Insurance Commission and the then Labor government to deal with this problem. I would like to quote from the summary of the report because I believe it should be recorded how successful the efforts have been. This report was embargoed until earlier this afternoon and I have not yet had time to go through the report entirely. I will refer to the comments in the summary.

<PARA STYLE="Para">On page xii the ANAO concludes that&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the HIC has adopted a sound risk management approach to managing leakage through fraud and inappropriate practice from the Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits Schemes. Its approach, which emphasises the importance of preventative action, is being amended to bring it into accord with the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board . . . guidelines for the management of fraud against the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the measures the Commission uses to report to external stakeholders on management of fraud and inappropriate practice could be improved. These improvements include additional performance indicators, release of more useful information on results of Purpose Based Audits, and publication of estimates of fraud and inappropriate practice;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">while the Commission has followed advice from the Australian Bureau of Statistics in developing and using data from Source Based Audits, it is unable to produce a reliable estimate&mdash;at an acceptable cost&mdash;of leakage through fraud. The Commission intends to re&hyphen; examine the possibility of producing an estimate once three years of data from Source Based Audits are available. The Commission has not produced national estimates of inappropriate practice from Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schemes; and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3366"> </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Commission has implemented all major recommendations from Audit Report No. 17 1992&hyphen;93.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report by the audit office finds that whilst there is still room for improvement and that there is still work that needs to be done, particularly over a longer period of time, to assess how successful the actions have been, nevertheless, the commission has implemented all the recommendations that came out of that earlier report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly want to point to the fact that the audit office finds that, on indicative estimates, leakage through fraud is currently running at around 1.3 per cent to 2.3 per cent of payments from the Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits schemes. To put it another way, it finds that 98 per cent, or thereabouts, of payments that are made through the Medicare and the PBS schemes are proper and that there is no evidence other than, as it says, for about two per cent of payments where any fraud has occurred. That, the office finds, is a very commendable level of ensuring that the system is not abused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate, of course, that in a scheme as large and significant as Medicare, there will always be instances where the system is abused, either by practitioners in the system or, indeed, by those who may be patients or claimants. Of course, within the Health Insurance Commission, there is the professional services review scheme which has as its specific task, firstly, to monitor the schemes to ensure that fraud is eliminated wherever it is suspected and proved and, secondly, that practitioners, particularly, are counselled where, whilst there may not be evidence of direct fraud, there is the existence of inappropriate practice such as overuse of referrals and other health services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the report of the audit office. It demonstrates that the actions and systems put in place by the previous government have worked within the Health Insurance Commission. I hope that this current government, whilst it seems to be able to find ways to increasingly cut back on government regulation and government servicing, ensures that we continue to maintain Medicare as the top quality health system that it is.

On this basis, the Commonwealth circulates to the States and Territories (through the Standing Committee on Treaties), approximately four times a year, complete schedules of current treaty negotiations and impending treaty action. With this information and the other formal and informal CommonwealthState consultation that occurs in a range of forums (including the Standing Committee of Attorneys&hyphen;General), States and Territories are given the opportunity to examine this issue and to put views on areas of potential conflict to the Commonwealth. Many such matters are resolved in the course of consultation.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that these objectives are valid, and consistent with its own commitment to seek to uphold and promote the principles of liberal democracy where possible, and to encourage, and aid in an active way societies in the process of developing democratic institutions, while recognising that many countries that are important partners of Australia place different 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3368"> interpretations on the nature and meaning of liberal democracy, which will be respected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has committed, through AusAID, A$250,000 per annum for three years to the Institute's core budget from May 1995. This contribution is made in recognition of the synergies between stable democratic government, peace, and equitable economic and social development. International IDEA's work in developing countries will build the local capacity to sustain electoral reform and bolster democracy, providing the stable environment crucial for effective government and sustained growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to its Statutes the Institute consists of a Council, a Nominating Committee, a Board of Directors, a Secretary&hyphen;General, and a Secretariat. The Secretary&hyphen;General is Mr Bengt Sve&hyphen;Sderbergh, a national of Sweden. Australians have since the  Institute's establishment participated directly in all of its main structures. Australia as a member is directly represented on the Council, and the Electoral Commissioner, Mr Bill Gray AM, has led the Australian delegation to the Council on two occasions. Senator Margaret Reynolds is a member of the Nominating Committee, as a representative of Parliamentarians for Global Action, an organisation which is an Associate Member of the Institute. Emeritus Professor Colin Hughes, former Electoral Commissioner, serves in his individual capacity as a member of the Board of Directors. An Australian national is also employed as a Programme Officer in one of the fifteen international staff positions in the Secretariat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has been substantially involved in the development of the Institute's overall work program. As part of the consultation process underpinning that development, the Electoral Commissioner participated in two meetings of the election management bodies of the member States, funded by the Institute, at which priority projects were discussed and identified. An AEC officer, seconded to the Institute at its expense, drafted the working papers that were dealt with at the first of those meetings. An AEC officer also participated as an expert panellist in a roundtable meeting on capacity building, sponsored by the Institute in AugustSeptember 1995, that provided input to the development of the Institute's work program in that field.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AEC has also taken part in a number of major projects within the Institute's work  program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Institute is currently undertaking a substantial cross&hyphen;national study of the administration and cost of elections, the aim of which is to identify optimal and efficient practices in a broad range of areas of electoral administration. It is intended that this will widen the range of alternatives and choices available to electoral administrators, provide complete and systematic information to those who are faced with designing electoral procedures, and support those who provide advisory assistance to election management bodies. An AEC officer is a member of the expert working group that is guiding the project. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Institute is developing a draft Code of Conduct for election observation. The need for such a Code was identified at a roundtable meeting on the subject, organised by the Institute in late 1995, that brought together a wide range of international bodies active in the election observation field. The first draft was prepared by an AEC officer seconded to the Institute specifically to work on the project. Even in its draft form, the Code was held up by those in charge of the observation of the recent elections in Bosnia&hyphen;Herzegovina as a model Code for use in that election. In addition, it was used at the recent elections in Nicaragua, at the instigation of the Electoral Commission in that country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As associated projects, the Institute is developing draft Codes of Conduct for election administration, and for the conduct of political parties during election campaigns. Again, the first drafts have been prepared by an AEC officer seconded to the Institute for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from those listed above, the Institute is pursuing a diverse but practically oriented set of projects, covering at the moment such areas as electoral dispute resolution systems, the support of networks of election administrators, and field co&hyphen;operation for international election observer missions. The Institute anticipates that in 1997 it will be launching projects on electoral technology, the political participation of women, the future of  electoral observation, guidelines pertaining to election observation involvement, and guidelines for the evaluation of free and fair elections. It will also be continuing to develop a joint Institute/United Nations Development Programme Information Network. In the field of capacity building, the Institute undertook in 1996 introductory missions to Kenya, Nicaragua, Romania, and, in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, Nepal. Work has also been done on challenges facing democratic development and electoral processes in Bosnia&hyphen;Herzegovina, Nigeria, and Bangladesh.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More general projects have also been initiated on the nature of democracy, on electoral systems and their design, and on the funding and functioning of political parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Institute is providing a range of information services for its clients, including an Internet home page, a Newsletter, databases, and a range of professional publications and reports. The Institute has on a number of occasions been able to provide Australian clients with information on international best practice in specific areas of election administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, the Institute's activities are expanding. Apart from its activities in Nepal and Bangladesh, it has offered services in the field of electoral assistance to the electoral authorities in Papua New Guinea and Fiji, and has taken a particular interest in the situation in Myanmar as a consequence of the presence of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi on its Board of Directors. It has also agreed to provide funding of $50,000 for a meeting of the election management bodies of South 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3369"> Pacific countries, which the AEC has proposed be held in 1997. It has further indicated its interest in making a substantive continuing commitment to electoral assistance in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the Government notes that the overall level of Australian involvement in the Institute's activities has been substantial, and has given Australia the opportunity to exercise a beneficial influence in the specialised area that is the focus of the Institute's activities. The extent to which its field projects are being conducted in areas of significance to Australia is increasing, and is likely to reach a substantial level in the near future. In the light of these facts, the Government believes that the Institute's activities are deserving of continued support from Australia. The government also notes that there are no provisions in the Agreement by which the Institute was constituted that impinge in any way on Australian sovereignty.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again the minister wants the committee to accept his glib assurances that his people will be watching this matter, but turn down the specific amendment coming from Senator Lees which will ensure that moneys are not given to the states simply to be used for environmental projects which otherwise the states would be funding, while the states move that same amount of money across to other projects, which, of course, can be inimical to the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us be clear here: the minister, presumably supported by Senator Harradine, is going to vote against an amendment which would ensure that the states do not double shuffle this money coming from the Natural Heritage Trust Fund, out of the partial sale of Telstra, and simply use it to fund projects that they were funding anyway so that they have got money to put into other pursuits of their own designation. What is more, there is an amendment here to ensure that there is an agreement, including an undertaking that the states receiving grants do not do anything contrary to the principle of the act. That is pretty clear. If the state is going to get money under the Natural Heritage Trust Fund it does not, at the same time, act in a way that cuts right across the principles of the trust fund in repairing and enhancing Australia's environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But here we have the minister for the environment saying, `I do not want to abide by that; I do not want to tie myself to that. If the states are going to be wrecking the environment and taking money out of this fund to put into repair projects, that is going to be okay. I am certainly not going to be tied down to ensuring that does not happen.' So we have got this absurd situation where under the lax rules in this Natural Heritage Trust 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3371"> Fund, for example, mining corporations can leave environmental degradation behind them and the states can take money out of this fund to fix it up, while at the same time authorising the same mining companies to be going in elsewhere and creating more havoc to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is clearly potentially available. That is what happens in Australia at the moment. We have seen massive funding, in terms of what community groups get, go to cleaning up after mining companies in several states, including Tasmania. That was in the budget last night. Millions of dollars of taxpayers' money repairing the damage that the mining corporations should have been repairing themselves. Instead of that, they put it across into their profit lines and pocket the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But when Senator Lees puts forward an amendment which says, `Let's ensure that does not happen. Let's ensure, at least, that this public money does not go in a way which is throwing good money after bad, does not go to clean up after projects which cause environmental damage and are authorised by state governments,' this Minister for the Environment says, `No, I am not going to allow that stricture to come in.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is reprehensible. That is plain and simple accountability which the minister is thumbing his nose at. That is tantamount to saying to the people of Australia, `If you expect that the Prime Minister meant last year, when he was announcing this fund, that he was actually going to guarantee that it went to top value environmental repair projects, silly you. I am now Minister for the Environment, and I am not going to bind myself by stipulations in this legislation which are going to ensure that the environment gets the best deal.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all, this is the same minister who is authorising the broad scale logging of forests in this country for woodchipping and whole log exports, including forests of national estate and world heritage value; who is authorising the government policy which thumbs its nose at a global effort to bring into control the global warming phenomenon; who is authorising an increase in uranium mining;

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe Senator Harradine will get up and speak for him again. Maybe it will be left to Senator Harradine to try to defend the indefensible. Maybe Senator Harradine&mdash;who is  a stickler for transparency, for due public process and for ensuring that the government spends public dollars in the best directed way possible&mdash;will get up and defend these amendments of Senator Lees which try to do just that, which try to ensure that the states do not double&hyphen;shuffle moneys, so that in effect the Natural Heritage Trust Fund moneys are wasted on projects which ought to be funded by the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe Senator Harradine will get up and say, `Well, it's logical. You are right, Senator Lees.'

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. A certain supercilious note comes into his voice when he says there are other things to be taken into consideration. Like what? Like who has put the biggest funds into the Liberal Party's election campaign monies? Like which electorates they consider are marginal and therefore need to prop up with projects? Like which woodchip company has the best contacts with the minister's office? Like which mining corporation wants to get out of having to do its proper duty and clean up the mess it has left, wherever it might be? What the minister is saying is, `Trust me.' Well I don't, and the further he dismisses any attempt in here at accountability, the less I am inclined to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the opposition and the Democrats are right: the principles of ecologically sustainable development should be taken into consideration and should be paramount and definitive. We should not have them counterbalanced by a clause which says `such other matters as the minister considers relevant', because he has already made it clear in here that, if there is an economic interest at stake against an environmental interest, he will let the environment go down the gurgler. His own actions outside the ambit of this particular legislation demonstrably show that he will put the environment second every time. In fact, in his representations in cabinet, he does not have the environment at the top of his priorities. It will come in a bad second if he is given a chance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I totally support this amendment from the opposition. It cannot do more than restrict the minister, if it were successful, to adopting the principles of ecologically sustainable development. Well, we might say, `Does he understand what that means?' Yes, he does. He absolutely understands what that means. But we might then say, `Well, is he going to faithfully implement the principles of ecologically sustainable development in the disbursement of this fund?'

Should that be a matter?</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME><STATE> (South Australia&mdash;</STATE><ROLE>Minister for the Environment)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(6.23 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is quite a tricky question, actually. The government has made a commitment to ensure that 10 per cent of the fund is expended in Tasmania. We did that on the basis of accepting a number of arguments: firstly, the pre&hyphen;eminent position of Tasmania in relation to Australia's natural heritage; and, secondly, a recognition of the extra burden that Tasmanians have accepted in conserving that natural heritage&mdash;a much greater proportion of the state of Tasmania, for example, is included within the reserve system; and also a recognition that Tasmania does have some extra 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3374"> economic difficulties above and beyond those of certain other states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were the reasons we believed a case a was made out for it, but what we had to do, Senator Harradine, was then ensure that projects consistent with the principles of the act could nevertheless be developed, because that was the constraint in which we had to operate. We were satisfied, after receiving several submissions from the Tasmanian government, that projects of the appropriate quality and within the programs as set out in the act could be developed in Tasmania that would take up 10 per cent of the fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether it is technically a matter that needs to be taken into account in terms of this legislation, as opposed to a background matter&mdash;I am not sure. What I can tell you, Senator Harradine, is that the principles of ecologically sustainable development were never intended to be the exclusive principles upon which money is to be disbursed. What we have committed ourselves to in this bill&mdash;and I think for the  first time&mdash;is to ensure that the principles of ecologically sustainable development are taken into account in determinations. We think that that is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we were saying earlier today, there is not much point in setting up national strategies in relation to these areas if they simply then become another book in the bookshelf; they need to be implemented. In this bill, in appropriating this very large sum to our natural heritage, we are taking those principles into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there may be other factors from time to time that we want to take into account as well. I mentioned the Biodiversity Convention and the national strategy in that area, and the interjections were that it was believed that that would be sufficiently encompassed within the principles of ecologically sustainable development. It may or it may not be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am reminded that we are in the process of developing a national wetlands strategy. We have developed a Commonwealth wetlands policy and each of the states is developing a policy, and we want to integrate all of these into what will be almost a world leader in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> terms of preserving the wetlands of this nation. That strategy we may wish to take into account in the future as well. It is not specifically referred to, of course, in the national strategy for ecologically sustainable development, because the latter was developed before the wetlands strategy. So we do need that bit of flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that it is our objective and it is sensible policy to have that bit of extra flexibility, the question then becomes, Senator Harradine: if this amendment is successful and subclause (b) is removed, what is the consequence of that? We took advice on that from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, and I just read the last paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only way that I can guarantee that the courts will not construe subclause 21(2) as an exhaustive enumeration of the matters for consideration is to include a provision along the lines of paragraph 21(2)(b).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is why the draftsman has included it: to make it clear that the ESD principle was never intended to be an exclusive factor in the determinations to be made under this clause. So  it is a safeguard and, I put it to the committee, a sensible safeguard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some want to review it cynically&mdash;unfortunately that is in the nature of politics&mdash;but that will be watched. There will be the annual reports, the questions in this place and the estimates committees. No doubt, programs that are developed under this fund will be analysed in very great detail and judgments will be made upon that. I do urge the committee to recognise that maintaining that bit of flexibility within this clause is the implementation of sensible policy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think when 1,500 of the world's top scientists, including all those Nobel laureates, say to the world, `Let's do something about this,' we should take it seriously. As I said earlier in this place, if there was an injunction from an equal number of economists warning governments that if they did not change course there would be a collapse on the stock exchange, there would be a frantic rush to change government direction and to head off such an economic outcome. And we would have it on the front pages of the newspapers around the country. But, because the scientist was speaking about the environment and the sustainability of life&mdash;including human life on the planet in the next few decades&mdash;it is a matter of some humour on the coalition benches and they dismiss it as if it is a bit of fun. It must be taken seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have the situation where not only will Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment, on behalf of this government, not confine himself to ecologically sustainable principles in the spending of a very tiny amount of money, compared to government budgets, in the pursuit of environmental enhancement in this country; he will not apply it to this Natural Heritage Trust Fund. He does not want to be confined by that wisdom. He wants the ability to take into account such other matters as he wishes, as might seem proper to him.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of those matters, of course, will involve pressure from those in the corporate sector doing the wrong thing. Not all the corporate sector is doing the wrong thing; some of it is making excellent changes in direction as the increasing alarm about the way the world's environment is going gets through to people with a greater wisdom. Nevertheless, in 1997 in Australia&mdash;and I cannot repeat this often enough&mdash;under the aegis of this government, and particularly authorised by this Minister for the Environment, we have got the greatest rate of destruction of our forests in history and, with that, a tragic impact on the safety of the species richness that this country has. Moreover, we have got rapid, vast, wholesale destruction of native vegetation cover&mdash;up to half a million hectares per annum in Queensland alone&mdash; which parallels that going on in the Amazon Basin and the Taiga forests of Siberia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the minister says he is not going to confine himself to ecologically sustainable principles in spending money on the environment. This is not spending money on the nation as a whole; this is just the environment. He says he is not going to be confined by what the world think tank of scientists says should be our guiding lines in the 1990s. He is not going to be confined by what comes out of the alarm of those people who have the wisdom to look at the world. He says, `I am going to keep doing what we have done in the past and I will not even be confined to environmental principles in spending money on the environment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a farce. What an abject farce. What a disgrace it is that, instead of the minister espousing environmentally sustainable development&mdash;ecologically sustainable development&mdash;he is saying, `I want an out from that. I want to be able to do what I want. I will pay lip&hyphen;service to it but I am not going to be bound by it.' It is reprehensible and the minister knows it. He is, of course, getting ample sustenance and support in this from the Independent senator from Tasmania, Senator Harradine, who has the pivotal vote in enabling him to get away with this&mdash;without, of course, being able to do more than say, `It may be that you will need to abide by a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3376"> commitment to give 10 per cent of this money to Tasmania.' Well and good for Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole of this money spent in Tasmania would not undo the damage that is being occasioned by Senator Hill and his government's licensing of the chainsaws and bulldozers moving in on our natural domain, including world heritage forests, at the moment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think these amendments require some comment and debate in the committee. I will, nevertheless, keep my remarks brief. The government amendments 4 to 6 will be opposed by the opposition. This amendment removes the requirement for the base amount for the financial year that begins on 1 July 2001 to equal 30 per cent of the total amount transferred to the reserve and sets a fixed amount of $300,000 to remain in perpetuity after 1 July 2001.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has increased the amount to be transferred to the trust by $100 million to meet the terms of the arrangements it came to with Senator Harradine. The opposition believes that 30 per cent of this $100 million should be kept in perpetuity, as was originally required. Amending this bill to make it easier for the government to meet what I have described in the past as the Telstra vote deal with Senator Harradine is another example of the trust being manipulated, in my view, for political rather than environmental imperatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of perpetuity, I am somewhat interested in the government's approach, considering the trust expenditure commitments announced last night. How much will remain in the trust at the end of the financial year 2001? I would appreciate a response to that issue from the minister. Is the government on track to have at least $300 million left in the trust?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to government requests 2 and 3, this goes to a crucial issue of the extension of the trust from five to six years. This extends the trust fund from a five-year program to a six-year program but with no extra funding for the sixth year. Last night's budget included no extra money for the trust. In fact, as far as I can see, it robbed $103 million from the trust. The government is about stretching the Telstra money out to 2002. By extending the trust fund over six years, the actual value of funding for the environment and sustainable agriculture to be spent by the trust has been reduced by nearly $50 million a year. I say to the committee that this is a massive dilution 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3378"> of the Natural Heritage Trust. It is an extra year but no extra money&mdash;that is the nub of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night's budget did not deliver on John Howard's environment funding promises. It did not deliver on the funding promises that Mr Howard made when he went for that walk in the forest during the last election campaign. That is the walk in the forest that I was referring to earlier with Senator Brown where, unfortunately, one or two of Senator Brown's close confidantes got sucked in and conned. They swallowed the John Howard line hook, line and sinker. The best example is Mr Alec Marr. It was the greatest environmental sell&hyphen;out in Australia's history. Senator Brown, I know that you have commented on this and I appreciate the points that you have made about what you have said in this debate on this issue, but let us not forget the way this operation worked. It was very disappointing to see people sucked in, conned and manipulated in that way, but I am not a bitter person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I move on to this point, which I hope everyone can embrace, that last night's environment budget was a massive con. This proves it. It has effectively torn asunder the government's electoral mandate. You had at the centre of the coalition's campaign commitment an unqualified promise from the Liberals to provide $1.15 billion over five years to the environment on top of Labor's forward estimates. That is the promise that was made: $1.15 billion for five years, not six years, on top of Labor's proposed environment spending. I see Senator Harradine nodding. I assume that means that he accepts this. This is not an interpretation; this is a reality. This is a fact of life. This is what they said. This is the big con that I am talking about. But of course what the government has done is re&hyphen;badge its existing environment programs and put them under the natural heritage banner. And last night's budget robbed the Natural Heritage Trust of $103 million.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will continue my contribution, Mr Temporary Chairman, which I thought was a rather good one. Let me in fact conclude because the point I am making is that this is an open and shut case of a breach of an election commitment. Let me not dwell on the fact that some in the environment movement swallowed this election commitment. Let me not dwell on that anymore. Let me just say it was a black and white election commitment. It was a pledge from the government, and the government tonight reneges on the commitment as well as reneging on the commitment in terms of the existing programs last night&mdash;the commitment to provide $1.15 billion on top of Labor's forward estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government reneges on its commitment to the Natural Heritage Trust, and now it is further attempting to erode the trust. We in the opposition will not accept this cynical, sleazy fiddling of the books. We are not going to cop that. I have taken it pretty easy through this debate, but I want to place absolutely on the record what a scam from Senator Hill and the government this is. They ought to be exposed for this cynicism, this gross misleading of the Australian people in the election campaign.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3379">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this government will basically do anything it can to weasel out of the commitment that it made to spend $1 billion on the environment over five years. As far as the opposition is concerned&mdash;and I hope other senators will join us&mdash;we are not going to stand by, Senator Hill, and let you abrogate your responsibilities, your commitment to the Australian people during the last election campaign. We will not let you slide away from commitments that you made. That is what are you trying to do&mdash;and you stand exposed and condemned for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend to the committee the knocking over of this proposal, the government requests and amendments, before us&mdash;knock them over, hold the government to its word, hold the government to its commitment. It has shown scant regard for these electoral commitments but often argues the case of electoral mandate&mdash;and it certainly has argued the case of electoral mandate in regard to the Telstra&hyphen;environment link. We heard it ad nauseam, the argument of mandate, when the Telstra partial privatisation was debated in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From your own point of view, if you are going to be consistent, you will continue to argue the electoral mandate of the coalition&mdash;and that is, a properly constituted Natural Heritage Trust Fund, with funding over five years and expenditure over and above that which is contained in Labor's forward estimates. That is what you promised, and I hope the Senate ensures that, on that part&mdash;or on some part&mdash;of the commitments you made, you are held to them. You ought to be.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just clarify the matter, I hope, for the benefit of the committee. It is true that in the last election we promised an expenditure of $1.149 billion over a period of five years. And, although it was difficult to be exact as to how that should be broken down, we nevertheless published indicative figures for each of the five years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We started off, for example, with an indicative figure of $84 million in the first year&mdash;and that is the year that is just completing. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The $1.149 billion was made up of a capital contribution, from our desired intention to sell one-third of Telstra, of $1 billion, then there was an interest component and there was also a component from recurrent expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened subsequent to that is that we have decided to add a further $100 million, so that now the capital contribution to the fund will be $1.1 billion. Together with interest and a contribution from recurrent expenditure, the total expenditure will now be $1.249 billion, plus $300 million which will be left at the completion of this term of the trust. So we have increased the sum very substantially by $100 million. But we have also decided and announced last night that we would prefer to expend the larger sum over six years, one year having just about passed. This means that the balance of the fund would be spent over the next five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were not able to spend in the first year what we had desired. We put in the indicative figure of $84 million&mdash;and I have to say that I am going from memory here. But when in the early stages of our government we re ceived such strong opposition to our intended sale, the government decided that it was irresponsible to advance $84 million up-front without there being any real assurance that we would ever get the capital infusion to repay that sum of $84 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in order to do some preliminary work on the trust, I think we got funding of about $20&hyphen;odd million. Then, when we got the sale of Telstra bill through the Senate, we went back and, through the additional appropriations, we could then speak more comfortably to the government about our wanting to accelerate the planning for the trust, the preliminary work. We got then a total of $41.9 million, which we will have expended. So about half of what we had intended to spend in the first year we spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now looking at a larger overall sum but with a much smaller contribution having been spent in the first year. The question then becomes: how do you responsibly spend the balance? The other thing we have become aware of through this preliminary work is that in a lot of areas around the country of Aus 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3380"> tralia&mdash;although in other areas a lot of the planning work has been done which will enable us to implement programs at an early date&mdash;there is still a great need for planning work before money actually being expended on the ground. It seemed to us as a result that to squeeze the balance of this larger sum of money into just the next four years would not result in the best possible environmental outcome; that it would be a more responsible approach to spend it over five years to allow better planning, where necessary, and the expenditure of the expanded trust fund to achieve, as I said, the optimum environmental outcome. So that is what we are doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We published last night new indicative figures of what we have in mind. They are published at page 3 of the document `Investing in our natural heritage'. Basically, it would mean, under the trust fund, the expenditure in this upcoming financial year of $186.9 million&mdash;and I do not believe that we can responsibly spend more than that consistent with this objective of getting the best environmental outcome&mdash;in the following year of $290 million, and in the years after that of $297 million, $279 million and $152 million respectively, which will leave us with the balance of $300 million. That is what has happened since the time that that original promise was made. What I would suggest to the committee is that what we are now putting before the committee and seeking to put into this legislation is a responsible approach to public expenditure but also an approach that will ultimately achieve the best environmental outcome.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very disappointed with your explanation for this, Minister. Basically, what you are now asking us to accept, after what you have told us as we have been through this bill and after what you have said about sticking to the eight per cent interest to try to maximise funds for Tasmania&mdash;and I agree that they have, compared to their population, larger responsibilities due to the very large reserves that we fortunately have in that part of Australia&mdash;is that you are now saying, `Sorry, it is all going to be absorbed because 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we are going to stretch this out for another year.' That is simply not acceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your only choice, as far as I can see, is to put another year's value into the fund. Surely, after the Telstra money is spent, we will not have a situation where there is nothing to spend on the environment. As you go through the figures in last night's budget you find that we are looking at $152 million for the last year. If that was something like $352 million we might be able to sit around and talk. There would still be some short changing. If you look at the average, we were expecting $230 to $250 million a year to be spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with you that the first year may not have gone as you forecast, but there is no reason why that cannot be put out into years three or four. We do not have to stretch it over into year six and therefore spend less money on the environment. I believe it is a real sleight of hand to suggest that we have to accept a cut of somewhere between $200 and $250 million in terms of spending on the environment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When this plan was announced to the elector ate Mr Costello made a commitment that there would be $223 million spend out of this fund in the coming financial year. What Senator Hill is saying now&mdash;and this includes the Harradine $25 million&mdash;is that in fact there will be $187 million spent this year. The promise to the electorate is being broken to the tune of $36 million if you put the best spin on it. If you were to discount the extra money that Senator Harradine got from the government, you could argue that it is over $60 million. It is at least $36 million that is not going to go into the environment because Senator Hill and the government have broken their election commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me for a moment go back to what Senator Faulkner had to say when you traduced the name of Alec Marr. I have said it before in this place that Alec Marr is amongst one of those citizens who has gone to extraordinary lengths in their lifetime to stand up for the environment. I was at Farmhouse Creek when Mr Marr sat for not just days but weeks in a huge eucalypt tree which was the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3381"> target of the chainsaws and bulldozers of the then Liberal government of Tasmania led by Robin Gray.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although that tree was not saved and although the logging industry, with the full backing of the Liberals of the day, bust in vigilantes to assault environmentalists&mdash;and many were hurt on that particular occasion and the tree was ultimately destroyed&mdash;Alec Marr amongst many others kept on fighting and campaigning peacefully for those forests until years later they were protected as world heritage. He is one of those stirling people committed to the environment like those people currently sitting in the Giblett block in Western Australia because the Minister for the Environment sitting in here tonight has failed in his duty to protect part of the National Estate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along comes a Liberal promise to do better by the environment in the name of Prime Minister Howard March 12 months ago and in the wake of a pretty poor performance by the then Keating government which in turn in the wake of the loggers illegally circling Parliament House had gone to water and ordered vast tracts of the National Estate and, remarkably, important forests to be given across to the woodchip companies. That is just what happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said as an aside to Senator Faulkner, if you cannot believe the last opposition and if it was a reprehensible thing to believe the last opposition when you had a government that was failing in terms of its environmental responsibilities, is he not simply saying that next time around the opposition should not be believed either? Citizens have a right to expect that those who make promises at election time, in this case on the environment, will keep those promises. Not only is the promise that is inherent in this Natural Heritage Trust Fund being defrauded here today as this minister repeatedly sells out his obligations to ensure that the money is, under the terms of this legislation, for priority spending for the environment but it is very clearly and specifically being breached by this attenuation of the spending period from five to six years.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a clever little trick by Senator Hill. What a nasty little way to defraud the environment: instead of spending what you said you would spend, you take $36 million out of that obligation and put it over to some hypothetical future use. We must expect that further down the line there will be changes again to the way in which this Natural Heritage Trust Fund is established and the way its funds will be disbursed. One can only conjecture as to why they want to make it six years instead of five. We have not heard an explanation for that from Senator Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He did try to say that he could not get his act in order and that he was not prepared to risk spending the necessary money because last year he could not get the guarantee that was later forthcoming from Senator Harradine that the legislation for the part sale of Telstra would get passage through this Senate. But he knew early on that it would; the deal was struck with Senator Harradine and the legislation went through. All he is saying is that he could not get his act together. He did not have the commitment and the wherewithal, and he did not give the environment the priority that was required of him to meet the Prime Minister's commitment to the people of this country that the money would be spent in  the coming year on the environment according to the formula promised by Treasurer Costello.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are led to believe that $36 million is being filched out of that fund to be spent in future years. No doubt the government thinks that it is going to get away with that in the Senate. I predict that it will not. l predict that even Senator Harradine is not going to accept this manipulation of this fund in a way which, because Senator Harradine got a better deal for Tasmania, will specifically impact on the expectations of Tasmanians, who, as the minister himself said, have a particular claim to government regard because of the enormous importance of the natural heritage in the island state.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make one last attempt to try to explain why this can actually lead to a better environmental outcome. I will respond very briefly to Senator Brown, who made the point and was very critical of the fact that, under this amended program that we think more accurately reflects the expenditure necessary to maximise the environment outcome, we would be spending less in this next year than what we had originally intended. I draw to his attention that in the following year, after the programs have had that extra year of development, we are actually spending considerably more than what we promised. If he adds up the funding expenditure intentions for the next two years and compares them with what was promised way back in the election he will find that they are not, in fact, very different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the government's view that we can get a better environmental outcome. We are not just spending money for the sake of spending money; we are spending money to achieve the best environmental outcome within the terms of the objects and purposes of this bill, which reflects the objects and purposes of the trust. It is our view, now that we have had a year to spend on the planning to working up each of the major capital projects&mdash;the revegetation project, the coast and clean seas project, further work on the national reserve, further work on the land and water audit&mdash;that a lot more work needs to be done in terms of planning in the earlier stages to achieve the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> maximum output on the ground in the later stages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To squeeze all of that into the next four years we do not believe will produce as good an environmental outcome as spending it over the next five years. It is true that it will take a little longer but in our view we get a better outcome. We do not really see the term of the trust in quite the same way as some others see it here because we intend it to be a trust in perpetuity. We do not claim that we are going to fix this problem in four or five years. What we have done to reflect our recognition that there is a need for a major ongoing program is to ensure that there is $300 million left available at the end of this term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That will be a base, hopefully, that will be built upon by the government of the then day to continue the task of restoring the health of Australian's natural environment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I believe that BHP has made a commercial decision to cease integrated steel making in Newcastle, I deplore the timing of the announcement. It was actually an insult to the parliament of Australia because we did have an unfinished bipartisan steel inquiry still in process at the time of the announcement. The inquiry had finished its work in terms of visiting all the steel plants where we were accompanied by BHP officials but we were yet to report to the minister the result of those inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senior BHP officials gave no indication at all to the government that they were about to make that decision. It was really a snub to the government and a snub to the parliamentary committee. The steel committee did meet earlier today with Ron McNeilly, the chair of BHP Steel, and we put this point very strongly to him at the time. We also called on the need for BHP to be a bit more forthcoming in the way they proposed to deal with the site from this time on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BHP Steel started on this site in 1915. The plan before BHP came along was actually to make it a botanical gardens. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would take 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some effort in terms of site restoration to bring it back to being suitable for a botanical gardens. But it is certainly prime industrial land right on the harbour&mdash;the sort of thing which the world has a great shortage of&mdash;and it could be a very attractive site for future industry. We believe BHP has a moral obligation to lay down a plan, the timing, the costing and what they intend to do about cleaning up that site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This decision by BHP will have a major impact on the Hunter; 2,500 direct jobs will go and another 1,000 contract jobs will go. The one small bright light in the BHP announcement was that they were going to relocate and upgrade the wire plant making facility, therefore locating all the long product and wire division in Newcastle. But this would represent only about 150 jobs as against a drop of 2,500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must clarify for the Senate something that is widely misunderstood by the public. People keep talking about the closure of steel in Newcastle. What is closing down, of course, is the smelting of steel in Newcastle, where most of the jobs are. But what is very important for the downstream industries is that steel will continue to be rolled in Newcastle. Of course, the engineering divisions which rely on this product downstream are very dependent on that. So even though the impact is great, it could have been a lot worse if BHP had decided to shut the plant totally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the deplorable hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this matter. They come to this debate with no credibility at all, particularly after the failed Button steel plan.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why it has all scaled down so drastically over this time, particularly since the Labor government came to power in 1993, was the very poor investment climate created by Labor in the 1980s. There was no upgrade of steel making in Newcastle. There were some patch&hyphen;up and fix&hyphen;up jobs. They shed 10,000 jobs, they lost $144 million and, under Labor, there was a massive decline. Their export performance fell away and, even though they did spend money at Port Kembla on building a new blast furnace, they just relined the old Newcastle plant. The incentive was not there under Labor's last scheme to save the steel industry in Newcastle.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to speak tonight about the issue of car tariffs and South Australia, the car industry in Australia and industry policy. I do not want to get diverted by the remarks of Senator Tierney talking about Newcastle. What his remarks showed is that this government has no industry policy at all. We had the disgusting spectacle of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) preferring to be at the opening of the Melbourne casino than in Newcastle addressing and talking to people about the BHP closure and the loss of 2,500 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not want the same thing to happen to the car industry in South Australia as John Howard and John Moore let happen to the steel industry in Newcastle. As a result, last Friday, and on Monday of this week, I was in Japan, representing the federal parliamentary Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, with Mr Mike Rann, the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, explain 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing to the Japanese companies that are involved in the car industry in South Australia what our tariff policy is and why we want them to continue to invest in the car industry in South Australia in particular, and in Australia, and why our tariff policy gives them the certainty that they can invest well into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made it clear that at the state level the Liberal Party and the Labor Party have a bipartisan view about the tariff issue for the car industry. Unfortunately, we had to explain that the Liberal government here in Canberra has no policy; it keeps dithering and deferring any decision&mdash;which we think it should have made some time ago&mdash;to reject the idiocy in the Productivity Commission's recommendation that tariffs be reduced to five per cent for the car industry by the year 2005.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We outlined our policy: when tariffs get to 15 per cent by the year 2000 they would not go lower than that and would certainly be guaranteed to remain at 15 per cent until the year 2005; there would be a review in 2003 and 2004; and a look at any further reduction would only occur if our competitors in other APEC economies were also reducing their tariffs to the same level as we have in Australia, so that there was a fair and even, level playing field. We made that very clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also made it very clear that we support the retention of the export facilitation scheme to encourage our car industry to continue its very successful program of exporting cars and  car components from Australia, and particularly from South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Friday of last week we met a major delegation from the Mitsubishi Motor Corporation led by Mr Kuromizu, the executive vice&hyphen;president of that company for their worldwide operations. He made their views very clear to us, in a presentation he gave us, by saying in conclusion that tariffs on passenger motor vehicles and components at 15 per cent ought to be maintained until at least 2005, and that either the export facilitation scheme ought to be maintained to post&hyphen;2000 or comparable levels of support to automotive exporters introduced. They made it clear that both those things are needed and, if they do 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3386"> not get that decision, they will review and not proceed with a $440 million investment for the next generation Verada and Magna in South Australia&mdash;a decision they have to make no later than January 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that decision is not made, that will be the end of manufacturing by Mitsubishi in South Australia and Australia by early next century. They also said that, if there was a decision not to maintain tariffs and the export facilitation scheme at the present level, they would then look at another country within APEC to manufacture their cars and, of course, export them into Australia. Mr Kuromizu made it very clear and said, in English&mdash;he did not use a translator&mdash;`And we are not bluffing.' I have to say to those who have had dealings over time with Japanese officials and senior business people, who are usually very polite and formal in these meetings, that for him to use English and to use a phrase that we all understand in Australia was very significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also met with the Bridgestone company, which has a major tyre and car component manufacturing operation in Adelaide. We met with a Mr Uchiyama, who is the vice&hyphen;president of their international tyre operation and his phrase was very simple: if the tariffs go below 15 per cent in the year 2000 it would be fatal for their investment and fatal for their car component manufacturing in Adelaide, and it would be a very serious blow to their tyre manufacturing. Both these companies spoke politely, bluntly and firmly about the importance of getting the correct decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We indicated what the Labor Party policy is. We outlined it very clearly. They welcomed our decision. I have to say that I suspect they are at the moment quite perplexed that this federal government will not make a decision and has let it drag on. They also noted that Mr Hashimoto, the Japanese Prime Minister, when visiting Australia only two weeks ago, publicly raised the issue of the tariff policy and the importance of the investment of the Japanese car industry in Australia. So even at that level, during a state visit, it has been raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also had the opportunity to meet with Vice&hyphen;Minister Ueno of the Ministry of Inter 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> national Trade and Industry and explain our policy on tariffs, which he noted and welcomed. He understood our position and the importance of Japanese investment in car manufacturing in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also took the opportunity on behalf of the Labor Party to completely reject the mad ideas of Pauline Hanson, who is calling for an end to foreign investment, calling for high tariffs and making unbelievably outrageous remarks about the possible `Asianisation' of Australia. I noticed that when I made those remarks at the MITI meeting in Japan their officials took it all down very seriously. They knew about the debate. What particularly alarmed me over the weekend in Tokyo was that in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Japanese Times</EMPHASIS> English version they had reprinted the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bangkok Post</EMPHASIS> editorial about the Hanson issue. I understand they had also on a day before, though I did not see it, reproduced a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> editorial on Pauline Hanson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For anyone to say that she is not creating damage to Australia's long-term interests&mdash;particularly when we are trying to convince the Japanese Mitsubishi and Bridgestone companies to maintain their investment in the long term for jobs and economic wealth in Australia&mdash;when she says, `We don't want foreign investment,' is the height of economic lunacy. I think it is incumbent upon all of us at all times in the Labor Party and the Liberal Party and the National Party to reject completely the madness from Pauline Hanson. It is doing us significant damage overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I appeal to this government to rapidly make a sensible decision on car tariffs within the next few weeks. They need to get on with the job so that we can guarantee the long-term future of thousands of jobs in Adelaide, Melbourne and Geelong in our car industry. If we lose the manufacturing of Mitsubishi and Bridgestone in South Australia and then General Motors, it will be a major blow to the economy of South Australia and put tens of thousands of people out of work. This is an issue that is a matter for South Australia. It is a life and death economic issue. This federal government must accept its responsibility and support South Australia but,

This nation is built on the back of the legal fallacy that is terra nullius&mdash;that is, that no-one was here when the white settlers arrived.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal people did occupy this land in 1788 and had for tens of thousands of years. They respected this land. They cared for it. Their spiritual beliefs are centred upon it. They obtained all they needed from the land and their dreamings arose from and embraced this land. So it is almost inconceivable that the new arrivals could have so ignored their presence, could have legally overridden the presence of the indigenous inhabitants without any acknowledgment of their rights or even the fact that they were actually occupying the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As inconceivable as this may be, this is the history of our nation. It is this history that has created the chasm that exists between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. Reconciliation was to be the process of acknowledging this history and seeking through active measures to restore to indigenous Australians some of that which has been stolen from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fight to stop the bridge to Kumarangk on Hindmarsh Island has been taken up and led by indigenous women&mdash;not just the Ngarrindjeri women but also their sisters from other indigenous nations. It has become a symbol of the division between non-indigenous greedy development on the one hand and the beliefs of indigenous women on the other. Ngarrindjeri women have told us of the spiritual significance of Kumarangk and what it means to them. Did we listen? No. Non-indigenous Australians knew better. Non-indigenous Australians sought a factual, plausible, specific and unanimous base for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these spiritual beliefs before they would listen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How well would Christianity hold up to such scrutiny? How many loaves of bread did Jesus create out of nothing? Should we hold a royal commission to examine that? How many days after he died was he resurrected? Should we hold an inquiry to examine that? Is there no variation amongst the Anglican and Catholic Australians as far as their support or understanding of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible</EMPHASIS> is concerned? Is it accepted that within a religion or a spiritual group there will be unanimous, unequivocal, unquestioning acceptance of all their stories and beliefs? Only for some, it seems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The women of the SOPHIA Justice Circle&mdash;a group of Catholic women who are fighting for the rights of Aboriginal women in Adelaide&mdash;have provided a strong dissenting voice in the midst of this ongoing debate over Kumarangk. The Sisters of Mercy in Adelaide have worked hard to support the Ngarrindjeri women. The Kumarangk Coalition has brought together a cross-section of people&mdash;mostly South Australians, many of them from the Goolwa area&mdash;to fight for the Aboriginal women and to fight for the protection of the island and the Coorong that lies beyond. These three groups have taken part in the long march and are now preparing for the long sit-in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has not always been easy to stand up to the backlash against indigenous spirituality and indigenous culture in general. Nonetheless, these people have done so, and I congratulate them for their courage and commit ment in the face of adversity. Their determination to continue to support the women and to protect Kumarangk is an inspiration for all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I am pleased to publicly associate myself with their efforts and to say that the Australian Democrats vehemently oppose the building of this bridge. It is an attack directly on the spiritual beliefs of indigenous people. It is an attack on the process of reconciliation. It is an attack on the very land that we are fortunate to occupy now. This attack must be resisted, and I and the Democrats will con 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3388"> tinue to do so. Such an attack on other religious groups in this country would, I suspect, not be tolerated at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So how is it that this nation has adopted the findings of a royal commission which has carried out this attack without the involvement of those women who specifically hold these beliefs? The royal commission was a sham. Its findings were a sham, and I now suspect that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge may be constructed as a result of this sham.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is much work to be done if Aboriginal people are to feel at home in their own land. The constitution needs to be amended to reflect their presence here. The national anthem needs to be rewritten so that indigenous people have a place in it or that we at least remove the word `young', for people have been here a long time. It is time to correct our history, to base our written history on facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court's decision on native title has begun that rewrite, but it is a very small step in the correction of the history of this nation. Terra nullius has been legally laid to rest. However, the battle is far from over. The battle against the Hindmarsh Island Bridge is but another small step in the process of reconciliation&mdash;another step in the fight to protect the limited native title rights of indigenous people and to ignore the greed and self-interest of a few developers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court's decision on native title was a very limited recognition of native title, although you would never believe that from listening to some of those recently commenting in the media. It was, on its own, a very narrow window of recognition of land rights for indigenous people. Yet this government seeks to obliterate even these slender rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wik decision was actually in favour of the pastoralists, ensuring that their rights, if there was any conflict, took precedence over native title rights. I state here tonight&mdash;and I am saying this personally&mdash;that I strongly oppose this government's attempts to water down and, in fact, extinguish the already weak native title rights as recognised by the High Court.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The women of SOPHIA are absolutely correct in their view that Australia will be shamed in the eyes of the world if the government legislates to extinguish native title on pastoral leases. I believe the government is being held to ransom by a number of interested parties, including its coalition partner, the National Party, and those farmers who have a vested interest in getting their land converted to freehold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the broader picture? What about the agenda of reconciliation that was a commitment of the Hawke government in the 1980s and that this government has committed itself to? What about the views of those Australians who believe that it is time for this country to recognise its indigenous inhabitants?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, I thank SOPHIA, those women of the Catholic Church in Adelaide who have organised this group. I thank the Kumarangk Coalition who have done a lot of the work bringing together the various parties who are interested in these issues. I thank the Sisters of Mercy, particularly Sister Janet Mead, and indeed all those who are working so hard for reconciliation and working to stop the Hindmarsh Island Bridge.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak briefly about Australia's foreign aid program. There are always perennial questions about whether Australia's program does enough to alleviate the plight of the poor living in our region in abject poverty, where hunger is indeed a grim reality. Equally compelling is the often asked question of how Australia can most effectively deliver the assistance it provides to recipient countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has always acknowledged the importance of an effective aid program and, upon coming to office in 1996, commissioned an independent review of Australia's overseas aid program through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Alexander Downer. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3389"> resulting report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One clear objective</EMPHASIS>, chaired by Mr Paul Simons, more commonly referred to as the Simons report, attempts to address some of the funding inconsistencies which have plagued the foreign aid program during the last decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fundamentally, Simons suggests that Australia's aid program is in need of renewal as opposed to fundamental change or dramatic overhaul. It raises the question: if the 1980s was the lost decade for development, has Australia the capacity to deliver more effective solutions to better respond to world poverty in the 1990s and beyond? I suggest that the obvious and fundamental issues to be addressed in the wake of the Simons review are why, where, how, and how much aid Australia should provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first comprehensive review of foreign aid in 13 years, Simons identifies the primary goal of the aid program as humanitarian&mdash;to reduce poverty through sustainable development. This goal of primary humanitarian focus is in line with community support, with 81 per cent of 2,011 surveyed responses in the most recent Roy Morgan research poll in May 1994 believing that aid should go to the very poor countries to respond to the priority areas of natural disasters, health promotion, basic needs and human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Simons report states that the primary motivation for providing aid is to help those less well off than ourselves. This is a laudable aim. But with this principle comes the need to address the extent to which the aid program can meet multiple objectives and whether it is possible and/or desirable to pursue compatible objectives through the aid program without distorting its primary focus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The employment of a singular objective of poverty reduction to direct the provision of Australian aid raises four main questions. Firstly, whilst a primary goal of the aid program might be to reduce poverty reduction through sustainable development, this needs to be defined with measured and identifiable parameters within a specific time frame. Secondly, is it possible to isolate poverty reduction as a singular objective of the aid program when, in practice, questions such as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> human rights, geographical distribution, sectoral concentration and good governance influence the decision making process? Thirdly, is this singular objective of poverty reduction through sustainable development appropriate, given that the aid program can deliver a range of different outcomes such as those relating to Australia's engagement in the region and other policy interests, as well as assistance to Australian industry? Fourthly, to what degree are trade&hyphen;offs between different interests inevitable anyway?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One fundamental issue examined by the Simons review was how best to ensure the maximum effectiveness of the Australian aid program. Although the committee was alarmed by the proportion of Australian aid tied to the procurement of Australian goods and services, the report conceded that there is no mechanism to verify reported levels of tied aid and concludes therefore that the proportion of Australian tied aid may be overstated in relation to other donor countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implication of breaking down the number of contracts per company or firm is that tied aid&mdash;similar to allegations about the former development import finance facility or DIFF scheme&mdash;has resulted in a concentration of benefits to a few select firms rather than net gains to the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But given that there has been no comprehensive and authoritative study relating to the costs of tying Australian aid, the determination of the fate of tied aid is akin to stabbing in the dark. If you cannot measure the economic impact of tied aid, how can it be either supported or abandoned one way or the other?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst supporting the principle of micro&hyphen;credit financing, it is disappointing indeed that the Simons report does not acknowledge in  any way the role of women in maximising development benefits in this form of aid delivery. Micro&hyphen;credit has been firmly placed on the world's aid agenda following the International Micro&hyphen;Credit Summit held in Washington in February 1997. The preliminary analysis suggests overwhelmingly that targeting women in micro&hyphen;finance activities in developing countries results in significant multiplier effects as well as immeasurable benefits to the woman's immediate family&mdash;

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leaving issues of the relationship between aid and development unexplored, most commentary since the Simons report was brought out seems to concentrate in relation to foreign aid on the overstated question of `How much?' rather than `What for?' I suggest that those questions are ordered wrongly. In logical terms, the answer to `What for?' should determine the ballpark figure `How much?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the wake of the Year of the Eradication of Poverty, it is appropriate and timely for the Simons review to reflect on the progress made to eradicate world poverty and Australia's contribution to meeting this goal both now and in the future. I welcome the period of public consultation invited as a result of the report, welcome the fact that comment has been called for, and look forward to the valuable input of NGOs, industry groups and indeed other stakeholders in Australia. It is an important question and, as I said, it is a timely matter for us all to consider.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="3390"><TITLE>Telecommunications: Electromagnetic Radiation</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight on a matter with which Senator Alston says I am obsessed. No doubt, Senator Alston and those in the telecommunications industry who have his ear would like to silence me and others who speak out on the issue of the potential for electromagnetic radiation to detrimentally affect the health of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do not have an obsession; what I do have is a deep disquiet about the reluctance of the government to do anything but persistently try to discredit research findings on this issue. I must say that this increasingly futile endeavour has quite the opposite effect on the Democrats and many others who are starting to ask why it is that a government which is supposed to act to protect public health should act in such a defensive manner and ignore its responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far from being silenced, I want to talk at greater length another time about the research study conducted in Sydney and published last 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> week. Of course, this study found an increased incidence of cancer in mice after their regular exposure to digital mobile phone emissions. This was a study which the industry and the government have been at pains to discredit as irrelevant to humans, even thought it was commissioned by Telstra, who presumably are not in the business of selling phones to mice. But I do not want to trivialise this issue by making silly jokes about mice using mobile phones. The government might find that amusing but we do not. I will speak later about the details of that study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I want to again appeal to the government and to the industry to adopt the `precautionary principle' when it comes to wireless communications equipment and infrastructure. In its web site, Senator Alston's department says that it is not prepared to adopt the precautionary principle because:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no substantiated evidence that exposure to EMR from mobile phone towers will have an adverse health effect.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Earlier in that document it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The precautionary principle is based on the knowledge that some thing or action will have an actual or potential effect.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I understand it, the research data showing biological effects&mdash;and therefore potential health effects&mdash;is quite substantial. I have already listed such data in this place. Even the Australian Radiation Laboratories information officer has recently been quoted in a Melbourne newspaper as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there plainly are non&hyphen;thermal effects, but it is difficult to interpret them to the extent of including them in the standard setting procedures.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The same officer, while touring Australia with the telecommunications roadshow in February this year, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are clearly some sort of athermal effects around.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If I am not much mistaken, there is a contradiction here. On the one hand, Senator Alston's department is stipulating that adoption of the precautionary principle is based upon knowledge of a potential effect&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Telstra has advised that it has no plans to remove the base station at Mt Kuring&hyphen;Gai.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) It does not follow that the presence of a telephone base station represents an effective subsidy of telecommunications carriers by private property owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The Government has considered the issue of concerns about the potential for reduced property values in residential areas near telecommunications infrastructure generally. We have decided that it is not possible to introduce an appropriate regime&mdash;principally because the difficulty of appraising any loss of value which individual property owners might have suffered. In particular, since telecommunications facilities are installed throughout the community it is difficult to conclude that property owners near such facilities have been singled out for discriminatory treatment of a kind which would found a case for compensation.</PARA>
