<para>âThis legislation, the <inline ref="R2228">Australian Passports Bill 2004</inline>, was introduced in the last parliament, along with the <inline ref="R2226">Australian Passports (Application Fees) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2219">Australian Passports (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill 2004</inline>. However, the legislation had not passed through the parliament before its prorogation and so it was reintroduced in the new parliament in December last year. This is our next opportunity to debate this legislation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Two of the bills are unchanged since their previous introduction, while the Australian Passports Bill 2004 has been amended in a minor way. The Australian Passports Bill 2004 replaces the Passports Act 1938âand it is probably high timeâand provides an entirely new passports act. It repeals Australian passports provisions in the 1938 act.</para>
<para>In a time of international terror, the maintenance of a world-class passports system is a key national security issue. Effective border security is part of the first line of defence in a strategic environment where threats may take the form of a lone individual or individuals, rather than the militarised conflicts we more normally associate with national security. Thus the Australian Passports Bill 2004 sets up a modern legal structure which will do a number of things. Firstly, it will provide Australian citizens with the best possible passports. Secondly, it will provide a passport law to complement national security, border protection and Australian law enforcement measures, as well as international law enforcement cooperation. And, thirdly, it will provide consistency with family law, privacy and administrative law principles.</para>
<para>The Australian Passports (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill repeals superseded provisions of the 1938 act and renames that act the Foreign Passports (Law Enforcement and Security) Act 2004. This legislation makes the following improvements to the law governing Australian travel documents. Firstly, it provides, for the first time, a clear statement that Australian citizens have the right to a passport. Secondly, it increases the penalties for passport fraud to 10 years imprisonment or fines totalling $110,000. Thirdly, it introduces a framework for the use of technologyâand later we can talk about the current technological advancements in this area. Fourthly, it will establish that disputes between parents regarding the international travel of minors should be dealt with by the courts. Fifthly, it improves refusal or cancellation mechanisms on law enforcement grounds or if a person is likely to engage in harmful conduct. Sixthly, it attempts to ameliorate problems caused by lost and stolen passportsâit tries to overcome the difficulties that people have when passports are either lost or stolenâand in that instance it will provide a much better outcome for customers. Seventhly, it introduces various privacy measures, such as increased transparency in obtaining information for the verification of identity and citizenship and it regulates the disclosure of passport information for other limited purposes.</para>
<para>The bill also sets out the following major changes: first, it empowers the minister to make determinations regarding methods or technologies for identification or other purposes under the bill; secondly, it changes the framework and procedures by which passports may be refused or cancelled; thirdly, it creates new offences and enhances penalties; and, fourthly, it establishes new measures in regard to the use of information and associated privacy procedures.</para>
<para>You can see from the range of changes that they are not small changes. These changes ensure the modernising of the passports system in Australia. They provide in total a better position. Therefore, Labor supports the measures. The new bills include an amendment sought by Labor to division 2, clause 47 of the <inline ref="R2116">Australian Passports Bill 2004</inline>. There is always an opportunity for Labor to not only examine and agree to contents but also suggest improvements. It is worthwhile mentioning at this point that the government has picked up on the improvements that Labor has put forward.</para>
<para>This amendment refers to the authorisation by the minister of the use of particular methods and technologies as they apply to passports. That ministerial determination must now specify the nature of the personal information to be collected and the purpose for which it may be used. This is to build community confidence that personal information will be protected, while allowing for the adoption of new technologies such as biometrics. I suspect over the years we will hear more about biometrics and their use in identifying individuals. It is one of those areas that is important to get right at the beginning so we do not end up in a position where it becomes unclear whether personal information can be collected and what uses are appropriate. We need to make sure that it is adapted for the purposes it is supposed to be used for.</para>
<para>The integration of such technologies into the Australian passports system is necessary to ensure that our passports system not only provides maximum protection but can also integrate with other systems being adopted around the world. These are not simply advancements that are occurring within Australia. There have also been advancements overseas in ensuring that travel documents identify the individual, remain secure to the individual and are protected from being copied or otherwise used unlawfully. Australia has to maintain vigilance in this area to ensure that we are within worldâs best practice. The Australian Passports Bill also includes certain changes from the original bill in regard to the cancellation of passports. I will not discuss them here. Suffice it to say that Labor supports those changes.</para>
<para>There have also been changes in regard to privacy provisions. The first clarifies arrangements for requesting information from private sector organisations. The second removes the specific reference to disclosure of passport information for national security purposes. That particularly relates to clause 46(d), which is an area covered specifically by the Privacy Act. In another change from the previous bill, the government has attempted to align this legislation more closely with administrative law principles, which in my view is always a good thing. The <inline ref="R2115">Australian Passports (Application Fees) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2219">Australian Passports (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill 2004</inline> remain unchanged.</para>
<para>We support the proposed amendments in the Australian Passports Bill 2004, reintroduced into the House of Representatives on 2 December and now available for debate in the Senate. We believe that the delay of several months in the passage of the legislation, and the refinement that it has allowed, will provide a better legal framework for Australian travel documents. I would like to concur with my colleague in the other House Kevin Rudd, the shadow minister for foreign affairs and international security, that it is unfortunate that these improvements would not have occurred had it not been for the proroguing of parliament.</para>
<para>Simply put, the additional time, closer scrutiny and willingness to compromise has produced a much better document in the end. It is certainly a much better bill and has thus been able to gain our support. This legislation has been improved through closer examination and, I believe, will serve the Australian people better than the original proposal. So Labor supports the passage of this legislation and the modernisation of our passports law to reflect contemporary needs. It is long overdue. We support it as an attempt to strengthen our national security structures and to provide a better service to the Australian public.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to this package of legislation to do with Australian passports. The <inline ref="R2116">Australian Passports Bill 2004</inline>, the <inline ref="R2115">Australian Passports (Application Fees) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2219">Australian Passports (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill 2004</inline> are important. They update the laws covering the issuing and cancellation of passports and administrative matters relating to passports, including fees. The legislation is thus welcome.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The bills cover a number of different areas, as Senator Ludwig has just outlined. There are changes to the methods and technologies for identification in relation to passports that are aimed at combating identity fraud, which is not just the production of fraudulent documents. Identity theft is certainly an area that needs continued vigilance, with most people thinking it is more important to ensure that a passport really belongs to the person holding it. Updating the laws to enable better effectiveness in addressing identity fraud is certainly a goal that the Democrats and, I expect, all Australians are supportive of.</para>
<para>The key question is how you do that: what powers you give to the minister, the government or the department and whether those powers are appropriate and whether the protections in place are adequate. Certainly, some privacy questions arise that I will touch on shortly. There are issues to do with the grounds for refusal and cancellation of passports, and issues to do with the criminal offences relating to travel documentsâincluding increasing penalties, fines and maximum terms of imprisonment in relation to those offences. There are also aspects of the bill which enable the minister to obtain various pieces of personal information for a range of purposes. The general goals of the bills are something that most people would be very supportive of. The key questionâand part of the important role of the Senate is to answer thisâis whether it achieves those goals in a way that is going to be as effective as possible and that ensures sufficient protections for the Australian public.</para>
<para>When giving a minister, or indeed anybody, power over peopleâs information and details, we should always ask whether those powers are necessary and whether the protections surrounding the use of those powers are adequate. This broader issue is something that has been raised in relation to this legislation because of its ability to enable biometrics to be used as part of passports in the future. As I understand it, the bill does not specifically mention biometric technology, but I think the Minister for Foreign Affairs made it clear that there is an intention that the bill will provide for the introduction of facial recognition or photo-matching technology and, potentially, other technology down the track.</para>
<para>It is important to emphasiseâand I draw on comments which the former Privacy Commissioner, Mr Malcolm Crompton, made in an address about biometrics and privacy he gave to the Biometrics Institute Conference in Sydneyâthat there are strong arguments in favour of the use of biometrics from a privacy perspective, as well as strong arguments or cautions against it. What really matters is the protections surrounding it. The technology itself is not inherently bad or inherently good, as with any of the other technologies that are currently used. In many respects, at least in terms of the initial likely usage of this, it is probably not going to be particularly different from the current situation of facial or photo matching via the use of photographs that are providedâand, as anybody who has applied for a passport would know, a photograph is one of the things you have to provide. We already use biometrics in a range of areas in Australia, and some of the key considerations that are involvedâand these are things that Mr Crompton flaggedâare bodily privacy in the collection of biometrics, openness and choice in the collection of biometrics, the potential for data linkage and function creep, and the potential for that information to act as a universal unique identifier.</para>
<para>In terms of what the government or minister is likely to use the updated and clarified powers under this new legislation for, it is not particularly likely that concerns are going to be raised as part of that. But concern does need to be raised about its potential future usage. This is an important question and principle that will need to be highlighted far more specifically into the future, given that the single greatest protection for the rights and freedoms of Australians is about to be lostâthe independence of the Senate. From 1 July the government will have control of the Senate. It will mean they will be able to push through any changes to legislation they like. They will be able to push through any regulations they like. Until that situation changes back again and there is some degree of independent scrutiny of what the government does in the future, then it makes it all the more vital that any powers that are given to a minister or a department have enough protections already built into the legislation to ensure that the powers cannot be misused down the track by not just this government but any future government of any political persuasion. That is why it is appropriate to raise concerns about what powers might be used for in the future, even though the current minister can give, and indeed has to some extent given, satisfactory commitments about what the powers will be used for with photo-matching technology in the immediate future.</para>
<para>Extra uses can be brought in in future via regulation and, as senators would know but perhaps the public does not, regulations or secondary legislation is far less adequate in terms of guaranteeing proper parliamentary and public scrutiny. Similarly, regulations cannot be overturned if the government has control of the Senate unless there is a sudden outbreak of genuine independence amongst government senatorsâand I will believe that when I see it. So that basic principle is one that applies not just to this bill but to every bill the Senate passes from now on. Every Senate committee will certainly need to closely examine every piece of legislation to determine not just what the government of today will use the powers contained in the legislation for but whether there are protections built into the legislation against a future government using those powers for means that may be less benign or positive.</para>
<para>For the record, my view is that in most respects the changes and the aims that are contained in this legislation are positive measures. Measures that reduce the chances of identity theft and identity fraud are clearly very positive. Measures that reduce the ability of criminals, terrorists or whoever to obtain false passports or misrepresent themselves as somebody else should be supported but, as I and other Democrats have repeatedly said in this chamber, we have to be very careful to make sure that, in bringing in necessary changes, we do not also put in place extra discretionary powers for a minister that will allow freedoms to be taken away in the future unless a clear justification is given.</para>
<para>I make those comments more as a broad statement of principle about the general need to ensure that there are checks and balances on the discretion and power of any government minister. The statements are not an attack, or anything of the sort, on this government or the current minister. They are a statement of principle about the way our system of government is meant to function. It is a system of checks and balances where no one individual will have too great a concentration of power with too little scope for independent accountability, for oversight of how those powers are used and for limitations on those powers being expanded without further scrutiny and further agreement from an independent source. That system of checks and balances is now much more at risk with the loss of the independence of the Senate that will occur shortly, and it is particularly important when we are talking about new technologies down the track. In most respects, photo matching is not a particularly new concept, although perhaps it may now be being done in a different way.</para>
<para>This bill also opens up the scope for other technologies down the track. One of the risks associated with biometric technology that Mr Crompton outlined, which I referred to before, is what he calls âfunction creepâ. That occurs when information that is collected for one purpose is gradually used for a range of additional purposes. Because of the protections contained in the Privacy Act, function creep generally involves legislative authorisation to use information for additional purposes. The most obvious example is the vastly expanded use of the tax file number which was originally brought in for a very precise and limited purpose and is now being used for a wide range of purposes. All of those changes to the use or purpose have been authorised by subsequent laws, so I am not in any way saying that those wider usages are invalid. I simply say that once you open up legal authorisation more widely there is an innate tendency to expand things down the track. It is because of the issue of function creep that the Democrats retain some concern about the nature of this legislation, because it does provide for ministerial determination in relation to a range of detailsâfrom the technology that is to be used to whether information can be disclosed to another person.</para>
<para>Because of that reliance on ministerial determination, rather than the need for future legislative change, the potential for function creep is increased. It is always easier for governmentsâand I can very much understand why they prefer it this wayâto get the general principle through in legislation and then, as changes and refinements need to be made down the track, to have the ability to make them in a much more prompt manner and, government ministers and public servants would probably argue, in a more efficient manner. If there is a need to draft changes to the laws, to put them before Senate committees and to introduce them in the parliament, it can be a lot slower. But it is also a lot safer and there is much greater protection of the freedoms of the individual and the community. In balancing the natural desire for maximum flexibility and speed, which governments always like, with the need to have adequate safeguards, checks and balances and protections for the community, I certainly believe you should always err somewhat on the side of caution without going overboard about it. Because of that prospect of ministerial determinations being made in the future, some of which will require regulations to be brought in, we do not believe that is necessarily an adequate protection against potential future misuse and future extra powers going to the government.</para>
<para>Certainly the area of ministerial determination I am most familiar with that of migration law. It is an enormous area of power for a minister. That ministerial discretion is virtually unlimited in some respects, with virtually no oversight of how that power is used and no opportunity for independent scrutiny. I suppose it is because of my experiences in that areaâwhere I have seen what was originally proposed as a very minor piece of the law, to be used as a last resort or a safety net in extreme cases, over time expand to become a major aspect of the operation of some components of the migration lawâthat I am much more conservative about giving ministers, in any areas, further powers where they can make changes simply by exercising their discretion without adequate protections being built in. What is being proposed here, let me hasten to add, is nothing like what is in the Migration Act in terms of the scope of ministerial power and the lack of any scrutiny of what the minister does in certain areas. I simply draw on that as an example of what can happen when open-ended ministerial discretion powers are allowed to take hold without adequate scrutiny of, and accountability for, how those powers are used.</para>
<para>It is those two aspects that I would emphasise: firstly, down the track, what other things might those powers be used for and how adequate or otherwise will be the ability to scrutinise changes and extra uses of those powers that may occur; and, secondly, whether adequate processes are in place to scrutinise how the powers are being used. That is something that will be an ongoing task. I am sure it is something that those who have an interest in this area will continue to do: to look at how these powers are usedâfrom a positive perspective, not just negative one. People have recognised the potential positive benefits of biometric technology for a whole range of reasons and we need to continually learn, as it is used, how it can be better used and what additional benefits can be gained from it. From that perspective as well, it is beneficial to have sufficient transparency of the monitoring of the use of technology so that people can learn from it and come up with ways of doing it better. In areas like this, where technological development is fairly rapid and the potential for a range of uses continues to grow, opportunities for input into how things might be done in the future are very important.</para>
<para>So, whilst the tone of my contribution has probably been focused on the negative or at least on sounding a warning, I do acknowledge the potential of this legislationâthe potential benefits of biometric technology and, indeed, other technologies when they are used. As with any power, the key thing is that it is appropriately constrained and cannot be expanded without further future scrutiny and awareness and, secondly, that there is adequate oversight with how those powers are used. In those areas, I am still not convinced that the protections in this legislation are necessarily adequate, but my concern has more to do with how the technology may be used in the future than how I anticipate it will be used immediately. I think it is appropriate to put those concerns on the record. They are areas that in many ways link into the concerns that have been raised by the Democrats over a long period.</para>
<para>People will perhaps recall former senator Janine Haines and her concerns about the use by governments of personal information and the need for good protections about that. Her campaigning about privacy issues has been taken up and continued, particularly by Senator Stott Despoja in her exploration of a range of these issues, not least in the current Senate committee inquiry about the adequacy of the privacy regime across the board that is in place. I urge people who have concerns or views of any sort about some of the wider issues to do with the use of technology, personal information and privacy related issues to make submissions to that inquiry.</para>
<para>In many respects, it is the adequacy of our overarching privacy regime and privacy legislation in Australia that is the key. It needs to be made as effective as possible, balancing all the competing challenges rather than homing in on just one particular area of its usage. Despite the government having control of the Senate from 1 July, I am sure the Senate will continue through its committee process to play an invaluable role in engaging with and getting the expertise of the public about how we can do things better in a whole range of areas. The privacy regime is certainly one of those areas and that Senate committee inquiry, which was established at the end of last year, is certainly one that I would encourage people with an interest in this area to engage in.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2228">Australian Passports Bill 2004</inline> and its attendant bills, the <inline ref="R2226">Australian Passports (Application Fees) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2219">Australian Passports (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill 2004</inline>, comprise a timely addition to the body of law governing Australiaâs national security, especially in a world now facing the ever-increasing risk of terrorist attacks and of identity fraud. As Senator Bartlett has outlined, the Democrats have concerns with the bills as drafted. These bills, which replace the Passports Act 1938, will strengthen the probability of uncovering identity fraud and the possible misuse of passports by terrorists and other criminals through the introduction of facial biometric technology to verify identity. Additionally, under these bills the penalties for passport fraud will substantially increase.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>However, what has not been addressed in this debate so far, or in the attendant publicity and information surrounding the bills, is the problem with the way in which Australians presently find themselves abused by our system. In the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 24 June 2004 the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Alexander Downer, was cited as giving his assurance that these new powers would be administered fairly and that natural justice would be preserved. He was cited as saying:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The governmentâs policy is that Australian passports should not be used as an extension of the judicial system and should not be expected to impose any more restraint on an individual than a court would be prepared to impose.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is these concepts of fair administration and natural justice concerning identity fraud that concern me with this new passports legislation.</para>
<para>To illustrate my concerns, I would like to draw attention to a specific and fairly recent example concerning the mistaken identity of an Australian citizen returning home after a trip abroad. In October 2003, my electorate office received via email a confidential submission for the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into children in institutional care. This submission was from an adult male who had been put into the care of Parkerville Childrenâs Home in Western Australia as a young child. There, he was subjected to such cruel treatment that he absconded regularly, only to be found and returnedâand that is a common story for many of those who were abused in institutions. At the age of 14 he finally succeeded in absconding, making his way up north, where he secured work as a jackaroo. He states in his confidential submission, No. 93, that his tragic and traumatic time at Parkerville will remain with him forever. He remained working in the pastoral industry for many years and received many an award, including an excellence award for jackaroo of the year.</para>
<para>Another form of abuse, known as secondary abuse to those who understand this field, was to plague him in his adult years. With thoughts of overseas travel, he applied for a passport for the first time in 1999. When he did so, there was some confusion over his actual identity, because when he gave his name and what he thought was his birth date he was told that he already had a passport, which he did not. When asked for details of his birth and parents in a subsequent interview with a passport official, he could not supply this information as he just did not knowâan all too common problem for the hundreds of thousands of those who have been raised in care in Australia. On producing his drivers licence a passport was issued.</para>
<para>In mid-2002 he was to fly to Holland with his fiancee to meet her family, only to find after intensive searches that he had mislaid his passport. Again, there was confusion over his identity, but this time he was actually interviewed by two federal agents. His fiancee flew back to Holland without him and eventually another passport was issued. Unfortunately, when he was finally able to join his fiancee overseas, his passport was stolen. When he reported this and went to collect a new one, he was given a new ID by the authorities in the name of the person they believed him to be. However, on attempting to book a flight home, he was told that this person had never left Australia and that he could not fly. So began another attempt to sort out his identity and passport at the Australian embassy in The Hague. Eventually, a travel document was issued to allow him to fly back home, but yet again it was in another name.</para>
<para>On arrival back in Australia last November, his nightmare continued with his immediate arrest at the airport by the Federal Police and subsequent detention. He then appeared in court on a charge of making false statements to procure an Australian passport, and his application for bail was refused on the grounds that he was a flight risk. At no time throughout these circumstances was it ever apparent that anyone from the department, the authorities or the police had any idea that identity issues are a major problem for hundreds of thousands of Australians who have been in care. The matter was eventually dismissed by the court.</para>
<para>The distress and frustration this Australian citizen experienced at being accused of deliberately defrauding the government to obtain an ID for a passport cannot be underestimated. Even though he is no stranger to abuse, considering his time spent in care as a child, this form of secondary abuse has caused him unnecessary pain and suffering. He somewhat poignantly writes that these events have:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... stirred up a lot of old nightmares and pain which I had thought were forgotten. The biggest issue I have is the stigma of being in Parkerville and being treated by authorities as a nobody and now being expected to prove who I am.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What is more, in spite of his embedded distrust of authority figures, he patriotically writes:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I am not seeking compensation or publicity. I am not seeking to embarrass my government. I am not looking for anything other than my name and my life to be given back to me. I am proud to be an Australian, I am proud of what Australia stands for and I am proud of what I have achieved given the circumstances of my early childhood.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This example of alleged passport fraud goes a long way to arguing the case that it is imperative that âfairnessâ and ânatural justiceâ are safeguarded in these new bills and, more importantly, safeguarded in the exercise of authority under these new bills, especially for the people who are still searching for their true identities after being raised in care. Indeed, the search for identity for these people is a particularly onerous and frustrating task. Poor record keeping and the destruction of records by fires, church and other organisations or under government department orders has often made it nigh on impossible for them to either find or reconnect with family members or use the documents for more official practical purposes such as obtaining a passport. Right now the Senate has an inquiry into privacy, but there are miserable creatures who refuse to allow a change to the terms of reference which would allow for these sorts of issues, such as whether at times privacy principles need to be adjusted for people who cannot access their records and are denied their identity, to be assessed.</para>
<para>The August 2001 child migrant report <inline font-style="italic">Lost innocents: righting the record</inline> devotes a whole chapter, chapter 6, to the vital issue of identity. There are 40 pages to the chapter and it has 17 recommendations. I remind the Senate that this was a unanimous report, but if you were to ask the ministers or the officials responsible whether they are acquainted with that report and chapter I would venture to suggest that they are not. Of course, that report has been followed up by a further report, <inline font-style="italic">Forgotten Australians: A report on Australians who experienced institutional or out-of-home care as children</inline>, by the same committeeâagain a unanimous reportâwhich again focuses on the issues of identity for, I repeat, hundreds of thousands of Australians. The great difficulty we have is that I very much doubt that successive ministers and their key officials have even read the report. Nor is there a system of automatically red-flagging a child migrant or a person in care to an official who would be aware of these identity issues. It is obviously impractical for an entire department to be aware of them, but it must be possible for a system to be introduced where, when there is a specific identity issue, there are people who are experienced in that area.</para>
<para>Like Jews in Nazi Germany, many of these Australian Indigenous and non-Indigenous children and child migrants were known by number, not by name. It is a disgrace. Many had their names changed and their identity perverted by the good and charitable who ran those places of abuse. The loss of identity has had enormous practical implications for former child migrants. With no birth certificates they have experienced difficulties in obtaining passports and other documentation. It is also true of those Australian born children in institutions: those who were deserted by their parents, orphaned or simply handed over to the authorities frequently have no means of tracing their background and identity. Where is that issue attended to in the statements of ministers, the reaction of government and the examination of these bills? And this is when they have had two reports by the Senate unanimously recommending attention to these areas. Moreover, most former child migrants and others in care have discovered as adults that they were not even recognised as Australian citizens. Imagine the effect this has on these people, Defence Minister, especially when manyâand this is typical of institutional kidsâhave fought for this country and went to war for Australia.</para>
<para>At the time this bill was to be debated in August last year, my office had yet another requestâand there have been manyâfor assistance from a former child migrant planning to travel back to the United Kingdom to visit the grave of his mother whom he had never met. When he applied for a passport he learnt that he was not classified as an Australian citizen and, as he had spent time in prisonâI should add that this is something not uncommon for victims of brutal institutional lifeâhe faced possible deportation. The Senate committee recommended that the issue of citizenship should be dealt with sympathetically for people in those circumstances. Needless to say, the devastation and angst he experienced when informed of this situation was soul destroying for him.</para>
<para>You only have to speak to experts in organisations like the Child Migrants Trust, a wonderful and badly underfunded service provider, or the Christian Brothers Ex-Residents and Students Services, who provide a very good service trying to deal with this area, to realise what a huge issue identity is for Australians who have been in institutionsâall 500,000-plus of them: the Indigenous Australians, the British and Maltese child migrants and the non-Indigenous Australians. I despair of those from a privileged silvertail or landed gentry background who have a decidedly un-Christian disdain and disregard for people with these unfortunate backgrounds and a visceral antagonism to the people and agencies trying to help them. This is a government that at times seems to revel in a harsh reputation, safe and secure in the knowledge that too many Australians care little about how the unfortunate or the disadvantaged are treated. Yet I am not without hope. I know that there are very many good people in the government ranks, and those people should join us in urging the government as a whole to give due consideration to âfairnessâ and ânatural justiceâ in the administration of the powers under these laws for those Australians whose identity has always been hidden from them.</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">I speak on these Bills primarily in my capacity as the Foreign Affairs Spokesperson for the Australian Democrats. However, since the Bills have very significant implications for the privacy of all Australian passport holders, it is also relevant in this context that I am the Democratsâ Privacy Spokesperson.</para>
<para class="block">I begin by indicating that the Democrats accept that the Governmentâs genuine intention in introducing these Bills is, as the Ministerâs Second Reading Speech indicated, to âprovide a modern legal structure to underpin our world-class passports systemâ and âto ensure that Australians can continue to rely on a travel document of the highest integrity, which clearly establishes their identity and citizenship.</para>
<para class="block">The Democrats support those objectives, however, we believe that Government has gone well beyond them in the drafting of this Bill and, as a consequence, what we have before us today is bad legislation.</para>
<para class="block">As we know, there are four main aspects to the Australian Passports Bill.</para>
<para class="block">Firstly, in an effort to combat identity fraud, the Bill makes changes to the methods and technologies for identification in relation to passports.</para>
<para class="block">Although the Bill contains no express mention of biometric technology, the Minister has made it clear that the Government intends to introduce such technology, indicating that the Bill âprovides for the introduction of facial biometric technology as an effective means of verifying identityâ.</para>
<para class="block">The will be achieved by vesting the Minister with the power to authorise the use of particular methods and technologies for confirming identification or performing other functions connected with the Bill.</para>
<para class="block">Secondly, the Bill expands the grounds for the refusal or cancellation of passports. For example, the Minister may refuse to issue a passport upon request from a competent authority if the person is the subject of an arrest warrant in respect of a serious foreign offence.</para>
<para class="block">The Minister may also refuse a passport to a person who has lost, or had stolen, 2 or more passports in 5 years.</para>
<para class="block">These provisions reflect similar provisions in relation to foreign travel documents which were enacted last year in the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 3). Like the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 3), this Bill will enable the Minister to certify that a particular decision relates to matters of international relations or criminal intelligence. If the Minister issues such a certificate, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will have no option but to affirm the Ministerâs decision or remit it back to the Minister for reconsideration.</para>
<para class="block">Thirdly, the Bill creates a range of new criminal offences relating to travel documentsâfor example, selling an Australian travel document, dishonestly obtaining an Australian travel document, transporting a false travel document across international borders, and using powers under this Bill for wrong reasons.</para>
<para class="block">It is important to note that these offences will apply extraterritoriallyâin other words, a person will be able to be convicted of an offence regardless of whether or not the conduct constituting the offence occurred within Australia.</para>
<para class="block">Penalties are increased from a maximum fine of $5000 and/or 2 years imprisonment to a maximum fine of $110,000 and/or 10 years imprisonment.</para>
<para class="block">Finally, the Bill enables the Minister to obtain, use and disclose personal information for a range of purposes associated with the Bill, for example verifying information provided by an applicant for a passport.</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Passports (Application Fees) Bill will, according to the Government, âestablish a simpler structure to deal with changes in the costs and validity of passports and other travel-related documentsâ. In actual fact, it could facilitate a massive increase in the cost of obtaining an Australian passport.</para>
<para class="block">This Bill gives the Minister the power to specify application fees for Australian travel documents. These fees are âimposed as taxesâ and the âapplication fee need not bear any relationship to the costâ of the travel document.</para>
<para class="block">The maximum fee for the first year of the Billâs operation is $1000, which is an extraordinary increase on the current application fee of $150 for a standard passport. However, we have been informed by the Department of Foreign Affairs that this is simply an arbitrary figure which is intended to cover all possible increases to passport fees over the next, say, 30 years. I understand that there is no intention whatsoever to increase the cost of a passport to $1000 and it is important for that to be put on public record.</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Passports (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill will, among other things, remove references to Australian passports from the Passports Act and rename that Act as the Foreign Passports (Law Enforcement and Security) Act.</para>
<para class="block">I turn now to the Democratsâ key concerns in relation to these Bills. Our primary concern relates to the Ministerâs sweeping new powers and the potential impact on the privacy of Australian passport holders under the principle Australian Passports Bill.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill is not specific about exactly what type of technology the Minister may authorise to identify passport holders. In fact, while the Government has indicated that it intends to introduce a biometric system, there is no mention of biometric technology in the Bill. Because of this ambiguity, there is nothing in the legislation to stop the Minister eventually going as far as requiring genetic information to identify passport holders.</para>
<para class="block">This is an unacceptable situation, regardless of whether the Ministerâs determination is a disallowable instrument. Many of you in this place would be aware of my long-term interest in genetic privacy issues and my strong view that there is a need for legislation to protect the privacy of sensitive genetic information. Indeed, I introduced a Private Senatorâs Bill with this very objective in 1998.</para>
<para class="block">The absence of any legislation to protect the privacy of genetic information is exactly why general powers such as those contained in this Bill are particularly problematicâas there is no guarantee that they will not be used in a manner which violates the genetic privacy of Australian passport holders.</para>
<para class="block">However, even looking at the immediate proposal for a biometric identification system, there is no indication in the Bill as to what kind of biometric system this might be.</para>
<para class="block">The Bills Digest, for example, identifies two different types of biometric systems which could be adopted. The first of these relies on machine readable travel documents, as advocated by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</para>
<para class="block">As the Digest explains:</para>
<para class="block">âThis method uses a MRTD in which a data-chip is embedded. A computer can then access biometric data from the chip, matching the data with the biometrics of the person purporting to be the passport-holder. In some ways, this is an automated version of the current system of identity confirmation whereby a human Customs or Immigration (or like) officer manually matches a traveller with his or her photographic identification. This method does not rely on a database of passport-holdersâ biometric details.â</para>
<para class="block">On the other hand, the Government could opt for a database containing the biometric details of all Australian passport holders, which could be accessed through network-connected computers when passengers leave and enter Australia. The Bills Digest indicates that this is the model the US intends to use for all visitors to the US under its US-VISIT scheme.</para>
<para class="block">My understanding of the Governmentâs proposal is that it involves features of each of these models. It is predominantly a machine-readable system, however the Government will maintain a database of computerised photographs of all passport holders.</para>
<para class="block">But, quite apart from the merits or otherwise of a biometric database, the Bill fails to provide any rules as to how biometric information is to be collected, stored, protected or used. The Democrats would hope that, at the very least, this type of information would be included in any determination made by the Minister, however, we maintain our position that any specific technology proposed to be used in relation to identity verification, should be considered by the Parliament and not left to the Ministerâs discretion.</para>
<para class="block">We do not accept that it is sufficient for the Parliament to have the power to disallow a determination made by the Minister. This will not allow the same degree of community participation in any decision to adopt new passport technologies and, given the very large number of Australians who would be affected by such a decision, the Democrats believe it is important for such matters to be subject to proper Parliamentary scrutiny, including a Committee Inquiry if necessary.</para>
<para class="block">The Democrats believe that the Government should set out the details of its proposed biometric system in the text of the Bill. We note that, while the collection and management of passport identification information would be subject to the Privacy Act, the protection afforded by the Privacy Act is not particularly strong and notoriously difficult to enforce. Indeed, that is why I initiated the current Senate Inquiry into current privacy legislation and the extent to which it is capable of responding to new technologies.</para>
<para class="block">In relation to the Ministerâs power to disclose personal information for law enforcement, family law or other Commonwealth purposes, the Democrats are concerned that this could lead to the passport identification system becoming a de facto national biometric database which could be used by the Government for a variety of reasons.</para>
<para class="block">The Bills Digest warns:</para>
<para class="block">âThese provisions could make the passports system a process by which the Commonwealth could obtain and centralise a large amount of personal information about Australian passport-holders which could be put to a very broad range of uses with minimal parliamentary scrutinyâ.</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Privacy Foundation has warned that this could result in passports becoming âa de-facto Australia cardâ and, as the Australian Consumersâ Association has pointed out, the legislation will âaffect some 8 million passport holdersâ.</para>
<para class="block">There are a couple of other concerns which the Democrats have in relation to this suite of Bills that I wish to place on record.</para>
<para class="block">Firstly, there are restrictions on the appeal process if a person is refused a passport or has their passport cancelled on international relations or criminal intelligence grounds. If the Minister certifies that his or her decision involves matters of international relations or criminal intelligence, the AAT will have no choice but to either affirm the Ministerâs decision or remit it to the Minister for reconsideration.</para>
<para class="block">The Democrats believe this is unsatisfactory, given the enormous impact of the Ministerâs decision on a person who is subsequently prevented from leaving Australia. It continues the disturbing trend towards more opaque decision-making on the basis that decisions relate to security, or in this case international relations or criminal intelligence.</para>
<para class="block">Perhaps a more appropriate approach would be to limit the evidence which the AAT can consider as opposed to limiting the orders it can make.</para>
<para class="block">Another concern which I wish to flag is that there is an anomaly relating to the form of Australian travel documents which means that Australian women who marry overseas will need to change their name by deed poll if they wish to use their married name on Australian travel documents. This new policy, which is contained in a DFAT directive, has already affected two Australian women. I understand that DFAT is aware of this issue but is not sure how to rectify it at this stage.</para>
<para class="block">In conclusion, I can indicate that, while the Democrats have no in principle objection to the use of biometric technology in passports, we believe that the introduction of such technology must be accompanied by appropriate safeguards to ensure that the privacy of Australians is protected. In their current form, these Bills fail to include the appropriate protections. They are broad and ambiguous and the Democrats will not support them in their current form.</para>

<para>âI thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate. It seems that the <inline ref="R2228">Australian Passports Bill 2004</inline>, the <inline ref="R2226">Australian Passports (Application Fees) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2219">Australian Passports (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill 2004</inline> are supported. In fact, generally the way I interpreted the contributions of the Labor Party and the spokesperson for the Australian Democrats was that they recognise the significant improvements within this legislation, which sets out the new passport scheme for our country.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I guess the only negative from Senator Bartlett was that he despaired the âloss of the independence of the Senateâ after 1 July this year. I do not quite understand what he means by that. He may be in some way reflecting on the choice of the Australian people to elect a majority of coalition members to the next Senateâand that might be his attitude towards the wishes of the majority of Australiansâbut the Senate will not change after 1 July. The numbers might change within the Senate, but it will be just as independent as it has ever been. I hope he does not mean that after 1 July there will be no role of scrutiny for his party. He will have just the same opportunities to scrutinise legislation and hold the government to account through his argument that he has now. Basically, whether he likes it or not, it will be the Australian people who will then pass judgment on whether the coalition in the Senate is doing a job they support or Senator Bartlett has persuaded them to some other position.</para>
<para>Senator Murrayâs contribution was a different one. He raised the very real concern of those who, through no fault of their own, have difficulty in establishing their identity for passport reasons. He gave us the detail of one obviously very unfortunate caseâit was a rather sad set of circumstancesâand the great deal of anguish that a particular individual clearly went through. That is something we wish had not occurred. I have discussed the matter briefly with the officials and they tell me that, in the drafting of the regulations for this legislation, there will be sufficient discretion for them to make wise decisions in circumstances where people have difficulty in establishing their identity through traditional means. No doubt Senator Murray will have an opportunity, when he sees these regulations, to inform the Senate whether he believes they have adequately achieved the goal as expressed by the officials.</para>
<para>Whilst I do not in any way dispute his argument, I do ask him to also take into account the other side of the coin, which is the duty and responsibility of officials to protect the Australian people from abuses of the passport system. Sadly, that occurs. Through these legislative changes we hope there will be less opportunity for abuse. Nevertheless, the officials have a responsibility to enforce the legislation to protect the interests of the Australian people. That is not always an easy job. So I think there are two sides to this argument. On the one hand, we must be sensitive to those who, as I said, through no fault of their own have difficulty in establishing their identity. On the other hand, we must also understand and support officials who are doing their best to meet their responsibilities to the Australian people in seeking to avoid passport fraud. With those few words I commend the bills to the Senate.</para>

<para>âToday the Senate is debating the <inline ref="R2253">Tax Laws Amendment (Long-term Non-reviewable Contracts) Bill 2004</inline> and three related bills. The Senate is debating a number of bills to correct a hangoverâand a mighty hangover it isâof the implementation nightmare of the GST. Five years after the implementation of the GST, here we are dealing with four bills to correct the hangover. It is now five years since the introduction of the GST!</para>

<para>âSenator Kemp, in his usual form, interjects and suggests that I move on, but we are dealing with Liberal government legislation to fix up the GST, which should have been fixed five years ago. Senator Kemp and the Liberal government moved on without fixing up the issues relating to the GST. Here we are, five years on, still trying to fix up the problems. If memory serves me correctly, this is about the 1,650th amendment to the GST since it was introduced five years ago.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>One of the numerous difficult issues that arose at the time of the introduction of the GST was how to deal with long-term contracts entered into before the GST regime was introduced and for which no review opportunity has occurred. An example of such a contract would be a long-term lease by a bank over a branch office. If the GST had been applied immediately to these contract suppliers, they would have had to remit the GST on their supplies, but, because there is an existing contractual obligation, the contract price could not be changed to reflect the introduction of the GST. The recipient would have received the input tax credit without, so to speak, paying for it as a GST augmented price. In response, the Liberal government provided for a transitional regime that deferred the imposition of the GST on these contractsâand that effectively deferred the solution to the problemâuntil an opportunity occurred for the contracts to be reviewed. That transition period ends on 30 June 2005.</para>
<para>As I have said, the Liberal government has had five years to indicate in detail how it was going to fix this problem. Here we are at the eleventh hour and it has produced a set of bills. This is happening frequently at the moment. We are seeing tax bills, urgent bills, emerging from the government to deal with pressing concerns that should have been fixed five years ago. A problem with this approach is that it is attempting to railroad the Senate and the affected parties into a decision without an opportunity to have an input. The Labor Party, unlike this government, actually wanted to listen to the concerns that were being raised by parties particularly in the property industry about this last-minute solution to the issues that have been raised. It is just so typical of the arrogant approach of this Liberal government that we see emerging more and more. It is an approach that is arrogant, dismissive and uncaring, and it fails to listen to others.</para>
<para>The situation in relation to these bills could not, sadly, better reflect this arrogant approach of the Liberal government, particularly since their re-election. The Liberal government asked the Labor opposition in the last session to have the bill introduced into parliament, pushed straight through the Senate and passed on the same day. This is five years after the GST was implemented. Labor rightly called for a Treasury briefing in order to satisfy ourselves that the bill overall was an appropriate solution and mechanism to deal with the imposition of the GST on these contracts and also to consult with the affected parties. But the Liberal government refused to allow the Labor opposition to remove a copy of the bill from the briefing room, and we also had not seen an explanatory memorandum. In light of this, the Labor opposition allowed the bill to enter the House but insisted that a little more time, other than just the one day and the one sighting, was needed for the bill to be considered. Labor have listened to the representations from the sectors that are affected by the implementation regime. We have fully considered the legislation and consulted with the property sector, and Labor will be moving two amendments to the legislation when we enter into the committee debate on the bills. These are positive and fair suggestions that have been advanced by parties in the property sector who have been affected.</para>
<para>Before I touch on the amendments, the legislation we are speaking to as a whole seeks to provide a transitional phase for businesses engaged in long-term contracts which will be subject to the GST from 1 July 2005. A long-term agreement which was entered into prior to the commencement of the GST had no GST component negotiated in the contract. If suppliers under these long-term, non-reviewable contracts are unable to negotiate a change in the consideration to take account of the GST, they will have a GST liability from 1 July 2005, without the ability to recover the GST from their recipients. This has created the opportunity for major lessees of property to hold out, or at least to try to hold out, on renegotiating the contracts until after 1 July 2005 to avoid a price rise. The Liberal government has introduced this bill to try to âencourageâ such lessees to renegotiate the lease or end up paying the GST themselves. This is not an unexpected problem. It was a problem that was raised five years ago, when the GST was introduced. I would be interested to hear from Senator Murray what the Democratsâthe party that teamed up with the Liberal government to allow the passage of the GSTâthought about this particular problem at the time. I would be interested to know what the Democrats thought about this and why we are dealing with this mess five years on. Hopefully, Senator Murray can throw some light on that.</para>
<para>The bill provides for one of three outcomes. Firstly, the parties renegotiate the contract price, either voluntarily or through arbitration. The supplier can make an initial offer to adjust a price, which may be accepted by the recipient. If not accepted, the supplier can make an arbitrated offer to adjust the consideration. If accepted, the supplier remits one-eleventh of the renegotiated contract price, and the recipient receives input tax credits according to their usual entitlement. Secondly, if the recipient of the service under the contract rejects the offer of the supplier, the GST becomes payable by the recipient. Thirdly, the recipient of the supplies may make an irrevocable written election to pay the GST. Once an offer has been made by the supplier, the recipient has 28 days to accept it. Once an arbiter has ruled, the recipient has 21 days to accept the arbitration. A recipient who does not respond is liable for the GST.</para>
<para>Some problems with the approach in this bill have been raised with the Labor Party by the principal industry association for suppliers in this sector, the Property Council of Australia. They requested Labor consider moving amendments to the bill in two areas: firstly, to place a 28-day cap on the arbitration period and, secondly, to deal with the absence of regulations. We have not seen the regulations yet. Here we are, expected to pass a bill in one day because it is urgent, yet we have not got the regulations. It is another example of the arrogant approach of this government to the legislative process. The basic problem is that, without the amendments that Labor will be moving, the arbitration period could drag out. When does the arbitration period come to a conclusion? There is an incentive for the lessor to do this until after 1 July 2005, when the supplier will have to pay the GST. The lessor can then get the input tax credit without paying the GST. So a cap on the arbitration period is called for.</para>
<para>There is also a problem with regard to the qualifications of an arbitrator. The bill specifies that this will be determined by regulation, but we understand that the regulations have not been prepared. The minister may care to give us an update. These would normally be subject to disallowance within 14 days of the sitting period. But this is impractical from a Senate process point of view, because it would mean that there would be insufficient time to begin arbitration. So Labor is proposing to amend the bill to specify that, until the regulations are gazetted, the qualification of an arbitrator will be membership of CPA Australia or the Institute of Chartered Accountants.</para>
<para>The Property Council also asked Labor to specify that the costs of the arbitration process be split between both parties. That is an important issue, because it could be an expensive exercise. Labor do not propose to move a specific amendment to the bill in this area to deal with what we consider to be a very legitimate concern. I would ask that the minister indicate in her response, either in her contribution to the second reading debate or in the committee stage, how the government proposes to deal with the question of sharing the costs of the arbitration process. Labor call on the government to propose a solution to what is potentially a significant problem.</para>
<para>Laborâs interest in presenting the amendments and raising the problems that have been communicated to us demonstrates that we have attempted a fairness of approach when considering this very difficult issue. We have listened to business concerns, and Labor will continue to be proactive in dealing with legitimate issues that business raises. In terms of general taxation reform, Laborâs approach to these issues is to listen to business, to listen to its concernsâunlike the Liberal government on this billâunderpinned by a fairness to all approach.</para>
<para>It has to be said that in relation to this bill the performance of the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Mr Brough, has been appalling. After he expected us to pass the bill in the House and the Senate in one day, sight unseen, he arrogantly tried to stop Labor members debating the bill in the House. He even attempted to speak in the place of the member for Oxley when that member had been given the call. Fortunately, the deputy speaker asked the minister to resume his seat and to stop interrupting the debate. It is another example of the arrogance of this governmentâs approach. Labor approached the government to discuss the proposed amendments. However, the Liberal government cancelled the meeting with little over an hourâs notice. That is another example of the arrogant approach that is becoming all too symptomatic of this government, particularly since its re-election.</para>
<para>I ask the minister and all the senators to support the two amendments that I have foreshadowed when we get to the committee stage. The Labor Party are also asking the government to support the amendments in the other chamber when the time comes for consideration, if they are passed in this place. In concluding, let me repeat that it has taken not weeks, not months but yearsâin fact, five yearsâto draft this bill to deal with GST hangover issues. It is legislation which the government knew needed to be introduced before the transition period expired on 1 July 2005. The delays in presenting this bill to the parliament are not exceptional. As I said, they are signs of arrogance and a level of incompetence displayed by Minister Brough in the other place and another example of the governmentâs mismanagement of the legislative process. We will be supporting the bill, but we will be moving two amendments when we get to the committee stage.</para>

<para>âI too intend to speak on the <inline ref="R2253">Tax Laws Amendment (Long-term Non-reviewable Contracts) Bill 2004</inline> and the other three bills being dealt with cognately. I guess at one time or another all of us are guilty of this with pet issues, but I must say at the outset that sometimesâthrough you, Madam Acting Deputy PresidentâSenator Sherry and other members of the ALP, I think of you fighting a war that is long lost. I am almost reminded of those apocryphal magazine stories of some poor Japanese soldier suddenly emerging from a jungle 10 years after the war, ready to carry on and fight his battle. I think the GST is now well accepted in the community. I note that in Western Australia the cornucopia of riches that is available to both major parties contesting government is amply contributed to by GST funds. That enables them, of course, to make terrific offers on infrastructure, police, health and education. If ever you speak to the Labor members of state governments, as I do, you will know that the very last thing they ever want the coalition government or any other government to do is to get rid of the GST.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is a great tribute to the coalition and the Democrats that we had the courage to introduce and support such tax reform. As I said, that battle is over and you need to move on. In fact, I guess you are moving on because, having made your criticisms, you nevertheless will support the billâ</para>

<para>âYes, it has taken you five years to accept it, I suppose. But I am pleased to see it. I get distracted and I am sure we will have this jousting for many years to come. The <inline ref="R2253">Tax Laws Amendment (Long-term Non-reviewable Contracts) Bill 2004</inline> amends the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Transition) Act 1999 so that parties who entered into a long-term contract prior to 8 July 1999 have access to an arbitrator to enable negotiations to take account of the GSTâs impact on those contracts after 1 July 2005. On 1 July 2005 the five-year transitional rules that ensured no party was disadvantaged will come to an end.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In one respect I agree with some remarks of Senator Sherry: this matter could have been brought on earlier and could have been dealt with for the benefit of the parties concerned. It is not the Senateâs fault that it was delayed. One thing I am increasingly irritated aboutâand I want to join the Hon. Bob Hawke in giving the media a clip around the earâis the mediaâs continual and automatic acceptance of the coalitionâs mantra that the Senate has endlessly held up bills. That is not true. It is the government that decides how many sitting days there will be and it is the government that decides which bills will be before us. When those bills are before us, you will find that the Senate has dealt with them. There are very few bills in fact that have been held up. On Sunday, yet again I heard a senior commentator saying âand all those bills that the Senate has held upâ. Which bills? The media will immediately mention the unfair dismissal billâyes. Telstra, yes. Any others, folks? There are perhaps a couple, perhaps seven but certainly fewer than 10.</para>
<para>It is about time that the media started to behave like a media and give the government a run-in every time they claim that the Senate in its role has been obstructionist and has been holding up legislation. Ask the next question: âAll right, Minister, which bills? Name them. Name when they were held up.â Ask them why they did not have an extra sitting week, as we Democrats ask for many times. Ask them why bills were not put on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, when they have the entire power to do so.</para>
<para>On 1 July 2005, the five-year transitional rules that ensured that no party was disadvantaged will come to an end. This bill is necessary because the legislation implementing the GST recognised that there were numerous pre-existing contracts where the supply was to be made after 1 July 2000. The prices set under these contracts were most likely negotiated without reference to the GST regime. If the GST had applied immediately to these contracts, suppliers would have had to pay the GST but would not have had an opportunity to pass on these costs to the recipients. Further, recipients would have been able to claim the GST input credit without paying a price for these goods that included the GST paid by the supplier. So the essential problem was that one party would be advantaged and one party would be severely disadvantaged.</para>
<para>Consequently, section 13 of the GST transition act allows supplies under a pre 8 July 1999 contract, or a pre 2 December 1998 contract where the recipient was not entitled to a full input tax credit, to remain GST free until either the first opportunity for review of prices under that contract or 1 July 2005, whichever date arose first. After 30 June 2005 this transition period finishes and under current legislation all goods and services supplied under pre 8 July 1999 contracts will become liable for the GST. As noted above, suppliers may face the situation where they are liable for the GST but have no means by which to recover this cost from the recipients of those supplies. If the arbitration mechanism fails to produce a satisfactory outcome to the supplier, these amendments require a recipient to pay any GST obligation on these transactions. Where the recipient agrees to a change in consideration or accepts an arbitrated offer for a change in consideration or where no arbitrated offer has been made and no agreement reached, the supplier remains liable to pay the GST.</para>
<para>The government has had five years to address this issue. On 3 May 2000 the Treasurer issued a press release announcing that the government would introduce measures to ensure that there was no disadvantage to either supplier or recipient after the transition period ended. But it took until 29 October 2004 for the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer to draft the legislation and release it. I am aware that this government have at times been able to produce legislation on a 24-hour call. We know they can do it. My view is that obviously the government did not regard this legislation as a high priority and have done it in their own time.</para>
<para>This legislation was then introduced into the House on Tuesday, 7 December 2004. The Democrats were then privately asked to support the bill being rushed through the Senate by Thursday, 9 December. The Labor Party were unwilling to rush it through. They were not aware of the bill. They had not considered all the issues. As well, both Labor and the Democrats were dealing with other pieces of legislation. It is necessary, given that Labor likes to work its legislation through caucus and the Democrats through party room, that ample notice is given when a bill is to be dealt with. However, it was always the case that the Democrats would support this legislation, and the parties concerned knew that that was the case.</para>
<para>After looking at this bill over the Christmas period, we did take on board the concerns of the Property Council that there was some uncertainty in its operation. Specifically, there did need to be some definite time frame for the offer period. That is a very common feature of contracts, as Minister Coonan would know as a former barristerâI presume she is still a barristerâand it is a very necessary constraint so that things are done in time.</para>
<para>The Labor Party have drafted an amendment to this effect. I have seen some correspondence from the very able Peter Verwer of the Property Council stating that the proposed amendment provides much-needed certainty. That particular amendment does make sense to the Democrats. We have not had any negative feedback from those concerned in the industry and we will be interested to see what the governmentâs attitude is to that minor and clarifying amendment.</para>
<para>On the subject of the GST, I would like to remind the Senate that the recently released mid-year economic outlook shows that the states will receive $35.2 billion in GST funding in 2004-05. This year, the states will have $1.94 billion more revenue from the GST than they would have had under the previous system of financial assistance grants and the state taxes that were abolished at the time of tax reforms. All of us must recognise that the primary role of parliaments is to ensure that they deliver the goods and services that are legitimately needed by Australians. It is a primary role of federal government to ensure that the states are able to attend to their duties successfully, particularly in the areas of the environment, health, education, and law and order. Therefore, the GST has provided much more certainty as a growing tax base than the wholesale sales taxâthat limited consumption tax that only applied to goods and not services.</para>
<para>The state governments owe the Democrats a big thankyou. One or two of their ministers have whispered that in my ear but they have not said so publicly and I will not die waiting for it. Not only that, but the federal government is also forecasting massive surplus budgets in the coming years, the Australian economy remains strong, and inflation, unemployment and interest rates are either relatively low or low. The Democrats as a party have taken a lot of pain to deliver Australia a lot of gain.</para>
<para>I am going to repeat some remarks I have made before, but I do note some newspapers again stating that the GST should be revisited to apply to basic food. In response to that, the Treasurer made it very clear that he was not interested in that proposition. Some of the very newspapers that push that boat forget to remind their readers that at the time of the original debate those newspapers were asking to be exempt from the GST themselves. That is a little fact that is conveniently left out of the commentary. Now and again I write a letter to the editor reminding them of that and miraculously it does not get printed. It is always wise to keep a history of these things.</para>
<para>Some of these editorial writers and advocates imply that food is the only thing which is GST-free, but I want to persistently remind people that the coalition decided on extensive GST exemptions for dwelling rentals, health services, education, financial services and exports, all of which total well over 20 per cent of GDP. So, right from the start, the coalition advocated that one in five consumer dollars should not be subject to the GST, and we added basic and fresh food to that. It was not the only exemption or even the most important exemption. The Democrats agreed with the coalitionâs proposed exemptions. We then broadened them to include basic and fresh food, which is consistent with GST/VAT systems the world over. We also negotiated extended exemptions in the health, education and charitable services sectors.</para>
<para>I freely admit that we could have done better. Undoubtedly, the government could have done better too. Everybody concerned could have done better, particularly the Labor Party, because if they had entered into the discussion with more principle and less politics we would have got somewhere. I will never forget that the Labor Party called a division and voted three times to tax food under the GST. It is on the record in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. Overall, I will say again and again that, despite the angst it has caused my own party, this was a very good outcome in Australiaâs national interest.</para>
<para>Finally, I would like to briefly comment that we know the Treasurer is likely to have a largeâperhaps huge or perhaps massiveâsurplus in the next few budgets he will manage, and he will be tempted to provide tax cuts. By the way, I agree with the Labor Party that the GST should be recorded as a Commonwealth tax; do not forget that I have put that on the record many times. Tax cuts of themselves are not a bad thing, but the Democrats would always say that first we should make sure that our health, education and environmental systems are catered for. If you are then going to look at tax cuts, the priority should be low-income earners. The priority should be to increase the tax-free threshold from its ridiculously low $6,000. This would provide a fair and equal tax cut to all Australians as well as potentially reducing some of the effective high marginal tax rates paid by those moving from welfare to work.</para>
<para>Tax cuts right now are a big agenda item because the backbench of the coalition have decided to flex their muscles and have an opinion on this. We support their approach in that it is creating a debate, but we stress that the principles we stand by are: firstly, income tax reform should be structural and permanent; and, secondly, it needs to be prioritised over a number of years. We say that the first priority is low-income earners, which means that, firstly, you have to pay attention to tax-free thresholds; secondly, you should pay attention to tax indexation; and, thirdlyâonly thirdlyâwould you then look at raising the upper rates. We do not object to the idea that the upper rate should be raised at some time, but this is not the time. If the Labor Party sit on the fence on this one they will be doing themselves a disservice.</para>
<para>We think that to provide another exclusive tax cut to high-income earners would be divisive in Australia, and it would certainly not be supported by the Democrats. The Labor Party might be tempted to fold again on those principles. We would urge them, under their new leadership and with their new mood, to in fact attend to the debate and attend to the issue of permanent structural income tax reform, which will get us away from the triennial debate about what goodies you dish out at election times and give us some certainty and securityâwhich is, incidentally, what the coalition have provided on the consumption tax side. With those concluding remarks I confirm that the Democrats will be supporting this bill.</para>

<para>âAs we appear to be in furious agreement on the <inline ref="R2253">Tax Laws Amendment (Long-term Non-reviewable Contracts) Bill 2004</inline> and related bills, I am not going to take much of the Senateâs time, apart from making a couple of remarks in summing up and then dealing with the proposed amendments. The package of bills deals with the situation of people who have long-term contracts stretching from before the GST legislation was introduced to the rapidly approaching date of 1 July 2005, the end of the GST transition period when GST begins to apply to these contracts. These bills have arisen out of several periods of consultation stretching back to November 2000. There was a second one in December 2003, and since early 2004 there have been ongoing consultations with industry groups over the draft legislation which was publicly released for comments on 29Â October 2004. I place that on the record because there were some comments made about the length of time this has taken. Time in itself is not a problem if you get a better outcome, and the government are satisfied that, having listened to industry, we now have the very best package of bills to address this issue.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The bills give the parties to these contracts a mechanism for negotiating a pricing adjustment to reflect the GST in the contract price, if necessary with arbitration. If negotiation fails, there will be a way of breaking the deadlock, by allowing the GST to be imposed on recipients of supplies under the contract. Because there is not a lot of parliamentary time before 1 July 2005, it is important that the parties have the certainty they have sought about the mechanism as soon as possible. While the GST will not apply until after 1 July 2005, the government certainly do wish to give industry enough time to finish their negotiations before then so that the price adjustment will be in place when supplies under these contracts become liable for the GST.</para>
<para>As I said, it seems that we are in furious agreement, apart from a couple of minor amendments. I should mentionâbecause it has taken up a great deal of the time in this debateâthe GST, which has been a reality for a number of years. It really is astounding that the ALP would still seek to argue that they no longer support the GST and the revenue it provides to the states and territories. If that is the case, it should be clearly stated. As Senator Murray said, the states and territories are indubitably better off. The windfalls for state governments which have flowed from tax reform have been quite extraordinary and can be measured in billions of dollars.</para>
<para>With respect to the proposed amendments, we accept the second amendment with reservations because of the availability of qualified arbitrators and the complexity of some issues. In the interest of certainty for the industry, the government will accept this amendment, but I want to place on record the fact that my colleague Minister Brough does have some reservations about this. The government are not disposed to the first amendment. We think that it is more appropriate for arbitrators to be listed in regulations. Regulations will be made as soon as possible after the bill receives royal assent. The government are of the view that it is inappropriate for CPA Australia and the Institute of Chartered Accountants to be listed as arbitrators, because their members are of course very expert in their own field and are suitably qualified, perhaps more so as assessors. I have indicated the governmentâs attitude to the amendments in the hope that we might be able to deal with this legislation before question time.</para>

<para>âMy question is directed to Senator Vanstone, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in her capacity as minister for immigration. Can the minister explain why she has not responded to the community calls, including from the Rau family, for a full, open and transparent judicial inquiry into the case of Ms Rauâs 10-month detention by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs? Can the minister confirm that her chosen method of inquiry by former Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mr Mick Palmer will not have legal powers to compel the attendance of witnesses, will not be able to compel answers to questions, will not be able to administer an oath to witnesses, will not be able to compel production of documents or of items such as videotape footage, will not be able to protect witnesses or testimony, and that his report will not be protected from legal action such as defamation? Does the minister agree that the absence of these features may limit the capacity of Mr Palmerâs inquiry to have all the facts of the case fully considered and could undermine public confidence in the process?</para>

<para>âI thank the senator for his question. It is correct that the government and I have decided that it is appropriate to have an inquiry into this matter to ascertain whether there is anything that anybody in the Commonwealthâa Commonwealth contractor is included in thatâor any of the three state governments involved and the two agencies in each of those states, namely the police and mental health services, should have done that they did not do, or could have done in a better way or should not have done that they did.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We have selected Commissioner Palmer because of the respect with which he is held in the community. As you know, he is a former distinguished police commissioner, as I recall appointed by the Labor Party and then reappointedâI think it was on two occasions but, if not, on one occasionâby this side of politics. His integrity, certainly to my understanding and in my own mind, is beyond question.</para>
<para>I am also mindful of the unsolicited offer by Premier Beattie for his officials to cooperate with any inquiry. I would ask the Senate to be mindful of the Commonwealthâs unsolicited remarks that, when New South Wales indicated that they would usually have an inquiry when a missing person matter is concluded, we would cooperate freely with that. I am mindful of the remarks by Dr Phillips, who is in charge of mental health services in South Australia, and of the cooperation that he has always received from immigration officials, in particular at Baxter, and of his willingness to get to the bottom of these matters.</para>
<para>Given that there is such a willingness by officialsâand I would be very surprised if there were notâto get to the bottom of this, I think the sooner we can get to the bottom of whether there is anything better that could have been done, the better. As a consequence, there will be a private inquiry headed by Mr Palmer. There have been other inquiriesâfor example, the Flood inquiry is one that comes to mindâthat have worked in the same way and been effective. I look forward to the outcome of that inquiry being made public. Obviously, whether or not I think it is fairâand I happen to think it is fairâwhen the inquiry has concluded people will then be able to judge whether it has been appropriate. Certainly, I leave the way open for Mr Palmer to raise it with the Commonwealth if he has the slightest whiff or suspicion that he is not getting full cooperation from state and federal authorities. We will then look at the matter. But the understanding I have from discussions I have had with officials and from what has been reported to me from state authorities is that there is no-one in existence who does not want to find out what they could have done better if they could have, and what they should not have done if they did.</para>

<para>âMr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for her answer but I refer her to the original question, which she failed to answer and which is: can the minister confirm that her chosen method of inquiry will not have legal powers to compel the attendance of witnesses, will not be able to compel answers to questions, will not be able to administer an oath to witnesses, will not be able to compel production of documents or items such as video footage, will not be able to protect witnesses or testimony and that the report will not be protected from legal action? Minister, what is the answer to those questions? Why have you chosen to go down a route where the inquiry does not have those powers? Further, what powers does the inquiry have to call the attendance of and evidence from ministers and ministerial staff? Why have you not given the inquiry the sorts of powers that would seem to be so necessary in a case like this?</para>

<para>âWith respect, Senator, since you have asked the question again, I will answer it again. It is a private inquiry, the nature of which you have just indicated you do understand and that you therefore did understand the answer. In a nutshell, the answer I gave you was that I believe there has been an expression of more than willingness by all agencies to cooperate, and I expect that there will be. Therefore there is no need to take the inquiry to a higher level. I believe that all witnesses that are required will attend, that they will answer honestly and that Mr Palmer will not need to compel the production of evidence. I further believe that people will tell the truth. As I have said, if Mr Palmer is uncertain of that during the course of the inquiryâ <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThe Australian Defence Force is continuing to provide vital support to the Iraqi people through this difficult election period and the transition to full sovereignty. Our personnel have done an outstanding job in helping to establish security and deal with the insurgency in such a dangerous environment. I am pleased to advise the Senate that the three security detachment personnel who were injured when their unit was attacked by a suicide bomber last month have now returned to Australia and are continuing with their treatment. We obviously wish them a full and speedy recovery.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>On behalf of the government, I take the opportunity to pass on our condolences to the family and friends of former RAAF officer Flight Lieutenant Paul Pardoel, who was killed in action recently while serving with the Royal Air Force in Iraq. I extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, to his children and to his family and friends for their loss. We join them in mourning the tragic death of such a highly respected fellow Australian. His sacrifice was not in vain. Through the British military he served the coalition in the fight for democracy, for the freedom of the Iraqi people and for an end to the cruelty that they have endured for so long.</para>
<para>The clear majority of Iraqi people have shown their determination for this democratic process to succeed by braving intense intimidation from the insurgents to exercise their right to vote. The turnout for the election exceeded expectations. It is expected to be as high as 60 per cent. It is a big step in the right direction. I congratulate the Iraqi people on their incredible courage in putting their lives on the line to achieve their goals.</para>
<para>I would also, however, like to take this opportunity to extend the condolences of, I am sure, all honourable senators to the family and friends of Australian Federal Police protective service officer Adam Dunning following his tragic death while serving with RAMSI, the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. The government and all Australians were shocked and saddened to learn of the fatal shooting of this exemplary officer, who served his country with great distinction. We have since boosted our military force to ensure the rule of law is restored in the Solomons and the significantâin fact, extraordinaryâprogress achieved by RAMSI continues.</para>
<para>Our personnelâDefence, police and other agenciesâwho are serving in operations have done an outstanding job for our country, for the coalition in Iraq and for our friends in the region. The government is determined to continue the fight against terror in all its forms and to work cooperatively in the region to help our neighbours, and through that to help make Australia a safer place.</para>

<para>âMy question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. I refer the minister to a media statement in which she said that it âis a tragic case, but one that has been resolved, giving comfort to the womanâs familyâ. Can the minister explain to the Senate what comfort the Rau family can obtain from the wrongful detention for 10 months of its seriously ill family member? If the minister really wants to give comfort to the family, will the minister now commit to holding a fully independent, open and public inquiry, as requested by the Rau family?</para>

<para>âI thank the senator for the question. In the context of the question you raise about giving comfort to the family, I think that is unquestionable. The fact that Ms Rau was found and was safe, albeit with a pre-existing mental condition, must be of indescribable comfort to the family, who for a significant period of timeâsome eight months or soâhad not known whether their daughter and sisterâand I understand that her sister has made some remarks in respect to this matterâwas alive and well.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The family have indicated, as I understand it, some regret that Ms Rau was not notified earlier as a missing person. I can understand them feeling that but I can also understand it not happening. If you were responsible for a person with a pre-existing mental conditionâwho, according to my advice, has in the past left Australia on a German passport without notifying anyone and then returnedâand they went missing you would not immediately go to missing persons. I understand that position, but I can understand their feelings as well. My remarks with respect to the familyâs relief were to do with the fact that she has been found and is safe.</para>

<para>âMr President, I ask a supplementary question. The minister has not taken us to the real question of why she is so determined to prevent the inquiry from being fully public, open and transparent. She should ensure that due process in fact occurs. Isnât it the case that a closed inquiry will be unable to investigate the operation of the minister, the acting minister for immigration, Mr Peter McGauran, and the ministerâs own office and staff? Isnât it the case also that protection from self-incrimination may not be available to the witnesses and they might receive legal advice that they should not cooperate with the inquiry? What processes have you put in place to ensure that that will not happen and that contractors and DIMIA officials will cooperate fully with the inquiry? If none of that is in the terms of the inquiry, what powers does it have?</para>

<para>âWith respect, your question does tempt me to express some disappointment in the political and parliamentary process since it does appearâand forgive me for misjudging you if this is not the caseâthat your primary interest, in what is clearly such a tragic case, is a political one. In contrast, I am determined to get to the bottom of what happened vis-a-vis Ms Rau. I am satisfied that the process we have put in place is an appropriate process. I indicated in my answer to your leader that if at any point Mr Palmerâin whom I presume you have confidence and trust since your previous government appointed him and he is very widely regarded as a man of great integrityâhas a concern about the appropriateness of the evidence that he is able to obtain, I invite him to raise it with the government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>âI thank Senator Fifield for that good question and acknowledge his great interest in matters relating to the economy. Australiaâs economy is now in better shape than it has been for decades. We have interest rates on mortgages of 7.05 per cent, compared to an average of 12.75 per cent under our predecessors. The annual inflation rate is 2.6 per cent, down from an average of 5.2 per cent under the previous government. We have paid off $73 billion of the $96 billion of debt we inherited. Unemployment is down to 5.1 per cent, the lowest it has been since November 1976. The share market gained 23 per cent in the course of 2004, and on 30 December the share market reached an all-time record high.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We have a number of positive business surveys showing a lot of confidence in the business sector. The NAB business survey showed that corporate profitability reached record levels in October and November. The census survey of small and medium businesses showed confidence about the next 12 months at record highs. We have seen record sales for the Australian car industry. Consumer confidence is at its second highest level in the last 30 years. Only last week the highly respected OECD released its economic survey of Australia, which included a very strong endorsement of the governmentâs economic management and this countryâs economic performance. That survey stated that Australia had become a model for other OECD countries. It praised the structural reforms introduced by successive governments and the medium-term macroeconomic framework introduced by our governmentâchanges that the OECD said had conferred an enviable degree of resilience and flexibility on the Australian economy. The OECD predicted a continuation of strong, low-inflation growth and continued low unemployment.</para>
<para>The OECD did have some very pertinent messages about the future for Australia. It highlighted that our two great long-term challenges are to raise living standards and to prevent the fiscal burden rising significantly in the face of an ageing population. In that respect, the OECD endorsed the governmentâs pro-growth approach to addressing the challenges posed by demographic change through increased work force participation and greater productivity. In keeping with that view, the OECD made it clear that the pace of reform needs to be continued if we are to maintain a strong economy.</para>
<para>I think it is worth referring to the suggestions the OECD had for reform in Australia. It specifically recommended further industrial relations reforms, including the simplification of awards and a lesser role for centralised wage fixing, basing safety net wage increases on productivity and the employability of low-skilled workers. It recommended reforms to unfair dismissal, continued water reform, ongoing efforts to encourage work force participation by older workers and the full sale of the governmentâs remaining shares in Telstra. It also recommended changes to the eligibility for the disability support pension, specifically to discourage welfare dependency and to encourage work force participation.</para>
<para>That is an agenda which this government will pursue during this term of office. We are determined to progress those reforms, and we would welcome the support of the opposition, with its new found interest in the economy, and indeed of the minor parties to ensure that the reforms recommended by probably the worldâs most prestigious independent economic consultancy are carried out. They are needed if we are to maintain the very great strength which we have built up in this economy over the last nine years.</para>

<para>âI thank the senator for the question. I am advised it was late in March when Ms Rau came to the attention of Queensland police somewhere near Coen. My advice is that she had in her possession a stolen passport, which I recall was Norwegian. She did not have another passport with her and she indicated to the policeâbut I have not seen the police reportsâthat she was a German national who was visiting Australia. They contacted Immigration because they believed that she might be an unlawful noncitizen. I do not think that was an unreasonable assumption for the Queensland police to have made. To paraphrase, I think Immigration agreed with that assessment and asked that she be detained. I am advised that happened in March.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In April there was at least one interview, possibly a numberâand I will certainly get you the chronologyâat, I believe, the Brisbane Womenâs Correctional Centre. That is where she was detained, although not in the first instance. She consistently maintained in interviews from that point onwards, both while she was in the Brisbane Womenâs Correctional Centre and later, that she was a German nationalâand she was correct in saying that, because I understand that she isâbut more particularly that she was a visitor from Germany, that she had come in on a three-month visa, that she had been visiting throughout Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland and that she had no relatives, friends or family who could be contacted in Australia, because she was a visitor.</para>
<para>I am advised that she went further than that and gave names for her parents. In one of the briefings I have read she indicated at some point they had changed their names due to a change in their lifestyle and she gave the name of someone she alleged was her boyfriend back in Germany. The German consul was contacted and saw her in early April, I think, but I will get you that date. As I understand it, there were a number of visits by the consul and by the consul general from Melbourne at another point. The advice we received was that her German grammar construction was childlike, as was some of her conversation, and there were intimations that her accent may in fact be something else, such as Russian or Polish. Nonetheless, the German consul and the consul general subsequent to that made significant efforts to ascertain whether there was an Anna Schmidt or Anna Brotmeyer and whether the parents or boyfriend could be located.</para>
<para>DIMIA, however, did not take it for granted that what Ms Rau was saying was correct and subsequentlyâI think it is fair to say when it appeared that that was not going to show fruitâcommenced a range of other checks. They did in April, for example, contact the Queensland Police Service Missing Persons Unit with the details we had at that point and, as I am advised, a photograph. But she was not listed as missing at that point and the police did quite the right thing in saying no, they did not have her listed. That may beg the question of whether in future we should shift to some sort of computerised mechanism for listing missing persons so that, if an inquiry is made where we have someone who may be a missing person, we can all be sure that it is fed into a system where, if an entry is subsequently made that someone is missing, it could be matched with a previous inquiry which had got a proper no at the time. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

Was that authority given when she was at Coen or Cairns? When she was transferred from Cairns to the Brisbane Womenâs Correctional Centre, was there a protocol in place for that and under what authority was that done? Where, and by whom, was she detained in Cairns and under what authority was she detained thereâwas it by DIMIA? These are the particular issues that I sought answers to with my question in the first instance. As to when DIMIA did issue instructions, is there a protocol in place with the Queensland police or other police services for this to happen? If there is, is it in writing and, if it is, can it be made available?</para>

<para>âSenator, I thought I answered your question by saying that the police contacted DIMIA because they believed or had reason to believe that she was an unlawful noncitizen and DIMIA agreed with that and asked that she be detained. I have indicated I will get you the dates of that. In a supplementary question you have asked about her being shifted at some point from what I presume is a watch-house to the Brisbane Womenâs Correctional Centre and then under what authority she was shifted. You will be aware that Australian legislation requires that unlawful noncitizensâthat is, those who do not have any visa or bridging visaâbe detained. I will get you the answers to those questions.</para>

<para>âHonourable senators and Senator Allison will know that this is a very detailed question and the responsibility of mental health is a responsibility particularly of the states. The Commonwealth has taken a lead role in addressing issues of mental health, but accommodation and treatment for people with mental health problems is a state health issue. There have been some significant changes in the way in which people have been treated. There was a move to deinstitutionalise people, I think, 15 or 20 years ago. I have to say personally, with my professional background, I was not necessarily in total agreement. I had seen in the United States where this had led to homelessness. With my hat on as Minister for Family and Community Services, one of the factors in the cause of homelessness is the fact that we do not have appropriate state facilities for people who are incapable of providing for themselves in the activities of general day-to-day living.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I think it is an issue that needs to be addressed, particularly by the states, but I do not think that you can take the one incidence that Senator Vanstone is being asked questions about as an example that everything is failing. There are some very good systems and particularly some of our nongovernment organisations that are delivering high-quality care to people with mental health problems. We have undertaken a range of measures from the Commonwealth. For example, there are our programs running in schools to train high school teachers to identify children and young people at risk and to work with them. There are now thousands of teachers trained within the state systems, through a Commonwealth program, to identify young people at risk and to also encourage young people who believe they have a problemâfor example, depression or behaviour that they feel is differentânot to be embarrassed about it and that it is an illness like a physical illness. I think we have shown leadership in the mental health area that was lacking before. One can always do more, but I also think the states need to address more carefully the care and residential care of those people who are in a situation where they are not able to care for themselves.</para>

<para>âMr President, I ask a supplementary question. If mental health is entirely the responsibility of the states, why is it that we have a national mental health strategy which is basically failing us, as this case demonstrates? Minister, I think we would like to know: how many detainees have become sick because of your governmentâs mandatory and indefinite detention policies; and how many have now been found to be genuine refugees and released with no access to Medicare but with serious mental health problems, many of whom did not have them when they went into detention? Minister, why is your government still arguing with the South Australian government over a memorandum of understanding with that government for mental health services for asylum seekers at Baxter? Why has it taken 12 monthsâand still there is no agreement? What has that lack of agreement meant to this case?</para>

I gave the example of the MindMatters program. I could go through a whole range of them. Some are stored in my memory, others I would have to go back to a brief for. Another example is the GP program, the mental health program, where patients can now see a GP, and GPs can refer people to psychologists. There are an enormous number of measures that we have undertaken in the areas of our responsibility.</para>

<para>âI might take the opportunity, if the senator will forgive me, to answer part of her question and give time to answer a question from Senator Ludwig that related to a memorandum of understanding between DIMIA and the police in Queensland. I understand that a memorandum of understanding or protocol has been under discussion for some time, but I also understand that the practices that were followed are well established practices and that both sides have simply been trying to articulate those in a written form.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As to your question, Senator, about the date of photographs and fingerprints: I will have to take that on notice and get that if that was done. I indicated in the earlier answer that DIMIA did contact the Queensland Police Service Missing Persons Unit with details and photographs and the response came back as no, and that is because she was not listed as missing at the time. There were some subsequent discussions with a whole range of state and federal authorities on the basis that Ms Rauâs story about being German may not in fact hold upâpeople in Births, Deaths and Marriages, Centrelink and a whole range of agencies. I understand these were formal inquiries and I will be able to give you the dates and details of those.</para>
<para>It is worth mentioning, although you did not directly ask about it, that there was an occasion when New South Wales contacted DIMIA, and I understand that was two DIMIA people outposted to New South Wales police for the purposes of dealing with movement discussions, asking about the movements of a Ms Rau on a German passport. She had left Australia in the past on a passport without informing her family. The first inquiry from them, however, related to whether she was an Australian citizen or an Australian permanent resident. That was just a process inquiry, which was answered, and the next was a process inquiry dealing with possible travel movements vis-a-vis a passport. The dates of inquiries with other state and federal agencies would be quite detailed. DIMIA was consistently trying to establish her identity both in the German context, through the consul and our embassy, and with state and federal authorities, and I will get you the details of that answer.</para>

<para>âI think it is very clearâI am sure it is clearâthat the identity of Ms Rau was established as a consequence of an article in the paper about a German-speaking woman who was in immigration detention. The advice I have is that a friend of the family noticed the article, wondered if it could be Ms Rau, contacted the family and, subsequently, photos were exchanged and the identification was made. I was told by an adviserâI do not have the specific date, but I think it was pretty much instantaneously to it having happened. I was pleased to hear that we had established who it was, both because we were concerned who it was and because it obviously gives an enormous sense of relief to a family that has had someone missing for eight months.</para>

<para>âSenator, in relation to your first question: the details in relation to health issues in the detention of Ms Rau first, to my knowledge and understanding and belief, came to the attention of my office in January. However, indirectly, Ms Rauâs caseâas opposed to Ms Brotmeyerâs case, that was the issue raised in January; it is still listed under Ms Brotmeyerâcame to the attention of some people in DIMIA, in my office. I understand that towards Christmas Ms Rau sought an intervention under 417âI have not yet seen the letter; I only found out about this earlier todayâwhich of course is not appropriate because she is not in a position of having a visa that has been refused and there has not been an appeal process. A reply was sent. She also wrote to someoneâI do not have the nameâin relation to Australian citizenship at around the same time. I can get you the details of that. I am quite happy to do that.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In response to the proposition that you put that this ill womanâclearly she wasâwas held in detention, can I remind you that she attended the Princess Alexandra Hospital for, I think, a week. She had an assessment by someone who has been described by mental health authority officials in South Australia as being one of the most prominent people in this field in Queensland. The diagnosis came back that the woman did not exhibit the diagnostic criteria for a mental illness. So presumably you do not want DIMIA officials second-guessing a professional assessment that has been done. Nonetheless, with that having happened in August, I think, within days of her coming she was seeing the psychologist and the GP, who indicated that we should get the psychiatrist to see her. That happened within about a month. It is at that point that we contacted the South Australian health authorities because, under the protocol that is not yet signed but is agreed on this aspect, where we have such concerns there is an appropriate section for DIMIA to contact to outline those concerns and pass the information on. The middle of November is the point at which DIMIA officials, after the visit from the psychiatrist, believed that it was appropriate to get an assessment in an institution and were seeking, according to the protocol, an assessment by Glenside with a view to ascertaining whether it was appropriate to admit her.</para>
<para>A journalist said to me, âWhy donât you just send her there?â as if she has no say in this. People who have a behavioural or personality disorder are nonetheless capable in many instances of deciding and/or agreeing on whether to be sectioned. I can assure you that she had been seen by the GPs and the psychiatrist. There was a reluctance to section her. She did not want to go. That was the basis of some of the discussions with South Australian mental health authorities. Contrary to the belief that some advocates would have, DIMIA and the officials were working with South Australian authorities to work out the best way to handle this matter. The date of the fax that I have seenâwhich obviously comes after a number of phone calls discussing the matterâthat forwarded this information to South Australian mental health authorities is in the middle of November.</para>

<para>âWhat I have indicated is that officialsâwhich includes the contracted health authoritiesâwere concerned as to her health and believed that her problems may have exceeded those which could be described as personality or mere behavioural issues and were seeking to have that matter assessed. They did not conclude that they knew what the problem was. They concluded that we needed to get a proper assessment. Under the memorandum of understandingâwhich is not yet signed, but this aspect, I understand, is agreedâofficials contacted the appropriate agency or section within South Australian mental health. There was some disagreement about whether it was appropriate to send her to Glenside against her will and whether it was appropriate that further assessment be undertaken with a GP and a psychologist present and with a psychiatrist present by phone.

<para>âI thank the senator for the question. I have seen some remarks by Mr Harley, who is the South Australian Public Advocate and who is known to me. The Public Advocate is someone who may well seek to become a guardian of someone who is in institutional care in South Australia. That of course takes us directly back to the question asked by Senator Brown. The process was being followed to ascertain whether in fact it was appropriate to commit, or section, Ms Rau to Glenside. If that had happened, Mr Harleyâs authority would have come into play because there would be a person in the care of South Australian mental health, but that had not happened.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>That is a matter that I think the inquiry will want to look at, and there are two aspects to it: one is the manner in which it was dealt with by South Australian mental health authorities and the other is whether immigration officials or other officials should have sought to intervene or harass or cajole or remind South Australian officials that they had the material and that we were waiting for a response sooner than they did. They did in fact do that in early January. They sent a letter and had further telephone conversations, with the letter concluding with words to the effect, âCould we please have an indication of the appropriate way in which to handle Ms Rau.â Once she was in Glenside Mr Harleyâs authority would come into play, but until then he is the South Australian Public Advocate.</para>
<para>You asked me whether I am aware of him having contacted DIMIA in December. My answer to that at this point is no. I am aware that he indicated he had made contact. At this point the advice I have is that he made some contact with one person in the department after Ms Rau had been actually shifted to Glenside. One of the facts in this matter that needs to be made clear is that Ms Rau did not go to Glenside because of the publicity or because we subsequently found out that she was an Australian permanent resident. She went to Glenside because the process started by immigration officials and health officials employed by Immigration in November came to fruition. Officials at Glenside agreed that they would in fact make an assessment even if she was not sectioned. Then, in the last few days, there was an agreement that there would be another mechanism to do it through Baxter. But this visit to Glenside and her now being in Glenside would have happened in any event. What would not have happened if advocates had not raised itâor it may not have happened so quicklyâis our discovery of who Ms Rau really is.</para>

<para>âYes, I can indicate when I first heard, although I cannot specifically give you the date. I believe I was watching a news service and saw Mr Harley commenting. Mr Harley is entitled to put whatever views he chooses as an Australian citizen, but his jurisdiction relates to South Australia and people in the care of South Australian mental health authorities. We were already well into the process of establishing when in fact that would happen. I cannot give you the date of that.</para>

<para>As to Dr Phillips, I invite you to look at subsequent remarks by Dr Phillips. He made it very clear that he is not the operational person.

<para>âAs one who comes from the land in rural and regional South Australia, Senator Ferguson would be well aware that bushfires are indelibly part of the Australian landscape and they have been that way, of course, for thousands of years. They are a natural disaster. But I think we all acknowledge that the severity of the bushfires is ultimately the result of land management issues and land use decisions made by people. Senator Ferguson would also be well aware of the tragedy that occurred on 11 January on the Eyre Peninsula, as he mentioned. It was a fire that cost the lives of nine Australians, and 82,700 hectares of farmland were burnt and destroyed.</para>

I think also that all senators would join me in commending the volunteer bush firefighters who put their lives at risk to save the lives and property of others. There were so many people who helped at that time and who deserve commendation. I mention in particular the 9th Brigade of the Australian military forcesâpeople we are all very proud about for many reasons. They again did a marvellous job. Those reservists in our defence forces, along with many other volunteers, were very much involved in the clean-up operations.</para>
<para>The Eyre Peninsula bushfires, like the Canberra bushfires in January a couple of years ago and many before that, provide an opportunity for the government and land managers to learn from the experiences to try and reduce the risk of similar events occurring in the future. I am proud to say that the Howard government has taken a leading role in looking for better management options. You will recall that we set up the Nairn inquiry into bushfires. We were also instrumental in getting the COAG inquiry going. Primary responsibility for bushfires, of course, is a matter for state and territory governments, but the Howard government has led the way, contributing some $16Â½ million to the National Aerial Firefighting Centre and $24 million to assist local communities to better prepare for bushfires with fire trail construction, maintenance of signage, bushfire research and bushfire awareness and preparedness initiatives. All governments should consider and implement the recommendations of the Nairn inquiry and the COAG inquiry to ensure that the chances of these devastating bushfires occurring in the future are significantly reduced. I certainly do commend to the state governments the recommendations of the Nairn inquiry, which took over 500 submissions, most of them from volunteer firefighters.</para>
<para>It is with some regret that I mention that volunteer firefighters are today protesting outside the Supreme Court of the ACT because the ACT government is trying to shut down the inquiry into the Canberra region bushfires of a couple of years ago. That is quite unprecedented. In fact, I am surprised that Senator Brown has not asked a question on this. The ACT government is trying to shut down its own inquiry, to go against the decisions of its own inquiry. One wonders why the ACT government is doing that. I support these volunteers. The ACT government is taking this step to protect itself from the adverse findings of its management during the Canberra firestorm. State governments are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of public lands, including national parks, and this is one of the problems. State governments love the kudos of locking up production forests into reserves, but they never put enough money into their management, and as a result we have these firestorms. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âMy question is directed to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Minister, it is still not clear to me when you first became aware of Ms Rauâs case as the result of a number of questions that have been asked of you. Could you clarify for the Senate when your office became aware of Ms Rauâs case and the concerns about her health, be it under her proper name or the name she was using? When did your office inform you of concerns about her and her potential treatment et cetera? On what date did you become aware that the detainee was Ms Rau and that in fact she was not an illegal immigrant but a permanent resident of this country? What form did that communication to you come in? What action did you take as a result of being informed that Ms Rau was in fact a permanent resident of Australia and should not have been detained? Were you at any time concerned, or were concerns raised with you, about any aspect of the treatment of Ms Rau during her time in the custody of DIMIA?</para>

<para>âI indicated in the answer to Senator Brown, and in any event I will repeat it, that I was advised today that at some point in December, towards ChristmasâI do not know the exact date, but I will get it for youâa letter was sent by Ms Brotmeyer seeking what I believe was a 417 intervention, which of course was completely inappropriate, given her circumstances, and that she had written some other correspondence to someone else in relation to Australian citizenship. I will get you the date of that, but that was not in relation to the detention and health issues; it was simply in relation to a view she was clearly expressing that, presumablyâI have not seen the letter yetâshe wanted a 417 intervention. That letter had not come to my attention until today, which is not surprising as lots of people seek ministerial intervention. The process is that, when the letters come to the office, they go straight to the department for the department to gather the information, make a decision about what needs to happen and then prepare the appropriate files.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As to the date that I was notified, I have indicated that I was notified either the day or the next day. Frankly, when it happened, I did not say to myself: âQuick, I better note the date. Someone will ask me if it is Thursday or Friday.â I felt a tremendous sense of reliefâbut I imagine it was nothing like the relief that her family feltâthat this matter had been resolved, that someone who had been missing had now been found.</para>
<para>The last matter that you raised was about a permanent resident who you say should not have been detained because they were a permanent resident. I ask you to consider the relevant act, which refers to having a belief that someone is an unlawful noncitizen, and in fact Ms Rau presented herself as a person from Germany who was visiting and who wanted to go back to Germany. She did not present as a permanent resident of Australia. Efforts were made through both the German consul and consul general and a range of authoritiesâand I have already indicated my willingness to give the details of the authorities that were contacted and whenâto ascertain if Ms Rauâs story was in fact incorrect and if she was either an Australian citizen or an Australian permanent resident. I have already answered that aspect.</para>

<para>âMr President, I ask a supplementary question. Maybe I am not getting my point across, but I was not really interested in whether it was a Thursday or a Friday that the minister notified; I was after the date. Given the public controversy, I thought it was a reasonable question to know when the minister found out about Ms Rauâs case, whether or not she had concerns raised with her at any stage about the medical treatment or the condition of Ms Rau and whether she had any concerns about that. Clearly, we would appreciate the minister answering when she or her office became informed that Ms Rau wasâas the government now admitsâinappropriately detained. I do not think there is any argument that she was inappropriately detained. I accept that it was an argument about not knowing her identity, but I am not clear, Minister, despite all the questions asked of you today, when you as the minister were informed that Ms Rau was in fact a permanent resident and should not have been detained, and what action you took.</para>

I indicated to you why that belief was heldânamely, she maintained, in effect, that that is what she was. It is quite clear now that she was not an unlawful noncitizen.

<para>âSenator Bartlett, I have already indicated that Ms Rau now being in Glenside and having what we assume is appropriate care is not a function of advocates repeating things that they presumably got from people who were in Baxterâwho, incidentally, are not all asylum seekers; some are simply overstayers who are pursuing some legal means of staying in Australia. It was not because they blew the whistle that this matter came to the attention of immigration officials or became their concern. As I have indicated repeatedly, the Queensland police must have had some concerns, because my advice is that while she was in the Brisbane Womenâs Correctional Centre she was sent to the Princess Alexandra Hospital and an assessment was made there by someone whose qualifications I am not in a position to dispute, nor do I know anyone who wants to. When she went to Baxter, she was seen by a psychologist and thenâI think at the psychologistâs suggestion but, in any event, not long afterâby a psychiatrist, who recommended that a proper assessment be made through the proper processes, and that process was started in November.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As to the asylum seekers giving evidence, I will give consideration to that. I will take that on notice and get back to you. I do repeat, however, our determination to get to the bottom of this. I repeat that if former Commissioner Palmer has the slightest concernâand he would be in a better position than most of us to detect who is telling the truth and who is not, given a lifetime of experience at thatâhe is invited to raise it with the government. We are determined to find out if there is anything we could have done better and if there is anything we did that we should not have done. I assume that the good faith expressed by the state premiers concerned will be put into practice in terms of cooperation with this inquiry. I do not know anyone who is of bad faith in this matter.</para>

<para>âI move:</para>
</talk.start>
<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked today relating to the detention of Ms Cornelia Rau.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I say at the outset that what the government has in fact outlined today in the answers given by Senator Vanstone is that the immigration detention system does have massive cracks and that Ms Rau seems to have fallen through every single one of them. Rather than go through, one by one, the issues of what happened so that we can understand the systemic failure that the immigration detention system seems to have had in relation to Ms Rau, rather than go through the dates when things happenedâhow many times DIMIA has in fact tried to establish her identity, when she was detained and on what basis she was detainedâwhat we have had is a general version of broad events and an appeal to the heart from Senator Vanstone. No-one doubts that it is a terrible case, that this woman deserves sympathy and that her friends and family similarly deserve sympathy. But what they also deserve is the truth in relation to this matter, the truth in relation to how it is going to actually play out.</para>
<para>Instead, we find Senator Vanstone went to a press conference today before question time and failed to articulate how this inquiry will get to the bottom of these issues. She failed to identify what powers Mick Palmer will haveâwhether he will have the ability to compel witnesses and protect witnesses; whether he will even have transcripts of the proceedings; and whether he can ask not only the department but the contractors, subcontractors and anyone else who might have an interest in this matter, who might have evidence and who might be able to shed light on the Rau matter. During the press conference, she did not say what those powers are and what the terms of reference are and provide them for public scrutiny. We do not know. There has been no answer.</para>
<para>Her statement from the press conference seems to be, âIâll go and check on it.â One would imagine that, if you are going to go to a press conference and announce an inquiry into a matter, you would have those things bedded down, you would know the answers to those issues. I suggest that she did not know the answers because there are no answers. She will not ensure that there is. In fact, it will be a whitewash, a cover-up. That is what it seems to beâno more, no less.</para>
<para>If you were going to have a proper inquiry, you would make it public, you would make it open, you would make it independent, you would have the terms of reference bedded down and you would have the powers of the person who will run the inquiry bedded down. You would ensure that you have transcripts and that you have protection for witnesses. You would ensure that there is also the ability to preserve evidence. You would ensure that, if there is evidence of offences being committed under the Migration Actâor any other criminal lawâthat evidence is not tainted, that people have the ability to come forward and provide evidence to the inquiry so that they are then not subject to and open to charges themselves. In other words, it should be made clear to them that there is the ability for either self-incrimination not to be available or privileges to be given so that they are not then subject to future defamation cases. Those are safeguards that ensure that these things become open and transparent.</para>
<para>Today we have heard a poor imitation of what could be a proper inquiry. There is no question that Mr Palmer is a good individual. We are not looking at Mr Palmer as an individual. I do not want to hear from the government that Mr Palmer is a well-respected person. There is no doubt about that. We want to hear from the government how they will ensure that they will get all the information on the record, that they will ensure that it is available and that it will be a comprehensive inquiry. We have not heard how they will achieve that.</para>
<para>When you look at all the detail that has been asked for today, you get a blurred statement from Senator Vanstone about how this will happen. You almost expect to hear, âTrust me to ensure that we will get to the bottom of this case.â Minister, we want to trust the system. The system has to be in place to ensure that there is no systemic failure. We do not want to trust anyone; we want to make sure that there is a system in place. Today the minister has been unable to articulate how that will work. It is a sad case. We need to ensure that the ministerâs office, her advisers, are able to turn up and provide evidence. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThis is a tragic case about a human being in unfortunate and very difficult circumstances. No-one seeks to avoid these facts. No-one seeks to portray it as anything other than a very regrettable incident. No-one shouldâand I hope no-one willâseek to make political capital out of the difficult circumstances of Ms Rau, and I sincerely hope that the opposition will not seek to do so.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>At this stage of the incident, it is probably premature to offer an apology. The important thing is to establish the facts and see if there was anything more that could have been done in the case of Ms Rau. To that end, Minister Vanstoneâwho has advised the Senate todayâhas announced the details of an inquiry into Ms Rauâs case. The minister has advised, as we have heard, that the distinguished former Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Palmer will conduct the inquiry. Senator Ludwig said that there was no need to discuss the integrity of Mr Palmer, the support that Mr Palmer has. But I think it is important to do so. It is important to ensure that we have on the record, from both the government and the oppositionâand I am pleased that Senator Ludwig has expressed confidence in former Commissioner Palmerâthat he is a distinguished former Australian Federal Police Commissioner. He was initially appointed by Labor when they were in office. He was reappointed by this government upon ascension to office.</para>
<para>I think it is worth taking time to note that former Commissioner Palmer is beyond reproach, and I think any criticisms of the inquiry do, in some way, seek to reflect upon Mr Palmer. I do not for one second think that Mr Palmer would seek to involve himself with an inquiry, would seek to conduct an inquiry, unless he felt that he had the tools, the authority and the resources to properly undertake that inquiry. Those who say, âWe support Mr Palmer, but we are not so sure about the inquiry,â should be very careful that they do not impugn Mr Palmerâs integrity. We can all have confidence in the independence of this inquiry because former Commissioner Palmer is in charge of it.</para>
<para>The minister also released today the terms of reference of this inquiry. They are as broad as they can be, but they focus on the central issues relating to the detention of Ms Rau: the interaction between the Commonwealth and state agencies, particularly police and mental health providers. It is important that this inquiry is a private inquiry. Absolutely, its findings must be made public. But it is important for Ms Rauâs privacy that it be a private inquiry. It is also important to ensure that the focus remains on establishing the facts and the sequence of events. We do not want distraction from establishing the sequence of events. What do we know thus far?</para>
<para>Let us deal with the substance, not the politics. There is a huge amount of misinformation currently circulating. There is understandable concern in the community. The community wants to get to the facts. We all understand the concerns of members of the community, the families and the parents of people with disabilities. We want to make sure that what happened here does not happen again. We hopeâand I am sure that it will be forthcomingâthat we will get the full cooperation of all four jurisdictions involved in this matter. Senator Vanstone has been very forthcoming. She has been totally upfront about when she was advised and when she first became aware of these matters.</para>
<para>But we have to make sureâI do not hold out hopeâthat we do not descend again into the oppositionâs tired old refrain of: what did you know, when did you know it and who did you tell? If we descend to that level of debate on this issue then we are really missing the point. The point is to establish the facts. It is only once we know the facts that we can establish whether there is something that should have been done that has not been done. It is only then, when we know the sequence of events, that we can determine what can be done to make sure that this does not happen again. Senator Ludwig wants to prejudge the inquiry. He wants to state already what he believes the facts to be. To be responsible we have to establish the sequence of events. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âIt is pretty clear from the answers given by Minister Vanstone and that contribution by Senator Fifield how the government proposes to deal with this serious issue and the serious questions being raised by the opposition and other members of the Senate. When we are asking legitimate questions about what occurred when, the sequence of events, when they were told and how come this was not brought to their attention we are told by Senator Fifield that we should not get bogged down in that sort of detail and that we should be focusing on the facts. Pardon me, Senator Fifield, but I would have thought that the Australian public have a right to know when the ministerâs office knew, whether they took any action and why these issues when raised by people such as the Public Advocate in South Australia were not drawn to the ministerâs attention or were not acted upon. The Australian public probably has a right to know the answers to those questions.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The other obvious tactic that both the minister and the senator have engaged in today is to seek to suggest that any criticism the opposition makes of the inquiry and the lack of powers associated with it is somehow a criticism of former Federal Police Commissioner Palmer. There is a straw man argument if I have ever heard one: in answer to any legitimate criticisms about the whitewash inquiry that has been put in place by this minister let us set up this argument that somehow the opposition is impugning somebody who is well respected on both sides of politics.</para>
<para>The minister failed to answer some serious questions in question time about the powers or lack of powers associated with this inquiry. That is not a criticism of former Commissioner Palmer. These are serious questions about things like how come the inquiry does not have the power to compel people to give evidence? Why has the inquiry not got the power to protect witnesses? If you have an employee of Baxter detention centre or a person who might, for whatever reason, be fearful of giving evidence to this inquiry, surely you would think that one of the things you would turn your mind to as the relevant minister in establishing an inquiry would be how to ensure that anybody who has relevant evidence can give evidence in an inquiry without fearâwithout any concern of victimisation or any retribution or defamation action or any of the various legal problems that could arise from giving such evidence. But has the minister dealt with this issue? Does her press release refer to issues like this: how do we actually ensure witnesses are protected in the same way that witnesses before Senate inquiries are protected? Is that dealt with? No, it is not. The only thing that is dealt with is the terms of reference.</para>
<para>When the opposition raise these legitimate questions, what do we get from the other side? What do we get from the minister and those senators on the other side who are lining up here to support her today? We get an accusation that somehow we are impugning Mr Palmerâs reputation. That is not the case. What we are saying is that there are some very serious questions associated with the case of Ms Rau. It is astonishing and distressing that a woman with a serious mental illness can have been in detention for so long without authorities becoming aware of who she was or correctly diagnosing her mental illness. It is tragic that this woman was placed in Baxter and that she was placed in solitary confinementâif the media reports are to be believedâfor a period of time. These are serious issues and the Australian public deserve an explanation. They deserve a full and open inquiry which is able to take evidence as needed and which is able to take evidence from people who might be fearful or concerned about giving evidence and so forth.</para>
<para>Finally, on this issue of playing politics, I heard the minister on a number of occasions, and various interjections by senators on the other side when we were raising legitimate questions about this issue, criticising the South Australian Mental Health Service, the Queensland police, and the Queensland hospital. I say to them: do not take the high and mighty ground here. From what we have seen in the chamber today there has been a great propensity on the other side of the chamber to blame anyone elseâany state official, state department or state governmentâfor what is a very concerning story which we must get to the bottom of. If Senator Fifield is going to talk about not playing politics I suggest there should be some discussion on that side of the chamber about not responding to any legitimate question that the opposition, the Greens or the Democrats raise on this issue by having a go at some state department. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThere we have it: the oppositionâs sole interest in this whole matter distils down to the fact that they anticipate a whitewash. That suits their political agendaâa whitewash is the allegation against this very respected and learned former commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. He has already been hung, drawn and quartered by the opposition in this place by the labelâthe epitaphâof a âwhitewashâ. This is a great tragedy that in todayâs Australia we can mistakenly, inadvertently or wrongfully incarcerate someone who is mentally ill and in circumstances where nobody has been able to accurately and reliably determine the truth for so long. Over many years, I have had some considerable experience with schizophrenia and those who suffer from this malady. In my experience it presents a very broad and often inconsistent group of outward patterns and manifestations in terms of conduct and personality traits. It is not easy to define or diagnose; it is not easy to detect in the personality of a person who may well be very adversely affected by this mental illness.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In these circumstances, my call to the opposition is to take the politics out of this situation. We must build into our system a response that protects people like Cornelia Rau from ever having this sort of thing happen to them. We need to be extra careful that our mechanisms for the identification of missing persons have some consistency and ease of access across state borders and boundaries.</para>
<para>When I look at what the facts appear to beâfrom newspapers, other reports and indeed from what the minister has saidâthe first issue that was confronting authorities in Australia was identification. People who know anything about those suffering from schizophrenia know that this is usually at the top of the list. Schizophrenics completely lose recollection of their context. So a woman saying that she is of German citizenship, speaking fluent German and identifying her parents would, on face value, have to be taken as being quite plausible. I must say that authorities would be very astute and completely out of the ordinary to be able to detect that as a false representation.</para>
<para>The next issue is, as I say, the extent and nature of the personâs mental incapacity. Schizophrenics are very difficult to diagnose. It takes a lot of knowledge and a lot of time with a subject to understand that they are not functioning normally intellectually. I must say that it strikes me as very odd that medical advice in South Australiaâand I do not cast aspersion on thisâwas that she was unsuitable to be admitted to the Glenside facility in South Australia. So, by all accounts, she presented to those who should know as a very difficult case.</para>
<para>All I want to say in closing is: let us get the facts, let us get the advice of the agencies involved and let us get the advice of the psychiatrists. It is not a matter for politics and it is not a matter that the opposition can seek to get any mileage out of. We must build protections into this system and learn from what we have seen and read about in the last week or so on the tragic case of Cornelia Rau.</para>

<para>âAt the outset, I have to say that I agree with the sentiments expressed by other senators here this afternoon that the case of Ms Cornelia Rau is a very sad and sorry story. It is tragic that this could have occurred to anyone in this country, whether they be an Australian citizen, an Australian resident or indeed somebody seeking asylum in this country. I believe the case of Ms Rau illustrates that there are a number of failures in the existing system. Firstly, there has been a failure in the identification of missing persons. That is quite clear. Secondly, there has been a failure on the part of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and a failure on the part of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in relation to the duty of care that she owes to all persons who are detained. Thirdly, there has been a failure of government policy generally in relation to mandatory detentionâand this case illustrates that quite well.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the case of Cornelia Rau, we have seen a systematic failure of the police and the health and immigration authorities seemingly at every turn. There was a failure to identify her as a missing person and there was a failure to identify the serious mental illness which she has now been diagnosed as having. This young woman was found wandering around in the desert, which the Aboriginals notified to police. She was then taken to Queensland, held there and then finally transferred to Baxter Detention Centre in my home state of South Australia where she was held for a period of four months until the situation that she was in and the series of failures that surrounded her case were made public.</para>
<para>Today I want to focus on the failures that have occurred in this case, particularly on the part of the department of immigration and the minister for immigration and, more broadly, the failure of government policy in this regard. On the question of the ministerâs duty of care and the duty of care that the department has, it is quite clear that the minister and the department owe a duty of care to everyone who is in immigration detention. It is quite clear that the minister and her office should have been alerted much earlier as to the manner in which this woman was being treated and there should have been an immediate intensive investigation into her circumstances. The fact that this did not occur, that she was held in immigration detention in South Australia for four months before anything happened, can only be described as a monumental failure of the system.</para>
<para>The second failure of the system clearly was in this womanâs diagnosis. Until quite recently, this woman was not diagnosed as having the serious mental illness that she does have. Senator Johnston referred to the fact that it is very difficult to diagnose mental illness, and I have no doubt about that, but my concern is that the persons who were treating Ms Rau were unable or unwilling to diagnose the serious mental condition that she had.</para>
<para>In the time I have left I wish to draw the Senateâs attention to the broader issue that we have here: the question of how many detainees are in detention centres in Australia who are suffering from a serious mental illness and who have not been properly diagnosed. Anyone who knows anything about mental illness knows just how debilitating it is. It can lead to incidents that we have seen in detention centres: sewing lips together, attempted suicide and the like. This is the broader issue that needs to be considered following on from this tragic story.</para>

<para>âI have heard some senators today say that we should take the politics out of this matter. I could not agree moreâit is a terrible story, a terrible ordeal that is still continuing for this woman and her familyâbut that should not be used as a way of trying to silence criticism. That is what this government is doing. We criticise what appears to have happened and we are abused and told, âYou are playing politicsâ. If that is the best defence that the government has, it is just going to keep saying it, but it is certainly not going to silence me or plenty of other people.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We owe it not just to this woman but to everybody who has been touched by mental illness to get to the bottom of this incident and to get some good from what is obviously a terrible situation: greater understanding, greater awareness and greater accountability for how people have been acting to date. You cannot get accountabilityâthe bottom lineâif you have a secret inquiry. If all the evidence is presented in secret you cannot have accountability. That is not a criticism of Mr Palmerâthat is not to say that he is not up to the jobâbut a simple fact: how can you have accountability, how can you increase public awareness and how can you have faith in the outcome, in an area where peopleâs trust has quite obviously been shaken, if you have a secret inquiry?</para>
<para>Obviously, if there is a matter that affects the privacy of Ms Rau, an inquiry can hold a session in private or not publish some evidence. But I have noticed that already, conveniently, stories are being put on the front page of some tabloids about her alleged activities in other parts of her life. I am sure there will be convenient bits of information put into the public arena to try to harm peopleâs sympathy for Ms Rau, playing on peopleâs lack of understanding of mental illnessâno concerns about her privacy there. I have too much experience with this government, and in this area of immigration in particular, using the excuse of privacy as a blanket to cover up everything. There is simply no way that it is an adequate excuse to say that privacy means that we should not have this inquiry in public. Secrecy about the evidence is unnecessary. If Mr Palmer is as good as the minister and the government insist he isâand I have no reason to think otherwiseâthen of course he can make a judgment as to when it is appropriate to have a session in private.</para>
<para>There is no legal protection for the evidence that is given. What if somebodyâperhaps somebody who has worked in these facilities and is involved in any aspect of this caseâwants to report some wrongdoing somewhere? They will have no legal protection for their evidence. They will have no protection against ramifications. It is a massive disincentive to tell the truth if you do so in private and you know you have no protections.</para>
<para>In question time today I asked the minister: can the asylum seekers, the detainees who are the key to this womanâs identity being established, tell what they saw? The ministerâs answer basically was âIâll think about thatâ. Could she give a guarantee that, if they give evidence, the evidence of these peopleâwho are living in fear of being deported every day of the week and who are in a detention facility behind closed doors where all sorts of consequences can be played out on them for giving evidenceâwill draw protection? No. When she was asked, âWill Mr Palmer be able to examine allegations of mistreatment of other people in Baxter detention centre to try to determine whether there is a pattern?â she said, âNo; we are going to quarantine this as much as possible and keep everybody else out of it.â</para>
<para>I have had allegations of mistreatment repeatedly made to me over the years. In relation to mental health I have had allegations made to me just in the last week about people trying to get into Baxter with an independent psychiatric assessment and being told not only no but also âif you try to push this we will ban you from even coming to this centre at allâ. I do not know whether that is true but I have plenty of reason to assume that it is. If that is the way people are treated when they are trying simply to establish the wellbeing of people in detention centres, is it any wonder that situations like this have happened?</para>
<para>There is no doubt that if it were not for those asylum seekers Ms Rauâs identity would not have been established. She may have ended up in Glenside but she still would have been an immigration detainee within that facility, with all the consequences that go along with that. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</motion>
<para class="block">We reflect upon a natural event that was certainly the most severe tsunami in the last 40 years, but some would say that the humanitarian disaster that followed was almost unprecedented in our times. The estimated death toll is truly appalling and it continues to grow. It is put at over 280,000. Clearly, the exact death toll will never be known. Latest estimates are that Indonesia has lost more than 160,000 citizens, with 120,000 deaths already confirmed. Sri Lanka has lost over 31,000, India over 15,000 and Thailand over 5,000.</para>
<para>Other countries, including the Maldives, Malaysia, Somalia and the Seychelles, were also heavily affected. Whole communities have been obliterated. Eighteen people from Australiaâ12 citizens and six permanent residentsâhave been confirmed to have lost their lives and we continue to hold grave concerns for nine more Australians. At this difficult time, our thoughts are very much with the families and friends of those who were lost.</para>
<para>It has been a real test for the international community. Much has come from the event that has been commendable. I am very proud as one Australian that there were so many who so quickly moved to help our neighbours in the days that followed the disaster. I think first of the public servants who so quickly came together. We are talking of an event that occurred the day after Christmas, so it certainly was an unhelpful time of the year for gathering services to support the response to such an event. Through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Federal Police and other agencies, many public servants and others immediately came together to help Australians who feared that they had lost relatives, to help those who were injured as a result of the event and to provide consular services in relation to those who were lost.</para>
<para>The response of Australian agenciesâand we obviously tend to focus on Australian agenciesâhas been truly remarkable. Senator Ellison is going to take the opportunity in this debate to talk a little about the contribution of the Federal Police. I particularly wanted to make mention, not surprisingly, of the role that was assumed by the Australian Defence Force. Once again, our defence community came to the fore and did an amazingly good job. I never cease to be amazed, I have to say, that, as has occurred on other occasions, as soon as news of the event hit the radios and television, ADF personnel started to phone inâparticularly those involved with the C130 transports and the medical teams that did the same sort of work after such incidents as the Bali bombing, the earthquake in Iran and others. They were immediately telephoning in and saying, âI assume that we are needed. When and where do you want us?â</para>
<para>So, very shortly after we as a government made the decision to particularly focus our efforts on Sumatra and had established the correct communication with TNIâwhich was to take a lead in the response in Indonesiaâand with the government authorities, we were able to put C130s in the air and start ferrying aid and support to the people of Sumatra and, with the support of the Indonesian authorities, directly into Banda Aceh. With the initial aid we were also able to ferry in the first of the emergency medical teams. We were also able to ferry in a United Nations assessment team, which was going to provide an assessment to New York in support of the efforts that were being made by the UN to mobilise the international community in their area of responsibility.</para>
<para>We quickly established the correct relationship with TNI and the Indonesian government. Indonesia was obviously to take the lead and we were there to assist and support. Our assistance and support was very much welcomed. We established a staging base in Medan in northern Sumatra. Australians, as they do, immediately got to work and took things one step further. We established a coordinating mechanism for flights into Aceh, not only dealing with Indonesian and Australian flights but those of other donors, who were quickly starting to arrive. That provided a coordinated base for getting aid into Aceh.</para>
<para>The ADF then established a coordinating mechanism between the TNI and international aid agencies in order that the work of the aid agencies could be coordinated. It was obvious from the very beginning that the challenge of coordinating this massive assistance movement was going to be a great one. The Australian Defence Force was there assisting from the beginning. We have maintained that air bridge between Australia and Aceh using the C130s and chartered aircraft from the time the first flight arrived. Movements were challenging into Aceh. I understand that before the disaster Banda Aceh normally had six flights a day. After the disaster, air movements went up to some 250 a day. With the support of Malaysia, the ADF then established a further staging base in Butterworth, which would take pressure off Medan and provide another way in which we could ferry our assistance into Aceh.</para>
<para>We then provided four Iroquoi helicopters for the transport of aid out of Banda Aceh to the outlying areas. With this mechanism in place, both the C130s and the helicopters were able to ferry aid in and take displaced persons out. Working closely with the TNI, we provided our force support and did most of the very unpleasant work in relation to the recovery and burying of bodies. The TNI general whom I spoke to up there made mention to me that they had buried 87,000 bodies by the time I reached Aceh. The Australians then helped establish a hospital capability, and I think all of us have seen on the television the fantastic work that the Australian military doctors, nurses and other health professionalsâmany of them reservistsâhave done between the disaster and today. They are now getting to the point where they can start passing that responsibility on to civilians.</para>
<para>We also quickly realised that to avoid disease what was needed most urgently was clean water. Therefore, again almost from day one, Australian Army engineers established a plant for the manufacture of clean water, and that has continued until this day. In fact, we have now just passed that responsibility across to the Red Cross. The engineers have done a fantastic job and kept many Indonesians alive. It has been much appreciated by the Indonesian people. I heard one lovely story of an elderly Indonesian lady who was in the queue to collect her clean water. She looked up at an Australian soldier and said, âThanks, mate.â Australian soldiers doing this sort of work create a lot of friends. There is no doubt about that at all.</para>
<para>By that time we had decided that further engineers were needed and we made a decision to deploy a further 150 engineers and their heavy earthmoving equipment in the <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla.</inline> They were obviously going to support the huge clean-up task in Banda Aceh, and they have now been doing that very unpleasant but essential work for some weeks, again providing a more healthy environment for the people of Aceh. Taking the <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline> also meant that we had the capacity to provide further health capabilities and two Sea King helicopters with a longer range and heaver load facility.</para>
<para>The Australian military were by this time also assisting with air traffic control in Banda Aceh. They are obviously very experienced and accomplished in that particular task. Over 1,000 Australian personnel, both permanent forces and reservists, have been part of this operation. They have done an outstanding job, and they have been well supported by those behind the scenes, both in uniform and civilian, who deserve credit but often do not get it. They have all played a part in this extraordinarily successful operation in Aceh to help the Indonesian people in a moment of great need, and they have been well supported by other agenciesâand I particularly make mention of the diplomatic staff operating out of Jakarta. Their work has been superb as well.</para>
<para>This clearly has been a terrible experience for the Indonesian people. The recovery task will be hugely challenging but, as you know, Mr Deputy President Ferguson, Australia is committed through the long-term and historically large fund that has been established to stay with Indonesia during the task of reconstruction. We are still in the clean-up phase. We are starting to move towards the reconstruction phase. It is going to be a massive endeavour in itself. The task for the ADF is limited. Its time is coming towards a close as its tasks are transitioned to civilian alternatives. That is the correct way to approach this matter, but the work still needs to be done and those civiliansâmany of whom will be Australiansâwill continue to be supported by our government and the Australian people.</para>
<para>I would like to end on that note. I have talked a lot about what the ADF have done because I am obviously very proud of their contribution, yet again, but it has also been moving to see the way the broader Australian community have responded to this disaster. The extent to which they have been prepared to go out and give aid and the extent to which they have been prepared to volunteer their services and help others in a moment of great need has been uplifting. We within government and the parliamentary process should be particularly grateful to all of those who have responded. With those few words, I commend the motion.</para>

<para>âOn behalf of the opposition I wish to support the motion moved by Senator Hill on behalf of the government in memory of those killed by the Boxing Day tsunami. We offer our condolences to the families of the hundreds of thousands of dead and our sympathies to those whose homes and livelihoods have been destroyed. On behalf of the Australian Labor Party I would also like to make special mention of the Australians killed or missing in this terrible natural disaster.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This event, which has devastated the lives of so many, has also been the catalyst for an outpouring of generosity in this country and around the world. It is a response which has shown the very best that our society has to offer. I would also like to recognise the generosity of the Australian community and the dedication of our public servants, military and police personnel, doctors, nurses, engineers and others who have given up their time and made personal sacrifices to respond to this event. I would also like to recognise and support the swift and appropriate response of the Australian government and the assistance provided on behalf of all Australians. I will refer a bit later on to the aid package offered by the government. I would also like to make some points in regard to the role of the disaster victim identification teams and the establishment of an Indian Ocean early warning system.</para>
<para>The Boxing Day tsunami was caused by a massive earthquake off the coast of Aceh in Northern Sumatra. The earthquake registered nine on the Richter scale. It was the most severe earthquake in 40 years. It sent a tidal wave crashing onto the shores of countries surrounding the quakeâs epicentreâIndonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and other islands. It reached as far west as the Seychelles, Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania. The scope of it was just breathtaking.</para>
<para>To date, the estimated number of dead has exceeded 290,000âthe worst affected country being our nearest neighbour, Indonesia, where it appears that up to 240,000 people have died. The UN has estimated that one million people were displaced and five million people deprived of basic services. From our own community, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs, 12 Australian citizens and six permanent residents, ranging in age from six to 81 years, were among those confirmed dead, and there are concerns for a further nine. Our hearts go out to those in our community who mourn for friends and family and to those who wait for news of loved ones. We are aware of the anguish they must suffer. Millions more have lost their family, friends, homes and livelihoods. These people have to live the rest of their lives with the memory of the horror of that day. The economic impact of the disaster is still being assessed. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> magazine, Indonesia alone has some 700,000 people who have been left homeless and a repair bill estimated at $9.7 billion. Countless homes, businesses and jobs have been lost. It remains to be seen what the long-term effects on industries like tourism will be.</para>
<para>Like all Australians, and I think people across the world, I was horrified to see the events of Boxing Day unfold. And yet, like many, I have been heartened by the remarkable public response to this tragedy. On the day of the tsunami I was lucky enough to be on leave, holidaying in the beachside resort of Dunsborough in the south-west of WA. It seemed that no sooner had news of the events begun to unfold than Red Cross volunteers were out in force, rattling tins at the local shops, giving up their holiday time trying to make a difference in support of people far away. It was quite remarkable how quickly they were out there, active and involved. All credit to them. It was just a small part of an outpouring of financial and emotional generosity which has marked the Australian publicâs, and I think the worldâs, response.</para>
<para>Eerily, in the hours which followed the impact of the tidal waves, I, like many others who were near the WA coast, witnessed unusual wave patternsâtidal movements coming in and out within a matter of minutes. It was just a tiny ripple, I suppose, of the much more terrible tidal event to our north. This demonstrated to me just how fortunate we in Australia were to be spared the impact of the tsunami. It also reminded me of how different things could have been for us had the earthquake happened in a different part of the Indian Ocean.</para>
<para>According to the Australian Council for International Development, aid organisations in this country so far have received $239 million in donations. The response and the generosity has come from all areas of our societyâfrom the Red Cross collectors in Dunsborough to families, businesses, unions and groups of employees in workplaces around the country; from the people who organised the Wave Aid concert, the Tsunami Cricket Match and the Reach Out to Asia telethon. So many Australians have given their time, their money and their tears. We are a better society for their generosity and their response.</para>
<para>We are also grateful to those many people who, through their work and personal sacrifices, have given such a fine response to this tragedyâthe military and law enforcement personnel engaged in recovery and reconstruction; the public servants who gave up their holidays to coordinate Australiaâs response; and the doctors, nurses and other Australian professionals who have been so quick to respond and so generous with their skills. I think all of us would have been moved by the images on our TVs of Australian Defence personnel and others restoring basic services like water and providing medical assistance. I know a number of the senior Australian Army officers involved; I met many of them when they were in Timor in a similar operation. They do their service and Australia proud.</para>
<para>I also saw the professionalism and dedication of so many Australian public servants reflected in the briefings we received from the various government agencies involved which reflected the wider work going on. It is not very often that Australian public servants get a good rap and I am one of those who are prepared to give them a hard time at estimates committees, but I think the way the Australian Public Service responded was a great credit to them. Unfortunately sometimes it is those in uniform at the front end who get the credit, but I think this is one of those occasions when both Commonwealth and state public servants responded with all the other agencies in a way that did them great credit.</para>
<para>Representing the Labor Party, I had the opportunity to visit the embassies of Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand in the aftermath of this tragedy and it was clear to see the appreciation those countries had for the emotional and humane response of the Australian people. I also heard of their appreciation of the Australian governmentâs willingness to listen and respond to their needs rather than to tell them what they needed. Our nationâs concerns at the events on <inline font-size="11pt">Boxing Day were symbolised in the National Day of Mourning and Reflection on 16 January. On that day I attended a ceremony at City Beach in Perth. Ethnic and religious leaders were there, along with many thousands of people wishing to show their support for the victims and to make sense of what had happened. On this occasion, as at many other times over the past few weeks, I was impressed by the compassion and the solidarity of such a wide cross-section of the Australian people.</inline>
</para>
<para>
<inline font-size="11pt">I would also like to express the support of the ALP for the governmentâs response to the tsunami. The government has followed the lead of the Australian people and acted swiftly, effectively and generously. With the initial relief package of $60 million and then through the $1 billion aid package to Indonesia, the government has added another chapter to the story of compassion that we have seen in this country over recent weeks.</inline>
</para>
<para>The Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development is the biggest single aid package in Australiaâs history. We commend the Prime Minister and the government for this action. It not only represents the wishes of the Australian people but also provides an opportunity to build vital relationships between Australia and Indonesia. At a time when there are forces which fuel mistrust and animosity in our region, this package is an example of our commitment to our shared destiny and our shared humanity. On a human level, of course, it is the right thing to do. The aid package is not the end of the story when it comes to Australian efforts to provide assistance to those in need and to share more equitably the advantages we enjoy. It is not the end of the story, but it is an expression of what can be achieved when we have the will. We support the government in its response to this tragedy.</para>
<para>I would also like to mention the work being done by the disaster victim identification teams in ThailandâI see that Senator Ellison, the Minister for Justice and Customs, is in the chamber. These teams are made up of federal and state police officers working in cooperation with local officials and DFAT staff. From the comprehensive briefings given to us it appears that there have at times been 106 team members deployed in Thailand, working on 14-day rotations. Their knowledge and expertise have been employed in the disaster to ensure the best possible identification process. I must say, I did not seek to be briefed on the details of their work. It is a most gruesome and challenging task and not one which I would wish to volunteer to help with, but we really do appreciate the efforts they make. It is not easy work, and we extend our appreciation and support to all those officers and other personnel involved in that difficult task, because it is obviously important for the families that the work is carried out.</para>
<para>One of the things that struck me most from the briefings we received about the whole response was that so much experience had been gained in Bali that was put to good use in the tsunami. So, out of every terrible event, something good comes. One of the features of the Australian response was the ability to have learnt from the Bali experiences: for agencies to be better prepared and to be able to coordinate better. So, while in some ways it is a terrible thing that they have had that experience, it was no doubt central to their capacity to respond to the tsunami.</para>
<para>It is incumbent on us in political life to ensure that positive change is built on the experiences of the past. One way in which we can do this is by establishing systems to lessen the effects of similar events, should they be repeated in the future. Labor believes that Australia can make a significant contribution to the development of an Indian Ocean early warning system. We could contribute through facilities such as the Australian National Seismograph Network and the Alice Springs Joint Geological and Geophysical Research Station, as well as through the significant scientific expertise we have in Australia. Such a project could be some small memorial for those who have died. Projects such as this, the governmentâs aid package and the response of the Australian public build much needed understanding in our international environment.</para>
<para>I hope that we can continue to create positive steps out of the horror which affected so many on Boxing Day. On behalf of my Labor colleagues in the Senate, I extend our thanks again to all those in our communityâour police and service personnel, our public servants, medical and other professionalsâand the organisations and businesses who got behind the effort. I reaffirm our support for the Australian governmentâs actions. I repeat most particularly our heartfelt condolences to the millions who have lost loved ones and those Australian families who mourn. We remember those who have lost children, parents, brothers, sisters and friends, for whom the rebuilding may take a lifetime.</para>
<para>Before I bring my remarks to a conclusion, I just want to make a couple of other comments. This is a motion the government has moved in relation to the tsunami disaster but, as you would be aware, over the break since the parliament last sat a number of terrible events have occurred in addition to the tsunami. We were not clear today as to what the government intended to do, but I do not want to sit down without making some reference on behalf of the Australian Labor Party to condolences, in particular to those families who have lost loved ones in the South Australian bushfires in January. As if the tsunami had not been enough, we then experienced those terrible fires, where nine people were killed. It was a terrible disaster, and the stories of how some of them died really touched all of us. Many others were injured and we wish them the best for their recovery.</para>
<para>Terrible devastation was done. These were the worst fires since the Ash Wednesday bushfires of 1983, when 75 people were killed. It was a significant tragedy for Australia. I am sure Canberrans in particular are much more aware these days of the terrible havoc that bushfires can cause, although Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, Senator Ellison and I are well aware of the terrible threat they are, as we had serious bushfires in Perth over the period as well. But the South Australian bushfires were another terrible tragedy and on behalf of the Australian Labor Party I want to extend our condolences to the families of those who died.</para>
<para>On this rather sombre noteâI have been told Senator Ellison may be saying something later in the dayâI want to formally make note of the death of Adam Dunning, an officer of the Australian Federal Police who was killed while on a peacekeeping mission in Honiara in the Solomon Islands. Adam was a former member of the army, had served in East Timor and had volunteered to serve in the Solomons. His death was a terrible tragedy.</para>
<para>The AFP has been deployed along with the Australian military to the Solomons with the support of this parliamentâcertainly with the support of the Australian Labor Partyâand we take his death as a great blow. We take very seriously our responsibilities in the deployment of Australians to serve their country overseas and to go into trouble zones. Adam paid the ultimate price for serving his nation. I want to extend our condolences to the family of Adam Dunning, express our regret at his death and extend our condolences to other members of the AFP.</para>
<para>I wrote to Mr Keelty on behalf of the opposition, and Ms Macklin, then acting leader, attended the funeral, but, as we are dealing with the tragedies that have occurred in the last few months, I wanted to make special note of our sorrow at the death of Adam Dunning and commend the work that he performed in the Solomons and that of the AFP, who continue to serve there in most difficult circumstances. As I said, I think the parliament must accept a great responsibility for the fact that Adam was in harmâs way, serving his country at the request of this parliament. It is certainly important that we recognise the sacrifice he made on behalf of all of us, helping to bring stability and peace to our region and assisting the Solomons in their recovery. With those words, I wish to formally support the motion moved by Senator Hill in relation to the tsunami. I hope that we do not have ever again nearly as tragic a Christmas and New Year period as Australia and its region have experienced. I formally support the motion.</para>

<para>âCertainly I wish to associate myself with the remarks made by Senators Hill and Evans in relation to the motion before the Senate dealing with the tsunami disaster which we experienced in our region during the break after the last rising of parliament. Senator Evans also mentioned the death of Adam Dunning, and I will be placing on the record my remarks at a later stage in relation to that. Today my remarks in relation to the tsunami disaster in particular go towards the men and women who did, and are doing, such a fantastic job in disaster victim identification. When the enormity of this disaster became apparent, we had an immediate response from the Australian Federal Police and CrimTrac, our federal agency which manages the database for fingerprints and DNA.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>At the request of the Royal Thai Police, the Australian Federal Police responded on 28 December, sending a multijurisdictional assessment team consisting of 18 personnel. Since then a total of 105 Australian personnel have been deployed to Thailand in relation to disaster victim identification. I want to acknowledge police officers from New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland, the Northern Territory and Tasmania, all of whom have served in the most difficult circumstances in relation to disaster victim identification. As Senator Evans said, much experience was gained, unfortunately, during the period of time after the Bali bombing. Of course, in any disaster one of the things you have to look to, apart from the welfare of those who have survived the disaster, is the speedy identification of victims, done with accuracy so that certainty can be established as to the loss of life. This is essential for those who are left behind, such as loved ones.</para>
<para>Australia led the way in disaster victim identification. Up to 30 different countries, and more than 400 people, have been represented in this international response. Australian police were heavily involved in setting up what is now called the Thailand tsunami victim identification centre, where all the ante-mortem and post-mortem information is collected and compared to identify the deceased. The situation was very difficult because there were many visitors from many different nations who perished as a result of this disaster. That of course made the identification of these people and locals all the more difficult.</para>
<para>In Australia, the Australian Federal Police established a 24-hour forensic major incident room in Canberra to coordinate the Australian DVI response to this incident. This has included staff from missing persons units from all state and territory police services. The Australian Federal Police also used their family liaison officers to continue to discuss the DVI process with families of the victims. They did such a magnificent job in relation to the victims of the Bali bombing and were called upon to replicate that commitment and the great work that they did, and they have continued to do that.</para>
<para>Strict controls have been put in place to ensure that a person is correctly identified. This is normally done through primary identifiers such as dental records, DNA and fingerprints. Secondary identifiers such as property, wallets, tattoos and personal items can also be used, but there must be two secondary identifiers or they must be used in conjunction with a primary identifier. Of course, the Australian Federal Police brings considerable expertise to bear in this regard. The advantage, if you could put it that way, that has come from this disaster, from this adversity, is that yet again we are seeing our officials working so closely with officials in the region and building those relationships. Hopefully this will not be relied upon in the future in relation to any other disaster, but should one occur then we will have an even more strengthened relationship with the officials in our region. I think it is a great tribute to those involved that this has developed.</para>
<para>I mentioned CrimTrac. It became apparent very soon after the disaster that victim identification was going to be a crucial issue. I spoke to the director, Jonathan Mobbs, who responded immediately with CrimTrac putting into place the measures necessary to assist the Australian Federal Police. Indeed, the director of CrimTrac led a delegation to Thailand between 22 and 26 January and they agreed to Interpolâs formal request to supply an automated fingerprint identification system. That was done on 7 January and it was operational by 10 January. CrimTrac staff have been heavily involved with the set-up of the fingerprinting DVI process in Thailand since arriving onsite on 8 January, and I believe they have played an essential role in the whole DVI process.</para>
<para>The response from the Australian Federal Police, the state and territory police, and CrimTrac has been outstanding. We saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, accompanied by Police Commissioner Keelty, attending the region very shortly after the disaster occurred. This signified the immediate response that we saw from Australian officials. I want to pay tribute to the officials who gave up their time to respond so speedily and efficiently to this disaster. Indeed, Senator Hill has covered, more than adequately, the role of the ADF, but I also want to pay tribute to the role that they played. Both Senators Hill and Evans have also paid tribute to the Australian public. The public really exhibited the fine qualities of the Australian character: when we see a friend in trouble, we go to their aid. I think it was typical of Australians that we saw such an outstanding response to this disaster from the Australian community.</para>
<para>At this stage we look to have lost 18 people from Australia and there are grave concerns for nine more. It was thought at one stage that the number would be many more. Our heartfelt condolences and sympathy go out to the loved ones of those who have perished and, in particular, to those in Australia who have lost loved ones as a result of this tsunami disaster. I must say that I think the work that has been done by Australian officials in the region, and in those areas which have suffered such great loss of life, has resulted in lessening even further loss of life.</para>
<para>Finally, you and I, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, are both Western Australians. We come from a state, as does Senator Evans, which has its seaboard facing the ocean in which this disaster occurred. I see that Senator Webber is here too. She is from Western Australia as well. We in Western Australia saw a minor tidal surge as a result of this. But it brought home to us how things might have been very different had this disaster occurred in a different way. If mother nature had caused an earthquake in another way, the effects could have been felt differently. You have to remember that the effects of this disaster were felt on the east coast of Africa, which is on the other side of the Indian Ocean. We were very lucky indeed that Australia was not affected by this directly. I think that, as a neighbour in the region, it was the least we could do to respond in the way that we did.</para>

<para>âI rise to speak on the tsunami disaster condolence motion. On behalf of the Australian Democrats I offer my deep and sincere condolences to the victims of the tragic Boxing Day tsunami that has devastated South-East Asia, the families of the quarter of a million people who have died and the millions more whose lives will never be the same. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the number of confirmed Australian deaths remains at 18 and there are grave concerns for a further nine Australians.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In early January I received a briefing from the Australian government agencies about Australiaâs response to the disaster, for which I am grateful. One of the terrible facts that emerged from that briefing is that it could be a very long time before the remains of some Australians are identified. Some may not ever be identified. That situation must be extremely hard for the loved ones of those people. One massive earthquake below the sea has wreaked havoc in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, India, Burma and the Maldives, and it has left families in every corner of the world devastated.</para>
<para>Since it happened we have been focused on how we in Australia can best assist those affected in the enormous task of rebuilding their homes, communities, and lives. The Australian public has already generously donated $228 million to help with the relief and reconstruction effort in South-East Asia. Organisations such as the Australian Red Cross, World Vision Australia, CARE Australia, Oxfam Community Aid Abroad, Caritas Australia, UNICEF and the Christian Blind Mission International have all received millions of dollars in donations. They are all working hard to make sure that that money is put to good use as soon as possible. On behalf of the Australian people, I extend my thanks to those organisations for their work.</para>
<para>I would also like to thank the many Australian Democrats members who worked very hard in every state to collect money for UNICEF to aid their work in the tsunami zone. Our members collected over $50,000 to help UNICEF with providing clean water and vaccinations for children in the affected areas, reuniting lost children, protecting children from exploitation and getting children back to school. From New Yearâs Eve we had a button on our web site which assisted people to donate.</para>
<para>I acknowledge the wonderful assistance work of the Australian military and civilian personnel who are still working in neighbouring countries. It should not be assumed that, because this is aid work, there are no ongoing dangers. Of particular concern is the fact that one of the worst-hit areas, Aceh, is still an area of military conflict. In many villages and towns in north Aceh, people are being forced to move into government temporary sheltersâand there are reports coming out that they are being denied access to their original land and villagesâand those who refuse are accused of being from the separatist movement. There are fears that the military is now using food and basic needs to control and enforce their military approach. The Democrats urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs to use our improved relationship with Indonesia to encourage the protection of the human rights of the Aceh people.</para>
<para>The Democrats have welcomed the governmentâs $1 billion Asia assistance package, but I think it should be acknowledged that this is half aid and half long-term loan. According to AusAID, the package will consist of $500 million in grants and $500 million in concessional loans over 40 years, with no interest and no repayments of principal over the first 10 years. Next week in estimates hearings the Democrats will question the minister and department representatives for more detail about how that money will be spent. We encourage the Australian government to work very closely with the United Nations and aid agencies to make sure that the money goes where it is most needed. Given Australiaâs relative wealth and the fact that this has happened in our own region, the Democrats think that we should be leading the world in responding to this tragedy both now and into the future. We must also focus on other avenues, such as debt relief, to make sure that we are not giving with one hand and taking away with the other.</para>
<para>Despite the one-off generosity of the response to the tsunami, I think we have a long way to go before we will be fulfilling our obligations as a relatively wealthy global citizen. A recent United Nations report showed that Australia is not doing enough to reverse poverty, hunger and disease in developing nations. The report of the UN Millennium Project, of which Australia is a member, has demonstrated that Australia is falling far short of the 0.7 per cent of GDP target that will be needed from each member nation if the millennium development goals of eradicating poverty and hunger, raising education standards and reducing child mortality are to be achieved. At present, we are spending only 25c out of every $100 of income on overseas aid.</para>
<para>Last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, our Prime Minister dismissed the calls for greater aid and debt relief that came from delegates at that conference. Mr Howard said that instead he believed that worldwide trade reform and the elimination of agricultural subsidies by rich nations were the only ways the developing world would have a decent chance. The thing is, we do not have to make that choice. It is not a question of choosing just one aspect of helping the developing world and sticking with it. In fact, the opposite is true. Only a three-pronged approach involving fairer trade and World Trade Organisation reform, targeted aid at increased levels and a program of debt relief and cancellation will have the impact that is so desperately needed by the developing world.</para>
<para>The Democrats believe we should be taking a leaf out of Gordon Brownâs book. The British chancellor has called on the nations of the world to recognise the three essential elements of developing a plan for a new deal: first, full debt relief for burdened countries; second, reforming world trade so that it begins to better benefit poor countries and ensure their capacity to benefit from this new trade; and, third, declaring the level of aid to be approximately 0.7 per cent of national income. Debt relief works. The chancellor said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is partly because of debt relief that in developing countries, primary school enrolments have increased at twice the rate of the 1980s; those aged over 15 who can read has risen by 7 per cent; life expectancy has increased; and the numbers living in extreme poverty has fallen by 10 per cent. People weighed by the burden of debts imposed by the last generation cannot even begin to build for the next generation.</para>
<para class="block">To continue to insist on payment offends human dignity.</para>
<para class="block">What is morally wrong, cannot be economically right.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Democrats soundly endorse that sentiment and have, as I said, pleasure in supporting this motion today.</para>

<para>âI associate the National Party also with the motion on the tsunami disaster currently before the Senate and moved by Senator Hill. Senator Hill and Senator Evans gave a very comprehensive overview of the role played by Australia and all Australians. I too would like to express my sympathy to the families of the people who were lost in the tsunami and all the people who have had their livelihoods taken from them and whose businesses were washed away. What happened on 26 December was a tragedy beyond all tragedies.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We as a nation, and as Australians, were one of the first to pitch in. Individual Australians and companies have pledged $100 million. We were the first foreigners on the ground in Indonesia after the disaster. If we want to be a leader in our part of the world, we have to be there in bad times as well as good times. What we have offered the Indonesians and the other countries that were hit by this tragedy is mateship, and that is what being a good neighbour is all about. We were very happy to be able to assist. Like most other people, I was on holidays when this tragedy occurred. I saw the death toll escalating. I think the first day it was 8,000, then it was 11,000 and then it gradually got up to 250,000.</para>
<para>The Australian government was on the ground first. We sent a medical assessment team to Phuket. This team was provided by the Canberra Hospital. The next day medical assistance teams, comprising a mix of Australian Defence Force reservists, medical personnel and civilian health professionals, left for the affected areas. Teams included orthopaedic surgeons, general surgeons, emergency physicians, nurses, rescue paramedics and, of course, the people who have the very hard task of identifying the remains of the bodies.</para>
<para>The Australian government will contribute over $1 billion over the next five years to the new Australia-Indonesia partnership. These funds will be additional to Australiaâs existing development cooperation programs and will bring Australiaâs commitment to Indonesia to a total of $1.8 billion over five years. While there will naturally be a clear focus on the areas devastated by the tsunami, all areas of Indonesia will be eligible for assistance under that partnership. The $1 billion of new money will consist of equal parts of grant assistance and highly concessional financing. The grant aid will be directed at areas of priority need in Indonesia. It can be expected to encompass small-scale reconstruction to establish social and economic infrastructure in affected areas, human resource development and rehabilitation. It will also include a large scholarship program, providing support and training in areas such as engineering, health care, public administration and governance. The concessional financing component can be expected to be directed to the reconstruction and rehabilitation of major infrastructure in the first instance. It will provide $500 million interest free for up to 40 years, with no repayment of principal for 10 years, and that is a very generous offer by Australia.</para>
<para>This is an historic step in the Australia-Indonesia relationship. It is the single largest aid contribution ever made by Australia, focused on the long term and founded on partnerships. Addressing the urgent humanitarian need of those afflicted by the tragedy will also serve to bring our countries and people closer together. It is a strategic commitment to raise the living standards of the people of Indonesia. The Boxing Day tsunami brought widespread tragedy, but there will be a new world for the survivors. Australia is stepping up to the mark to provide assistance and friendship. I commend the motion to the Senate. It thoroughly deserves to be brought into this house. Once again, I offer my sympathy to all those who were caught in this terrible tragedy.</para>

<para>âThe scale of the tsunami disaster is heart wrenching and overwhelming, with more than 300,000 people killed, many more injured, and lives and communities shatteredâmany of which will probably never recover. The Australian Greens express our heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of the victims. We must commit to working long term to address this disaster and help people to recover and rebuild their lives.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Indonesia, particularly Aceh, was the worst hit, with the toll of missing and dead now almost 240,000; but almost every country on the Indian Ocean has shared in this tragedy, including Australia. However, amongst the tragedies there are stories of hope and tales of personal courage and heroism. The willingness of ordinary citizens around the world to show their support is hearteningânot least the enormous financial donations made by Australiansâand points towards the growing international consciousness that we are the one planet and we need global cooperation.</para>
<para>There are many stories and examples of people affected by the tsunami. My colleague in the New South Wales parliament, Greens MLC Ian Cohen, was in Sri Lanka on the first day of a surfing holiday when the tsunami struck. He described what happened in comments to the ABC. He said that he was in front of a little hostel right on the beach and the waves started to pound at the walls. He had to retreat behind a pillar and the water was running like a river down the side of the building where he was. Then the sea retracted right back, but 30 minutes later exactly the same thing happened again, and this time there was a lot of timber and furnitureâand that was the big danger because it was swirling around. One or two more waves would have pulled the wall right down over him and he would be dead now. Ian stayed on in the village of Hikkaduwa to help with the relief effort, working with local environmental groups that were among many NGOs that quickly began assisting victims. He has continued to help back in Australia, supported by the Greens and particularly by his home community on the north coast of New South Wales. The Byron Bay community has raised over $300,000 to support the relief effort in Sri Lanka. The Australian Greens are encouraging Australians to support the Indonesian Civil Society Coalition for the Victims of Earthquake Tsunami, which is made up of Indonesian environmental and human rights organisations which are part of the aid assistance delivery project.</para>
<para>Whilst this was a natural disaster and, according to the United Nations, the worst tsunami in recorded history, the scale of the devastation was exacerbated by human activities. The lack of warning and the inadequacy of early warning systems and civil defence resources around the Indian Ocean is shocking, and it should not have taken a disaster of this magnitude to be addressed. Why is it that only rich countries have early warning systems? And why, according to reports in the Thai newspaper the <inline font-style="italic">Nation</inline> in December last year, were the economics of tourism in Thailand placed in front of warnings of the risk of a tsunami? Why is it that Western tourists injured by the tsunami returned home to decent hospital care whilst communities in Aceh have received aid only in recent weeks? Poverty will continue to be an important factor in recovery, and it is with this in mind that we should evaluate Australiaâs response to the tsunami.</para>
<para>Half of Australiaâs aid is in the form of conditional loans to Indonesia, and the terms are still being negotiated. I understand that only Australian and New Zealand companies will be able to tender for contracts as part of the aid package. The Australian public support a reinvigoration of Australiaâs commitment to tackle poverty in less developed countries in the long term. We need to increase our aid to the United Nations recommended target of 0.7 per cent of GDPâsomething Australia promised to do a long time ago. The Greens have been calling for this for many years, and we need to direct our resources to addressing the Millennium Development Goals. Instead, unfortunately, Australiaâs ongoing aid budget is half the amount recommended by the UN, and much of it is âboomerang aidâ funding the work of Australian companies.</para>
<para>This week the G7 countries, the richest countries in the world, recognised that debt relief is crucial in making poverty history, and yet our Prime Minister had the audacity to argue that debt reliefâor even a moratorium on interest paymentsâcannot help the worldâs poor and that more loans can. Indonesia already owes Australia over $1 billion. To add another $500 million to this burden is not the kind of generosity that many Australian people expect. Aid in disasters such as these is often used as a political football, and we need to be vigilant in the coming months about how the aid effort in Aceh develops. Despite the possibility of peace talks and the lessening of conflict in Aceh, the civil war continues. According to a Reuters report in February this year, the Indonesian military has already shot and killed at least 200 independence guerrillas since the tsunami struck. The Indonesian military is continuing to control access by the media and NGOs to certain areas of Aceh, and NGOs fear that aid will be used as a weapon in the counter-insurgency war.</para>
<para>Only through governments taking serious action, urged on by citizens, can we address the ongoing disaster of global poverty and, just as important, climate change. Whilst killer tsunamis are not frequent events in the Indian Ocean, coastal flooding and rising sea levels do threaten the lives and livelihoods of tens of millions of people. Bangladesh and the Maldives are at risk from impacts of global warmingâparticularly with the combined effects of more frequent and powerful typhoons and rising sea levels. Already, floods and diseases like cholera kill tens of thousands of people in Bangladesh on a regular basis. In 1984, for example, more than 400,000 people died as a result of floods. It is the rich industrial countries of the world that are the primary cause of climate change, so it is we who need to take responsibility for protecting poor coastal people from the rising tide. If we do not address the crisis of global warming, the creeping tsunami of climate change will bring disaster to us all, particularly to the worldâs poor. Real, concerted action to address poverty and climate change would be the most fitting epitaph for the victims of the disaster.</para>

<para class="block">What seems to have happened in what can only really be described as a disturbing case, the case of Cornelia Rau, is that an Australian permanent resident was wrongfully imprisoned for 10 months. It was not for 10 daysâsomething that you might think in passing is a short period. Ten months is a significant period in anybodyâs language. In that 10 months she was in the immigration detention system per se, if I can use those broad words.</para>
<para>What we understand so far about Ms Rauâs case is from what we have been told so far and what we can garner from newspaper articlesâand that is an issue I will go to shortly: the lack of information that is being provided by the government on this matter. What we can garner so far is that she presented in Coen as a person who was behaving differently from what the locals might think was normal and she was reported to the police. The police, as I understand it, made inquiries and came back to seek further information. This is only the version that I can garner from the media. I hope and I do think that what I am going to outline is a better course for determining what happened. Ms Rau ended up under DIMIAâs controlâthat is, under DIMIAâs detention regime.</para>
<para>The case is disturbing because Cornelia Rau went not only from Coen to Cairns but also from Cairns to Brisbane, where she was in the Queensland womenâs prison systemânot as a prisoner of the Queensland government but as a detainee under the DIMIA system, as I understand it. DIMIA request and seek arrangements with the Queensland Department of Corrective Services for the detention of unlawful arrivals and the like by the Queensland corrective services on behalf of DIMIA. But it did not end there; that only brings us up to about Octoberâit is not quite clear. From there Ms Rau went to the Baxter detention centre, and it has not been made clear to us yet what protocol meant that she left the womenâs prison or why the decision was made to transfer her to the Baxter detention centre in South Australia.</para>
<para>So Ms Rau had covered a considerable distance, which would be at the very least disturbing and unsettling if you were an unlawful arrival. In this instance it is not clear what Ms Rau thought about her detention; that is a matter that requires significant further investigation. What I think Ms Rauâs case has demonstratedâeven if you just look at the breadth of issues that it raisesâis that there are significant cracks in the Howard governmentâs immigration detention system: she has managed quite easily to fall through every single one of them.</para>
<para>Those who are listening to this debate will know that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has ducked and weaved on this issue, particularly as to where the responsibility lies. I think it deserves much better than that. I think it is a sad case and one that requires more than the minister simply ducking and weaving. The press conference that she had before question time today left more questions unanswered than answered. If the minister were going to announce, as she did, an inquiry of the type that she did, one would have imaginedâalthough I cannot put myself in her shoesâthat she would go to the press conference prepared to answer the journalists, who were asking pragmatic, simple questions about process and how the inquiry would work. Senator Vanstone in my view failed to adequately explain to the journalists and I think to the public generallyâbecause it was broadcastâhow that inquiry was going to be conducted. She effectively took on notice some of the questions from the journalists; whether or not they get a reply is another matter. She does deserve to have to come back in here at question time and answer those questions that were asked of her in todayâs question time which she took on noticeâthe detail of what occurred, when it occurred and how it occurred.</para>
<para>First of all, it appearsâand I do not want to unduly attack the minister until the facts are more clearly laid outâthat, from the minute the story broke, Senator Vanstone was clutching at straws, trying to blame every other agency involved in the case. I do not think that this is a matter for apportioning blame. It appears she has been trying to pull them in, to blame everyone but herself in this process.</para>
<para>But a curious thing happened in Senate question time today. The minister managed to admit that not only was Cornelia Rau originally detained under the Migration Act but it was DIMIA that ordered her detentionâDIMIA, no-one else. That means that, far from the undertones and suggestions that Senator Vanstone has been spreading about this place in relation to the Queensland police or anyone else involved, it is Senator Vanstone herself, as the minister responsible, who ultimately should take responsibility for ordering Cornelia Rauâs detention and for her welfare from the second she came into detention, almost a year ago in March. I am not suggesting for a minute that DIMIA should not have the power to detain unlawful arrivals. That is a matter for another debate and another time. In this instance we are looking specifically at the systemic failure that appears to be rife within this department overseen by Minister Vanstone.</para>
<para>For argumentâs sake, in cases where people arrive at airports or by other means, or where they are overstayers, the immigration officials seem to be able to do their work and deal with them in a reasonable way. But in this instance something different happened, and that requires more than just an inquiry of the ilk that is being proposed by Senator Vanstone. Was there adequate assessment of the physical and mental health checks performed? Did DIMIA perform these checks? Why did it take so long for the mental health checks to occur? Did Ms Rauâs mental health deteriorate as a result of being kept in solitary confinement, as some of the media suggest? We do not know whether or not that happened, and I am not suggesting it did. But there are questions out there that need answers. Will the inquiry get to the bottom of some of these questions that I have posed? That is a difficult question.</para>
<para>It looks from first glance as though, without the ability to have compellability of witnesses, without privilege, without some of the ordinary things that attach to proper judicial or open inquiries, without those types of arrangements, you may unfortunately get instances where people choose to protect their own interests first rather than try to look at the interests of Ms Rau in this case. They may turn to their legal advisers, friends and colleagues and say, âWhat shall we do in this instance?â They may not come forward. They may not give evidence. They may not provide a snapshot. They may not provide evidence that could be used to examine the case to determine what in fact happened so that the problems can be fixed, if there are systemic problems, which it appears there are.</para>
<para>It is going to be a closed inquiry, not a public one. We do not know whether transcripts will be kept or made available, or whether submissions will be called for or made available. Without that type of inquiry and the powers I have indicated, I remain unconvinced that we will have a full, open, frank inquiry that will get to the bottom of it. That is what we need. That is what this government should do and it does not seem to want to actually bite the bullet and do it.</para>
<para>These concerns go to issues such as: firstly, why did it take 10 months; secondly, was the treatment of Ms Rau for those 10 months that she was in immigration detention humane and appropriate, especially given what we now know of her mental health; and, thirdly, how can we guarantee the safety and welfare of those that are in detention centres? Those are the questions that we need to get to the bottom of and answer. Finally, why has the minister for immigration chosen to hold an inquiry which appears not to meet the tests that I have put forward? It does not seem to meet the tests of being open; it seems to be closed. She was not able to explain clearly all the other matters to the public during the interview that she conducted today. I think that it is a sad indictment of the minister that she has failed to adequately deal with this issue right from the moment it broke. It begs the question: is there something to hide? I do not know and I am not suggesting it, but unless you ensure that it looks proper then you always run the risk that it is not. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âAs Senator Ludwig has said, this is a sad case and I would have thought, with respect, that good sense and common decency would dictate that it not be made the subject of an unedifying and discreditable attempt at scoring political points. Senator Ludwig, who, if I may say so, usually takes a very responsible attitude to these affairs did rather disappoint me in his speech by trying to use this sad case, which is about a sick person, a mentally ill person, in respect of whose affairs mistakes were madeâand nobody is denying thatâas an opportunity for point scoring. I would hope that senators who participate in this debate show a greater interest in getting to the bottom of the facts of the case than in using it as a platform for rhetorical flourish. That is what I want to doâI want to set out in a dispassionate way those facts which do seem to be established.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Can I in a preliminary way make two points. First of all, Senator Vanstone, I think, to any fair-minded person impressed anyone who observed her in responding to questions in question time today with appropriate candour and deliberation and an obvious eagerness to ensure that we did get to the bottom of whatever systemic failures there were in this sad case. Secondly, can I make the obvious point that the government by announcing today an inquiry by a highly suitable individual, the former commissioner of the Australian Federal Police Mr Mick Palmer, has shown that same willingness to get to the bottom of what happened by holding a departmental inquiry and then making the findings public and subject to public scrutiny.</para>
<para>Let us go through the facts so far as we know them, and be aware that there are other undisclosed matters which will no doubt be revealed as the Palmer inquiry takes its course. The lady concerned, who we now know was Ms Cornelia Rau, a permanent resident though not a citizen of Australia, was at the end of March found in Coen, a small community about 660 kilometres north of Cairns, apparently by Aboriginal people, in a state of some distress and she then came to the notice of officers of the Queensland Police Service. When they interviewed her she told them that she was German. She spoke in German or partly in German. She said she was German, that she was a visitor to Australia, that she had no friends or family in Australia and that she had with her a stolen passport. She told the police that her name was Anna Schmidt or, variously, Anna Sue Schmidt or Anna Brotmeyer.</para>
<para>So the starting point of these events was that a person told officers of the Queensland Police Service, to whose attention she had been brought, that she was a nonresident foreign citizen who was in Australia on a stolen passport. The Queensland Police Service got in touch with DIMIA. She was taken into custody, as, on the basis of the information she gave the Queensland Police Service, she should have been. On 31 March she was taken to Cairns and several days later she was taken down to Brisbane, where she was detained in the Brisbane Womenâs Correctional Centre. During the course of this time, the Queensland Police Service apparently had an informal arrangement with DIMIA, the people who had initiated the detention, and she was being held in a Queensland government facility. There is no suggestion that she was other than an unlawful noncitizen and there was no suggestion, or any basis, for anyone to discover her real identity.</para>
<para>In detention in the Queensland womenâs correctional centre she exhibited symptoms of a behavioural disorder, so in August she was sent, apparently at the instigation of those who were responsible for her custody, to the Princess Alexandra Hospital. As Senator Ludwig, as a Queensland senator, knows, that is one of the largest and most respected hospital facilities in Queensland and indeed in Australia. It appears she was there for about a week. During that time she was psychiatrically accessed by an eminent and respected psychiatrist, and as a result of that assessmentâit was not a matter of a cursory examination; it was a matter of several days, almost a week, of clinical investigationâhis professional conclusion was that she did not show the diagnostic symptoms of mental disorder. She was released back to the Queensland womenâs correctional centre on the doctorâs professional advice and, in due course, in October, transferred into the custody of DIMIA at the Baxter detention centre in South Australia.</para>
<para>All of this was done in accordance with the procedure which, on the state of their knowledge at the time, the relevant authoritiesâboth the state authorities and the Commonwealth authorityâought to have followed. There was no reason to believe up to that point that she was anything other than what she said she was. She characterised herself as being an unlawful noncitizen. She went to the Baxter detention centre and again concerns became apparent, to those in whose custody she was, about behavioural problems, so she was seen first by a psychologistâas Senator Vanstone said in answers in question time todayâand then by a psychiatrist, and in mid-November a process of psychiatric assessment was begun.</para>
<para>Meanwhile, in August, her family in New South Wales listed Cornelia Rau as a missing person. But unbeknownst to them, by listing Cornelia Rau as a missing person with the New South Wales Police, the name Cornelia Rau went onto the New South Wales Police database, but not, evidently, onto a national database. That, no doubt, is something that Mr Palmer will consider when he conducts this inquiryâthe extensiveness of the missing persons database. The report that Ms Rau was a missing person in New South Wales did not reach, and had no reason to reach, either the Commonwealth authorities or the state authorities involved in the custody of the person they thought to be an unlawful noncitizen of German nationality going under a different name in either Queensland or South Australia.</para>
<para>In the meantime, the process of psychiatric assessment continued in South Australia. Then last Thursday, 3 February, it appeared, as a result of inquiriesâthe full nature of which are not yet apparentâthat the person in detention was in fact Cornelia Rau. Apparently a photograph of the person in detention was posted by somebody and it was identified by Cornelia Rauâs family. That was the first point at which there was any intersection between the identity of Cornelia Rau and the supposed unlawful noncitizen Anna Schmidt or Anna Brotmeyer. It was the first time that the identity of those two supposed different individuals was established. So that very day, it being established that the person who had been supposed to be the unlawful noncitizen was in fact an Australian permanent resident, there was no power to detain her under the immigration act, she was released first to Port Augusta Hospital and then the following day, Friday, 4 February, to Glenside psychiatric centre, where apparently the lady concerned still is.</para>
<para>Senator Vanstone addressed, without any hint of seeking to conceal anything, all of these matters with the media and in question time today. As well today the government established this inquiry, which is not wanting in transparency, Senator Ludwig, as you will see if you but read the terms of reference.</para>
<para>In closing, let me quote the words of Ms Rauâs sister, Christine Rau, who on the weekend said the most sensible thing that has yet been said about this sad case. She said that there is no point in apportioning blame until an investigation uncovers all of the relevant facts. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âIt would not be the first time that tragic events have put someone with a mental illness into the headlines in this country. A couple of years ago we had numerous police shootings in Victoria involving people with mental illness. More recently, we had patients being shackled and guarded by security personnel in South Australia. The tragedy of people on the treadmill of illness, homelessness, incarceration and often suicide now and again gets media attention. But none of the public outrage that is attached to those stories appears to make much difference to the way people with mental illness are treated in this country. We heard from the minister today that mental health services are all up to the states, despite the fact that what is called the National Mental Health Strategy is supposed to be in place. It is a fine document and it has worthy aims, but it is not being implemented and it does not have the funding, either at the federal or the state level, to put it into place. In this latest incident, I think the victim of neglect, misunderstanding, misdiagnosis and mistreatment can point very clearly to the government for the situation that has transpired.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Democrats are disappointed in the inquiry which has been announced today. It is not a public inquiry; it is going to be conducted behind closed doors. It will not have powers to call witnesses and to seek evidence. In our view, an inquiry should have been conducted by a judge and it should have had those powers. It should not be conducted behind closed doors. It could be made confidential where necessary, but secrecy about the evidence seems to us to be unnecessary. Those aspects of the inquiry that could impinge on Cornelia Rauâs privacy could be kept closed while it remains an open inquiry about the practices of the various agencies. That is what we are talking about here todayâthe treatment of someone with a mental illness who has ended up not just in prison but subsequently in a detention centre when there was clearly no reason why they should be there.</para>
<para>We also think there needs to be an inquiry, in addition to what should have been a judicial inquiry but is now just a private inquiry, into the state of Australiaâs mental health services. We think that, given the number of people with mental illness who are not receiving treatment, given the failure of the national strategy to deliver and given the number of people who, as I said, are in this cycle of homelessness, despair, lack of treatment and sometimes suicide, we have a very serious situation on our hands. One of the reasons this is the case is that Australia spends on mental health services around half the percentage of the health budget that countries such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom do. As I understand it, it is just five per cent of the health budget, yet the mental health burden, if you like, is around twice that at 10 or 11 per cent.</para>
<para>I think there are some questions we need to have the government answer. We need to know how many people have become mentally ill since the government put them into detention centres, how many have been found to be refugees and released into the community without access to Medicare but who have serious mental problems and how many are suffering from a mental illness which has been caused by their detention.</para>
<para>On Friday, I went to the Maribyrnong detention centre. I regularly visit that place. I met with an Iranian asylum seeker who has been there for a long period of time. He is now on a cocktail of medication related to mental illness. When this man came into detention, he was not sick and he was fit. I argue today in the Senate that incarceration, particularly for very long periods of time and particularly where there is no end date in sightâthat is, the government does not indicate to those detainees when they are likely to be releasedâin fact causes mental illness. I think that is what ought to be examined in the Senate inquiry that the Democrats are proposing.</para>
<para>Let us just look at some of the recorded impacts of detention and mental illness. We know that there is limited access to mental health services. The man whom I visited is on medication, but he does not have access to psychologists and psychiatrists. One of the reasons he does not is that he does not wish to be handcuffed when he leaves the detention centre. That is one of the conditions on his seeking and receiving that treatment. There is limited research into the impact of detention on the mental health of asylum seekers, which is mainly due to difficulty in getting access to that evidence. But there is evidence that detention and the treatment that asylum seekers receive in detention contributes to high levels of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, self-harm and suicidal behaviour.</para>
<para>A study reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Medical Journal of Australia</inline> found that all but one of the detained asylum seekers who participated in the study displayed symptoms of psychological distress at some time. At the time of the study, 85 per cent reported chronic depression, 65 per cent had pronounced suicidal ideation and 20 per cent exhibited signs of psychosis. We also know that in our prisons there are vast numbers of people who suffer from mental disorders. In prison those conditions are far more common than in the general population. For psychosis, less than half a per cent of the general population has that condition compared with nine per cent in prisons. For affective disordersâfor example, depressionâit is six per cent in the general population and 22 per cent amongst inmates. For anxiety disorders, it is 10 per cent in the general population and 43 per cent amongst inmates. For substance abuse disorders, it is five per cent in the general population and 57 per cent amongst inmates. I think that gives us some insight into the cycle. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise to speak this afternoon on the urgency motion presented to the Senate by Senator Ludwig. I spoke earlier today on this matter and I indicated then, as I do now, that it really is a very sad and sorry tale indeed. Not only is it a very sad situation for Cornelia Rau, but I think it also reflects very badly on the government, on the minister and more generally on the government policy of mandatory detention. In the time that I have available today, I want to expand on what I said earlier today, particularly in relation to the failures that are obviously in the system of mandatory detention that have been brought to light as a consequence of Ms Rauâs situation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We have seen in the last few days that the tragic case of Cornelia Rau has gained a great deal of media coverage, as it should have, and it has brought about a considerable amount of outrage and disbelief in the wider Australian community. People have been left wondering just how it could possibly be that an Australian resident could spend 10 months in a detention centre or in a hospital, during which time the authorities were attempting to identify her. During much of the time she spent in the Baxter detention centre, because of her mental illness she was acting in such a way that the authorities could only deal with this by putting her into what is termed the management unit and allowing her to suffer.</para>
<para>We have heard today from the minister that it is intended that there be an inquiry into this matter, which of course we do commend. However, our concerns are that the powers of this inquiry will be inadequate to bring to light exactly what the facts were in this situation and exactly where the failures in the system occurred.</para>
<para>Labor say in the motion before the Senate today that we believe there needs to be a fully transparent and independent public inquiry into the detention of Cornelia Rau. Senator Ludwig went into more detail about the powers that Labor consider this inquiry ought to have in order to fully expose the facts and the weaknesses that are quite evidently in the system. Labor also call upon the government to establish an inspector general of immigration detention and an operational secretariat to monitor conditions of immigration detention and to deal with complaints from detainees and their advocates. Finally, we say that there must be guaranteed access to immigration detainees by independent and external medical and psychiatric personnel.</para>
<para>As I said earlier in my remarks this afternoon, this case reveals systemic abuse and failure within the system that is in existence at the moment. We have to ask ourselves: how could a woman who is as mentally ill as Ms Rau seems to be find herself in the predicament that she is in? How could immigration authorities reach the conclusion that they did in relation to this woman? The plight of Ms Cornelia Rau raises the wider issue of how detainees are treated in detention, particularly when they have some kind of mental illness. We can only conclude from this very sad and sorry tale that this is not the only incidence of a person who has not been properly assessed being in immigration detention and not being properly treated.</para>
<para>Since this matter came to light, a number of lawyers, including lawyers in South Australia, have raised cases regarding their own clients or those of other lawyers who have received similar inadequate treatment and responses to their mental illness. A prominent lawyer in Adelaide, Ms Claire OâConnor, has indicatedâand I think she is right on the money hereâthat it is unfortunate that it has taken the plight of an Australian residentânamely, Ms Rauâto highlight what is a systemic problem in the system. Ms OâConnor has said that one of her clients, an Iranian asylum seeker, suffers a severe mental illness and, since being in Baxter detention centre, has attempted suicide 20 times. Ms OâConnor has said that this man has not received adequate treatment since he has been in detention. Ms OâConnor has indicated that it took months of court appearances before the Commonwealth would allow her client to be examined by an independent doctor. She says the term used by the Commonwealth lawyers was that the standard of care for mental illness at Baxter on the ground was âexcellentâ and that if there was anything wrong with him they would know. Once the Commonwealth finally conceded, a doctor from the Royal Adelaide Hospital examined him and independent medical treatment was received, he was transferred immediately to Glenside Hospital, which, I understand, is the hospital Ms Rau is currently receiving treatment at.</para>
<para>That is an example of another case where the treatment that is being received or the assessments that are being made about detainees in the Baxter detention centre are clearly inadequate. Unfortunately, we can only assume that there are many other detainees who are in a similar situation to Ms Rau and to this Iranian asylum seeker, who is a client of Ms OâConnor and who suffered the same kind of treatment that Ms Rau received.</para>
<para>On a wider point, this very sad and sorry incident really puts the focus on the governmentâs policy of mandatory detention of asylum seekers. It also tells us something about how we see ourselves as a nation. We quite readily allow the imprisonment of people who are already traumatised and who can show they have suffered harsh treatment in their own countryâoften including persecution, which can give rise to very serious mental illnessâyet we seem to be comfortable with detaining these people purely on the basis that we are attempting to protect our borders. As we know, Australia is the only Western country that enforces a policy of mandatory detention for asylum seekers who arrive in the country without visa documentation.</para>
<para>There have been independent reports into the conditions in our detention centres. One was released last year by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, who highlighted in their report that mental distress in varying degrees is very much a common manifestation of detained persons within our detention centres. They also expressed concern that there was a lack of correlating mental health support in the system. The case of Ms Cornelia Rau certainly highlights that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission were correct in identifying this as a major failure in the system. It should also seem obvious to most people that a detention centre is hardly a conducive environment in which to recover from a situation where they have been traumatised or to recover from mental illness. However, this is the system that is in place. Again, the Cornelia Rau case just exposes how badly people can be treated as a consequence of this system.</para>
<para>More broadly, I think this case really exposes the extent to which the treatment of detainees in the manner in which Ms Rau has been treated has just become normal procedure for persons who cannot be identified as being lawful citizens. Essentially, it shows that we are happy to treat human beings and their human rights with contempt and that the onus is upon them to prove that the authorities are wrong in categorising them as being unlawful citizens in our country. Of course, as we now know, Ms Rau was an Australian resident. She had a right to be in this country and there was certainly no lawful authority for her to be detained in the manner in which she was.</para>
<para>The other thing that I think this case exposes is, as I said, in relation to public attitude. It took a group of detainees within the Baxter detention centre itself to highlight the plight of Ms Rau. As I understand it, they brought it to the attention of refugee advocates who, in turn, attempted to bring it to public attention. I think that in itself is very concerning but, again, it is as a result of the system that is in place: there is no open public scrutiny of what goes on behind the closed doors of Baxter detention centre and it is left to detainees and refugee advocates to bring to light the atrocities that are often occurring behind those closed doors.</para>
<para>Many speakers have spoken about the number of errors and failures that happened in our system which led to Ms Rau being left in the shocking circumstances that she has found herself in. I think that it is concerning and it suggests that the humanity and compassion of Australians is drifting further and further away from mainstream Australia. We are losing that sense that we have always prided ourselves on. We now seem to live in a country where the emphasis is on punitive measures in response to persons who appear to be, and often are, fleeing persecution in their own countries.</para>
<para>Labor have called upon the government to establish an independent and transparent public inquiry with all of the powers required to call evidence from all of the relevant authorities. Furthermore, there is a need for full resourcing of the inquiry and, given the seriousness of this matter, the inquiry should take place as a matter of haste and should report as soon as possible. We believe that aspects that ought to be investigated in the course of this full, public and transparent inquiry include the process leading up to Ms Rauâs detention and dealings between DIMIA and the Queensland police, including the availability of a missing persons notification. We say that the inquiry needs to look at the relevance of establishing an independent inspector general of detention, who would be supported and advised by the Immigration Detention and Advisory Group. We believe the inspector general should be able to monitor conditions and resolve complaints from detainees and their advocates.</para>
<para>The inquiry should also look at the desirable extent of independent external medical and psychiatric personnel to ensure sound monitoring of detainee conditions. There is a need to look at the monthly justification of continued detention after 90 days as well as the effect of the intrinsic tendency for a higher hurdle on psychological and health issues given the reality of detention centres. Finally, there is a need to investigate the adequacy of DIMIAâs database and reporting procedures for overstayers. This is a tragic incident and it deserves a response along the lines that Labor has outlined.</para>

<para>âSenator Kirk, both in her speech this afternoon and in the debate on the motion to take note of answers after question time, has sought to make the case that there has been a systemic failure in the management of Ms Rauâs case. By contrast, I think that the reverse is in fact true; I think that this lady has been managed very sensitively and that her interests have been carefully looked after at every stage of the process that has led to where we are now.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is a very sad and complex case. I think it is important that we deal with the substance of the issue and the facts before us, not the politics of the general issue of the governmentâs policy of detaining illegal immigrants. Ms Rau has a history of psychotic illness. She is schizophrenic. She was in a psychiatric institution in Sydney, from which she absconded. She very clearly wanted to conceal her identity after absconding. She had a stolen Norwegian passport as her identity document. She did not in any way admit to being who she was. She then claimed to be of German origin, coming from Munich, and, again, quite clearly, did not want anybody to know who she was; she concealed her identity.</para>
<para>If somebody wants to conceal their identity and mislead people about who they really are, unless there is some other compelling piece of evidence about their identity, it is very easy for them to conceal it and pretend to be someone else. This lady obviously did not like being in a psychiatric institution, so she left. She did not want to go back there. After some time, when she was interviewed by the police in Queensland, because of this confusion about whether she was Norwegian or German, or who she really was, the suspicion arose that she might have been an illegal entrant.</para>
<para>So far one can hardly say that is a history of systemic failure or poor treatment. This lady had a confused story about her identity. The issue arose as to whether she was an illegal migrant or an overstayer. Accordingly, she was placed in custody until her identity was established. I think it is important to understand that the diagnosis of psychiatric problems, and psychotic problems in particular, depends on the cooperation of the patient and their giving truthful answers to questions. People with psychotic illnesses are different from people who have psoriasis or dermatitis or a pain in their abdomen or something. They do not walk around with some identifiable sign on them that says, âHey, Iâm a schizophrenic,â âIâm a manic depressive,â or âIâve got an obsessive compulsive disorder.â There is no way of telling, unless they manifest some sign of that illness in their behaviour. Unless they do that, it is impossible to know that they have a mental illness.</para>
<para>On the ABC <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> program on 7 February, Minister Vanstone said that, while Ms Rau was in a Brisbane correction centre, suspicions were raised about her behaviour and she was sent to Brisbane Hospital for assessment. The assessment was that, while her behaviour was odd, she was not exhibiting any diagnostic symptoms of psychotic or mental illness. I think that, given that the assessment was made at such an early stage of the proceedings, again one must say that this is not an example of systemic failure; instead it is an example of sensitive treatment of a person who was behaving in a rather odd way but who was obviously well enough in control of herself not to be exhibiting overtly psychotic behaviourâand who was very careful about how she answered questions, I would suspect.</para>
<para>Consequently, according to the minister, investigations were carried out to determine her identity. She said she was German, and the German diplomatic service in Australia was contacted to see if they could locate her relatives in Munich, where she claimed to be from. She claimed to have a boyfriend in Germany. In addition, the police around Australia were contacted regarding whether she was a missing person. There were questions asked of Centrelink and other government agencies dealing with social security, births, deaths and marriages to determine whether or not her identity could be established. Again, that is an example of the system working to identify who this lady was.</para>
<para>When she was in Baxter, she was seen in the first week by a GP and a psychologist, who referred her to a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist recommended further assessment. As Senator Johnston said, in the debate on the motion to take note today, it takes time to establish the diagnosis that somebody is a schizophrenic as it is a thought and behaviour disorder. Schizophrenics do not really have split personalities, as people imagine; they are not Jekyll and Hyde. They are people with a strange thought disorder and shallow affect. They often have hallucinations of persecution; they hear voices talking to them. They think there are special messages for them on TV and so on. It takes time to build up that picture.</para>
<para>This lady was eventually sent off to a psychiatrist at the Baxter detention centre. Again, that is not an example of systemic failure but an example of this person being treated very sensitively. I would say, as a general comment, that this is a sad case involving a woman who sought to conceal her identity because she had absconded from a psychiatric institution in Sydney. The Queensland police authorities and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in fact took a great deal of care with her in order to establish who she was. Because of her odd behaviour, there were medical interventions quite early in the piece. So I repeat: this is no example of systemic failure; this is an example of sensitive treatment of a woman who sought to conceal her identity and the fact that she had a psychotic illness. In no way at all do I believe that any of the authorities involved warrant any kind of criticism; in fact, they deserve to be praised for treating this woman so well. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThe story of Cornelia Rau is an incredible case of negligence and incompetence by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Global Solutions Ltd, the company contracted to run the detention centres; and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone. It is incredible that behaviour that Aborigines in Cape York and asylum seekers in Baxter detention centre were able to clearly identify as being related to a mental illness could be construed by the department of immigration as ânormalâ. It is even more incredible that the department and authorities at Baxter detention centre deemed that it was appropriate to lock up Ms Rau in the isolation unit. The minister cannot claim ignorance, and the department cannot say it acted responsibly. The minister must apologise immediately, as should the Prime Minister. Appropriate compensation should be arranged for Ms Rau and her family.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Unfortunately, Ms Rauâs case is not an isolated incident. It is a snapshot of the cruelty that occurs behind the razor wire of our immigration detention centres. The treatment that Cornelia suffered is the same treatment that asylum seekers suffer every day. I have visited the detainees in Baxter detention centre. I have heard their stories, and I have seen the depression in their faces. Every day I receive correspondence from ordinary Australians who have befriended asylum seekers and who are horrified by the treatment their new friends receive. Two separate studies into mental illness and immigration detention concluded that almost all long-term detainees suffered at least one mental illness. Dr Louise Newman has called Baxter a de facto psychiatric hospital. If Cornelia Rauâs case is an example of the level of care it provides then this is a facility that should be closed. The Rau case has exposed an immigration detention regime that is systematic in its neglect of detainees, that results in human rights abuses and that strips asylum seekers of their dignity and their mental health. Detention itself is the problem.</para>
<para>The Greens called for a royal commission into conditions in detention in May 2003 after <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> aired allegations of brutality and abuse in our detention centres. We repeat the call this week. An inquiry must not be restricted to Cornelia Rauâs case; it must look at the conditions of all people in mandatory detention. Everyone, whether they are an Australian citizen, resident or noncitizen, is entitled to quality health care, dignity, human rights and justice. The inquiry must be transparent, independent and public. We believe that a royal commission, with broad terms of reference and an ability to take evidence from a wide variety of sources, is the best form of inquiry. This type of inquiry will reveal the full extent of the inhumanity of mandatory detention and why it must be abolished.</para>

<para>âI have to say I do not believe that todayâs urgency debate has exactly added to the lustre of the Senate. Here we have what is clearly a very sad case of a woman who according to the details provided in the media has suffered some quite horrendous circumstances and who needs to be restored to a different state to the one she has found herself in over the last nine months or so. Clearly, some kind of investigation is required to determine what happened in this case and make sure that, if there is any kind of structural problem to do with the housing and treatment of people in detention centres, it is dealt with. But what we have in this debate today is a litany of assumptions and accusations which appear to show no interest in what a considered analysis of the facts actually is.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We have heard that this case shows that there is negligence and incompetence on the part of DIMIA and the detention centre system. It shows systemic failure, according to Senator Kirk, and reflects badly on the government, on the minister and on the system of mandatory detentionâthe very system, incidentally, which Senator Kirkâs government put in place some years ago. It demonstrates that there are atrocities going on inside Australiaâs detention centre system. I think that is an overreaction to the evidence that is presently available of what happened to this particular woman. We need to find out what occurred before the judgments which have been passed in this chamber are put on the table. We need to know what actually happened.</para>
<para>I for one have great faith in Mr Mick Palmer determining what exactly happened in this matter. Mr Palmer served concurrently for some part of the period that he was Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police as the Chief Police Officer of the Australian Capital Territory. As police minister for the Australian Capital Territory during that period, I had occasion to work closely with him. I know him to be a man who is both fair minded and absolutely vigorous in the discharge of his duty. He is not a man who is going to have the wool easily pulled over his eyes. If there are facts to be found, this man will find them. Members of this place have said that they do not have confidence that people will come forward and tell their stories. I have no doubt that Mr Palmer will be more than capable of determining when people do not tell the full story, do not tell what actually happened, and that he will be able, with the intuition which comes from many years of service as a good policeman, to appropriately frame his findings and recommendations in light of that fact if it occurs. There is no evidence, of course, that it is going to occur.</para>
<para>The fact of what has happened today is that Senator Vanstone put on the table a series of pieces of information which ought to cause people who have jumped to conclusions about this matter to reassess their position. She has explained, for example, some information which could quite plausibly lead a person of goodwill, a person of good faith, to conclude that Ms Cornelia Rau was indeed a foreign visitor to these shores and in breach of the conditions under which she was visiting and to take the step of detaining her under the terms of the immigration legislation. That has been put on the table by Senator Vanstone and I think we need to know just how much of what is being said by other parties still stands in light of that evidence. But, of course, we will not know by virtue of what takes place in this debate. The enlightenment we seek will not be added to by what happens in this chamber with this sort of debate.</para>
<para>I must say that there is a considerable irony in hearing members opposite call for an open inquiry on this on the very same day that elsewhere in this city a Labor government is seeking to shut down an open inquiry into the circumstances by which four people lost their lives two years ago during the horrendous January bushfires. That irony does not appear to have drawn itself to the attention of those opposite. The fact is that members of the Australian Labor Party in this place, and other people, are trading on the unfortunate circumstances of this woman for political capital. They would prefer to talk about issues like this and others which are closer to home, closer to the internal circumstances of the Labor Party, and the convenience of this debate is a matter that presents itself very obviously to them.</para>
<para>I for one believe we need to wait and see what this inquiry produces. I for one have no doubt that Mick Palmer is the right man to determine what happened here and to put that evidence squarely before the Australian community. What he will determine, of course, will be determined in a fair-minded way, in a thorough way and in a way which will be evident to Australians, because this report will be public information when it is tabled. It is also important for this to be done fairly expeditiously, and that is the other advantage of the approach that the government has taken. I believe that it is a mistake to assume that merely because government agencies have been involved they must have in some way been at fault. It is possible for a system to be well designed and yet for certain individuals not to be dealt with with appropriate outcomes by that system. No system is perfect, and it may not be the imperfections in the system but the circumstances under which the case came about that explain why this situation arose. I want to see what those circumstances are and I for one believe that that is the appropriate approach for all of us to adopt hereânot jumping to conclusions, not assuming that we know better because we have read reports in the media. That does not do the Senate any credit, and it certainly does not do the family of Cornelia Rau any favours as it seeks to get to the bottom of what actually happened in this unfortunate case.</para>

<para class="block">I note that a coronial inquiry into the death of Mr Doomadgee has commenced in Palm Island. The letter from Mr Mackenroth, the Acting Premier of Queensland, relies very heavily on the importance of the Crime and Misconduct Commission inquiry into the death in custody. I note, and it is important for the Senate to note, that the Palm Island community and the Doomadgee family stated in a press statement on 31 January that they have lost confidence in the CMC inquiry. They believe there is a conflict of interest when police are involved in investigating police action and that this is unacceptable. The community on Palm Island needs to be satisfied that the investigation is above board and provides real answers. They say that they have lost confidence in the CMCâs ability to undertake their investigation in a fair and reasonable manner and now call on the federal government to instigate a royal commission into Mr Doomadgeeâs death.</para>
<para>These are very important concerns being raised by the people of Palm Island, particularly about whether they will get the answers they need out of a CMC inquiry. It raises questions which the Senate needs to keep an eye on. I do not want to speak for particularly long, but I thought we could not let that response from the Queensland government pass today without noting that the community on Palm Island has lost confidence in the CMC inquiry. It is vitally important that the Queensland government make every possible effort to rebuild the confidence of the people of Palm Island and that these issues regarding Mr Doomadgeeâs death be properly investigated. Certainly, the Senate needs to have a close watching brief on the outcomes of the coronial inquiry and the response of the Queensland Police Service and the Queensland government.</para>

<para class="centre">
<inline ref="R2088">Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">Managing Australiaâs fresh water resources effectively and efficiently is one of our most important environmental and resource management challenges. Without secure and high quality water resources we would be unable to sustain our regional economies or urban communities. The long-term health of our freshwater ecosystems also depends on us minimising the negative impacts of agricultural and urban water consumption.</para>
<para class="block">The emerging urban water problems in Australia are looking increasingly serious. One only needs to look at Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and South East Queensland for a graphic illustration of the urban water issues. High rates of population growth, the strong economy, increasing demands for environmental releases and prolonged drought conditions are continuing to offset the gains from conservation programs and increasing the pressure on available water supplies.</para>
<para class="block">Reduced rainfall and inflows to storages have resulted in much lower sustainable yields from available storages than had been projected as recently as 5 to 10 years ago. The Gold Coast, for example, will be past the sustainable yields of its existing dams in only a few short years. Previous estimates of the potential water available from unexploited dam resources are being revised downward as a result of the recent drought at a time when the population is growing at a tremendous rate. As a consequence the Gold Coast is now in the process of planning a new regional pipeline to collect water from a dam near Brisbane. Unfortunately this solution will only provide temporary relief and the Gold Coast is now looking at recycled water, desalination and rainwater as part of its future water supply strategy. Water conservation has become more than a noble idea for the Gold Coast, but is now an integral part of meeting future water needs.</para>
<para class="block">The Howard Government has taken this challenge very seriously by committing significant resources to improving water management across the nation and by working in partnership with the State and Territory Governments.</para>
<para class="block">Today I am introducing a Bill for the introduction of a national Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Scheme that will require water efficiency labels to appear on a range of common water-using products like washing machines, dishwashers and toilets and also establish a regime for the setting of minimum water efficiency standards. But before I explain the detail of the Bill, I would like to provide the broader context of the initiative.</para>
<para class="block">In 1994 the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreed to implement a strategic framework for the reform of the water industry. Through the implementation of water reforms over the last ten years, Australian governments have made some real progress towards efficient and sustainable water management. The recognition of the need for environmental water provisions, the separation of water entitlements from land, and pricing reform, have all been significant steps forward.</para>
<para class="block">At the COAG meeting in June this year, the Government and the States and Territories (except Western Australia and Tasmania) agreed to an Intergovernmental Agreement on a National Water Initiative. In essence, COAG recognised the twin imperatives to increase the productivity and efficiency of Australiaâs water use and to ensure the health of river and groundwater systems. It was agreed that opportunities for a cooperative national approach to further progress water reform exist in a number of areas. These form the basis of the National Water Initiative. Key features of the National Water Initiative include:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>Secure and nationally compatible water access entitlements;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Improved water trading, to expand water markets to their widest practical geographic scope;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Accountable, outcomes-focused provision and management of environmental water; and,</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Actions to better manage urban water demand.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">The urban water reforms are aimed at improving water-use efficiency and demand management, making better use of stormwater and recycled water, and encouraging water sensitive urban design. There has been a lot of activity in this area over the last ten years, including in the reform of water pricing in urban areas. This Billâthe Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Billâis a key initiative in support of the urban water reform agenda.</para>
<para class="block">The Government is also working with States and Territories to develop National Guidelines for Water Recyclingâmanaging health and environmental risks. The new Guidelines will cover water recycling and water sensitive urban design and be a part of the National Water Quality Management Strategy. The Guidelines will increase the uptake of water recycling opportunities in Australia to provide new sources of supply in a way that protects public health and the environment.</para>
<para class="block">This Government is pushing forward with the implementation of its commitments under the National Water Initiative.</para>
<para class="block">During the election, the Government announced the establishment of the $2 billion Australian Water Fund. Investment under the Fund will help achieve the objectives of the National Water Initiative through practical, on-ground water solutions. The three programmes that make up the Australian Water FundâWater Smart Australia, Raising National Water Standards and the Communities Programmeâwill directly support improvements in how we manage urban water use. In particular, investment under the Raising National Water Standards programme will support this water efficiency labelling scheme.</para>
<para class="block">The Government has introduced legislation in this session creating the new National Water Commission, a key commitment under the National Water Initiative.</para>
<para class="block">The National Water Commission will have two vital roles:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>It will evaluate and advise on the reform progress under the National Water Initiative in accordance with the Intergovernmental Agreement; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>It will also advise on project selection and administer projects under the Water Smart Australia and Raising National Water Standards programmes of the Australian Water Fund.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">So the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill must be seen in the context of the Governmentâs very significant achievements in relation to water reform and as a contribution towards achieving efficiency improvements under the National Water Initiative.</para>
<para class="block">At just under 1,800 gigalitres per year, that is, 1,800 billion litres per year, household water use accounts for about 16 percent of the consumption of the mains-supplied water in Australia. This is the second largest share of mains water use after agriculture, which at around 8,400 gigalitres per year, accounts for around 75 percent of consumption. Clearly whilst the âmain gameâ in water consumption will always focus on agricultural use, urban and household water use cannot be ignored, especially as our main urban centres are experiencing significant water supply problems. The dual effects of increasing population and the emerging impacts of climate change make efforts to manage urban water use ever more important. Indeed, between 1996 and 2001, the supply of water to households in the main urban areas increased by 13 percent.</para>
<para class="block">The purpose of the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill is to establish a water efficiency scheme for a range of important water-using products. Through the Scheme, the Government wants to empower consumers by providing them with information about the water efficiency of products so that they can contribute to water conservation directly through the purchase of more water-efficient products. This information will predominantly come in the form of labels on products covered by the Scheme, but also from the associated website and promotional material.</para>
<para class="block">The net savings to consumers are forecast to be substantial. By simply choosing more efficient products, by 2021 the community stands to save more than $600 million through reduced water and energy bills. And these savings will be achieved without any compromise in product performance or convenience or any major adjustment in user behaviour. A water-efficient washing machine performs its function just as well as an inefficient one, as does a water-efficient urinal. So the scheme will promote clever design that benefits both consumers and the economy.</para>
<para class="block">The water efficiency scheme will be the first of its kind in the world. Given that pressure on freshwater resources is emerging as a truly global problem, the potential for Australia to position itself as a leading exporter of water-efficient technologies and expertise is significant. Underpinned by a robust technical regime, our exporters will be able to use the label as a platform for marketing the water efficiency of their products to a growing global market.</para>
<para class="block">The Government estimates that by 2021, water efficiency labelling will cut domestic water use by five per cent or 87,200 megalitres per year. A total of 610,000 megalitresâmore water than in Sydney Harbourâwill be conserved by 2021. Nearly half the water savings will come from more efficient washing machines, about 25 percent from showers and 22 percent from toilets.</para>
<para class="block">The Scheme will also deliver substantial energy savings and greenhouse gas abatement through a reduction in hot water use. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for Australia is projected to reach about 570 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per annum by 2021, with a cumulative total of around 4,600 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2021.</para>
<para class="block">The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill establishes a national legal and administrative structure for the Scheme. And yet, in the true spirit of federalism, the Scheme provides for working in partnership with the States and Territories, which will enact complementary legislation. This mirror legislation will fill in the small constitutional gaps in the Commonwealthâs powers. Importantly, the States and Territories have also agreed in principle to assist with funding the program using the usual population-based funding formula for any program costs that cannot be recovered through industry registration fees.</para>
<para class="block">The Government expects the Scheme to commence in 2005. Initially, six appliances will be required to carry water efficiency labels: washing machines, dishwashers, toilets, showerheads, taps and urinals. Flow control devices will be covered on a voluntary basis. In addition to labelling, it is proposed that toilets will be required to comply with a minimum efficiency standard so that inefficient toilets with an average flush volume of more than five and a half litres can no longer be sold in Australia.</para>
<para class="block">Under the framework set out in the Bill, it will be possible in future years to introduce minimum water efficiency standards for additional water-using or water-saving products other than toilets, where the need for this can be established. Minimum water efficiency standards will ensure that inefficient products can no longer be sold.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill will also allow the product range covered by labelling requirements to be expanded if this is found to be appropriate in future years. Whilst the Scheme will initially cover washing machines, dishwashers, toilets, showerheads, urinals, taps and flow control devices, there is every reason to believe that further research and development will reveal that other products would benefit from labelling and minimum standards. For example, evaporative air-cooling systems and hot water systems are potential candidates for inclusion in the Scheme.</para>
<para class="block">Industry has been consulted on the detail of the proposal and I am pleased to advise that the Scheme enjoys broad support.</para>
<para class="block">The water efficiency scheme will help consumers make informed decisions about what products to purchase and the water, energy and financial savings that are possible. Industry will also benefit from the Scheme because it will create a level playing field in relation to claims about water efficiency and provide for nationally consistent product standards.</para>
<para class="block">In conclusion, in this Year of the Built Environment the water efficiency labelling and standards initiative provides another important way that all Australians can conserve water and so help to make our urban communities more sustainable.</para>

<para class="centre">
<inline ref="R2227">Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to amend Acts that are a consequence of the commencement of the Financial Management Legislation Amendment Act 1999 (FMLA Act 1999) on 1 July 1999 and to update, clarify and align other financial management and reporting provisions. It proposes amendments to 112 Acts and the repeal of 28 Acts.</para>
<para class="block">An exposure draft of the Bill was subject to an inquiry by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA), which tabled its report (number 395), Inquiry into the Draft Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill, on 20 August 2003. The Government tabled its response to the report on 26 June 2004. The reportâs recommendations led to changes to the Bill that were agreed by the Government in its response. The JCPAA inquiry was also of benefit because it provided an opportunity for stakeholders to discuss a range of important issues and to gain an appreciation of the similarity of many of the amendments proposed in the Bill.</para>
<para class="block">A number of other changes have been made to the Bill since the exposure draft was released for the purposes of the JCPAA inquiry. These changes reflect recent developments. The Minister for Finance and Administration has notified the Chairman of the JCPAA of these changes and the reasons for them.</para>
<para class="block">In the second reading of the FMLA Act 1999, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, the Hon Peter Slipper MP, foreshadowed that a consequential amendments bill would be introduced that will ensure that terminology in other Acts is consistent with the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (FMA Act) as amended by the FMLA Act 1999. These consequential amendments account for the bulk of the amendments proposed in Schedule 1 of the Bill.</para>
<para class="block">The FMLA Act 1999 abolished the following three funds created by the FMA Act: the Loan Fund, the Reserved Money Fund and the Commercial Activities Fund. These funds were located outside the Consolidated Revenue Fund as it was then envisaged. The balances of these funds were merged in the Consolidated Revenue Fund and components of the Reserved Money Fund and Commercial Activities Fund were replaced with Special Accounts. A Special Account records amounts in the Consolidated Revenue Fund appropriated for expenditure on the purposes of the Special Account.</para>
<para class="block">The FMLA Act 1999 also reflected the adoption of the concept of a self-executing Consolidated Revenue Fund. That is, that money raised or received by the Executive Government automatically forms part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund without the need to credit a ledger account or a bank account designated as the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</para>
<para class="block">The FMLA Act 1999 provided that references in other Acts and legislative instruments to the funds being abolished, and related terminology, were deemed to be read as changed to the new terminology introduced by that Act. The amendments contained in Schedule 1 of the Bill are almost exclusively textual changes to Acts to align them with the changed terminology introduced by the FMLA Act 1999.</para>
<para class="block">Most of the amendments proposed in Schedule 2 of the Bill provide for the transfer of powers, from the Treasurer to the Finance Minister, to approve investments, money raising and guarantees of certain bodies that are legally and financially separate from the Commonwealth. Most of these bodies are authorities subject to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 (CAC Act). The amendments also introduce clear delegation powers for the Finance Minister.</para>
<para class="block">The transfer of these approval powers will co-locate in Finance, as one central portfolio, powers relating to the financial oversight of bodies that are mainly funded from the Budget. This will provide for more efficient and effective decision-making in relation to the resources available to these entities.</para>
<para class="block">Schedule 3 of the Bill proposes the repeal of Acts. Most of these Acts would otherwise have required amendment of text to align with the FMLA Act 1999. However, because the Acts are redundant, they are included for repeal instead.</para>
<para class="block">Schedule 1 of the Bill proposes minor amendments to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 and the Corporations Act 2001, again reflecting the concept that the Consolidated Revenue Fund is self-executing. The Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted about these amendments and the required number of votes were received pursuant to the Corporations Agreement.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill also proposes amendments to the FMA Act and the CAC Act that are not covered by the types of amendments that I described earlier.</para>
<para class="block">The amendments to the FMA Act are mainly of the following three types. The first concerns clarifying and expanding the information required, or allowed, in a determination of the Finance Minister that establishes a Special Account. This amendment reflects the Governmentâs agreement to recommendation 1 of the JCPAAâs report 395.</para>
<para class="block">The second type concerns specifying the membership, in certain circumstances, of an Advisory Committee that considers proposals for large act of grace payments or waivers, to replace a reference to the Chief Executive of the former Department of Administrative Services with a Chief Executive nominated by the Finance Minister.</para>
<para class="block">The third type concerns clarifying delegation powers of Chief Executives of Agencies, and directions relating to the exercise of a power or function delegated.</para>
<para class="block">The amendments to the CAC Act align the offence provisions applying to the conduct of officers with the Criminal Code Act 1995.</para>
<para class="block">This proposed law will update, clarify and align a wide range of financial management provisions applying to Commonwealth entities and thereby enhance the financial management framework of the Australian Government generally. I commend the Bill.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">The document is a letter from Minister Hardgrave regarding the resolution of the Senate dealing with the opening of parliament and Indigenous Australians. This relates to the Senateâs repeated request that Indigenous Australians be involved in some of the ceremonial activities at the opening of each parliament after an election. This was something that was recommended in a report in the previous parliament, which was not accepted by the government. It was again put forward by the Senate as a resolution after the most recent election. It is very disappointing to see that the government has again rejected this proposal by the Senate that Indigenous Australians be recognised more clearly as part of the ceremonies for the opening of parliament.</para>
<para>I do not suggest that these things are more important than tackling the major disadvantage that Indigenous Australians face in so many ways throughout our community, but I do believe that with something that is ceremonial and therefore by definition full of symbolism, such as the opening of parliament, it is remiss not to have a more clear involvement of Indigenous Australians in some aspects of it. Clearly the Senate thinks so and has thought so a number of times, as has the committee that originally recommended it, and I urge that the government reconsider this.</para>
<para>I note that the ministerâs letter firstly suggests that the government believes the opening of parliament after an election is predominantly about the people who have been elected. Perhaps I can understand how those of us in the parliament who have been elected might feel that that is what the opening of parliament is all about. I think it is about a lot more than that. Certainly, in the central role that the parliament plays in our democracy concerning what it is to be Australian and some of the most essential positive things about Australia, it is disappointing that the government remains averse to this idea.</para>
<para>I also note, however, that the minister makes the point that the current arrangements were readopted in the House of Representatives without dissent. Whilst I know that members of the opposition in the House of Representatives probably cannot be bothered dissenting a lot of the time because the result is always the same, I urge them to perhaps make their concerns a little more vocal in that chamber so that they match the concerns and views that Labor members are expressing in the Senate. It is only by making the point, even in a fairly mild way such as I am attempting now, and reaffirming itâdrawing attention to it againâthat we increase the chances for change. Maybe if there was a little more niggling down in the lower house, we might get a little more movement from the government.</para>

<para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I wish to make a few remarks on the Auditor-Generalâs performance audit report No. 22 on investment of public funds. I wish to do that now because I do not think there will be another opportunity before estimates and it is something I wish to put on the record. The Auditor-Generalâs performance audit report No. 22 concerned the very important topic of investment of public funds. The Auditor-General notes at 30 June 2004 that Commonwealth entities reported financial investments totalling $20.208 billion, which is a great deal of money. That belongs to all Australians. It means that the Commonwealth holds a great deal of investment on behalf of each and every Australian in Australia.</para>
<para>It is vital that public funds are prudently managed in accordance with the rules outlined by the parliament. The bureaucracy should not be free to simply invest Australiansâ money in the manner they see fit. Anyone with experience in finance and in the financial industry will be able to explain that there is an inherent investment trade-off between returns and the risk of the investment. Quite properly, the Commonwealth, when holding public funds, has a low tolerance for financial risk, and investment activity should be limited to low-risk assets. The objective of the Auditor-Generalâs audit was to examine the investment of public funds by selected entities, their compliance with the relevant legislation, the value from the investment strategies and the subsequent reporting of the investment activities.</para>
<para>Six entitiesâthree under the Financial Management and Accountability Act and three under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Actâwere selected for the audit. The six entities audited owned $1.84 billion in investmentsâroughly 10 per cent of the total Commonwealth exposure. During the audit, it was found that $566 million in unauthorised investments were identified. So about $1 in every $4 were unauthorised investments. The conclusion of the Audit Office was that there had been shortcomings in the management of the investment of public funds. The report makes seven recommendations and states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Implementation of the recommendations should collectively lead to a level of management and focus commensurate with the quantum of public funds under investment.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">If you decipher that, that is a nice, fat slap on the wrist. The implicit conclusion is that the current standard of management is not commensurate with the $20 billion controlled by Commonwealth entities. As the report notes, there is no excuse for noncompliance. It states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is clearly important that entities comply with restrictions legislated by the Parliament. In addition, where departures by Commonwealth authorities are seen as prudent, the legislation provides a means of obtaining appropriate approval from the Treasurer.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This governmentâsometimes rightly, sometimes with a little bit of exaggerationâlays great claim to its economic management, and it should not pass by the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and Administration or, indeed, the government as a whole, that this is not up to the standard that they would demand of government.</para>
<para>It was at least pleasing to see that all agencies concerned agreed, or agreed in principle, to all of the recommendations; however, from my perspective, the law was broken. If company directors disregard the Corporations Law or the Trade Practices Act, they can end up in jail. Perhaps it is time to remind the public sector that they need to be conscious that, if they break the law where the parliament has specified how matters should be dealt with, they can experience the full force of the law.</para>
<para>I hope that we and the Labor Party will be able to investigate these procedural failures during the Senate estimates process. I will be interested to know if there will be a follow-up procedural audit that can cover some of the other entities that were not selected in this audit. It appears that Treasury did not keep proper records of approvals of investments. If the Treasury experts, the guardians of the system, are acting negligently, how can other non-financial entities be expected to keep records prudently? The loose practice with financial management, as I have stressed previously in this chamber, is also encouraged by the vagueness of Treasury reporting, specifically the breach of accounting standards, by refusing to recognise the GST as a federal tax.</para>
<para>I believe it is timely that these issues are raised. The Commonwealth is currently in an extremely strong financial position but, as the Reserve Bank Chairman, Ian Macfarlane, commented recently, it is in the good times that important concerns should be addressed. These are not technical accounting matters; they are matters of legality and should be given an appropriately solemn and immediate response. Finally, I wish to congratulate the Auditor-General and the Audit Office on the seriousness with which this issue has been approached and the quality of the report prepared. I hope that the ministers responsible will act immediately to improve this situation. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2225">Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004</inline>, and I indicate that the opposition is intending to support this bill. When we talk about water efficiency and especially about the supply and use of fresh water, it is worth remembering a few important facts. Some 97.5 per cent of the worldâs water is salt water and is unfit for human use. The majority of fresh water is beyond our reach, locked in polar snow and ice. Less than one per cent of fresh water is useable, amounting to only 0.01 per cent of the earthâs total water. This would be enough to support the worldâs population three times over, if used with care.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Unfortunately water, like population, is not distributed evenly. Asia has the greatest annual availability of fresh water and, disturbinglyâas we all knowâAustralia has the lowest. In fact, Australiaâs rainfall is the lowest of the continents, excluding Antarctica. This low rainfall, combined with very high evaporation, leads to low river flows. Despite this, we in this country still have one of the highest per capita consumption rates in the world. While two-thirds of all the people on earth use less than 60 litres of water a day, the average Australian uses more than twice that amount during a single shower.</para>
<para>Access to clean, safe water is fundamental to public health and our quality of life. Australians expect that, when we turn on our taps, the water that comes out will be clean and safe. That expectation is deeply ingrained in our way of life. However, our growing population, combined with our drought-prone climate, means that we simply have to learn to do more with less. Indeed, we are likely to have more frequent droughts if the predicted effects of global climate change kick in. That is something I hope Senator Ian Campbell is aware of; I note that the government continues to maintain its position against ratifying the Kyoto protocol.</para>
<para>Nevertheless, I am hopeful and believe that Australia can become one of the most water efficient communities in the world. However, we all have to take responsibility to rethink where water comes from, how it is used and how to reuse it. Water shortages across Australia in recent times, particularly in New South Wales, Western Australia, Victoria and South Australia, have shown that the efficient use of water is not simply a response to the current drought. It is, in fact, an essential step in learning how to live with less water without compromising our way of life. I note that in my home state of South Australia the state government has made significant efforts to move to permanent water conservation measures for urban use.</para>
<para>There are no simple solutions to our water shortage. What is needed is a multifaceted approach that combines new sources, new efficiency measures and innovative ways of reusing our waste water. Clearly, water remains one of the key environmental challenges for Australia. Indeed, after climate change it is probably our most serious challenge. There have been many manifestations of this in recent times. In Perth there are plans for a desalination plant costing an estimated $350 million because there are no local sources of water to meet that cityâs needs. In South Australiaâthe driest state in the driest continentâwe have our own water shortage problems. A great deal of work is being done on salt interception schemes around the River Murray which are aimed at preventing the deterioration of Adelaideâs drinking water. Such work is extremely important because, as we know, if nothing is done by 2020 Adelaideâs water is predicted not to meet World Health Organisation guidelines two days out of five. On this note, one of the things the Howard government could do is to deliver the 1,500 gigalitres of water which is required to restore the Murray to health and to ensure Adelaide in particular maintains a safe drinking water supply.</para>
<para>Melbourne was on stage 2 water restrictions for most of 2003. Sydneyâs problems with water have a very high profile, with restrictions on sprinklers or watering systems, washing cars, filling pools and general garden watering. As of last Thursday, Sydneyâs main water supply, Warragamba Dam, was only filled to 43.4 per cent of its capacity. I am sure that most people in Sydney know water use is a serious issue.</para>
<para>The question of water use and water efficiency that is before us in this legislation is a very serious challenge facing the country. The purpose of the bill is to provide for the establishment and operation of a scheme to apply national water efficiency labelling and minimum performance standards to certain water use products. The aim of water efficiency labelling is to encourage the uptake of water efficient products and appliances in domestic and commercial areas. This billâs objects are to conserve water supplies by reducing water consumption, to provide information for the purchasers of water use products and to promote the adoption of efficient and effective water use technology. It also provides for the establishment of a national water efficiency labelling and standards scheme to be implemented cooperatively by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments. It provides for penalties to be put in place for those who fail to comply with the registration, labelling and minimum efficiency and performance requirements and for an enforcement regime. The government estimates the bill will reduce consumption of water in households and non-residential buildings by five per cent by 2021.</para>
<para>Whilst this is an objective the opposition supports, we consider that it is a manifestly inadequate objective. We need to use water better and reduce our consumption of water in households and non-residential buildings by five per cent in a much shorter time frame. We need to reduce water consumption much more rapidly than by 2021. This is hardly an ambitious project. It is also expected that there will be some greenhouse gas reductions through reducing water heating associated with these measures. The legislation is being funded from savings identified in the Measures for a Better Environment package and it picks up on recommendation 4 of the Senate inquiry into urban water use.</para>
<para>I understand that those who have been consulted, including the product suppliers and retailers, have actively supported the introduction of this scheme and that it has not been opposed by industry generally. The bill addresses the mandatory labelling of most water use products, but in relation to mandatory performance standards it only applies to toilets. In the view of the Labor Party, the legislation is far weaker than it could have been and the environmental benefits will not be fully realised if the governmentâs agenda stands as it is in the bill. We believe there is a case for standards to apply far more broadly. It is the view of the opposition that water efficiency performance standards ought to apply to more water use products.</para>
<para>We make these points against the background of the comments with which I opened, that we are one of the highest per capita consumers of water in the world. In Australia each person uses around 350 litres per day, and our national reuse of effluent is just 14 per cent. If we could do more to reclaim and reuse stormwater, treated sewage effluent, treated industrial discharge and grey household waste water, we would be in a much better position to deal with shortages and it would boost our environment and our economy.</para>
<para>An integrated approach which considers all sources of water available to urban areas is needed to achieve a significant improvement in water use efficiency in urban areas. Reclaimed water can be used for a whole range of purposes, such as irrigation of city parks and sports ovals, industrial purposes and cooling water. Surplus floodwater can be used to recharge natural aquifers, and safe, treated urban effluent can be used on crops. There are many other uses. The government should be working with the states and territories to improve both water quality and the environmental outcomes of urban water management. The government should be investigating incentives for promoting stormwater and wastewater reuse and the integration of these issues in strategic planning of urban areas. The government should be using the COAG process to implement national initiatives to promote water saving measures such as rainwater tanks, water saving showerheads and tap fittings, dual flush toilets and increased use of grey water.</para>
<para>Another area of concern to the opposition is the research effort in relation to urban water. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth research effort in this crucial area has largely dried up. The government should be reinvigorating the role of the Commonwealth in research and development for irrigation, water reuse and innovation. Promoting water reuse research would yield many dividends, including better design and value from experimental projects and monitoring, covering gaps, integrating project results, ensuring quality control and disseminating information effectively to those who need it. Establishing an urban water research program would support innovation in the reuse of stormwater, the reuse of effluent, water conservation, water-sensitive urban design and urban water planning and management practices. The government should establish a national program of research to promote sustainable water use in Australia, with a particular focus on water reuse.</para>
<para>There are very significant challenges facing Australia in relation to domestic water use. Domestic households account for around 16 per cent of the consumption of mains-supplied water in Australia. That is the second largest share of mains water use after the agriculture, forestry and mining sectors, as you might expect. The main indoor use is showering, which accounts for 29 per cent of indoor consumption. In terms of overall domestic consumption, it is worth noting that the amount of water used for outdoor purposes does vary considerably between cities.</para>
<para>Between 1996 and 2001, the supply of water to households in the main urban areas of Australia increased by about 3.4 per cent per annum. According to information from the Water Services Association of Australia, water consumption in two state capitals is already beyond the safe yield level, meaning that additional supply or effective demand measures are required immediately. According to the association, three other capitals will be beyond the safe yield level between 2012 and 2020. That is a very serious situation and it does require action.</para>
<para>Back in 2002, the Senate ECITA committee completed an inquiry into Australiaâs management of urban water. I note Senator Allison is in the chamber; she was on that inquiry, and I think it was one of the first inquiries I came into, late, when I first came into the Senate. That was a couple of years ago. Unfortunately, many of the Senate committeeâs recommendations have not been taken up by the government. The committee commented extensively on the issue of urban demand management, indicating there is considerable scope to reduce water use and achieve efficiencies so that water-efficient appliances, which can dramatically reduce water use in the home, can be introduced. This approach, coupled with water-efficient gardens, the use of native plants, minimal lawns and efficient watering systems could yield substantial benefits. The committee found that the fundamental factor in a successful demand management program was changing behaviourâchanging the behaviour of Australians, changing us so that we do not do things like hose down the driveway and gutters, water lawns during the heat of the day and have extensively long showers.</para>
<para>So, what will be the impact of the labelling scheme which is provided for in the bill? According to the regulatory impact statement, the impact of the labelling component of the scheme will be to reduce total household water use by about five per cent by 2021, compared with the âbusiness as usualâ approach. As I indicated at the outset, we consider that to be an insufficiently ambitious target. No modelling has been done for the introduction of efficiency standards across all of the six products that were consideredâthat is, washing machines, dishwashers, toilets, showerheads, taps and urinals. The regulatory impact statement suggests that, for water users, the cost of water-efficient products will most likely be higher, but consumers will benefit from a net saving because water bills will be lower. The statement also considered manufacturers and importers, noting that labelling will come into force 12 months after the regulations under this bill are finalised.</para>
<para>As water efficiency labelling has an effect on consumer preference, the extent to which the sales of various manufacturers and importers are affected will depend on the water efficiency of their product ranges. Manufacturers and importers that offer only products of low water efficiency will obviously be disadvantaged. Retailers that carry at least some water-efficient models should be advantaged. Those that specialise in low-cost products with low water efficiency will be disadvantaged. However, as the awareness of water labels is likely to build up over time, retailers should have ample time to sell their old stocks and order in more water-efficient models.</para>
<para>We want to raise one concern about the labelling requirement. Whilst the labelling requirement should assist those plumbers and builders who take an interest in, or seek competitive advantage from, advising clients on water and energy efficient products, the fact is that many end users will not see the water efficiency labels. Plumbers and builders will still be free to select or recommend products, irrespective of water efficiency, as many do now, and may well remove the water efficiency labels before end users see them. However, we note there are other programs under way to raise plumbersâ awareness of water product efficiency, including the Green Plumbers program, run by the Master Plumbers and Mechanical Services Association of Australia, which does receive some funding from the Greenhouse Office.</para>
<para>The introduction of water efficiency labelling for various indoor water use products is unfortunately expected to have only a modest effect on household consumption, and that effect will obviously take some time to materialise. Nevertheless, the requirement for labelling foreshadowed in the bill is a positive step. However, we emphasise it is only one aspect of managing the demand for water by Australian households. It would certainly be worth while if modelling could be done on how the introduction of compulsory water efficiency standards for things like new showerheads or new washing machines would be likely to affect household consumption.</para>
<para>In conclusion, water is a very substantial challenge for Australia. It is a substantial challenge for our environment. It is a substantial challenge to get our water use right in rural areas and to maintain healthy river systems. It is also a substantial challenge to get our water use right in urban areas, to take action concerning ocean outfalls, to lift our water reuse and recycling and to reduce our water demand so that we can have sustainable practices in our cities and in the country. Against that background, the opposition support the legislation, but, as I have said, we do not think it goes far enough. The opposition believe the government ought be acting with a far greater sense of urgency. In the second reading amendment moved in the House we indicated that the government ought be delivering water efficiency standards for a range of indoor use products. The government ought take up what is a significant opportunity to reduce household water consumption.</para>

<para>âOn average, Australia uses 350 litres of water per person per day. This figure has already been mentioned several times in this chamber and no doubt will be again. The problem is that overall demand is increasing and that is putting greater pressure on our limited water resources. It is clear to the Democrats that urban centres in Australia are using water in ways and quantities that are unsustainable. A great deal is being done, but we still see a specific need to increase the pace of change. We see a definite role for the Commonwealth to play in managing national water resources and setting national standards for efficiency.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>At the time of the announcement of the Australian water fund, the Democrats were very pleased to see recognition from the Prime Minister of the role the federal government can play in achieving significant cultural shift in water use and management. However, the reform is not keeping pace with the damage being caused by the expanding ecological footprint of our cities and nor are water efficiency initiatives keeping pace with growth in water use. I am convinced that Australia already has most of the knowledge, the technical expertise and the systems to solve the problems in urban water management. In fact, many of the initiatives that have been taken in this country have gone offshore, where other countries are much more interested in conserving water than we have been to date.</para>
<para>I welcome the <inline ref="R2225">Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004</inline>. This comes as a result of negotiations between the Democrats and the government a year or so ago. The government wished to shift moneys that were not required from the oil recycling program to a range of projects, and we asked for water efficiency standards for appliances to be funded as part of numerous projects under Sustainable Cities, including extension of the photovoltaic scheme for 12 months.</para>
<para>Moving to national water efficiency standards was one of the recommendations, as has also been mentioned, of the 2002 Senate Inquiry into Australiaâs Urban Water Management. I chaired that inquiry, and we looked in great detail at the adequacy of policies to reduce urban water use, the performance of urban stormwater systems and the potential to improve water quality and environmental outcomes. The final report of that inquiry calls for the government to play a more prominent role in driving the changes needed for sustainable urban water management. Since that time the government has set up the National Water Initiative and the National Water Commission, and we hope these are the first of many steps to be taken in that direction. We look forward to what will initially be mandatory labelling showing water efficiency ratings for domestic fittings and appliances as we have already for energy, and on to mandatory standards. That has the potential to result in very significant water savings.</para>
<para>My understanding, Senator Wongâand, if Senator Campbell is back in time, I am sure he will say thisâis that toilets are the first step and that there is no requirement for other appliances to be in the legislation but they will be dealt with by regulation shortly. We hope to see continued work towards a similar water and energy efficiency rating scheme for buildings and for best-practice water management standards to be incorporated into Australiaâs building and plumbing codes, particularly to pave the way for much greater recycling of water. Re-use of effluent on gardens and domestic use of grey water in cisterns, for example, could have a major impact on water conservation in this country.</para>
<para>Efficient water use within households must be coupled with water sensitive urban design principles, which currently remain the exception rather than the rule. Substantial water savings can be made through stormwater infrastructure and management being changed and reformed by minimising stormwater run-off and encouraging structures that contain rainwater on site. I have a 1,100-litre rainwater tank which fills up on a regular basis, especially in recent storms, and it is very useful.</para>

<para>âWhen I am home, exactly. We know that large volumes of drinking water are used for maintaining urban gardens. Initiatives to re-use grey water must be more fully explored and we must also have efficient garden watering systems so that this incentive on household appliances is supplemented by other sensible measures.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The Democrats also urge the Commonwealth to lead by example and develop a strategy for progressively upgrading all Commonwealth buildings for high standards of water efficiency. The cisterns in my suite are certainly still single flush and I think it is time we moved to dual flush throughout this building. There is little doubt that water use in both urban and rural areas is of primary importance to Australians and fundamental to establishing a sustainable and enjoyable standard of living in this country. At the time of its announcement, the coalitionâs $2 billion Australian water fund was welcomed by the Democrats. A national approach to water through the Council of Australian Governments is crucial for Australia to move forward to the end goal of sustainable use of water resources.</para>
<para>The Senate has provided a clear basis for water reform strategy through both the urban water inquiry and the later rural water inquiry, which was chaired by my colleague Senator Ridgeway. Considering the importance of this issue and the absolute necessity of bringing the states on board for all negotiations, the Democrats encourage the federal government to engage with the states in order to establish an effective water reform strategy. It would be good to move quickly from mandatory labels to labels plus mandatory standards and for these to be progressively improved. The minister has notified us that he will see that minimum standards for water efficiency are identified and determined by the end of 2007. For the record, I thought I would read the relevant paragraphs of the ministerâs letter. He says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">As you may be aware, the Bill establishes a regulatory framework for the Scheme. Standards for specific products will be set by ministerial determination, once the Bill is enacted. The Government has foreshadowed, in the explanatory statement and regulatory impact statement tabled with the Bill, its intention to introduce a mandatory minimum standard for toilets. I anticipate setting this standard shortly after the Bill is enacted.</para>
<para class="block">I intend to consider the need for further mandatory minimum standards once the scheme has been in operation for 12 months. This will allow time for industry to adjust to the new regulatory requirements and also allow the Secretary of my department, as regulator, to gather information about the performance of products and the potential for further water savings and to recommend additional standards. I would then consult stakeholders through a regulatory impact statement in the normal way. I expect this process would be completed, ready for my final decision, in 2007.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">We strongly encourage the minister to act on that commitment. Without identification of the absolute minimum water efficiency baseline for manufacturers, efforts to reduce water use through the sale of water efficient appliances may well be offset by the sale of much cheaper products with no efficiency benefits. While labelling is a very important first move, plumbers and builders would of course be free to select or recommend products irrespective of water efficiency, as many do now, and would be able to remove the water efficiency labels before end users see them.</para>
<para>Wasteful water practices have resulted in the degradation of many of our water resources and in ongoing rationing in many of our capital cities and rural areas. The Democrats believe the commitment to funding to secure the National Water Initiative is extremely important. So we hope that state and federal governments will adopt the second unanimously agreed recommendation from the Senate inquiry into rural waterânamely, that COAG should negotiate an ongoing shared program for funding reforms in the Intergovernmental Agreement on a National Water Initiative.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="S430">Disability Discrimination Amendment (Education Standards) Bill 2004 [2005]</inline> amends the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 to ensure that the provisions of the draft disability standards for education are fully supported by the act. Labor supports this bill, which is the next step towards what, in my view, is the long overdue implementation of the disability standards for education. The bill amends the act to support the draft education standards in a number of ways. The bill introduces and defines the term âeducational providerâ, which is broader in this particular bill than the pre-existing definitions covering educational institutions and authorities.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The bill will make it unlawful for education providers to discriminate on the grounds of disability in the development or the accreditation of curricula or in training courses. It also includes a provision that educational providers may be required to develop strategies and programs to prevent the harassment and victimisation of students with disabilities. The bill extends the definitions of the defence in education, the so-called unjustifiable hardship provisions, to post-enrolment situations. While this extension of the unjustifiable hardship provisions has caused some concern, nonetheless Labor will support the provisions in the bill insofar as it supports the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissionâs and the Productivity Commissionâs assessment that the amendment will remove a source of inconsistency and confusion in the current act. I will return to this matter in a little while.</para>
<para>Section 31 of the Disability Discrimination Act provides that the Attorney-General may formulate standards in relation to a number of areas covered by the DDA, including the education of people with a disability. The bill clarifies that disability standards made under section 31 may require reasonable adjustments to be made in order to avoid unlawful discrimination on the grounds of disability. The government has released a final draft of the standards which is intended to clarify and elaborate upon the obligations of education and training providers in relation to students with disabilities. I understand that the government intends to table these standards in parliament following passage of this bill.</para>
<para>I feel particularly strongly about these matters. I have had the opportunity to discuss these issues in this parliament for some time. In fact, in 2002 I chaired the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee inquiry into the education of students with disabilities. The committee produced a bipartisan report and its recommendations were unanimously supported by all members of that committee. The key message then, and it remains the key message today, is that social justice demands that students with disabilities have equal access to education. As the committee stated in its report:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">This is a human rights issue of considerable significance.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In 2002, the committee expressed its disappointment at the failure of the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, MCEETYA, to finalise the Disability Standards for Education at its July 2002 meeting. Work on these standards has been under way since 1995âthat is, since before the current government came into existence. Stakeholders have already been involved in two consultation processesâback in 1997 and 2000. It was the committeeâs view that the inability to finalise these standards in a timely manner represented:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... a failure at the national level to recognise the paramount issue of equity in the provision of services to those with disabilities.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In my judgment, this failure makes a mockery of the Adelaide Declaration on the National Goals for Schooling in the 21st Century. This is held up in many quarters, particularly within government, as being a declaration of principle which asserts that schools should develop fully the talents and capacities of all studentsâI emphasise the words âall studentsâ. The national goals explicitly state:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Schooling should be socially just, so that studentsâ outcomes from schooling are free from the effects of negative forms of discrimination based on sex, language, culture and ethnicity, religion or disability; and of differences arising from studentsâ socio-economic background or geographic location.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Frankly, if we have a situation in this country where students with a disability are not able to fully develop their talents and capacities, then quite clearly we are failing to meet those grand principles.</para>
<para>In 2003, all state and territory members of the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, with the exception of Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, voted against the Commonwealthâs move to introduce the standards. While all the states and territories said they agreed with the content and intent, they were not prepared to move forward unless the Commonwealth agreed to share the costs of implementation which some considered to be significant. Given this apparent deadlock, it is pleasing to see that the Commonwealth has finally taken legislative action to support the Disability Standards for Education. In fact, that was the recommendation of the 2002 Senate inquiry. It is important on issues such as this that the Commonwealth in fact raises the bar. Just as commentators agree that the role of school principals appears to be crucial in establishing and maintaining a climate of inclusion in education, so the role of the Commonwealth government should be to provide leadership at a national policy level on these fundamental social justice questions.</para>
<para>The education standards must now be implemented as quickly as possible to ensure improved access for students with disabilities. There is strong support in the disability sector for the standards to be introduced. Importantly, implementation of the standards will reduce the need for parents to participate in highly stressful complaints and legal actions to ensure that their children are not discriminated against in education.</para>
<para>Looking at these issues in detail, we see that the issues addressed in this bill, like those addressed in the existing act, are in fact very serious. One of these issues that was drawn clearly to the attention of the committee during the 2002 inquiry was the importance of definitions. During this inquiry, the emphasis on definitions became apparent because, frankly, the principles of the definition of disability provide a situation where education providers and education access is in fact established. The definition issues are not just fodder for bureaucratic arguments, they have a genuine impact on the rights of people with disabilities and their capacity to have access to the services that they need.</para>
<para>In 2002, the Senate committee report highlighted that much of the definition of a disability or even whether a disability is defined at all hangs on this principle. The report said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Depending on the scope of the definition, rights are protected; funds are allocated; research commissioned, and policy evaluated. The definition of disability becomes particularly important when it provides a mechanism to compete for funds.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">A fairly narrow definition of disability tends to be applied when allocating funds for the support of students with disabilities. The committee found that the group of students with disabilities which attracts funding support has not kept pace with the advances in diagnosis and the potential for students requiring additional support.</para>
<para>Among other findings, in relation to the definition of disability the committee found that:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the Commonwealth definition of disability for the purposes of additional per capita funding, are narrower than the definition of disability under the <inline font-style="italic">Disability Discrimination Act 1992</inline>.</para>
</quote>
<para>The report stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The evidence suggests, however, that in supporting the education of students with disabilities, the Commonwealth has given scant regard to the obligations imposed on education authorities since the introduction of the Commonwealthâs anti-discrimination legislation:</para>
</quote>
<para>Some of the submissions to the inquiry raised concerns with proposed subsection 22(4), which would extend the defence of unjustifiable hardship in education to post-enrolment situations. Some parents expressed concern, and many advocates supported them, in relation to this provision, which is understandable. The record of nonâgovernment schools in citing unjustifiable hardship as a reason not to enrol students with disabilities is not a particularly good one. Finney v Hills Grammar School was a particularly well publicised caseâit led to considerable litigationâand was one which the non-government sector had expressed concerns about. The school was found to have discriminated against a girl with spina bifida. There are other cases that follow a similar pattern. It is something of a concern that non-government schools may use the extension of the unjustifiable hardship provisions to avoid their responsibilities in relation to students who are enrolled prior to the onset of a disability or whose needs change.</para>
<para>Related to this is the risk that the extension of the unjustifiable hardship provisions will exacerbate the double standards that already exist between government and nonâgovernment schools in the way in which their obligations to students with disabilities are expressed. Time will tell. I can only hope that the introduction of the disability standards for education, which will apply equally to both government and non-government sectors, will provide greater certainty for parents and students in terms of what their school will be required to do to support them.</para>
<para>I would like to emphasise that Labor support the implementation of the disability standards for education. However, we are somewhat disappointed that the Commonwealth has refused to accept any of the real financial responsibilities for the implementation of these new standards. Labor understand the concerns of many states that the costs involved in the implementation of these new standards will fall heavily on them in the absence of any serious financial commitment from the Commonwealth. It is particularly disappointing that the government has chosen to ignore the further recommendations of the 2002 inquiry. The recommendations were unanimously supported by the committee, which asserted that the costs of implementing the standards should be shared between the Commonwealth, states and territories. The inquiry found:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Disability Discrimination Act gives a new responsibility to the Commonwealth government. To ensure the objectives of the Act are achieved, the committee agrees that the Commonwealth will have to accept a level of financial responsibility for the implementation of the education standards ... Such funding would be over and above those funds currently provided to state governments for the education of students with disabilities.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The reference committee considering this bill was advised:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Minister for Education, Science and Training will contribute to the development of professional development materials ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">However, professional development involves a lot more than just materials. Indeed, the fact that this small element has been identified for the Commonwealthâs attention simply highlights the governmentâs lack of willingness to provide comprehensive support for the implementation of the standards. I argue that, in relation to professional development, the Commonwealth does have a key responsibility in the existing administrative arrangements. The Commonwealth has in the past acknowledged that responsibility. The Senate committee that looked at these matters in 2002 found that there was already a training deficit that needed to be urgently addressed and that an attitudinal change to professional development was long overdue. The committee took the view that effective professional development in the area of disabilities required programs to be properly structured and sustained over a period of time. As the report states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Quality professional development comes at a cost.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The committee also expressed a concern about the evidence it received, which pointed to a shortfall and which might be called the attitudinal budget. It noted that it was indicative of a problem more serious than the shortage of resources for disability education per se.</para>

<para class="block">A lot of the public debate around migration matters in Australia and in tribunals tends to focus on refugee issues. That is understandable in many respects but it sometimes obscures the fact that there is a huge range of other migration decisions made each year. The operation of the Migration Review Tribunal assesses appeals against those migration decisions that do not deal with refugee issues. There are a few aspects in this report that are worth pointing out. The interesting one at the start of the report is that the case load for the tribunal of a little under 8,000 cases represented a decline of 11 per cent in the number of cases lodged from the previous year. The tribunal suggests a number of reasons for that, including changes of visa criteria, strengthening integrity measures relating to migration agents and reductions in case loads.</para>
<para>Whether or not those reasons given are the only reasons or even whether they are valid ones could perhaps be tested elsewhere. Nonetheless, in most respects it is a positive sign that fewer appeals are being considered as long as that means that there are fewer mistakes being made. I hope that is the case rather than other hurdles being put in the way, but there is certainly nothing that I am aware of from the previous 12 months in terms of extra hurdles that would make that the case. That should mean that, overall, the decline in the number of cases lodged should be an indication that perhaps there are fewer erroneous decisions being made or fewer vexatious appeals being lodged. That may be the issue in relation to migration agents that are mentioned. It may also be a matter of better education amongst people about which areas are worth appealing against and which areas are not.</para>
<para>It should be noted that an appeal of a decision to the Migration Review Tribunal does incur a fee. I am fairly sure that fee is $1,400, which is refunded if you are successful. That in itself can be quite a significant hurdle for people wishing to appeal a matter as they are basically risking $1,400 to get a matter considered. There is scope for waiving that if people make a case for it but it is certainly a factor that can come into account.</para>
<para>The other big issue in relation to the Migration Review Tribunal is the length of time it takes to finalise a case. It is definitely a welcome sign in the report that the average time taken from lodging an appeal to finalising that appeal has clearly dropped in the last couple of years. It is still a fairly significant time, I might sayâ320 days is nearly a yearâbut it has dropped from 362 days the year before and 387 days the year before that. That is certainly a welcome sign. There are other examples. For instance, 585 days is the average time taken to resolve refusals for permanent business visas and 601 days is the average time taken to resolve an appeal for a skilled visa refusal. It is still far too long but, in the same way that I am certainly quite willing to criticise aspects of the migration regime when I believe it appropriate, I also think it should be acknowledged when there is a positive move, and clearly there is a move in the right direction here.</para>
<para>Overall, I think the percentage of successful appeals would, on one hand, show that the tribunal is able to be independent. On the other hand, it also shows that, when nearly 46 per cent of appeals of decisions set aside are successful, that is still a pretty high rate of what one could call errors in the different decisions made at the departmental level. That is an area that is still of concern. It is up from the previous year and in some categories, such as partner or visitor visas, over 60 per cent of decisions are set aside. That is an area that is still of concern and is something that needs further attention. One of the key frustrations of appealing to the Migration Review Tribunal is the length of time it takes. That being said, the improvements being made are certainly going in the right direction. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</motion>
<para class="block">I rise to speak in relation to the treaty actions with the National Interest Analyses, tabled earlier today, and note the amendments agreed in Bangkok in October last year to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, commonly known as the CITES convention. The very existence of this convention shows that the view that some people have that the best way to guarantee the survival of a species is to generate commercial markets in them clearly does not apply in all cases and, in some cases, the trade itself is a key part of why those species have become threatened. That is why this convention was generated: to try to regulate, control and, if it is sufficiently serious, prevent trade in species that are endangered. Sadly, there are a lot of species listed on the convention where trade is prevented and five species were shifted up to the highest level of protection required or the highest restriction on trade under the CITES convention in appendix 1.</para>
<para>The species that were shifted to appendix 1, which prevents all trade on those species, includes the Irrawaddy dolphin, the sulphur-crested cockatoo, the lilac-crowned Amazon parrot, the spider tortoise and a palm. All those species have been driven to the edge of extinction in part because of trade and, thanks to this convention, at least there are mechanisms being put in place to try to prevent that trade and give the species a chance of survival. There are also other species listed on appendix 2, which is slightly less strict but still regulates and monitors trade in species that are threatened with extinction. The Australian government played a key part in listing one of those species, the great white shark, which Australia nominated jointly with Madagascar. That nomination was accepted. The great white shark population continues to decline because of the commercial markets in shark jaws, fins and teeth. It is an example of how it is clearly not the case that giving an animal commercial value will somehow help and encourage people to preserve it, because those markets and that commercial value have dramatically increased the pressure on stocks of the great white shark and it is now clearly under serious threat of survival.</para>
<para>Other marine species were also listed in that appendix due to population decline: the humphead Maori wrasse and the date mussel. It is pleasing to see that those species are getting extra protection. There are other marine species that I believe the Australian government could do more to protect. I think protection of some of those is being avoided because it would be in the too-hard basket. They are commercial marine species and their protection may affect Australian markets. Obviously, it is a lot easier for the Australian government to support listing a species where there is no trade in Australia, but where there is trade within Australia then the government seems less keen to do that. I urge the Australian government not just to worry about the date mussel but also to look at some of the other fish and marine species that could do with listing under the CITES convention.</para>
<para>It is pleasing to see the ministerâs support for date mussels as well as for the great white shark and the Maori wrasse, but it needs to be more consistent across the board to ensure that all species that are under threat because of international trade are put under the protection of this convention. Whilst Australia is doing very good work with some species, we are falling short of the mark with other species. I urge the government to do more to ensure that those species that need listing do actually end up on the list. I also encourage the government to do more to ensure that the convention operates as effectively as possible. It is one thing to put a speciesâ name on a piece of paper; it is another to ensure that the protections it has theoretically are implemented in practice. That is certainly an area where more work could be done.</para>

<para>âThis afternoon senators united in expressions of condolence for the victims of the Boxing Day tsunami tragedy. Earlier today the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, noted how important it is for the national parliament to act as a united representative of the Australian people in times of great tragedy. Sadly, we have known more of those times over recent years than any of us would wish. On each occasion, we in the parliament have been reminded that the matters on which we agree are more significant than those on which we disagree.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Tonight I want to acknowledge the magnificent response of local governments to the tsunami tragedy. In doing so, I do not want to avoid acknowledgement of the response of local governments to the South Australian bushfires and indeed many other events where local expertise, local knowledge and the capacity to respond quickly to identified needs is required. This level of government does, of course, do much that goes unacknowledged. Only rarely does the national parliament extend to this sphere of government the acknowledgement it deserves.</para>
<para>I know that many members and senators have a good deal of regard for the work done by local governments in their electorates. As Laborâs spokesperson on local government matters I propose to highlight as regularly as I can the contribution that local government makes to the wellbeing of our nation. In relation to the tsunami tragedy, this sphere of government has acted quickly to lend assistance to devastated communities. Some of this activity has been coordinated by the peak local government representative body, the Australian Local Government Association, and its state and territory based member organisations.</para>
<para>One week after the disaster struckâearly in the new year and bang in the middle of the holiday seasonâthe ALGA President, Councillor Paul Bell, issued a statement about the local government response to the tsunami tragedy. He noted that Australian communities have always been quick to help those in crisis and pledged that local government would do all it could to assist in this time of need. Councillor Bell said ALGA would offer advice to Australian councils about how they could best support the effort to assist affected communities and would establish a web site to facilitate the provision of this advice.</para>
<para>I can report that the web site was established very quickly indeed, and the Australian Local Government Association has played a key role in assisting local government to maximise its contribution to the relief of devastated communities. I urge senators to visit the ALGA web siteâwww.alga.com.auâand acquaint themselves with the local government contribution to the tsunami relief effort. On that site they will find an opportunity for councils and individuals to register offers of assistance. They will find details of the Adopt a Village program, which establishes direct beneficial links between Australian local government bodies and villages in tsunami-hit Sri Lanka. The ALGA tsunami relief web site also offers a small sample of the many activities being undertaken by local governments across Australia. I want to highlight some of those activities tonight.</para>
<para>Brisbane City Council has donated $100,000 to the Australian Red Cross tsunami relief appeal and established condolence registers at all council libraries, ward offices and city hall. Shoalhaven City Council has collected cash donations from residents and visitors for the Red Cross tsunami appeal. Manly Council has made community facilities available to a community initiative, Aid4Aceh, which has collected medical supplies for distribution to the Indonesian province of Aceh.</para>
<para>Whittlesea City Council has called a meeting of groups from Indian, Sri Lankan and other affected local communities and added resource material containing telephone hotline numbers and general information to the councilâs web site. The City of Fremantle is lending a hand to its sister city, Seberang Perai in Penang, Malaysia, and has held a special fundraising function entitled, intriguingly, âthe Brown Paper Bag Eventâ. The City of Melbourne has allocated $500,000 to the relief effort, offered the Melbourne Town Hall to community organisations and placed a condolence book in the town hall foyer.</para>
<para>The City of Sydney launched a New Yearâs appeal for tsunami relief and pledged $50,000 to Oxfam to kick-start donations. I understand about $900,000 was collected at the cityâs New Yearâs Eve event. Mosman Municipal Council coordinated a day of fundraising on 9 January, saying that it was to âenable us to donate as a community and share our commitment to each otherâ. The City of Greater Dandenong has donated $10,000 to the Red Cross tsunami appeal and supported a tsunami interfaith gathering of prayer and reflection on 16 January in a local park.</para>
<para>Maroondah City Council has also donated $10,000 to the relief appeal and invited donations at its customer service centres. The City of Joondalup has approved the use of five environmental health officers to assist in the recovery effort. Port Phillip City Council has organised an interfaith community commemoration service and consulted with overseas aid groups to identify the best way that Port Phillip can offer long-term practical assistance to help rebuild devastated communities. Macedon Ranges Shire Council has organised a benefit concert and established a link with the local Sri Lankan community to assist rebuilding.</para>
<para>Whyalla City Council joined the Red Cross and the Salvation Army to conduct an appeal on Australia Day for both bushfire and tsunami victims. Mansfield Shire Council has donated funds to the Red Cross tsunami appeal and is acting as a collection agency for Red Cross donations. Council staff have also organised clothing donations to Sri Lanka. Kingston City Council has donated $10,000 and made customer service centres available as collection points for further donations. The council has also donated the use of the town hall for fundraising activities.</para>
<para>Adelaide City Council staff members have made payroll deductions to CARE Australia. Hobsons Bay City Council has held a concert benefit featuring local youth bands and established accounts with appeal funds for staff payroll deductions. A group of five Adelaide western suburb councilsâCharles Sturt, Marion, West Torrens, Holdfast Bay and Port Adelaide-Enfieldâhave processed donations through their offices, and the mayors of each municipality have pledged $1,000 to the fundraising effort. Latrobe City Council has pledged a donation of $10,000 to the Australian Red Cross.</para>
<para>The City of Onkaparinga has committed itself to a 12-month response to the tsunami tragedy, donated $30,000 to the relief effort and received strong fundraising support from its staff social club. The rural City of Wangaratta formed a committee to oversee Wangarattaâs â10 Days of Givingâ, which raised funds for the tsunami relief effort. Caloundra City Council has donated $50,000 to the APN tsunami relief appeal from its charity and benevolent management fund. Council staff members have also contributed to relief efforts through fundraising activities coordinated by their social club. Banyule City Council has donated $10,000 and made its community halls available for fundraising.</para>
<para>But I should say that councils in my home state of Tasmania have also made a tremendous contribution. My office is in the city of Launceston. They have made available facilities for fundraising and have conducted a special interfaith ceremony in commemoration of the victims. Waratah-Wynyard council has announced a $14,000 donation to an ALGA approved tsunami infrastructure benefit fund. This contribution represents about $1 for every member of the Waratah-Wynyard population.</para>
<para>Tasman council, together with the Port Arthur Historic Site Management Authority, hosted a âNight of Lightsâ concert on 28 January as a way of saying thank you for the support of the local communityâsimilar to the support they got eight years agoâin giving help to others. The Salvation Army and the Red Cross collected donations during the evening. Glenorchy City Council has donated $20,000 to World Vision Australia to enable the council to sponsor five children from the affected tsunami region to an amount of approximately $500 per annum per child over eight years.</para>
<para>King Island council has established a King Island tsunami appeal, with an initial target of $10,000, kicked off by a donation from the council. Clarence City Council has allocated $10,000 for tsunami relief. Northern Midlands council has initiated a tsunami appeal and donated $2,000 to the fund. Hobart City Council has made a $50,000 donation towards the establishment of an orphanage in Aceh. The council has also made contact with the Australian Local Government Association to identify ways in which it can assist in the long-term recovery process. Sorell council is hosting a benefit on Sunday, 13 March, to raise more funds.</para>
<para>These are magnificent efforts, and they are just a small sample of the contribution that local governments around the country have made as part of the Australia wide response to the tsunami disaster. Tonight I acknowledge that contribution, one that proudly reflects the generosity of the communities that local government so effectively represents.</para>

<para>âOn 27 November 2003 I made a statement to the Senate that the Department of Finance and Administration, through its administrative unit, Comcover, was investigating various contractual compliance matters associated with its reinsurance broker, the Heath Lambert Group. I would like to advise the Senate of the outcome of those investigations now that all issues associated with this matter have finally been resolved.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As previously advised in my 27 November 2003 statement, Comcover engaged the services of Ernst and Young on 15 September 2003 to conduct a thorough review of Heath Lambertâs contractual compliance relating to commissions received by Heath Lambert in respect of reinsurance placements made on behalf of Comcover. The Ernst and Young investigation was conducted in both the Sydney and London offices of Heath Lambert with Heath Lambertâs full cooperation. The investigation revealed that the Heath Lambert group received various commissions in respect of its placement of reinsurance for Comcover in noncompliance with both its 1999 and 2003 contracts with Comcover. Specifically, since 1999, Heath Lambert received commissions from various underwriters amounting to $2,903,307.51. Heath Lambert in its statement of 28 November 2003 stated that the practice of receiving commissions for placing reinsurance is widespread in the insurance industry. However, Health Lambert noted that it had contractually removed its ability to retain such commissions in its contracts with Comcover.</para>
<para>Heath Lambert stated that the matter had arisen because of the misunderstanding between Heath Lambert and its United Kingdom parent company and affiliates over whether commissions were allowed under the contract with Comcover. The receipt of commissions by Heath Lambert was a breach of its contract. A negotiated settlement was finalised in May 2004 by way of a deed of release executed by the parties. However, this matter was then considered by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in relation to possible breaches of relevant regulatory legislation. The commission advised on 10 December last year that it had finalised its investigation and that it would be taking no further action in relation to Comcoverâs allegations.</para>
<para>Under the settlement, Heath Lambert agreed to pay to the Commonwealth damages of an amount equal to all the commissions identified as having been received by Heath Lambert in breach of its contract with the Commonwealth. This amount of approximately $2.9 million will be distributed to Comcover fund members. In addition, Heath Lambert agreed to pay costs, including interest, of $365,526.03 that Comcover incurred associated with investigating the contractual compliance issue. This brought the total amount of damages and costs recovered through the investigation to $3,268,833.54. I consider this outcome to be sound and defensible. A negotiated settlement with Heath Lambert has maximised the Commonwealthâs return.</para>
<para>The Australian Government Solicitor provided legal advice and assistance to Comcover in resolving this matter. It has advised that the settlement was in accordance with the legal services directions. These directionsâwhich are to be adhered to when the Commonwealth is or may be involved in a legal disputeâset required standards of behaviour which must be met in the settlement of any dispute. Additionally, independent advice from Ernst and Young confirms the outcome to be fair and in the Commonwealthâs best interests.</para>
<para>Heath Lambertâs contract with Comcover expired on 30 June 2004, following an open competitive tender in late April 2004. Jardine Lloyd Thompson Pty Ltd was awarded the contract to conduct these services for Comcover for 2004-05, with two one-year renewal options at the discretion of the Commonwealth. The government took strong and decisive action to resolve this matter, with significant damages having been paid by Heath Lambert and the public money spent on the investigation recovered in the settlement. I commend Comcover and Finance for their vital role in achieving this appropriate outcome.</para>
<para>The investigation also identified ways in which reporting and control mechanisms in the contract and in Comcoverâs oversight practices can be strengthened. Comcover has since implemented improvements for future contractual arrangements. For the record, I indicate that I have provided a copy of this statement to Senator Carr and Senator Murray, who shadow me in this area. I note that neither of those senators have had the opportunity to respond to this statement tonight, but I have no doubt that Senator Carr will respond on some future occasion and possibly follow-up during Senate estimates.</para>

<para>âI want to speak tonight about judgesâ pay and conditions. In doing so, I am mindful that the federated nature of Australia produces different judicial structures and sometimes generates widely variant responses to what on the face of things might seem to be similar issues.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In this chamber, we meet in the middle of the Australian Capital Territory. The ACT is a place that almost anywhere else in the world would be a city, but which in federal Australia has been accorded the status of a fully-fledged territorial government. This means it has a Chief Minister who can make far-reaching decisions at a government level. Now I do not mean that the ACT should not be a territory. It is an honoured and very pleasant part of our federation and it is served with distinction in this chamber by my very good friend and colleague Senator Humphries and also through the energetic focus of Senator Lundy. But I was interested to see that at the beginning of December the ACT Chief Minister had been reported in the press as vowing to review his judgesâ leave provisions to put them in line with something he described as community standards. The Chief Minister was reported to have been stung by revelations that ACT judges enjoy more than two months of holidays a year. He should not have been stung; he should have known that, particularly as a former Attorney-General. But then, perhaps he did.</para>
<para>A Chief Minister should certainly know that judicial holidaysâwhich critics like to describe as lengthyâactually provide for rather more than just extra time at the beach under the umbrella, having slip-slop-slapped and put on a hat of course, for members of the bench. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 3 December last year, the ACT Chief Minister became the first state or territory leader to promise action to curb what senior legal figures have described as the outdated luxury of extended annual leave for the judiciary. He was the first of a number of political leaders to jump on that bandwagon this time around. It is also said that the Chief Minister believed there was a concern that the public might regard the level of leave as inconsistent with community standards and that it might impact on the efficient administration of the courts. I think we need, as a legislature and as a community, to consider very carefully what it is we mean by community standards insofar as they apply to the rates for the job.</para>
<para>Obviously there is no system that cannot be improved, whether in the discipline of dog catching or the business of court administration. Efficiency is vital and timeliness is crucial, especially in the delivery of justice and judgment. But at the same time, chanting mantras about community standards is a bit of cop-out when the only obvious motive is to press the populist button. We need to understand as a community what it is that judges do, and what it costs them to provide that essential public service. Most judges go to the bench from the bar. Manyâif not in fact allâlose money when they do so. Senior barristers at the peak of the legal profession are very well remunerated. The people deserve justice delivered effectively and efficiently, with scholarship and learning and with scrupulous fairness.</para>
<para>In order to achieve these objectives, judges must lead what is in effect a reclusive lifestyle, and so must their families. A judge must be detached from influence. She or he must be seen to be independent. A judge must accommodate herself or himself to the significant loss of social opportunity that comes with having to remain detached from the community. It is important that they keep up with judicial issues and matters and continuously work to inform themselves of all manner of legal arguments and decisions. It is not a nine-to-five job.</para>
<para>From time to time, some people have a lot of sport with judgesâ holidays. It is sometimes open season on judicial travel. For exampleâyou know the sort of thing I am referring to, Mr Acting Deputy President Bolkusâsome catchy headline might proclaim: âJudge Gadabout takes flightâ. Of course it is not only judges who enjoy holidays or who, for that matterâto mention a point publicised only this weekâjoin the lengthy list of Australians who have failed to lodge their tax returns on time. Holidays are a professionally enhancing element of a doctorâs or a scientistâs career, for exampleâand for a plethora of academics they are an actual art form, and, dare one say it, that is so even for newspaper editors and senior journalists. It is odd how no journalist or newspaper editor ever comes back from a freebie and confesses publicly to its all having been a horrid waste of time and an expense that would better have been avoided.</para>
<para>We often hear the argument that judges are on the public payroll and are invited to conclude that wasting private payrolls on sabbaticals and other perks is another matter. But who else is going to pay our judges? Who else is going to provide the level of superannuation that was opposed by the Labor Party before the last election? It will be interesting to hear what the newly recycled Labor leader has to say about that matter nowâthe level of superannuation that judges deserve and that helps to guarantee their independence and the integrity of the justice system.</para>
<para>That is not to say there cannot be improvements made to the administration of justice either at the Commonwealth level or in the various state and territory judicial systems. I am reminded that last year the member for Denison, himself a QC, told the House of Representatives in an appropriations bill debate that he had been in correspondence with former Federal Court Justice Russell Fox, who had been advocating the need to look at judicial process to ensure that Australia has the best and most efficient system of administration of justice. The member for Denison, for whom I have great respect as both a lawyer and a representative, made the point that efficient management of the judicial system is a dark corner of public administration. He noted that it has little academic or public attention except when particular matters come to light because of the grossness of the way in which delay has occurred or procedures have gone awry.</para>
<para>He made the further point that âroutinelyââas he put itâlarge amounts of litigantsâ moneys are wasted, and procedures are often anachronistic and not properly reformed because attention is not given to them in a strategic or systemic way. Without going into the substance of his argument or indeed arguing that things probably are not quite as dismal in that unexplored corner of public administration as the member for Denison asserts, of course we can always do better and of course we should always try to do better. However, it is unlikely that we shall do better so far as the administration of justice is concerned if we allow populist tub thumping by premiers and chief ministers to pass without comment or correctionâor, even worse, to win the day by default.</para>
<para>My friend Senator Mason in a contribution in this chamber last March attacked the then Labor Party position of reducing judgesâ superannuation. Senator Mason noted that under the then Labor leader, Lathamâthe unrequited levellerâjudges would be shifted to a so-called âcommunity standard superannuation schemeâ, calculated to constitute a 60 per cent reduction in judgesâ superannuation entitlements. The sheer folly of this proposal is obvious. It is in the communityâs interest to attract the best judicial brains to the bench. That is where Laborâs so-called âcommunity standardâ should really come into play.</para>
<para>Arriving at judicial decisions is not like driving a bus. Driving buses is a skilled occupation for which the community rightly demands appropriate training, discipline and appropriate skills, and a clean driving record. Deriving a fair and reasonable judgment from a body of law, free from the influence of any other party, is also a skilled occupation, but one of an entirely different character. I do not think most Australians would be very happy at the thought of judges driving buses. I believe most Australians, very sensibly, would be remarkably averse to a bus driver hearing complex legal argument in court and then deliberating on that argument. To put in its proper context, we must continue to ensure that we get the best judges we can and reward them accordingly.</para>

<para>âOver the last few months we have been having a very one-sided debate on abortion. We have heard almost exclusively from male MPs and we have heard how tragic and terrible it is that 100,000 pregnancies are terminated each year in this country. We have heard that women are having late-term abortions and that while there are babies being born premature and being saved others of the same gestation are being aborted. Women have listened to this debate in dismay. These were arguments they thought were put to bed decades earlier. They have not wanted to give oxygen to this damaging debate. I say âdamagingâ because I think those pushing this issue mean to damage women. They mean to make them feel ashamed, guilty and fearful. They would have us return to the bad old days of expensive, illegal and dangerous abortions, in the hope that women will bear children they do not want. I think it is time for us to stop turning the other cheek and to recognise that this debate is not going to go away. I draw the Senateâs attention to an article that appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper on 4 February 2005 by Samantha Maiden. It read:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Willy-nilly pregnant women âdumbâ</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">A COALITION MP calling for a ban on late-term abortion has questioned why older, educated women in Australia are âso dumb to get pregnant willy-nillyâ.</para>
<para class="block">As Health Minister Tony Abbott defiantly declared last night he had no plans to take a âvow of silenceâ over abortion, leading anti-abortion Liberal MP Alan Cadman said he wanted more support for women to adopt or bring up their child, but wondered why there were still so many unwanted pregnancies.</para>
<para class="block">Asked why abortion statistics suggested it was older women who were having the most abortions, not teenagers, Mr Cadman, 67, said he could not understand why.</para>
<para class="block">âI canât believe that women in this day and age are so dumb to get pregnant willy-nilly,â he told <inline font-style="italic">The Australian</inline>.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">As I said, I think a lot of the anti-abortion campaign to date is intended to shame women. Mr Cadmanâs comments go a step further than shaming women who have had abortions. He insults every woman who has ever had an unwanted pregnancy, while revealing his own lack of understanding of the issues.</para>
<para>I also draw attention to the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> today by Lachlan Heywood, entitled âMP urges refusal after one terminationâ, which reports that Liberal member of parliament Peter Lindsay has said that a woman should be able to receive only one abortion on Medicare. He is quoted as saying, âI am of the view that âOkay, you make one mistake, but there is no reason for two.ââ I am going to send both these members of parliament copies of a simple sex education booklet because they are clearly unaware of the basics. Any sex education book, including those produced by church groups, will point out that no contraception is 100 per cent effective. To say that women are dumb when contraception fails or that they should be denied access to an abortion under Medicare if they get pregnant more than once is just appalling. One wonders what punishment would be given to the men who impregnated these women. Will they be denied Medicare next time they go to their GP? Or perhaps they should get a bonus if they go off and have a vasectomy. I do not hear this kind of debate being given weight.</para>
<para>Other developments in this debate over recent years include threats to limit access to emergency contraception, conditions put in place around the availability of RU486, attempts to limit young peopleâs access to confidential medical records and the recent proposals to reduce access to abortion. Senator McGauran gained access to a womanâs private hospital records and medical records despite the patientâs refusal to give her consent to their disclosure and despite her doctorâs refusal to provide the information on the basis of doctor-patient privilege. Senator Boswell has just asked for details about women who have abortions: their ages, income, marital status, number of children, previous abortions, reasons for abortion, geographical location et cetera. Why does he want this information? Is it because Senator Boswell thinks that some abortions are justified and others are not? Is it because he thinks that some women deserve to be forced to continue with an unplanned pregnancy while others do not?</para>
<para>I think we need to be reminded that 80 per cent of the Australian population support access to safe, affordable, accessible abortion services, and yet anti-abortion groups have not accepted that, and they have become much more cunning in the way they frame their arguments. They are not only shaming women but also trying to make doctors reluctant to provide this medical serviceâand, if the report in the <inline font-style="italic">Sun-Herald</inline> this week is true, they are being effective. The <inline font-style="italic">Sun-Herald</inline> reported that a womanâs health has been put at risk because a hospital has refused to undertake a legal medical process because of the âpolitical climateâ.</para>
<para>The anti-abortion groups are, of course, still very loose with the facts when trying to make their case. They refer to inaccurate statistics on the so-called âabortion epidemicâ and make unsubstantiated generalisations about women suffering psychological problems following terminations and being forced to have terminations. I make the point that there are no reliable national figures on the number of abortions performed in Australia. However, we do know that the number has been falling. Health Insurance Commission figures show that the number of Medicare funded abortion type procedures fell from 76,000 in 1997 to 73,000 in 2004, and many of those procedures were for spontaneous abortions or unviable foetusesâwhich are included in those records. We do have a higher teenage pregnancy rate and a higher teenage abortion rate than many other developed countriesâsomething which obviously should be addressed with some urgency. However, even teenage pregnancies have declined substantially since the 1970s.</para>
<para>The calls to ban late-term abortions are just as disingenuous. All evidence suggests that abortions performed in the third trimester are very rare and are overwhelmingly the result of foetal abnormalities. Those abnormalities are being identified by new technologies. A recent study of 9,000 Australian women concluded that most unplanned pregnancies in adults are likely to be attributable to method failure or inconsistent use. I think that anti-abortion groups run the line about late termination abortions because there is widespread support in the community to oppose an outright ban on abortion. So now we are hearing about women needing a cooling-off period, or needing more information through the provision of mandatory counselling, or being forced to see a scan of the foetus. I might point out that most pregnancy counselling services are run by anti-abortion groups. They do not admit that in the advertisements that are in telephone directories and the like. I do not hear calls for mandatory counselling or for forcing people to see scans for other medical procedures. These people seem to believe that women who choose to have abortions do so thoughtlessly and that they have not thought through what they are doing. The reality is that women who have an abortion are aware that it will end a potential life and stop a baby being brought into the world. They take motherhood seriously and will decide to end a pregnancy rather than bring a child into the world under the wrong circumstances.</para>
<para>I regard this as just the beginning of the debate. There is a great deal more to be said about this campaign which is being waged. I am extremely fearful of the consequences of this; however, it is clearly not going to go away. Women need to have a voice in this debate, and I encourage those who are in this chamber today to join with me in doing so. What we have seen in developments in America in recent years has clearly demonstrated that reproductive self-determination is continually under threat and that hard-won gains can be easily undone. In the United States, womenâs reproductive rights have increasingly been restricted by the government through a series of measures. One measure is to fund and promote only those sexual health education programs which use an âabstinence onlyâ curriculum. It does not work, it never did work, and it will not work in the future. Other measures include denying women access to over-the-counter emergency contraception; introducing bans to stop servicewomen and military dependants from obtaining abortions at overseas military hospitals, even if they pay for the services themselves; introducing a federal ban on so-called âpartial birth abortionsâ; and recognising a fertilised egg as an independent entity separate to the pregnant woman. Australia must not go down this path. It is very important that we have the facts on the table and that we do not get the issue clouded by arguments which are emotional and which are not related to the facts. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>âI rise this evening to address the subject of health care for veterans and ex-service personnel. The Senate will recall that last year the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquired into this issue. In its report <inline font-style="italic">Taking Stock</inline> the committee offered an excellent policy overview and review of this rather important subject.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>First, as we know, Australiaâs defence personnel often suffer exposure to considerable hazard. The prime hazard of course is the threat of death in warlike circumstances. One makes the obvious point that that is the nature of the business, so to speak. That is also why we maintain the traditional attitude of care and recognition for those who suffer such exposure. The other great threats are those which might not kill as immediately but the effect of which is equally serious over time. In recent years, with overseas deployments to the Gulf, Iraq and Afghanistan, we are more alert to the harmful consequences deriving from issues related to chemical warfare. We now focus on the need to remove this threat as an end in itself. We need also to protect those charged with that most difficult of responsibilities; hence the controversy about exposure and the ongoing debate as to the existence of these weapons.</para>
<para>Controversy surrounds the regime of protection. A recent example is the program of anthrax vaccinations, the process of consent and the quality of research into any side effects. Gulf War syndrome is just one manifestation of symptoms attributed to such exposure. That controversy shows no signs of abating, especially in the United States, where more and more research is coming into the public domain and different consequences are being exposed for public consideration. Mental health issues now manifest themselves as a singularly important set of issues deriving from this problem. As shown in our own Gulf War health study, the fear of risk and perceptions of hazard and danger are psychological triggers in themselves. The authors of that study found that actual levels of illness barely differ from that of the general population. We must at the outset also concede that this general phenomenon, while much discussed, is not generally well understood. There is an increasing population of military personnel who believe their health suffers as a direct result of their service in the Australian Defence Force. Unfortunately, there is little scientific corroboration, medically or statistically, to support their supposition. Hence, we continue to see concern expressed about issues such as Gulf War syndrome.</para>
<para>Despite a royal commission, we are still debating exposure to atomic fallout from the British tests in Australia during the 1950s. British Commonwealth occupying forces who served in Japan after World War II as an occupying force do not accept assurances that atomic fallout was insufficient or had passed so that it did not continue to affect them. Since the Bosnian crisis in particular, concerns are regularly expressed in correspondence about depleted uranium and its potential consequences. Vietnam veterans still consider Agent Orange as the cause of physical disabilities despite the processes of a royal commission. This includes intergenerational effects on their children and grandchildren. A recently completed study into the health of Korean War veterans confirms some of their fears. The effect of DDT on World War II personnel continues as a concern for some veterans. Others believe their exposure to experimental anti-malarial treatment is the cause of illness. Preventive treatments continue to concern service men and women. The anthrax vaccination regime applied en route to the gulf is a more recent example. The Senate committee report made a point of focusing on this issue. The anti-malarial drug Larium administered to our forces in East Timor is now raising concerns. And the saga continuesâapparently without end.</para>
<para>The principal question is whether the systems in place are able to properly deal with these concerns, both in retrospect and in advance. The Senate committee concluded that efforts on this level are improving. I suggest that the ADF needs to continue this process of review into the future. I presume that in that context responsible officers from the ADF in both the Department of Defence and the Department of Veteransâ Affairs carry out this responsibility.</para>
<para>The committee noted improvements in research capacity, the level of awareness and response commitments to problems that are raised on an ongoing basis. Yet, unfortunately, chapters of history still emerge highlighting this issue. Navy personnel complain about their exposure to beryllium. Media reports outline that beryllium was used in apparatus to clean old paint from shipsâ hulls. This highly toxic heavy metal scars the lungs and causes respiratory ailments. As a very tough metal it is also alleged it was used in the manufacture of syringes. This is not to mention the effects of inhaling paint dust. Media reports suggest liability is being acknowledged. Whether the evidence to support compensation claims is adequate is at this stage unknown. It is certainly emerging as a new issue requiring attention.</para>
<para>Another is the effect of diesel fumes on submariners. The exposure of RAAF personnel who worked on the deseal and reseal of F111 fuel tanks is under active scrutiny by the government. A detailed report on a medical survey conducted on many of these people is now complete. The government response to date, it must be said, is both pithy and inadequate, much to the chagrin of those who suffer daily. The government chooses not to comment on the acceptance of liability, levels of compensation or whether the Defence Force will compensate family members. The act vests discretion in the government to resolve this issue relatively quickly. But the government, to date, has chosen not to exercise this discretion.</para>
<para>The defence occupational health and safety regime applying in those days was clearly deficient in allowing defence personnel to be exposed to these toxic substances, and we can only wonder now at the length of exposure. Some believeâwith good reason, it must be suggestedâthat their families have also been affected, and the evidence certainly points in that direction. Others responsible for refuelling RAAF aircraft, including tanker drivers, believe their health suffered through the inhalation of toxic fumes.</para>
<para>These are all serious breaches of the duty of care flowing from normal peacetime service. They are not associated exclusively with the risks of warlike service. In another context they are simple, routine, ordinary, everyday industrial matters. Under normal workplace requirementsâfor example, for the civilian populationâthese concerns would have been attended to a long time ago. The Commonwealth has a particular responsibility when defence personnel are involved. Our obligation in attending to constituent concerns on these matters is to ensure that the Commonwealth addresses these problems. Those affected need both immediate remedial care and ongoing compensation. Unfortunately, as always, it is too late for some. We need to ensure the period of life remaining to them is free of uncertainty and stress.</para>
<para>That is why we on this side are keen to ensure justice is delivered to F111 deseal-reseal personnel. We believe that, whatever medical science may say, there is a strong coincidence here of exposure and reported illness. Perhaps the government should use its discretion and look after these people. As the Senate committee report shows, medical science is neither complete nor exhaustive, and new developments do occur. There is always an element of doubt. That is why the government is now reviewing, for example, the evidence from the atomic testing regime. That is why the government authorises health studiesâto go beyond the assertions and denials. These new surveys examine evidence from a more modern vantage point.</para>
<para>Veterans keep this issue alive because it goes to the heart of their ongoing health concerns. For too long, governments have stonewalled on defence health issues. Clearly, the ADF and the Department of Defence appreciate that past performance was poor and requires improvement into the future. Higher levels of review and scrutiny outside the Department of Defence provide more assurances for the future. Of course, we must communicate these ongoing developments to those with an interest in this area of defence health. The opposition will maintain a watching brief on this subject, and we give that assurance to both serving and ex-service personnel <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âTonight I rise to pay tribute to a fine young Australian who lost his life in the service of this country during the worthwhile endeavour of restoring law and order to the Solomon Islands. The government deplores the senseless and cold-blooded murder of AFP Protective Service Officer Adam Dunning in Honiara on 22 December 2004. Again, on behalf of the government, I extend my sympathy to Adamâs parents, Michael and Christine; to his sisters, Sarah and Emma; and to his partner, Elise. I had the privilege of meeting them on the return from my visit to the Solomon Islandsâon which I was accompanied by the member for Bartonâduring which we repatriated Adam to Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>During that visit to the Solomon Islands I saw first-hand the fine young Australians that we have who are working in very difficult conditions in the Solomon Islands. I also met the people who worked with Adam, in particular those who were on his shift, and I must say that I was very impressed by the calibre of those people and the work that they are doing.</para>
<para>Adam was just 26 years old. He was a genuinely popular AFP protective service officer. Prior to his service in the Solomon Islands, he worked here at Parliament House and was held in the highest regard by his fellow officers. Prior to joining the AFP Protective Service in March 2003, Adam was a member of the Australian Defence Force, seeing service with the United Nations contingent to East Timor. Adam and his unit received a Meritorious Unit Citation for their work in East Timor, which included the securing of Dili airport. At every stage of his career, Adam exhibited great enthusiasm and a notable ability to defuse difficult situations. Indeed, on 18 December last year he was given a commendation in recognition of his efforts in disarming a man carrying a replica pistol in the Honiara magistrates court.</para>
<para>At 10 past three on the morning of 22 December 2004, Protective Service Officer Adam Dunning was shot and killed while on patrol protecting the Prime Ministerâs residence and the Governor-Generalâs residence in Honiara. He was a fine young man, and he is sadly missed by his friends and colleagues and of course his family and loved ones. I had the privilege of attending his funeral and seeing first-hand the tributes paid to him. The one I recall readily was a tribute paid by one of his mates who saw him the night before he was killed and recalled quite clearly how Adam had asked him if he was right for money. That, I think, is the mark of that young man.</para>
<para>I am able to report to the Senate that two men have been arrested in the Solomon Islands in relation to the murder of Adam Dunning. These men have been charged and remanded in custody pending further court action. I can assure the Senate and the people of Australia that the government will not rest until justice is done and will continue to take measures to protect personnel who are serving overseas. We will not be intimidated by thugs or anyone who wants to use violence to attempt to deter us from doing the work that we must see through to completion in the Solomon Islands. Adam and those like him have helped reclaim the towns and villages of the Solomon Islands for the people. There have been over 5,000 arrests, over 3,700 weapons have been seized and the lawlessness which once threatened the viability of the Solomon Islands has been curtailed. Schools which were once closed have now been reopened, women and children are now free to walk the streets and a normal life can be resumed by the villagers on those islands.</para>
<para>The tragedy that occurred on 22 December last year was not in vain. Adam Dunning died for perhaps one of the highest goalsâthat is, to achieve law and order in a society so that people can live freely. That is precisely what he was and what his fellow officers are endeavouring to achieve in the Solomon Islands. It was a service to the people of the Solomon Islands, the region and also Australia. I want to place on record the governmentâs deep appreciation of the efforts of the men and women who are in the Solomon Islands carrying out what is a very important mission. I also place on record the governmentâs deep appreciation of the efforts of Adam Dunning, Australian Federal Police protective service officer.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI want to address the Senate tonight on the question of water and I particularly want to do so from the perspective of the debate and campaign in Western Australia concerning water. There are essentially just a few ways in which water can be supplied to Western Australia. One is obviously rainfall and our dams. It is very well documented that we are now in the third decade of a drying time for Western Australia and the ability to replenish our water supplies through natural run-off is diminishing. At the end of the wet season in the South-West, the Perth dams averaged about the mid-thirtiesâin other words, about 35 or 36 per cent of their capacity. So it is clear that for a growing part of WAâthat is, Perth and the South-Westâother water supplies have to be considered.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>For many years, Perth has relied on its aquifers. Up to 40 per of Perthâs water has been taken up from aquifers but that is a diminishing resource and it cannot continue to be drawn from in the way in which it is at present. I should remind the Senate that only 13 per cent of WAâs water is actually consumed by individuals; all the rest is consumed by commercial uses, agriculture and resources. The other means of increasing water supply is through greater efficiency in the use of water. Some cities and towns throughout Australia are harvesting water from aquifers at a greater rate than they are being recharged. In other locations, the quantity and quality of raw water in catchments is under pressure from agriculture and logging. Despite the pressure on water supplies, the price of Australian water, at about a dollar per kilolitre, is very low and does not take into account all of the associated costs for infrastructure and the environment.</para>
<para>Our leader, Democrat Senator Lyn Allison, initiated and chaired a major Senate inquiry into the management of water in Australian cities, the adequacy of policies to reduce urban water use, the performance of urban stormwater systems and the potential to improve water quality and environmental outcomes. The final report, <inline font-style="italic">The value of water</inline>, called for the Commonwealth to play a more prominent role in driving the changes needed for sustainable urban management. The inquiry found that while urban areas were responsible for only 25 to 30 per cent of total water consumption, they have a considerable impact on a much wider environmental scale. Cities divert water from rivers and lakes and create large volumes of waste water and polluted stormwater, which in turn impact on waterways and coastal environments. Better water management in Australia is still hampered by outdated attitudes to stormwater and effluent use, century-old infrastructure, a lack of research and nationally consistent standards, and a reluctance to raise revenue from water pricing to fix environmental problems caused by water use.</para>
<para>Reasonable and equitable access to good water supplies should now be on the national agenda. The challenge is to find new sources of water for a growing population and to provide environmental flows for waterways and wetlands. Options will include urban systems that recycle grey water and treat stormwater as a resource rather than a waste product. Effluent can be a viable substitute for potable water used in irrigation if the price signals are right. Stringent water consumption targets, education and tighter appliance standards will all help conserve water.</para>
<para>The first thing that has to be done to address any problem with water, as we have in Western Australia, is of course attention to recyclingâthe use of grey water and so on. Right now, as we stand, it is still not a requirement for new houses to have drainage tanks made available to deal with the huge amount of rainfall that comes off roofs. It is still not a requirement that new suburbs and houses have second piping systems to allow the distribution of grey water into gardens and so on. The efforts to conserve water have still mostly focused on trying to make toilet systems more water efficient and limiting the days on which people water, so there is much that can be done in that area.</para>
<para>Even so, the Labor Party has quite rightly recognised that the pressure on Perth, in particular, and the South-West of Western Australia, is such that they cannot continue to rely on hopes for greater water efficiency and rainfall. Accordingly, the state Labor government have moved to have a significant desalination plant built down at Kwinana. However, this can only ever be a back-up system for Perthâs needs, if we have a particularly dry season or there is some shortage of water resulting from a breakdown in the system or an aquifer deficiency. So the Democrats some time ago started to say that we do have to look at alternative water supplies. I have been quite startled by the hysteria attached to the view that we should pipe water down from the north. It is quite clear to me that, given the wide range of costs for doing such a thing, you have to take care that it is affordable. The costs range from a Tenix proposal of around $2 billion to bring water down, via a closed canal, over 3,000 kilometres, to $4 billion for a pipeline as opposed to a closed canal, to a Water Corporation pipeline estimate of $11 billion.</para>
<para>If the costs of water through a pipeline or canal from the north were to be made affordable through a proper analysis which included environmental, native rights and practical engineering issues, then surely we should be a little more open-minded about the canal than so many people have been to date. Surely we need to examine the feasibility and the possibility of alternative water supplies in a drying state. In that respect, the Democrats very much welcome the decision of the Premier of WA, Laborâs Geoff Gallop, to conduct a feasibility study costing $5 million. We would also welcome the commitment of the Leader of the Opposition, Colin Barnett, to build such a facility, if only he had added to it the words, âproviding that it is affordableâ. The difficulty with what Colin Barnett has said to date is that he has committed to build it almost regardless of the cost. That is plainly not sensible. If he had said, âWe will build it, providing it comes within the Tenix cost estimate,â I think that would have been a reasonable position.</para>
<para>The financial excesses of the eighties and early nineties resulted in state and federal governments concentrating on much better financial management, high credit ratings and a good reputation in financial markets, which has been achieved in part by generating an excess of income over expenditure and drastically reducing public debt. However, state governments have become averse to debt and to capital works and infrastructure spending. I think the most important thing that should arise out of this water debate is the recognition that states have to get back into big-spending projects to deliver the resources and the needs of a state such as ours. So I hope that that feasibility study works to the benefit of Western Australia and that an alternative option for water is developed as a result.</para>

<para>âI wish to speak tonight about the ongoing situation in Zimbabwe. I particularly want to put on record the concerns that so many of us across the world have for a gentleman called Roy Bennett. Mr Bennett, with whom I was very fortunate to meet several years ago in Queensland, is an elected member of the Zimbabwean parliament. However, on 18 May last year his circumstances changed dramatically. Even though Mr Bennett, his family and his supporters were well used to acts of violence and harassment and direct attacks on himself and his family, on that day, whilst serving as a member of parliament, a horrific change in his life occurred. I will quote from the strangely named <inline font-style="italic">Zimbabwe Independent</inline> of 10 December. It is very difficult to find anything independent in Zimbabwe. The article reads:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">A debate in parliament on the issue of stock theft on May 18â</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">not an issue we debate very often in this parliament, I am pleased to sayâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">started it all for Mr Bennett. Justice minister Patrick Chinamasa accused Bennettâs ancestors of being âthieves and murderersâ to justify the governmentâs seizure of his Charleswood Estate.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">These attacks on the property of white farmers in Zimbabwe have been going on for a long time. They are not an issue of black and white; they are clearly an issue of politics. The article goes on:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">He said Bennett would never be allowed to set foot on his property again.</para>
<para class="block">An incensed Bennett charged at Chinamasa and floored him. Anti-Corruption and Monopolies Minister Didymus Mutasa joined the scuffle in support of Chinamasa but also landed on the floor.</para>
<para class="block">âI kicked him hard,â Mutasa later said.</para>
<para class="block">Bennett was found guilty by the special privileges committee.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is a bit different from the special privileges committees that operate in this place. The article continues:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It recommended that he be sentenced to one-year imprisonment.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It was actually 15 months imprisonment, but three months were put aside. It goes on:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Zanu PFâsâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is, the governmentâsâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">majority in parliament carried the day and the House adopted the recommendation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This was not a legal action; it was an action of the house of parliament. Mr Bennett attempted to make a formal apology to the houseâsomething we have seen in this place on many occasions. The majority government decided not to accept that apology. Mr Bennett was not kicked out of the house for a certain period of time for poor behaviour, as happens sometimes in the Australian parliaments; he was taken to prison. All his belongings were taken from him and he was put in a crowded central prison. Mr Bennett promised to return and complete the journey to freedom later with others as he headed forâand I am not even going to attempt to pronounce the nameâa prison where hard-core criminals are detained. Mr Bennett only stayed there for a period of time before he was transferred four hours journey away from the centre of Harare, the capital. So he is now in a full security prison working as a detainee and, although appeals are in progress, he is now facing a full 12-month sentence for something that happened on the floor of parliament.</para>
<para>I do not think anyone here can really understand that. The problem is that very few people in this country even know about it, becauseâas I have said before in this placeâthe access to information about Zimbabwe is severely limited. It is very difficult to get media coverage and it is very difficult even to ask questions about what is going on. I truly believe that if people understood that this is the kind of thing that can happen to elected representatives, they would share our shock and dismay and they would also be concerned about Mr Bennettâs family, who are now without their father, trying to survive in a situation of continuing daily harassment, fear and attacks.</para>
<para>There are significant links between Zimbabwe and Australia. Most of us who attend citizenship ceremonies regularly find Zimbabwean people who have been able to leave the country. It is a difficult choice for anyone to leave their home and their possessions to restart. But some people who have been fortunate enough to come to Australia and have fulfilled the requirements of citizenship in this country and made the choice to become Australian citizens have great links with their homeland through email. I do not know what we would do without access to email. It allows the free interaction of information, and it is where we find out what is happening to other families and about the attacks on property and the vicious attacks on the Zimbabwean people. We find out about those through email and through people talking amongst themselves.</para>
<para>I do wish to make a clear statement this evening to support Minister Downerâs public statements in support of Roy Bennett and also the need for an ongoing relationship with Zimbabwe.</para>
<para>Amnesty International, in support of the process for the free Roy Bennett campaignâwhich was started by family members and members of the MDC, which is the major opposition party in Zimbabweâhave put out processes across the world, mainly through the Internet again, getting people to sign petitions, lobby governments, talk to politicians and find out exactly what can be done as community people who want justice and freedom and who can see that the process of harassment is ensuring that there will not be any kind of free democratic process in that country.</para>
<para>It is strange to stand in our parliamentary system and hear what has happened to a comrade, to a person who was going about their duty in their parliament house. It is difficult to understand the quickness and viciousness of the process of âjusticeâ which has destroyed a family and put a representative of the people behind bars. There is an immediate link between this and the fact that the next round of elections in Zimbabwe is scheduled for 31 March this year. We hear from people living in various sections of Zimbabwe that the viciousness and ferocity of the attacks build up as the ballot date draws nearer. In a clear attempt to silence people, to force people not to make open decisions about their vote and how to use it, there is alleged to be a systematic attack on people who do not favour the current government.</para>
<para>In the last round of elections, we had an open invitationâand it did change as the date drew closer in that last roundâto various members and independent observers to visit Zimbabwe and scrutinise the election process. When those people came back, including Kevin Rudd who is the shadow minister for foreign affairs in the lower house, they actually made statements critical of the processes in Zimbabwe. Now, as we face the 2005 elections, the government is determined that that kind of openness will not occur this time. Because of outside interference there will not be the opportunity, particularly for the media, to actually cover the Zimbabwean elections. This has put the people in greater danger and increased the fear in the community.</para>
<para>We are asking that people throughout our communities and politicians from all sides of parliament use every effort to pressure the Zimbabwean government. We know it is difficult because in fact, really, there is very little that can be done. But we have to ensure that the message is out there. For people like Roy Bennett, who will be a candidate in the 31 March elections, it is very difficult to run a campaign from inside a prison. It is interesting that Mr Bennettâs imprisonment covers the full election period until after 31 March. But Mr Bennett will be a candidate. His popularity is very strong in his area. His own supporters have been trying to visit him in prison and have been standing outside saying, âFree Roy Bennett,â which has some kind of symbolic nature.</para>
<para>We need to keep that cry out there so that our government will be able to share in the international call for free and open elections. We also have questions about the role of our embassy, which I believe is looking at downsizing and changing its location. We are told that that is for security reasons in the area, and we understand that. There are serious concerns about security in Harare, but the message to the Zimbabwean people must continue to be that we are their friends and we are their supporters. People who talk to us say that they have strong links with our country, they value the relationship with Australia and the effort and work of our people in our embassy there have been lauded by people from across Africa, particularly in Zimbabwe. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talk.start>
<para>The delegation was located at the Australian mission to the United Nations. My special thanks go to His Excellency Mr John Dauth, the Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Australia to the United Nations, His Excellency Mr Peter Tesch, Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative of Australia to the United Nations, the Australian Consul General, His Excellency Ken Allen, and their staff for their courteous and inclusive approach to the work of our delegation. Australia can be proud of the quality and dedication of its diplomatic staff at this most significant world forum.</para>
<para>I will begin with some reflections on the work of the United Nations as a world body and then discuss my observations of the work of its complex committee process. Prior to leading this delegation to the UN, I had been a member of Commonwealth parliamentary delegations to the South Pacific Forum, India, Pakistan, Brazil, Argentina and France and I led parliamentary delegations to Nigeria, South Africa and the European Union. At the United Nations at this time, it was fascinating to observe so many of the issues and policy challenges that I had observed previously in so many regions of the globe resurface and see them being grappled with in the wider world forum of the United Nations. This was particularly the case with the deep and complex issues affecting the sad continent of Africa.</para>
<para>There are obvious limits to what the United Nations can accomplish. Achieving consensus across 191 nations with diverse national interests borders on the miraculous. Of greater concern are the structural limitations of the Security Council, which were set in concrete by the allies after World War II. Although the UN achieved some success in peacekeeping roles in earlier conflictsâfor example, in East Timorâand more recently in backing the French action in Cote dâIvoire, I could not detect any momentum towards playing a decisive and speedy role in the worldâs two major flashpoints: western Sudan and Iraq. Any progress seems to be in the hands of countries like the UK, the USA, France and other members of the coalition of the willing.</para>
<para>Similarly. the UNâs response to humanitarian crises, such as the recent tsunami, has puzzled many. In the public debate about the international reaction since Boxing Day 2004, many questions have been raised about the level and timing of the United Nationsâ response to this crisis. Our Prime Minister, John Howard, has been quick to point out why, in the face of such a disaster, bilateral response is more effective. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The UN has an important role but nothing can take the place of nation states because nation states have the assets and they have the capacity, the decision-making processes. I donât think it is seen as a sidestepping of the United Nations.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The reality is that the international body has no capacity to respond quickly in such a crisis. There are major decision-making and logistical problems in the UN structure. The United Nationsâ actions are based on resolutions agreed to by its 191 member states. Action requiring crossing the borders of sovereign nations, particularly in sensitive areas like northern Sumatra, is fraught with difficulty.</para>
<para>The major logistics problems facing the UN operations are multilateral, with sovereign states agreeing to commit such resources. Such agreements take time to put in place. Where the United Nations will find its proper role will be in coordinating the relief effort over time and the long-term rebuilding program, which could take up to 10 years. It is here that the United Nations will come into its own with its diplomatic corps from 191 countries sitting down and resolving the best way to direct the vast resources that have been made available for this crisis to best effect. The need for this to be supplemented by fast-moving bilateral efforts in response to an immediate crisis, such as the Indian Ocean tsunami, does not indicate a failure of the United Nations but a realistic assessment of the limitations of modern multilateral diplomacy. Given the way that the original charter of the UN was crafted, the obstacles to comprehensive reform seem to be insurmountable. I will watch with interest the latest round of proposed reforms advanced by the Secretary-General.</para>
<para>Although fundamental structural reform seems a distant hope, I sensed disquiet about some of the work of the United Nationsâ committees and the General Assembly. Committees such as the Economic and Financial Committeeâthe Second Committeeâwere simultaneously taking on a wide range of issues, from global climate change to the impact of globalisation. Other committees seemed to be tackling a narrower range of issues. On the agenda of a number of the committees was the topic ârefreshing the work of the committeeâ, indicating a possible loss of direction and/or momentum.</para>
<para>The development of resolutions through the committee process was, however, highly impressive, particularly the attempts to find common ground on the exact wording of resolutions between national groupsâfor example, the group of 77, which makes up the 77 poorest nations in the world, and the European Unionâwhere the negotiations were multinational and the member nations of each group also had to be comfortable with the wording of the resolutions on behalf of their own nation. Although discussions were sometimes tenseâfor example, the Sixth Committee work on the Law of the Seas, where the Scandinavian countries seemed to have a very different view of the world from everyone elseâI was very impressed with the good-natured and highly professional approach of the diplomats seeking a resolution. Having watched so much of the tortuous Sixth Committee work, I was honoured to be asked to put down the Australian position on âOceans and Law of the Seasâ in the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly.</para>
<para>Across many of the committees there was a strong focus on the plight of the continent of Africa, which is now a net exporter of capital. Apart from trying to put pressure on hot spotsâsuch as Sudan, Zimbabwe and, more recently, Cote dâIvoireâagreeing on resolutions in a number of the committees that might result in actions that improve the economic and social conditions in Africa seems largely beyond the reach of the current United Nations structures. The plenary processes of the various committees were of great interest and at times were highly instructive. Although most of the time was taken up by nations putting down statements in carefully crafted diplomatic language, occasionally some of these were very memorableâfor example, the US position on stem cell research and Zimbabweâs tortuously crafted position on human rights. Still, everyone listened politely. The Australian parliament could certainly learn something about manners from the United Nations General Assembly.</para>
<para>The most informative part of the committeesâ deliberations was the response by the rapporteur, who was an expert in the field and who responded to the debate and answered questions. The most powerful contributions were made by world experts in fields who occasionally addressed the United Nationsâthat is, various committees, councils and assemblies of the UN. I found many of the workshops and many of the discussions in the UN of interest, particularly the discussions on world trade and developing bilateral and multilateral agreements. This was one of the most impressive things about the United Nationsâ process, which we could borrow from in the parliament. People with expertise would come in and give really high-powered, professional presentations to educate the people making the decisions. It is something which we could possibly learn from.</para>
<para>Originally in my work at the United Nations I intended to focus mainly on the work of the Third CommitteeâSocial, Humanitarian and Culturalâbut found the work of the Second CommitteeâEconomic and Financialâfar more varied and challenging with a wide range of issues under discussion. In the long sweep of human history, the fact that at the United Nations all the nations of the world are sitting down and talking on a daily basis in an attempt to resolve the worldâs most pressing problems is in itself a dramatic step forward for humankind.</para>

<para>âEarlier this evening, this chamber heard Senator Ellison pay tribute to the late Australian Protective Service officer Adam Dunning for his sacrifice and his achievements. I think we all share that sentiment. Tonight I would like to speak on a matter within Australia which I am sure would make the late Mr Dunning feel satisfied that his sacrifice had not been in vain.</para>

<para>Nearly seven months ago on 21 July 2004 I had the pleasant experience of attending a community event in Melbourne that was particularly rewarding for two remarkable reasons. I use the word âremarkableâ in the original sense of the wordâthat is, worthy of remarkârather than in the derivative sense of something which is unusual. The election and chamber priorities intervened so there was a long delay before I could speak on this but the remarkableness of the event remains fresh and relevant, perhaps more so today, so tonight I would share this experience with my colleagues in the Senate.</para>
<para>The first reason that this community event was particularly remarkable and rewarding to attend was that its purpose was to mark the graduation of a Work for the Dole project. The second reason was that this project was sponsored and carried out by Victoriaâs Muslim community to celebrate Muslim achievements in our multicultural society. I seek leave to table the book produced by this project, called <inline font-style="italic">Celebrating Muslim achievements in Melbourne</inline>.</para>

<para>âI thank the Senate. The successful completion of community projects under the Work for the Dole program is not an uncommon occurrence. Indeed, it is actually very common. Nevertheless, completion is still remarkable in that it invariably demonstrates how well the projects worked out, delivering results that not only meet the objectives of the program but also provide tangible and substantial benefits to the participants and their supporters, be they trainers, workmates, employers or the community. I have attended many such celebratory events over the last 5Â½ years and have always been thankful for the experience.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The Work for the Dole program is a key component in the Howard governmentâs mutual obligation initiative. It gives job seekers the opportunity to improve their employability and work skills, while at the same time giving them a sense of achievement and belonging. It was introduced in 1997 against, it must be said, virulent opposition from the Labor Party, but has proved to be such an unqualified success that I have on numerous occasions had to share the stage with my Labor colleagues to offer congratulations to the project participants, coordinators and community sponsors, with not a voice of complaint to be heard.</para>
<para>I will briefly outline the basis of this program. Those eligible to participate in the Work for the Dole program include four groups of people. Those 18- to 20-year-old school leavers who have been receiving the full rate of youth allowance as job seekers for six months or more are required to participate for 310 hours within 26 weeks. Those 21- to 39-year-old job seekers receiving the full rate of Newstart allowance for six months or more are required to participate for 390 hours within 26 weeks. Those 40- to 49-year-old job seekers who have been receiving the full rate of the Newstart allowance for six months or more are required to participate for 150 hours within 26 weeks. Those job seekers who are 50 years old and over who have been receiving the full rate of Newstart allowance for six months or more may volunteer to participate for 150 hours within 26 weeks.</para>
<para>Senators will note that in all cases the pre-condition of having received six months of income support applies. In other words, these are people who have experienced difficulties in joining or returning to the work force. However, having participated in Work for the Dole projects, records show that they have a one-in-three chance of getting off welfare, either by finding work or pursuing further training. These are very impressive figures and are very encouraging to prospective Work for the Dole participants.</para>
<para>The real success story of the Work for the Dole program, unlike superficially similar programs promoted by previous Labor governments, is that it is not an artificial labour market exercise to reduce the unemployment figures by hiding them in pretend work projects. Work for the Dole projects are community-building projects. Participants do not disappear from the unemployment statistics, except of course those who are able to successfully rejoin the employed work force. I particularly want to emphasise this very fundamental feature of the Work for the Dole programâthat is, those participating in the program do not disappear from the unemployment statisticsâbecause some of my Labor colleagues seem unaware of it, simply assuming that this program is just a repeat of the various cynical âhide the unemployedâ exercises practised on the Australian people by the Hawke and Keating Labor governments.</para>
<para>My Labor colleagues have an understandable bias against any project that we propose, but there may well be others in the community equally unaware of the community-building nature of the program who, by not supporting it, are denying its very real benefits to their communities. These people do need this reminder. What are these benefits? The Work for the Dole projects help to develop work habits in young people. These young people gain valuable work experience and are able to recover their self-esteem. Often the most valuable lesson participants learn is that the best training for work is work itself. Work for the Dole engagement provides this experience.</para>
<para>Work for the Dole projects also provide opportunities for participants to learn new skills which can open new career opportunities. This is especially true for older people who have had the unfortunate experience of working for most of their life in a contracting industry and have a limited concept of what other careers may be available. Finally, Work for the Dole projects involve the local community in quality projects that provide community improvements. The lasting benefit to the community is a change in attitude and perception towards the unemployed by employers and by the community at large.</para>
<para>The Australians Working Together package, announced on 22 May 2001 and effective from 1 July 2002, included the introduction of the passport to employment and training credits as part of the Work for the Dole program. All participants who successfully complete Work for the Dole must be provided with a passport to employment. The passport to employment is a job readiness package designed to assist participants to effectively present themselves, their abilities and their experience to prospective employers through updating their resumes, developing basic job search and presentation skills and providing relevant certificates and references. Training credits are a reward for job seekers who have successfully completed Work for the Dole. The provision of training credits in conjunction with Work for the Dole builds on the work experience and motivation gained through these activities and thereby increases job seekersâ work prospects. Entitlement to a training credit between $500 and $800 is based on a job seeker participating in Work for the Dole for a specified amount of time and is dependent on their age.</para>
<para>Since the Work for the Dole program commenced in 1997, more than 18,000 Work for the Dole projects have been completed, providing more than 291,000 job seekers with valuable work experience and benefiting the communities who sponsored these projects with valuable improvements. I see my time is about to expire and I have a fair bit to go through yet, so I shall come back to this topic on the next occasion.</para>

<para>The names of the persons or company that undertook each examination are contained in the list at Attachment A under the heading âExaminerâ.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>Yes. The Registrar is careful to ensure that only reputable persons are used as examiners and administrators (the procurement and selection process is outlined in (5)(b)). This process involves examiners and administrators declaring any conflict of interest on a case by case basis (i.e. each time a quote is submitted and during the course of the job).</para>
</item>
<item label="(5) (a)">
<para>Refer to (3) above.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>The Registrar maintains a register of persons and companies capable of undertaking examinations and administrations. The current register was established in 1999 after advertising nationally for expressions of interest. The expressions of interest were assessed against two main criteria being relevant tertiary qualifications and experience working with Indigenous corporations. Subsequent additions to the register are made after assessment of resumes against these criteria.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para pgwide="yes">When a decision is made to have an examination completed by a person or company listed in the register, then at least three (3) quotes are sought from persons or companies listed therein. Each quote is then assessed by the Registrarâs staff on the basis of price, availability, relevant expertise, probity and quality of any recent work undertaken for ORAC.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The register of examiners and administrators is being re-established now, due for completion in early 2005. The process for re-establishing it is consistent with Commonwealth procurement guidelines and other requirements.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In relation to your Question 4 (5)(b) the Registrar has also provided me with copies of documentation relevant to the tender process completed in 1999 to re-establish the Register of Examiners and Administrators, as follows:</para>

<para>The provision of Military Commission Order No. 2 cited in the question is a rule governing admissibility of evidence, not protection against making an admission. That is, it is not a rule about the methods by which confessions may be obtained, but rather a rule about whether those admissions may be accepted as evidence in a military commission proceeding.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para pgwide="yes">In Australia, the admissibility of admissions into evidence in a prosecution for offences against Commonwealth criminal law is governed by the Evidence Act 1995 and provisions in the Crimes Act 1918. In accordance with section 84 of the Evidence Act 1995, an admission is to be excluded from evidence if it was influenced by âviolent, oppressive, inhuman or degrading conductâ or âa threat of conduct of that kindâ.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The rules of evidence applicable to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda do not include an express provision excluding evidence obtained as a result of torture. Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence applicable to the ICTY states that: âNo evidence shall be admissible if obtained by methods which cast substantial doubt on its reliability or if its admission is antithetical to, and would seriously damage, the integrity of the proceedingsâ. Similarly, evidence is not to be admitted before a military commission unless it would have probative value to a reasonable person. A determination of the probative value of a piece of evidence may include consideration of the manner by which that evidence was obtained.</para>
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(2)">
<para>US authorities have previously advised it is open to defence counsel acting in military commission cases to argue that the manner in which evidence, including admissions, was obtained means that the evidence could not have probative value to a reasonable person.

Australiaâs security is closely linked to the security and stability of our region. We recognise that Australiaâs security could be compromised if we did not continue to work to improve security in the region itself. Working with regional partners to build the regionâs capacity and capability to secure itself is a critical element of our strategy to safeguard Australia, and the fortress concept would do significant damage to that goal and its achievement.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Healthy Weight 2008 â Australiaâs Future â The National Action Agenda for Children and Young People and Their Families is the first step towards shaping Australiaâs future for better health and wellbeing. It is an agenda for action across all jurisdictions, multiple portfolios, communities and industry.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Healthy Weight 2008 has a strategic, four year timeframe for the first phase, acknowledging that a long term approach is required to address overweight and obesity. An initial set of actions commencing in 2004 was suggested, recognising that these are a guide and that not all actions will be addressed in the short term.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Please note, some actions in Healthy Weight 2008 sit more appropriately with State and Territory jurisdictional responsibility and the private and non-government sector also has a role.

<para>The NHMRC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Overweight and Obesity in Adults and the Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Overweight and Obesity in Children and Adolescents were published in November 2003.

<para>Funding was provided to the Pedestrian Council to organise the âWalk to Work Dayâ held in October 2003 and the âWalk Safely to Schoolâ day held in April 2004. In recognition of the value of these events, further funding of up to $1.5 million over the next three years ($500,000 per year) has been allocated. This provides an opportunity to build on the success of each subsequent event by allowing the benefit of longer-term planning and greater lead-time for each event. As part of this three year funding âWalk to Work Dayâ was held on Friday 5 November 2004.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Funding of $450,000 was provided for a pilot sentinel site (via Deakin University) to the Barwon-South West project in Victoria, on preventing obesity in children and adolescents through a whole of community approach.

</item>
<item>
<para>The Department of Health and Ageing has led public sector physical activity workplace initiatives with the 10K a Day program and the Corporate Challenge. The 10K a Day program promotes moderate exercise and health and wellbeing by encouraging participants to walk 10,000 steps a day. The 10K a Day kit has a pedometer and nutrition and physical activity information, backed-up with an on-line logbook that allows people to record and monitor their walking progress. The program has been taken up by other Australian Government departments and other jurisdictions.</para>

<para>This information is not directly available, however, the evaluation of the 2000-01 BreastScreen Australia campaign showed that over a third of the women aged 40 to 49 years surveyed who had had a mammogram had it through BreastScreen Australia. BreastScreen Australia specifically targets women aged 50 to 69 years as the group with the highest risk and most likely to benefit from screening. As a result, research focuses on the target age group. (b) In 2000-01, 20.5% of women aged 40 to 49 years had a screening mammogram through BreastScreen Australia.</para>

<para>Meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials have shown no difference in the size or stage of breast cancers at diagnosis or in the number of deaths from breast cancer for women taught to use a systematic approach for breast self-examination compared with those who did not receive instruction. At this time, there is insufficient evidence to encourage or discourage the practice of a systematic approach to breast self-examination to reduce mortality from breast cancer. The Government provides information to women of all ages on breast cancer through the National Breast Cancer Centre (NBCC), which has a leading role in improving outcomes for women with, or at risk of, breast cancer. The Government has provided funds to support a recent NBCC campaign aimed at women of all ages titled, âAny change is worth talking aboutâ. The key message for this campaign is that women of all ages should be aware of any changes in their breasts.</para>

<para>and (4) On 22 March 2004, as a result of investigations into the manufacture of the travel sickness remedy Travacalm by Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited, a brief of evidence was presented to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Following consideration of that brief by the DPP, Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited (Pan) appeared before the Downing Centre Local Court, Sydney on 26 October 2004 to answer ten charges of manufacturing a counterfeit medicine. Former Pan employee, MrÂ ShyamaÂ Jain, appeared before the same Court to answer ten charges of manufacturing a counterfeit medicine and Pan Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, Mr Jim Selim, appeared to answer a charge of destroying evidence.</para>

<para>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Australian medicinal product manufacturers are required to pay an annual licence charge of $4,230 if they undertake a single step in manufacture (eg sterilization only, packaging only) or $8,210 for multiple step manufacturing or for multiple products (such as medicines and medical devices). These charges allow for 16 audit hours in three financial years for the lower annual licence charge, and 48 audit hours for the higher charge. Where the audit hours exceed these times, the TGA charges for the additional audit time involved.</para>

<item label="(5)">
<para>The TGA audit team comprises 26 lead auditors and up to 34 specialists.</para>

<para>- (8) The TGA does not have contract auditors.</para>
</item>
<item label="(9)">
<para>Generally at audit, the auditor will sample some of the formulations for compliance with details on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. during the period specified, some manufacturers were found to have formulations that were not aligned with the details on the Register. Depending on the class of the product and the nature of the change, some amendments to formulation did not require TGA approval (eg excipients of complementary medicines). Any changes that required TGA approval were raised in the context of non-compliance with the marketing authorization.</para>
</item>
<item label="(10)">
<para>If a licence has been suspended at the request of the manufacturer, the TGA will undertake an on-site audit, which must demonstrate compliance with the relevant Code of GMP before the suspension can be lifted. If the licence was revoked, a new application for a manufacturing licence is required.</para>

<item label="(11)">
<para>Information on Australian manufacturers that may have transferred or intend to transfer their production overseas is not recorded on TGA information system. The TGA does not require manufacturers to divulge their reasons for seeking voluntary revocation of their licences.</para>
</item>
<item label="(12)">
<para>Normally the TGA does not conduct unannounced audits of overseas manufacturers because it is necessary to obtain Australian sponsorâs agreement to the audit. Advance notice is given in as short a timeframe as practicable and no audit plan is provided in advance. Should the TGA have significant concerns relating to prior warning, it would then seek the assistance of the relevant government regulatory agency in conducting a joint unannounced audit with that overseas regulator.</para>

<para>Of the initial $96 million from the Federation Fund, $50 million was allocated to the Department of Defence to meet costs of relocation from the sites and removal of buildings not required by the Trust; $6 million was provided to the Department of Defence to establish public access to parts of Garden Island naval base; and $40 million was allocated to support the clean-up of contaminated areas of Cockatoo Island. The Trust received $12 million of the $40 million allocation. The remainder of the allocation lapsed because it was necessary to finalise the Trustâs Plan and its proposed uses prior to completion of remediation works.

<para>Yes. Australia is a signatory to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.

<para>The Australian Government processes any application for international transfer in accordance with the International Transfer of Prisoners Act 1997 and relevant agreement as quickly as is possible.

This is certainly the case in Australia and the United States of America.</para>

<item label="(1)">
<para>When the HIV antibody test first became available, there was an urgent need for a coordinated and centrally controlled testing process to rapidly enable Australiaâs blood supplies to become safe, and all infected but clinically well people to be quickly identified. For these reasons, it was decided that HIV antibody testing should be undertaken in the non-Medicare benefits funded state and territory government public laboratories with state and territory governments not charging patients for this service. The Australian Government provides funding to states and territories through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs) for this purpose.</para>

<para>The figure quoted of an increase in a 12 month period is not the most recent data. There was a reduction in the annual number of new HIV diagnoses (adjusted for multiple reporting) in Australia, from 831 cases in 2002 to 782 cases in 2003. This reduction is in contrast with the previous yearâs increase of 20% (from 693 cases in 2001). The Minister is aware the issue of Medicare benefits funding of HIV antibody testing was raised in the draft National HIV/AIDS and STIs Strategy and is being considered in the context of finalisation and implementation of that Strategy.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I should note at the outset that the circumstances surrounding the discharge of Mr Nathan Moore from the Royal Australian Air Force are the subject of a confidentiality agreement between Mr Moore and the Air Force, designed to protect the privacy of Mr Moore. I also need to correct the Senator on two counts, Mr Moore was an Airman in the Air Force, not an Officer, and the ceremony to which the Senator refers was a private meeting arranged to present certain deliverables associated with Mr Mooreâs discharge.</para>
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>and (2) The Air Force conducted a facilitated discussion with Mr Moore and his legal representative on 18 October 2004 in Brisbane. The purpose of the meeting was to finalise the administrative matters associated with Mr Mooreâs discharge. At that meeting, it was agreed that Mr Moore was to be discharged on 15 November 2004 and that there would be a presentation of the deliverables agreed as part of the discharge at a date and place to be advised, closer to 15 November 2004. The arrangements for the presentation were advised to Mr Mooreâs legal representative in a letter from the Director General Personnel - Air Force dated and faxed on 2 November 2004.</para>
<para>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Mr Moore was, subsequently, contacted by a staff officer from the Office of the Director General Personnel - Air Force office by telephone on 12 November 2004 to confirm that he had been advised of the arrangements for the presentation by his legal representative.</para>

<para>The citation to which the Senator refers is a Combat Support Group Commanderâs Commendation dated 15 April 2002, which was awarded to Mr Moore. This citation commended him for his actions in response to a motor vehicle accident on Ipswich Road in Brisbane on 27 February 2002. The original commendation was presented to Mr Moore by the then Commander Combat Support Group. Mr Moore advised the Air Force that he was unable to locate the original of the commendation, so the Air Force arranged for it to be reproduced and presented to him on 15 November 2004. A copy of the commendation has been forwarded separately to your office.</para>
