<para>—Senators may be aware that over the last two weeks Parliament House has experienced three incidents where white powder was found in letters delivered to the building. In all instances, the substances were found to be non-hazardous. Unfortunately, parliamentary security staff detected a further suspect package in the loading dock this morning. As a result of the earlier incidents, mail screening procedures have been enhanced, with effect from this morning, by introducing a second level of screening to reduce the risk of letters containing hazardous substances entering the building.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The new screening procedures may delay the delivery of mail to senators’ suites. However, the Speaker and I consider this action is necessary while we are experiencing an increase in these incidents. Senators and their staff should also be looking out for any suspect mail and, if they are in doubt, I cannot emphasise too strongly that they should not open any suspect envelope. Instead, they should contact Parliament House security on telephone extension 7117, where they will be given instructions on what action they need to take. I hope that the people who send these sorts of items realise that the people they put most at risk are those who collect and distribute our mail at Parliament House, not the addressee. The Speaker and I cannot condemn this sort of behaviour strongly enough.</para>

<inline ref="R2346">TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2005</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The measures contained in this bill will cut personal income tax for all Australian taxpayers.</para>
<para class="block">The tax reductions amount to $21.7 billion over the next four years. This is in addition to the $14.7 billion in tax cuts provided in last year’s Budget.</para>
<para class="block">From 1 July 2005, the 17 per cent marginal tax rate will be cut to 15 per cent.</para>
<para class="block">The 42 per cent threshold will increase to $63,000 and from 1 July 2006, will increase again to $70,000.</para>
<para class="block">From 1 July 2005, the 47 per cent threshold will increase to $95,000 and from 1 July 2006 will increase again to $125,000.</para>
<para class="block">The reduction in the 17 per cent rate to 15 per cent means that taxpayers who are eligible for the full Low Income Tax Offset will not pay tax until their income exceeds $7,567, up from $7,382 currently.</para>
<para class="block">Senior Australians will also benefit. From 1 July 2005, senior Australians who receive the Senior Australians Tax Offset can earn more without paying tax. Single senior Australians will now pay no tax on their annual income up to $21,968 and no tax on equal incomes up to a joint $36,494 for a couple. The Medicare levy threshold for senior Australians will be increased to ensure that they do not pay the Medicare levy until they begin to incur an income tax liability.</para>
<para class="block">The personal income tax cuts will assist low income earners, boost disposable incomes and improve incentives for all Australian taxpayers to participate in the workforce, to invest and to save. This will ensure that over 80 per cent of taxpayers will face a top marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less.</para>
<para class="block">These personal income tax cuts will further improve the structure of Australia’s tax system and increase our international competitiveness. Our strong economy, lifestyle advantages and changes to the top two thresholds will provide incentives to work in Australia. Taxpayers will not reach the highest marginal tax rate until they earn around three times average weekly earnings, with the top marginal rate applying to only 3 per cent of taxpayers from 2006-07.</para>
<para class="block">If the threshold for the top marginal rate had been indexed to inflation since 1996, on 1 July 2006 it would have stood below $64,000. Under the measures contained in this bill it will stand at $125,000.</para>
<para class="block">Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.</para>
<para class="block">I commend the bill.</para>

</talker>
<para>—In speaking to the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline> I start by making it clear that the Senate has both a right and a responsibility to debate and review legislation—this legislation and all other legislation that comes before the parliament. That is what Australians expect from this chamber. That is why they elected us. As the alternative government, the Labor Party also have obligations to the Australian people. It is our responsibility to provide an alternative view of legislation, to speak out when we think things are wrong and to fight for those people whose interests we represent.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the case of this tax legislation, Labor have a very different alternative view. We believe the government’s proposal is grossly unfair, and we have been making that case in the strongest possible terms since the budget was delivered. These changes are particularly unfair in the context of the draconian welfare cuts that form the centrepiece of the budget. To fail to speak out against these tax and welfare changes would be a dereliction of our duty to the electorate. But in this case Labor are not just arguing against the government’s tax changes; we are presenting a comprehensive alternative. We have presented and are arguing for a different package, a package which offers broader tax relief for working Australians and a much fairer package than that which the government is offering. Even the government has failed to tackle us on that issue. But this is our role as the opposition: to critique the government’s legislation, to present alternative views and to put forward alternative strategies. Labor will not shirk that responsibility, and that is what we take up today.</para>
<para>The Treasurer, for his part, would have us not play that role, not carry out our duty as the opposition. He would have us move aside and quietly allow the passage of this unfair legislation. His position, as with the thinking of many, is based on the fact that as of 1 July the coalition will have a majority in the Senate and will probably be free to pass any legislation it thinks fit. Labor acknowledge that political reality. We respect the verdict of the Australian people handed down in October last year. However, that does not mean we will not oppose as best we can legislation that we think is unfair, legislation that does the wrong thing by Australian families. We will not be running up the white flag now or at any time over the next three years.</para>
<para>Some commentators have supported the Treasurer’s view that somehow Labor should quietly constrain our opposition on the basis of the new Senate numbers and the political reality that will confront us after July. But I think people should look very carefully at that proposition. They should consider what is required of the opposition over the next three years. Do they really want an opposition which effectively gives up and goes home, one that says, ‘We won’t have the numbers; therefore we should give up the argument, give up the fight’? Or do they want an opposition that argues its case, presents alternative views and policies and fights for what it believes in? I would argue that, given the power that this government will very soon have and given the types of extreme and unfair proposals that we are already seeing emerge on the basis of that new-found power, a robust, vibrant opposition is more important than ever.</para>
<para>The new circumstances of the Senate do not reduce our obligation to hold the government to account for its policies and to fight for a better deal for the people we represent. The obligation is even stronger upon us. The Labor opposition’s role in this parliament will become even more important than ever. That is an obligation that we accept and will honour. So we will argue against these tax and welfare changes and we will present what we see as better and fairer alternatives. To do otherwise would be a betrayal of the trust placed in us by so many Australian people.</para>
<para>The choices made in the budget reflect the values and priorities of the Howard government. This budget comes at a time of extended economic prosperity, on the back of reforms made by the Hawke and Keating Labor governments and highly favourable economic conditions. This budget was an opportunity for the government to make the hard decisions to ensure our future economic prosperity in the areas of skills and infrastructure and to engage in constructive reform of our tax and welfare systems. Labor believe that the hard work that needs to be done can be done with fairness and that as a society we must always ensure that the benefits of prosperity are shared. As a nation we need to make sure that the vulnerable people in our society and those who have fallen on hard times are not left behind.</para>
<para>Against that backdrop, this budget fails miserably. It fails to live up to the responsibilities of economic good fortune and it fails to invest in the skills and infrastructure that are needed to ensure our future prosperity. This budget fails to engage in the hard reforms and it fails the test of fairness. It delivers a kick in the teeth to some of the most vulnerable people in our society: single parents and the disabled. It delivers a meagre $6 a week in tax cuts to the vast majority of working Australians, while offering 10 times that amount to people on high incomes. This budget is truly the work of the Howard government. It shirks the hard decisions and the reforms that we need for Australia’s future prosperity. It delivers a huge bonus to the well-off and it punishes and impoverishes some of the most vulnerable in our society. It does, I am afraid, reflect the values and the priorities of the Howard government.</para>
<para>Over the last few months there has been a lot of big talk from the coalition about reform: increasing incentives in the tax system and reforming our welfare infrastructure. There have been lots of leaks to newspapers and background briefings by ministers. But when we saw the budget it was clear that it fails to provide the incentive that is needed to assist participation and economic growth, it fails to provide real incentive to any but the best-off in our community and it fails to meet the challenge of welfare reform. This budget returns to Australians $24 billion in tax cuts and there is the abolition of the superannuation surcharge, but it does it in a way which is grossly and shamelessly weighted to high-income earners. The maximum tax cut made under this budget will be available only to people with a taxable income of $125,000 a year or more—just 280,000 taxpayers. In fact, the top 10 per cent of taxpayers will get 45 per cent of the total value of these tax cuts. The other 90 per cent of taxpayers share the remaining 55 per cent.</para>
<para>Coalition members and senators have defended the unfairness of these tax cuts by claiming that higher income earners get a greater cut because they pay more tax, but this assertion is deceptive. Of course our tax system is based on the principle that the more you earn the more tax you pay, but this budget does not reduce the tax burden relative to the difference in tax paid—in fact, it undermines the principle of progressive taxation. A taxpayer on $125,000 a year pays three times the tax of a taxpayer earning $62,500. Under this budget, the taxpayer on $125,000 a year gets a cut of $65 a week—10 times more than the $6 a week that goes to the person on $62,500 per annum. That is what fairness means to this government: the high-income earner gets 10 times the tax cut of the middle-income earner, even though they pay three times the amount of tax.</para>
<para>The choices made in this budget are consistent with the government’s approach over the longer term. On current figures, a taxpayer on average weekly earnings of $50,000 per annum will, over the period from the introduction of the GST to the end of the forward estimates, get just $10 a week in tax cuts from this government. Over the same period, a taxpayer on $125,000 per annum will get almost $120 per week—nearly 12 times as much as the average earner will get. These are the choices and priorities of John Howard and Peter Costello. They could have made different choices; they could have made fairer choices.</para>
<para>Labor has put forward an alternative fairer tax proposal. This gives the government the opportunity to offer a better deal to Australian families and to offer greater incentives in our tax system. Labor’s alternative proposal would implement the following changes from 1 January 2006: introduce a welfare to work tax bonus which, when fully implemented, would effectively raise to $10,000 the tax-free threshold for people earning up to $20,000 a year; and raise the threshold where the 30c income tax rate cuts in to $26,400 per annum. This would deliver a tax cut of $12 a week to low- and middle-income earners.</para>
<para>The following changes would also apply from 1 July 2006: raise the income threshold where the 42c tax rate cuts in, from $63,000 to $67,000 per annum, ensuring that 80 per cent of taxpayers pay a marginal tax rate of 30c in the dollar or less; and raise to $100,000 the income threshold where the top tax rate cuts in, thereby improving the international competitiveness of our tax system. This model would give a far greater tax cut to Australians on low incomes. A taxpayer earning $25,000 per annum would gain $15 a week as opposed to $6 a week under the government’s budget—that is, 2½ times the weekly gain. Taxpayers earning between $35,000 and $60,000 per annum would gain $12 a week, as opposed to the $6 a week from the government, therefore doubling the weekly benefit. Under Labor’s fairer proposal, taxpayers earning between $70,000 and $100,000 per annum would get a cut similar to that proposed by the government. Those earning over $100,000 would get a tax cut of about $40 a week—more than $2,000 a year. That is not as much as under the government’s proposal but it is a significant cut and it provides substantial incentive.</para>
<para>Labor’s alternative tax proposal is far more generous to those on low and middle incomes, while still offering a substantial tax cut and recognising the hard work and aspirations of people on high incomes. Labor’s tax alternative delivers incentives right up the tax scale. It respects the needs and aspirations of the great majority of Australians and it demonstrates that the government could have made a fairer choice—it could have done the right thing by all Australian taxpayers.</para>
<para>The unfairness of the Howard government’s tax cuts is reinforced by the other key plank of this budget: the massive cut in welfare. While the government has given a huge tax bonus to the richest Australians and thrown some scraps to low- and middle-income families, it has delivered a sharp kick to the most vulnerable members of our society. This government has always been weak on social policy, and it has made one bad choice after another to try and weather the political fallout from its policy failures. The family tax benefit system has been a fiasco. Despite countless tweaks to the system, 150,000 Australian families still got an FTB debt last year. A further 300,000 families saw no benefit from the $600 per child supplementary payment—it was simply used to pay off their debts.</para>
<para>Like tax, there has been a lot of big talk from the government about the need for welfare reform. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, was promoting that as the key reform of this budget but, instead, they have pointed the finger at the 700,000 Australians on disability payments and spoken about increasing participation and making our welfare system sustainable. But what has been delivered is a poorly thought out set of punitive changes that will cut the living standards of the worst-off in our society.</para>
<para>Employment participation offers people not just financial independence but also social inclusion, self-respect and the chance to reach their potential. Government has a role in ensuring that the aspirations and potential of Australians are not wasted. To properly meet the challenge of welfare reform, there are three key areas that need to be addressed. Firstly, we need to build capacity to ensure that people have the skills to be competitive in the labour market, particularly those who bear the burden of long-term unemployment. Secondly, we need to provide incentives to work, so that people are financially better off through work, not deterred by crippling effective marginal tax rates. And, thirdly, we need to encourage business to take on people who have been on welfare on the same basis as they would employ others.</para>
<para>Addressing these three priorities would be a sound basis for welfare reform. However, the government’s plan fails to engage with any of them. Instead of providing any assistance to anyone, the centrepiece of the government’s changes is a massive cut in payments. Under the new arrangements, single parents will go onto Newstart—the parents’ dole—when their youngest child turns six. The tragic sixth birthday present from Peter Costello and John Howard for children in the most disadvantaged families will be a $22 cut in weekly income. Happy birthday!</para>
<para>Somehow, the government thinks this will encourage parents to look for 15 hours work each week. The absurdity of this claim is exposed when you do the calculations and find out that those single parents who already work part time will be punished the hardest. For instance, a single parent with three children between six and 16 and who works 20 hours a week for, say, $600 a fortnight will get $186 a fortnight less in payments after 1 July 2006. That is a massive cut in family income of nearly $5,000 a year. Similarly, a single parent of two children between six and 16 who works 15 hours a week for, say, $400 a fortnight will see their income reduced by $136 a fortnight after 1 July 2006—around $3,500 a year.</para>
<para>The parents in both of these examples are already doing exactly what the government wants them to do by working part time. These people are not bludgers; these are people who are working and raising kids and who are now going to be worse off as a result of this budget. So the government slashes thousands of dollars from their yearly income. These single parents may be forced to leave the work force altogether, unable to cope with the costly combination of child-care fees, transport fares and other expenses associated with going to work. This means that they will go back to being completely dependent on welfare and will slip into poverty, which is exactly the opposite of what should be happening. Moving parents onto the dole also decreases incentives to find work by exposing them to effective marginal tax rates 20 per cent higher than they face under the current parenting payment. For every extra dollar that they earn, the parent on Newstart will lose 60c through the withdrawal of payments, compared to the 40c that they lose on parenting payment. This is what the government represents as an incentive to work.</para>
<para>The budget also fails to provide other assistance to parents who are forced into work. It provides no assurance that new child-care places will be available to single parents entering the work force and it has failed to engage in any meaningful capacity building programs for single parents. What these changes will do is expose parents to the government’s harsh penalty regime and the prospect of further cuts to family income. The Dickensian darkness of the government’s plan is illustrated by the news that Centrelink will now have to buy food for the children of families who lose their payments as a result of the government’s penalty regime. This marks the government’s recognition that it will move already disadvantaged families and children to a state of subsistence. These changes are a new low, even for this government. That they should be announced at the same time as huge tax cuts for the wealthy is simply shameful.</para>
<para>This budget also fails the disabled. After complaining for years about the dire situation of 700,000 Australians on the disability support pension, there is nothing in the budget to address these people’s problems. John Howard and Peter Costello simply found it too difficult. There is nothing to help DSP recipients get off welfare and into work. Instead, like single parents, new applicants for assistance after July 2006 will have to cop a massive cut in payments. People with disabilities who are deemed capable of part-time work will be forced onto the dole, where they will be $77 a fortnight worse off than they would be on the DSP. And, as with single parents, those people with disabilities who are already working part time against the odds face the greatest punishment, through the loss of thousands of dollars each year in payments. These changes are harsh and mean-spirited and they do nothing to help people move from welfare to work.</para>
<para>What has become clear about the government’s welfare changes is that they were cobbled together at the last minute. Already we have seen two major backflips as a result of problems exposed at Senate estimates, the latest being that the Prime Minister had to renege on the assurance he gave to parliament about the treatment of single parents looking for jobs. This deal was cobbled together at the last minute and the Prime Minister did not understand it properly. It was a classic compromise between a Prime Minister trying to hang onto power and a Treasurer chasing his job. There are more examples of the government’s abject failure to plan for genuine welfare reform and its ducking of the hard issues. There is nothing more shameful than the fact that it did nothing to address the needs of those 700,000 people who are now stuck on DSP and quarantined but not assisted.</para>
<para>Taken together, these tax changes and the accompanying welfare cuts expose the priorities and values of the Howard government: a bonus for the wealthy, a kick for the vulnerable and very little for middle Australia. They not only show the government’s flawed priorities but also illustrate its failure to make constructive changes in our network of social support. The government has knowingly and willingly given thousands of dollars of tax cuts to the wealthy and taken large amounts from single-parent, working families. It has planned for an Australia where kids in vulnerable families will have to turn up to Centrelink to seek food and the payment of bills. The disabled will be worse off. This is a dark and shameful effort from the Howard government, and Labor would be failing in our duty to the Australian people if we did anything but to oppose it in the strongest way possible.</para>
<para>Labor will seek to amend this bill to make it fairer. We will argue for a fairer tax package. We will argue that the so-called welfare reforms are punishment of the disadvantaged in our community. We will take the fight up to the government on both those issues, because the budget reflects wrong priorities and wrong choices. There is a better way. We want the government to accept that they could do much better with the money and provide a much better solution to the problems confronting Australia than what they have come up with in this budget. In the committee stage Labor will argue to amend this bill. We will argue for our fairer package and continue to fight for a better alternative than that proposed by the Howard government.</para>

</talker>
<para>—The purpose of the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline> is to amend the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 and the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to give effect to the coalition government’s tax cuts proposals spelt out in its May 2005 budget. The budget tax cuts cost $21.7 billion over four years. You would be forgiven for thinking that this proposal from the government should have resulted in a debate concerning the public interest. We did not get such a debate, with too much of the media continuing a ridiculous obsession with interpreting posture rather than examining substance. Apart from some quality pieces from a few journalists and commentators—almost invariably in the print media and not the electronic media—the public have had a superficial and very ordinary media debate. The public are not dummies and do not deserve to be treated so.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>A public interest debate would require the following questions to be asked. Are the coalition’s proposed tax cuts fair? Do they advance equity? Do they improve productivity and efficiency? Do they integrate effectively, productively and fairly with the welfare system? Does Australia need permanent structural reform of its income tax system, and why? What sort of permanent structural reform is needed? Should the tax-free threshold be raised? Should we index the rates? Should we broaden the base? Should we raise the top rate? Should we change the rates themselves? If income tax reform is only affordable in manageable stages over a number of years, what should be the priority order? Should low-income earners get attention first, then middle- and high-income earners last and, if so, why? Should there be tax cuts at all, or should the budget priority be to satisfy an underspend in areas such as health, education, the environment and infrastructure?</para>
<para>Those interested in the workings of parliamentary process and our democratic system might have expected exploration of such issues as why parliament’s views matter, the difference between the substantive tax bill and the consequent regulations and schedules, the various voting permutations and possibilities in the Senate, and what happens when a Senate amended bill is rejected by the House. But there has not been a policy debate, has there? There have been a number of analytical pieces on various cases for tax reform, but there has not been an informed presentation and comparison of the views of the various political parties, academics and others interested in tax, has there?</para>
<para>The electorate remains largely ignorant of the alternative proposals and views they should consider. And whose fault is that? Whose responsibility is that? It is the responsibility of the media, the fourth estate—now mostly a big business oligopoly often rather obviously enjoying its power to veto, suppress and edit and to actively agitate for the interests of its owners. Just after the budget, at 8.45 am on Thursday, 12 May, as the Democrats spokesperson on taxation, I sent this message to AAP:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Just thought I’d send a note to you at AAP, given the ALP’s statement that they will oppose the tax cuts package and put up an alternative. They (like us) will need support to get any proposal up.</para>
<para class="block">The Democrats announced their alternative proposal on Wednesday (see below) and will be seeking ALP support.</para>
<para class="block">We will have two amendments. One opposing all tax cuts and raising the tax-free threshold to $10 000 instead. The second one (if that goes down) will split the tax cuts bill into the low income tax cuts and the high income tax cuts. We will then vote for the 17 to 15 cents low-income earners tax cut, and against the rest of the tax cuts.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">AAP did not think that was newsworthy—surprising, really, since we Democrats share the balance of power in the Senate at present. I mentioned my AAP message to a journalist I know—an obedient employee of a newspaper that confuses democracy with duopoly and bias with advocacy—and he exclaimed: ‘That lets Beazley off the hook!’ Actually it did not, and does not, but do you think he reported my statement? Of course not, because he and his editor wanted to keep Mr Beazley on the hook. They think the public are interested in this strength and leadership nonsense. What the public are interested in are the tax cuts—whether they will get those on offer or whether there should be a different set on offer.</para>
<para>This debate has largely been the coalition and the media versus the parliament. A media lynch mob has assailed the Leader of the Opposition and his party for daring to oppose the government. Their crude message has been: let us have an elected dictatorship—a message that echoes too many journalists’ own daily obeisance to the moguls or their lieutenants or the businessmen running their companies. Thank goodness for the many other journos who do not behave or think like that.</para>
<para>It has all been a question of demanding that the parliament step aside for the executive—never mind the lessons of history and the known dangers of excessive forelock-tugging to the executive, never mind that the majority of Australians did not give their primary vote to Mr Howard’s coalition, never mind that the most important power of a parliament is the power to tax and spend and it should be ever careful in doing so, never mind that democracy means that supreme power is vested in the people and is exercised through their elected representatives and it is they who decide the laws. It is parliament that decides our laws, it is parliament that decides our taxes, not the executive and not journalists and editors who look forward to filling their well-paid pockets with these high-income tax cuts.</para>
<para>If it is not bad enough having many employees of the big business media companies constantly fostering a duopolistic political system, if it is not bad enough having these same employees pursuing their own and their companies’ self-interest—with never once a declaration of a conflict of interest—we have them throwing overboard their sacred duty to the freedom of the press. That freedom is not the freedom to indulge your self-interest or your employer’s self-interest. It is not the freedom to fail to declare a conflict of interest. That freedom means being an organ of record, of championing free speech, of fairly representing alternative points of view, of abiding by the journalists code of ethics, and it means informing the public fully without fear or favour.</para>
<para>We have much to fear in our future if this is going to continue to be the standard of bias and groupthink we are going to be subjected to by so many in the media. While we can praise the journalists who stand out from the mob, they should be the examples of the best, not exceptions to the rule. Ask the voters. Have they been told what points of view there are on income tax reform, what the issues are and what the alternative policies are? Have they been told how the many combinations of Senate votes could produce different outcomes and how the process could go? No. Most of the media’s entire interest has been to lambaste Kim Beazley and his party. They have not lambasted me or my party, but they have lambasted Kim Beazley and his party and, quite frankly, I think somebody should stand up for them.</para>
<para>Labor do deserve criticism for not having a known, established and thought through income tax structural reform package. They do deserve criticism for just cobbling together their answer and their attitude shortly after the budget and for not having a well thought through approach beforehand. But they do not deserve criticism for believing that the coalition tax cuts package is wrong and that theirs is better and for voting accordingly. That is Labor’s duty. That is Labor’s responsibility. That is the meaning of parliament and the meaning of our democracy. By all means disagree with Labor. By all means disagree with the Democrats and with all the other political voices and policies in Australia, but at least let them be heard.</para>
<para>Moving from an unusual defence of the Labor Party, let me now go to the Democrats tax cuts. The relevant Democrat policy says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Australian Democrats support a taxation system that is broadly based, progressive, and based on capacity to pay.</para>
<para class="block">We support the principle of indexing taxes in general with income tax brackets adjusted regularly to minimise ‘bracket creep’.</para>
<para class="block">We believe that income tax brackets should be linked to meaningful social indicators.</para>
<para class="block">We believe that the tax-free threshold should be raised to the poverty line.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">For about three years we have been running a campaign to increase the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $10,000 and progressively increasing it thereafter to the poverty line.</para>
<para>In summary, the Democrat position has long been that the first budget priority is to satisfy underspends in areas such as health, education, the environment and infrastructure. Essential tax relief is required for low-income earners with very high effective marginal tax rates to raise their disposable income and living standards and to encourage welfare to work through greater incentives. Our position has included ending welfare for the wealthy by cracking down on unnecessary tax concessions and loopholes. The government use of tax cuts as an election-winning device perverts the real policy need for structural income tax reform and not just periodic relief. For those members of the coalition tax ginger group who think their job is done, it is not. Much more structural reform is still needed.</para>
<para>If the government is determined on broad tax cuts, I have had a public proposal out there as a contribution to the debate on permanent structural reform. As the Democrats taxation spokesperson, I have said that, because income tax reform is only affordable in manageable stages, in priority order low income should get attention first, then middle and high income last. We think that structural reform over a number of years should occur in this priority order as it becomes affordable: firstly, raise the tax-free threshold to $10,000; then $12,500, which is the minimum subsistence line, also known as the poverty line; then towards $20,000, which currently only some retired Australians enjoy. All Australians get a tax cut this way, but low-income earners benefit most with substantial real disposable income increases. Secondly, we have argued that we should index the rates starting with the tax-free threshold. That is something for the coalition ginger group to get a grip on—indexing the rates. Thirdly, broaden the base. We have a hit list of unnecessary welfare for the wealthy and tax concessions in mind, including, amongst others: exclusive tax cuts for high-income earners being funded by cracking down on tax concessions and loopholes such as taxing trusts as companies, instead of their present arrangements; excessively generous company car schemes, such as those that the Ralph review castigated; income splitting; negative gearing; and capital gains tax concessions.</para>
<para>We have suggested raising the top rate, and I have suggested $120,000. The Democrats have not specified what the levels of the rates should be. The key point is the amount of revenue you need to raise, not what the nominal rate should be. Rates are affected by what is fair, by progressivity considerations and by what is internationally competitive. We do of course recognise that other elements of welfare benefits will have to be integrated and adjusted for this approach. So our response has been to put forward our own tax cuts amendments to delete the government tax cuts provisions and to increase the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $10,000. This would provide a $13 a week tax cut, which is $680 per annum, to all taxpayers.</para>
<para>Because based on experience we expect this amendment to be voted down by the coalition and Labor, we will oppose the higher income earners tax cuts but attempt to pass the low-income earners reduction in the $6,000 to $21,600—that is, 17 per cent—tax bracket. That reduction is to 15 per cent. This is the government proposal which provides a $6 a week tax cut to all taxpayers earning over $21,600. The Democrats proposal is much better for low-income earners—it is well over double for low-income earners—than the coalition’s proposal.</para>
<para>In our view, the government’s tax cuts priorities are all wrong. There is an urgent need for tax relief for low-income earners, who actually have the highest effective tax rates of all. I believe that the Democrats tax position would not only provide greater benefits for low-income earners but also assist the Australian economy materially. Last week we saw the Industrial Relations Commission produce a fair and balanced wage decision on the minimum wage that, predictably, was criticised by employer groups and the government for being too generous and potentially costing jobs and by the ACTU for being too mean and too lean. Interestingly, the Industrial Relations Commission noted the tax cuts in this year’s and last year’s budget and commented that the $17 a week increase was needed to keep low-income earners increases in line with average wages. In their decision they said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... we have also taken into account the benefits to low-paid employees of changes in the tax and government transfer regimes which occurred during 2004 and which have been foreshadowed in the Budget for 2005-06. We note, however, that while tax reductions will undoubtedly assist low-paid employees in absolute terms, their living standards may not increase greatly in relative terms when all of the changes in taxation and government benefits are taken into account.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words, if you want to address low-income earners’ needs, you have to address the taxation and welfare intersection. The Democrats proposal to increase the tax-free threshold to $10,000 would provide a much fairer $680-a-year benefit to all taxpayers. It would also take the pressure off the Industrial Relations Commission, which has the sole responsibility at present for lifting disposable income for those groups.</para>
<para>We believe that the government should be providing more money for health and education. But, with a projected $9 billion surplus, we are not opposed to tax cuts. Our approach is simple: we support tax cuts, but we believe that low-income earners should get their tax cut first, then the middle-income earners and lastly the high-income earners. It is beyond me why the Treasurer and the government did not put together a full package and say: ‘This is the structural reform we are going to introduce. It will be introduced over a number of years. Here is the entire package.’ It just beats me why we have to persist with dribbling out these little gifts periodically when what is needed is certainty in this area in a policy sense.</para>
<para>The Democrats are critical of the present changes because they provide the highest income earners—and bear in mind the reports we have had about the number of millionaires we are producing every week—with a $4,502 annual tax cut but provide average taxpayers with only $312 per annum, or $6 a week. If you couple high-income earners’ income tax cuts with the ending of the superannuation surcharge, which is worth around $1,500 per annum to a high-income earner, this represents a huge benefit to higher income earners.</para>
<para>The media have publicised the Democrats’ opposition to the tax cuts package, although far fewer have said why we oppose it. The great majority of the media have ignored our alternative tax proposal and our parliamentary strategy. That might be all right for them if they want to take that attitude, but it is not all right with respect to Labor, which is the alternative government in this country. Turning back to the Democrat plan, our $680-a-year tax cut is double the Howard offer to low-income earners and slightly more than the Beazley offer of $12 a week. It is a better tax cut than the Beazley plan for nearly everyone earning under $60,000. For everyone earning under $65,000, it is a better tax cut than the Howard plan. In other words, it picks up the vast majority of taxpayers. The <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> recently stated that there are 1,801,805 Australians earning less than $10,000. Most of these people do not currently pay tax. But, if our policy were supported, around 400,000 more taxpayers would no longer have to pay income tax.</para>
<para>The Labor Party have proposed their own tax cuts, using the $21.7 billion from the tax cuts package and taking the rest from the superannuation surcharge, totalling $24 billion. Their package includes an increased low-income earners rebate, greater tax cuts for middle-income earners and a top tax threshold of $100,000. The Labor Party proposal is fairer than the government’s, but it does still favour high-income earners. It lacks the consistency of the Democrats position and it lacks the structural reform that we have built into our plan. The Democrats are the only political party to have outlined a detailed, comprehensive tax plan which contains structural reform rather than ad hoc, irregular tax cuts. We urge the major parties and the media to consider our proposals or listen to others who have structural reform proposals. We urge them to explain why they should not support the plan that provides the greatest assistance to hardworking low-income earners, takes the pressure off the Industrial Relations Commission to increase wages and provides in the future for the proper relief that all taxpayers deserve.</para>
<para>I return to the structural reform package that we have spelt out. We say that raising the tax-free threshold is the first priority. Indexing the rates is the second priority. We say the base should be broadened and the top rate should be raised. That would then constitute structural income tax reform. It should be melded in with welfare reform, particularly to encourage welfare to work.</para>
<para>Over the last few weeks the big issue has been the ATO’s regulations covering the taxation schedules. These schedules simply show employers in different industries how much tax to deduct from an employee’s wages based on a given salary level. These regulations are subsequent to this legislation. This legislation is the substantive issue that we have to deal with. The attention on the regulations has, to our regret, taken the tension off the question of the kinds of tax cuts that Australia really needs.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline> and to place on record some concerns with the government’s proposal as I believe that, in one particular area, the government could have done better. But, overall, the government’s proposal is one that One Nation supports.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>First of all, I would like to place clearly on the record some statistics that are not generally talked about in this chamber. We tend to look at the dollar value that is being derived from individual people in set brackets in paying their tax, but we overlook the percentage in relation to government receipts that each particular bracket pays. I would like to put those figures clearly on record. I will quote from the 2002 and 2003 government receipts because they are the latest that we have available.</para>
<para>People paying tax in the 17 per cent bracket pay 22 per cent of the entire receipts that the government derives from taxation. Those in the 30 per cent bracket pay 44 per cent of the receipts that the government derives. Those in the 42 per cent bracket pay eight per cent of the receipts. Those who pay 47 per cent and above pay 26 per cent of the receipts. The area that I would like to focus on is those people who pay in the 30 per cent bracket—currently those whose taxable income is between $21,600 and $58,000. The government’s proposal for the 30 per cent rate is that it will apply to people whose income falls between $21,600 and $63,000. The government has done the right thing in lifting the bracket for that group of people; however, I feel it would have been an additional benefit if the government had introduced another bracket in that area. I believe it would have reflected better on the government if it had split that current bracket into two, creating an additional bracket for people whose income is between $21,601 and $40,000, and structuring that rate at 22.5 per cent. That would have given a large percentage of lower and middle income Australians a considerable benefit in the tax that they pay. That is my only criticism of what the government is putting forward.</para>
<para>One Nation will support the government’s personal income tax reduction bill and will also oppose any disallowance motions on regulations. The reason I make that statement very clear so early in my contribution to this debate is because it is the prerogative of the government of the day not only to administer the revenues that they receive but also to set the levels of tax. If they do get it wrong—and I have highlighted just one small area where I think they have got it wrong—the people at the next election will cast their ballots in relation to how they judge the government. That is called democracy, and that is how this process should proceed.</para>
<para>I will speak in further detail in the committee stage in relation to Senator Murray’s amendments because I just have one question for him. What I find interesting in the lead-up to this bill is what the Greens are putting forward. They have made a statement in the media that they will not support a disallowance motion, and I commend them for that. I believe that is the correct procedure. But then the Greens have tabled a second reading amendment which I find somewhat perplexing because the outcome, were it to succeed, would be this legislation not proceeding. So we have the Greens on one hand saying, ‘We will not support a disallowance motion,’ and then on the other hand bringing into the chamber an amendment which in actuality would send the bill off into the never-never so that it would be irrelevant how they would vote on the disallowance motion on the regulations. I find that somewhat perplexing, and I will be interested to hear how the Greens can explain that not only to the chamber but also to the Australian people.</para>

<para>—No, it is in the banter of humour and I accept it as that. Speaking briefly on Labor’s amendments, again we have an interesting situation. The government’s proposal for the 2005-06 year is for a person who has an income between $6,001 and $21,600 to have a tax rate of 15 per cent—that is a reduction of two per cent that the government is proposing. I find it interesting that, in the amendments to be moved by Senator Sherry, the opposition’s proposal for the 2005-06 year for a person whose income exceeds $6,000 but does not exceed $21,600 is a rate of 17 per cent. Why on earth would the opposition bring a proposal into this chamber to lift the tax rates of a percentage of people that they claim to support? It is a funny way of supporting people.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>So, with those brief comments, I commend the government’s legislation, both the bill and the subsequent regulations, to the chamber. I look forward to some very interesting explanations in the committee stage.</para>

<para>—It gives me great pleasure to speak on the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline>. This bill is all about what coalition governments love to do—to cut tax. On this side of the chamber we believe that the government should be as limited as possible, consistent with a compassionate society. On this side of the chamber we believe that, where government intervention in the lives of individuals can be reduced, it should be. The coalition have the strong conviction that Australians know better how to spend their money than the government. This bill is a demonstration of that belief. We seek to return to the Australian public what is theirs, what is above and beyond what the government needs to do its job. Several budgets back the Treasurer established a new fiscal principle, the principle that essentially, once the government has paid for schools, hospitals, social services, security and defence and paid down debt, any money left over should be given back to the Australian people in the form of tax cuts. That is what this budget does, and the Treasurer again honoured that principle on budget night.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This government has cut taxes many times before—in 2000, 2003 and 2004—and, Senate willing, will do so again in 2005 and 2006. It is worth reminding the Senate that, in addition to the income tax cuts already delivered, the government has done a tremendous amount in cutting tax. It has cut company tax twice, halved the capital gains tax rate, funded the abolition of FID and BAD, undertaken a range of measures to crack down on tax avoiders and forced the states to honour their agreement as part of the intergovernmental agreement of the new tax system—something which they should have done beforehand.</para>
<para>This bill seeks to reduce personal income taxes even further—providing for a fourth and fifth round of personal income tax cuts. It will reduce the 17 per cent rate to 15 per cent. It will kick out the threshold for the 42 per cent rate in two stages: from $58,000 to $63,000 from 1 July this year and to $70,000 from 1 July 2006. It will kick out the threshold for the top rate of 47 per cent in two stages: from $70,000 to $95,000 on 1 July this year and to $125,000 on 1 July 2006. As a result of this bill, taxpayers will not reach the highest marginal tax rate until they earn around three times average weekly earnings, with the top rate applying to only three per cent of taxpayers from 2006-07. These tax cuts also maintain the principle that 80 per cent of taxpayers will be on a top rate of 30 per cent or less. The personal income tax cuts delivered by this government have more than returned the proceeds of bracket creep. If all this government had done was to index the thresholds, people would be paying more tax today and into the future.</para>
<para>The way the government has been able to cut taxes is remarkable given the Australian Labor Party bequeathed it a $96 billion deficit. It is all the more remarkable given the Labor Party opposed every single measure designed to bring the budget back into surplus. It is all the more remarkable given the Labor Party opposed the tax cuts as part of the new tax system.</para>
<para>I cannot talk about the tax cuts of 2000 without acknowledging the contribution of the Australian Democrats. The Australian Democrats from time to time know how to be a responsible non-government party. We should never forget the contribution of their then leader Senator Lees, Senator Murray and Senator Cherry in his former capacity as an adviser to the Democrats. They were a responsible party on the other side of this chamber.</para>
<para>But the Labor Party are at it yet again; they are back in support of higher taxes. I think Australians were stunned—senators on this side of the chamber certainly were—when on budget night the shadow Treasurer, Mr Swan, declared on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> that the Australian Labor Party would oppose these tax cuts. That soon turned to disbelief when the Australian Labor Party declared that they would vote to disallow the 2005 schedules—that was one of their options; that was their thermonuclear option. I have a copy of the schedules here from another place, which are yet to be tabled. These are like cloves of garlic or a silver cross to a vampire. When you hold them up to Labor you should see them reel back. They want to stay as far away from these schedules as they possibly can.</para>
<para>We on this side of the chamber want to hold Labor to account. It was farcical watching Senator Conroy plead with the tax commissioner at estimates to provide him with an exit, to provide Labor with an escape clause. He tried to blame somehow the tax commissioner for this situation because he was obeying the law. The tax commissioner is not in a position to provide an exit strategy for the Labor Party. This is a situation of their own making. The Australian Labor Party have got it wrong, and they know it. Senators opposite should do the decent thing. They should convince their leader to abandon this bloody-minded farce, allow the schedules, vote for the bill and get out of the way. I commend this bill to the Senate.</para>

</talker>
<para>—The Liberal government has missed a great opportunity to engage in long-term reform of the taxation system. It has managed to spend some $22 billion on personal cuts without delivering any real reform. There is no fundamental reform of the taxation system in the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline>, which we are considering. The tax measures are ad hoc and not part of any integrated strategy to boost participation and productivity. The overall tax package has clearly been thrown together quickly with no real vision and, as a consequence, the great bulk of taxpayers in this country on low and middle incomes continue to carry the overwhelming proportion of the tax burden.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Notwithstanding these tax cuts, this will still be the highest taxing government in Australia’s history, with a total tax at almost $235 billion in 2005-06. This is an increase of over 100 per cent, a doubling since Mr Howard came to office. Tax per taxpayer has risen by over $12,200 under Treasurer Costello and GST is weighing very heavily on Australian families. By 2008-09 the GST bill per household will be almost $5,400, or over $100 per week.</para>
<para>It is revealing to look at who is bearing the burden of tax. Despite the Liberal government’s claims to the contrary, successive changes to the personal income tax scales have left low- and middle-income earners paying as much if not more tax than in 1996, with higher income earners paying less. For example, a worker on average earnings—around $51,000 a year—will lose 22.5 per cent of their earnings in tax after the budget’s proposed changes. That is the same average tax rate they faced in 1996. A worker on half the average wage will lose 15.1 per cent of their earnings in tax, a hike from the 12.9 per cent average tax rate they faced in 1996. It is a very different story for higher income earners. Someone on 2½ times the average wage—around $130,000 a year—will lose 33.4 per cent of their earnings in tax, a cut from the average tax rate of 36.1 per cent average tax rate that they faced in 1996. These figures expose the government’s attempts to assert that low-income earners have benefited most from their tax cuts. In fact, the opposite is true: someone on half the average wage is paying more than $600 a year more in tax than they would have if the average tax rate which they faced in 1996 applied today.</para>
<para>Mr Costello’s tax package says a lot about who he believes is entitled to have aspirations for themselves and their families. His message was that unless you are on or approaching a six-figure salary you are not worthy of incentive and a decent tax cut. You see, in the Treasurer’s world, if you are a hardworking family slogging your guts out on a combined household income of $70,000—perhaps with a principal earner on $45,000 and a secondary income of $25,000—you do not have aspirations for yourself or your kids: that is the logic of the Treasurer’s argument. You only qualify for some token tax relief—a paltry $6 each for which you should be grateful, according to the Treasurer.</para>
<para>Labor’s package before the Senate today will set out a fairer alternative and give these middle-income earners $12 each per week or $24 for the family. High-income earners would do well out of Labor’s alternative package—not as well as under the Liberal government’s proposal, but they would still do well. Let us take the example of middle-income earners: a steelworker in Wollongong on $80,000, $90,000, or even $100,000 a year would get roughly the same tax cut as they would under Labor’s proposal as they would from the Liberal government. But it is the higher income earners, earning more than $100,000, who would not do as well under the Labor proposal.</para>
<para>There is a profound difference between Labor and the Liberal-National government. We believe in aspirations for everyone. You see, the Labor Party are the real party founded on aspiration. The Liberal Party’s political existence is based on opportunity for an exclusive few and aspiration only for high-income earners. We say this and we say it with conviction: whether you lift a pick, tap away at a keyboard, mind children or sick patients, run a small business or work down a mine, you should receive a fair reward for your efforts.</para>
<para>Let us have a look at fairness; let us shine a light on how skewed these tax cuts are to just 280,000 high-income earners who earn more than $125,00 a year. These are the people Mr Costello believes deserve a tax cut more than 10 times that of the seven million low-and middle-income earners making up to $63,000 a year. The argument of the Liberal government is that high-income earners deserve a tax cut 10 times bigger, and that is not including the abolition of the surcharge tax on superannuation, which I will deal with in some detail when we get to that bill.</para>
<para>The Liberal government thinks it is fair to give 45 per cent, or almost half, of the $22 billion value of the tax cuts to Australian workers earning in the top 10 per cent—one in 10. This is a disproportionate skewing of tax relief of the most extreme kind. Let us put this into perspective, because there is a pattern of behaviour here. As it currently stands, over the nine years since the introduction of the GST to fix what was allegedly a broken tax system—that was the argument at the time—those on $50,000, average weekly earnings, will have received just $10 a week from this government. That is just over $1 a year in tax cuts. Compare that with a high-income earner on $125,000, who will have received almost $120 a week over the same period. This government has been no friend of low- and middle-income earners. As I described earlier, since 1996 only those on significantly more than average weekly earnings have seen their average tax rates fall. Average income earners are paying as much tax as they were in 1996 as a proportion of their wages. Those on half of average earnings are actually paying more tax.</para>
<para>What has happened here has been the gouging of tax through bracket creep from low-and middle-income earners to provide the only real average tax cuts to those earning significantly more than average earnings. To grow the economy we need to give everyone incentive, not just a few. This is such a short-sighted approach from the Liberal-National government.</para>
<para>Labor sees a fairer way forward: the fairer way that we are fighting for and which we have been arguing for over the last few weeks, and which we will continue to fight for as long as we are in this place. The figures I touched on earlier do not include the significant tax cut to high-income earners that is in addition to the income tax cut—that is, the abolition of the surcharge tax on superannuation that will provide a further tax cut of between $35 and $40 a week plus for high-income earners on more than $125,000 a year.</para>
<para>Labor is also proposing a genuine tax reform package that tackles the issue of participation in our economy. Any serious analysis of the government’s budget shows it was not up to the participation challenge. Labor’s tax package is designed to improve participation, particularly for those on lower incomes who are likely to have the strongest behavioural response. Labour market behavioural studies of so-called elasticities suggest that low-income earners are more likely to re-enter the work force or work longer hours when given added incentives. This means reducing effective marginal tax rates among low-income earners and part-time workers. That has a very strong effect on labour market participation and hours worked.</para>
<para>Labor agrees that our highest marginal tax rates need to be more internationally competitive, and our approach reflects that. But we believe the first priority should be sorting out the disincentive problems at the lower end of the scale, because that is what is really dragging down work force participation. The truth is that the government’s half-hearted reforms do not do enough to undo the tangle between tax and social security income tests that combine to produce punishing effective marginal tax rates. Labor’s strategy for addressing high effective marginal tax rates is superior to the government’s strategy.</para>
<para>Because these high MTRs are caused when social security payments are being withdrawn at the same time as tax is being paid, the best way to tackle them is to stop tax and social security income tests doubling up—it is as simple as that. That is why Labor’s alternative proposals lift the effective tax rate threshold to $10,000 over time through the provision of a welfare to work tax bonus, removing tax on an income equivalent to two-thirds of the taper rate of a single-allowance recipient. The other key element of Labor’s proposal is to lift to $26,400 the income threshold where the 30c marginal tax rate cuts in. This would significantly reduce the overlap between the partner allowance income test and the 30c rate, which currently combines to produce unacceptably high effective marginal tax rates for many couples.</para>
<para>A recent example of this problem was highlighted with the decision to increase the minimum wage. Thanks to the Liberal government’s incentive-sapping tax and social security system, for a single-income family with children relying on the minimum wage, $17.65 of the recent $17 per week increase is clawed back in tax and lost social security. The family faces an effective marginal tax rate of 104 per cent. So what does the government do about this problem in the budget? Very little. If the Liberal government adopted Labor’s tax proposals, such families would see their effective marginal tax rate fall from 104 per cent to 70 per cent. Compared to the government’s plan, Labor’s plan would see such families have a near halving in their marginal tax rate, from 30c to 17c. Compared to the government’s plan, the take-home component of the wage increase would be almost 70 per cent higher under Labor’s proposal.</para>
<para>I challenge Liberal-National senators to support Labor’s tax package. It gives families on the minimum wage more incentives and more take-home pay. Labor does not argue that these reforms will solve all the problems at once. The structural reforms necessary will take time. But at least Labor is making a start with its package. These reforms put us a good way down a path on which tax and social security interactions can be untangled and punishingly high effective marginal tax rates can be eliminated or kept to a bare minimum.</para>
<para>Labor has proposed a number of amendments to be moved in the committee stage. I will be dealing with them later. Labor calls on the senators opposite to support a fairer way forward for all those Australia taxpayers who make our economy stronger. From 1 January 2006, the government should lift the effective tax-free threshold for those moving from welfare to work and for other low-income earners by introducing a welfare to work tax bonus that replaces the existing low-income tax offset. Secondly, it should extend the income range where the lowest 17c marginal tax rate applies by raising the threshold where the 30c rate cuts in from $21,600 to $26,400. This will improve incentives for low-income earners to return to work and will deliver a tax cut of $12 per week for low- and middle-income earners.</para>
<para>From 1 July 2006, the government should extend the income range where the 30c marginal tax rate applies by raising the threshold where the 42c rate cuts in from $63,000 to $67,000. This will compensate middle- and high-income earners for the effects of bracket creep and ensure that at least 80 per cent of taxpayers pay a marginal tax rate of 30c in the dollar or less over the forward estimates. The government should also extend the income range where the 42c marginal tax rate applies by lifting the threshold where the 47c rate cuts in from $80,000 to $100,000 per annum. This will improve the international competitiveness of our tax system.</para>
<para>Labor’s proposal is fairer. It takes the prudent approach of waiting until the country is out of the interest rate red zone before the bulk of tax cuts flows through. Even then, Labor’s package aims to fight inflation by offering better incentives to encourage people to move from welfare to work to boost labour supply. The government has not been interested in debating the substance of Labor’s package, and here is why: it offers larger tax cuts to low- and middle-income earners, better incentives to move off benefits and into work, and larger tax cuts on retirees’ investment returns than the government’s package.</para>
<para>Labor will be giving Liberal government members an opportunity to vote for Labor’s fairer alternative. As this debate proceeds, government senators can vote for doubling the tax relief to the considerable majority of constituents on average earnings, or they can vote to ensure that not just high-income earners but they themselves—particularly when we take into account the surcharge—receive a massive tax cut of around $130 per week. In terms of the surcharge tax cut—which I will deal with later in the week—no wonder members of the government stomped their feet and hooted when the Treasurer announced it on budget night!</para>
<para>If government senators oppose Labor’s proposals, Labor will be only too happy to campaign in their home states. Government senators stand to gain $9,200 a year, while average earners will get just $6 a week. Every Liberal and National Party senator should go back to their home state and explain why they will not support Labor’s plan for a $12 a week tax cut for low- and middle-income earners. They will talk about anything else. They will talk about schedules and disallowable instruments. They will make wild claims about tax cuts being delayed and about software providers such as MYOB complaining that users are not sufficiently literate to enter a password and push a button to select alternative schedules. They are all smokescreens to divert attention away from the central issue in the debate—which is why, under the Liberal government, average income earners will gain just $6 a week while those on higher incomes of $125,000 a year or more will gain $65 a week. That is 10 times what is being delivered to low- and middle-income Australians, and that is without the value of the surcharge tax cut, which adds another $35 or $40 a week. In the interests of their constituents, we challenge Liberal and National Party senators either to support Labor’s fairer package or to explain why they believe they should get a tax cut 10 times the size of the tax cut for seven million hardworking Australians—workers on average incomes with aspirations for themselves and their families.</para>
<para>I live on the north-west coast of Tasmania in the electorate of Braddon. I looked at some very interesting figures last week. Some 97 per cent of residents on the north-west coast of Tasmania earn an income of less than $60,000 a year. It is an overwhelmingly low- and middle-income electorate on the north-west coast of Tasmania. I publicly challenge the local Liberal member, Mr Baker. Labor’s proposal is much better in terms of delivering a much more significant tax cut to the overwhelming majority of residents who live on the north-west coast of Tasmania. It is certainly amongst the lowest—if not the lowest—of low- and middle-income electorates in Australia. As an interesting aside, only approximately 500 to 600 people—a relatively small number—on the north-west coast of Tasmania pay the surcharge tax on superannuation.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline> facilitates another redistribution of wealth towards the well off and away from disadvantaged Australians, and also away from public investment in essential services such as protecting the environment and looking after our public health and education services. This government is asking the Senate to waste $26 billion of public funds by frittering it away on a $6 a week tax cut for low- to middle-income earners and an $86 a week tax cut for the wealthy. That is on top of abolishing the superannuation surcharge for high-income earners and cutting business taxation. There is nothing in this budget for the least well off. In fact, the government wants to punish the people who are the least well off and make life harder for poorer Australians with its Welfare to Work policy. The tax cuts in this budget come on top of last year’s $14.7 billion of tax cuts—again, directed at the wealthy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Australian Greens oppose these tax cuts. There is a much better and fairer way to spend these funds. We will be asking the Senate to support our amendment, which calls on the government to redirect these personal income tax cuts into investment in public health, public education and the environment—investment that serves everyone. The government’s decision to waste $26 billion on tax cuts means that $26 billion will no longer be available to spend on these essential services—things such as responding to the crisis facing farming communities. Not two weeks after the Treasurer delivered the budget, a major gathering of drought affected farmers in my home state of New South Wales prompted the government into action. But the Greens say that it was not nearly enough action. The government’s drought relief package that provides an extra $250 million is more bandaid stuff. There is nothing to address the long-term issues and there is nothing to get on with the difficult but essential task of making our land management ecologically and socially sustainable.</para>
<para>One of Australia’s most respected scientists, Peter Cullen of the Wentworth Group—who won the Prime Minister’s Environmentalist of the Year award in 2001—has been trying to gain the attention of political decision makers about the urgency of the task, but they do not seem to be listening. Peter Cullen is calling for Australia to recognise that some land under farming is too marginal for the task and is calling on them to develop a plan to change the way that the land is used. I am hearing increasing calls from farmers who are suggesting that drought relief should be tied to improving land management and that one of the criteria for drought relief should be sustainable land management.</para>
<para>They are proposing that, in cases where farming is not ecologically sustainable, we need to develop plans about how to keep rural communities economically and socially viable. This might involve paying people not to farm but rather to manage the land in a sustainable way for the benefits that it delivers to the environment. This is the kind of project that ought to be receiving government funding, not as an ad hoc payment but as part of strategic planning for a sustainable future on this dry continent to safeguard our ecosystems, our economic development and our prosperity. We have the money. As a nation, we are swimming in it, according to the government, but the Treasurer seems to think that the cash will do more for the nation in the pockets of rich people than by investing in the long-term future of this land and its people.</para>
<para>Treasurer Costello, travelling the country to talk up his budget, made a frank admission when, as quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 17 May, he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… I reckon you would be struggling on $40-50,000 in Australia if you were paying a mortgage and raising some kids.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Treasurer Costello, this amount, which you say you would be struggling on, is almost twice as much as the current federal minimum wage, which your government believes is too high. Last week’s minimum wage case decision by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission took the annual income of some of the lowest paid workers in Australia to $25,188. What does Treasurer Costello’s comment that people are struggling if they are earning between $40,000 and $50,000 say about the people on the federal minimum wage which the government thinks is too high at $25,188?</para>
<para>That minimum wage would be $2,600 less per year if the Australian Industrial Relations Commission had listened to the argument put by the federal government each year about what level the minimum wage should be set at. Those people would be earning around $23,000 a year if the Australian Industrial Relations Commission had listened to the federal government about what the minimum wage should be. If people on $40,000 to $50,000 are struggling, it would be interesting to hear what the Treasurer thinks about the minimum wage that the government wants—$23,000. Would people on that be struggling, Treasurer? So the Treasurer’s apparent concern for battlers is transparent because, when he had the opportunity in this budget and in many before, he decided not to support them. In fact, he decided that, through this budget, he would take from the poor to give to the wealthy.</para>
<para>The Australian Greens also have concerns with other tax reforms that have been put forward in this budget. The Greens opposed the goods and services tax when it was introduced, because it undermined the progressive tax system by levying a flat tax on everyone. Irrespective of your capacity to pay, a flat tax is levied on essential goods and services—electricity, gas, telephone or whatever it may be. This budget further undermines the progressive elements of our taxation system through the personal income tax scales.</para>
<para>Income redistribution is an essential tool of any government in order to be able to redistribute wealth. It is particularly important in Australia. We have a relatively high rate of poverty compared with other OECD countries. The combined cost of tax cuts to high-income earners from the last budget and this budget will be $4.08 billion next financial year and $6.23 billion in 2006-07. Cutting tax for high-income earners is simply unjustified. There are not many more people paying tax at the top two income rates now compared to when the coalition came into government, and only a small proportion of taxpayers earn very high salaries. For example, only two per cent of full-time employees currently earn above $100,000 per annum, and the people in that category—which I am privileged to belong to as a member of parliament—have, like me every year I have been in parliament, been delivered a tax cut by the budget. I do not need that tax cut. We do not need that tax cut. The Australian community and our public services need that investment and that money committed there.</para>
<para>As we know, high-income earners already have a large number of legal avenues available to them for reducing their income tax—things like channelling it through company structures on which the tax rate is only 30 per cent; income splitting, including through family trusts; and salary sacrificing for superannuation and executive shares. The Australian Council of Social Service, ACOSS, estimates that the annual cost to the federal government of these measures is $6 billion. That is $6 billion that could be saved by closing these loopholes for high-income earners and could be invested into our essential public services. However, the government chooses to leave that $6 billion open as opportunities for income for high-income earners rather than investing it in our community and public services.</para>
<para>Wealthy people can often also artificially lower their incomes through negative gearing and dividend imputation, which means that their gross income is not an accurate guide to their final tax bill. Wealthy people also often qualify for a range of government benefits, like the proposed child-care rebate, the private health insurance rebate, the government’s superannuation co-contribution for low-income spouses or partners, and family tax benefit part B, which is not means tested on household income. All these government benefits, as well as tax cuts, are available to those who are well off.</para>
<para> Despite all the claims that Australia’s tax system is driving people out of the country, Australia’s top marginal tax rate is not particularly high when compared with that in many other OECD countries. In France, the top marginal personal income tax rate is 42.62 per cent, in Germany and Italy it is 45 per cent, and in the United Kingdom it is 40 per cent. Australia’s total tax take is low compared with that in other OECD countries, and so is our total income tax take as a percentage of gross average wage earnings. For example, in Australia in 2002 it equalled 24 per cent, compared with 43 per cent in Denmark, 41 per cent in Germany and Belgium, and 30 per cent in Sweden.</para>
<para>While the measures in this bill benefit the wealthy at a cost to national wellbeing, they also deprive the Commonwealth of funds that it could use to do things like alleviate poverty. According to NATSEM, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, poverty affects almost two million Australians. In a report on income inequality that was released after the budget, the St Vincent de Paul Society presents a stark picture of the growing disparity in incomes between the highest and lowest earners and the continuing failure to reverse the trend. Between 1994-95 and 2002-03, private household income for the bottom 10 per cent of Australians rose by just $26 a week, but for the top 10 per cent it rose by $762 a week. That is a difference of $736 a week depending on which end of the income bracket you are in. As the report by St Vincent de Paul notes, inequality of income is the open door to inequality in access to health services, housing, education, transport—</para>

<para>—My question is directed to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Can the minister confirm whether her departmental officials contacted the Chinese embassy or consulate in relation to a request for political asylum they had just received from a Chinese diplomat, Mr Chen Yonglin? Wasn’t Mr Chen’s request for protection based on Mr Chen’s fears for his own and his family’s safety if the Chinese government were to be alerted to his application? Why then did the minister’s department put Mr Chen’s future at risk by contacting the consulate to verify his identity and diplomatic status? Can the minister confirm that this departmental disclosure immediately prompted the consulate to call Mr Chen’s mobile phone while he was still in the immigration office making his application for protection? Does the minister believe that her department has properly carried out its responsibilities in dealing with Mr Chen’s application for protection?</para>

</talker>
<para>—I thank Senator Chapman for his question on an issue which I know all Australians are deeply concerned about. Australians have, in overwhelming numbers, supported the actions of those nations, including Australia, who seek to bring about an end to whaling. Not everyone will remember that Senator Chapman, in a previous Liberal government, was at the forefront of efforts to encourage former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to take a leadership role in bringing in the moratorium on whaling.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The question relates to how we have gone about seeking to improve the position of pro-conservation nations within the International Whaling Commission. That commission will meet in Korea in a few days time. I will be leading the delegation to what is the 57th meeting of that commission. There is no doubt that, based on advice from my depart-ment and from other countries around the world, for the first time in many years there is a risk of there being a majority of pro-whaling countries within that commission. That of course would be a tragedy for the world. It would be a tragedy for generations of Australians—in both political parties, I might add.</para>
<para>Under both Mr Whitlam and Mr Fraser there was a bipartisan approach to try to stop whaling, and that has continued. With a vote on what is called the revised management scheme—basically a plan on how to go about whaling and how to reopen commercial whaling—for the first time in many years there is a risk that there will be a majority in favour of whaling. I have been working to try and stop that occurring since July last year, when I was appointed as minister. We have not only been working with like-minded countries but also approaching countries that are not members of the International Whaling Commission and that we believe share our strong whale conservation stance to join the commission.</para>
<para>In the last fortnight I also embarked on a trip to 11 countries—all but one of which are members of the IWC—to try to get more support for the Australian position. I can report that we did receive some encouraging feedback both in Europe and in the Pacific during my trip. The importance of the visit was to ensure that, rather than just relying on the whaling commissioners—who quite often in the past have not always voted in the way their cabinets may have chosen that they do—we raised the issue to the highest levels of government, both in Europe and in the Pacific. I was very pleased to see, for example, the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands joining me at a press conference to commit that his cabinet would support Australia’s opposition to scientific whaling and would abstain from the vote on reopening commercial whaling.</para>
<para>As to the other things we have done—and Senator Chapman would be very interested in this—the Prime Minister has written to his opposite number in Japan and I have written to all of the like-minded nations throughout the IWC. There has also been a campaign across Australia, with lord mayors writing to sister cities. I note that this has occurred right across Australia. Senator Gary Humphries wrote to the mayor of his sister city in Japan. Also writing were the mayors of Redcliffe in Queensland and of Port Stephens in New South Wales. Today I got a letter from the Mayor of Fremantle, Peter Tagliaferri, who has written to his opposite number. The only person who seems to be a bit out of step on this is one local member. I think it is the member for Brand. Instead of sending a letter to Japan, he decided to get his constituents to write to me. Could I remind the constituents of Brand that I am opposed to whaling and that, if Mr Beazley wants to help, he should write to the Japanese and not to me. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Why was Mr Chen’s request for asylum not treated as a bona fide request to be dealt with according to law? When was the minister advised of Minister Downer’s rejection of Mr Chen’s initial application for protection? Can the minister advise whether this ministerial decision was made within 24 hours of the application? What was the reason for that rejection? Why was Mr Chen being told to apply for other forms of visa whilst also being told that the prospects of success were extremely unlikely? Where exactly is the departmental consideration of Mr Chen’s applications up to now?</para>

<para>—This is a very serious matter and I am satisfied that it has been handled in an appropriate way, but clearly the opposition are not. One would have thought that if they wanted the answer they would wait and listen to the answer. I am not satisfied of that assertion. DIMIA would not be in a position to offer advice on the likely outcome of any visa because it may be the decision maker, so DIMIA has not offered advice with respect to likely outcomes. Some advice was offered as to what opportunities there were to stay in Australia. Any questions in relation to DFAT advice should be addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</para>

<para>—It is not at all the case that this has been handled inappropriately—quite the opposite. I am aware that some people would like to make the case that that has happened, but I reject that assertion. I particularly reject an allegation being put into a question that sensitive information has been disclosed to a government from which someone is seeking protection. The answer to that was given in an earlier question. It has been out in the public domain since 8 June and there is very little a government can do, other than respond to allegations in the media by putting out a statement and making clear what happened on that day. I can help you, Senator, if you want to have it repeated. Mr Chen claimed to be an official and he was advised that the officer proposed—I draw your attention to the earlier <inline font-style="italic">Hansard. (Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The Australian government announced an additional 20,000 places for skilled migrants in the upcoming financial year 2005-06, meaning that the skilled migration program will jump from around 70,000 to just over 90,000. This is the largest increase in history and it will bring the number of places available for skilled migrants to nearly 100,000—it is about 97,000. That is a very important point to reflect on: the largest ever increase in skilled immigration.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Why are we able to do that? Because we have an economy that is continually growing, we have brought down the appalling unemployment rate that existed under the previous government. Under the previous government you did not have to worry too much about skilled immigration because the previous government put skilled workers out of jobs. If you were running a company, all you had to do was put an ad in the paper and have a look around. There would be plenty of skilled workers that Labor had put out of jobs—plenty. So you did not need to worry, because when you had a million unemployed you could find a skilled person for your factory any time you wanted. That was the way Labor managed skilled tradespeople in this country: it put them out of work. A million people were out of work.</para>
<para>So now we are very pleased to have a situation where the unemployment rate has been brought down. Employers now find it more challenging to find the people they need. It is now a situation where people looking for work have much greater confidence that they will be able to get a job. The tables have turned, because now the workers of Australia can be picky and choosy about where they go to work. Under Labor, the irony was that the employers could be picky and choosy about whom they took on. We have given Australian workers the power to be picky and choosy about where they go to work. That is the real irony: the party that says it is here to protect the workers put them out of jobs and gave employers the greatest opportunity to just take whom they wanted off the streets. It is this party—it is not the first recognised as the party for workers—that has been the best supporter of battling workers in Australia that this country has ever seen, because it has given them jobs and created a situation where they can now pick and choose where they go to work.</para>
<para>Senator, in relation to your question, I am very pleased with this substantial increase in immigration because it shows that we are a well-run government, we have a well-run country and we can afford to grow and bring more people in, which in turn will make the economy stronger and provide even more jobs for Australians. We hope that this increase will come from three particular focal areas. Firstly, it will come from working with employers to make sure they understand that they can sponsor people to come. The person who knows best the skills they need in their factory or their office is the employer. Secondly, we plan to expand the use of state and territory sponsored visas, because states, territories and regional areas understand what development is coming on in their area and they understand what skills they will need. We have given them the capacity to have some say in whom we bring into Australia. Thirdly, there will be an increase in the general skilled migration pool so that smaller businesses that do not have a human resource department and other capacity will be able to benefit from this increase. In summary, I am very proud to be part of a government that has given the workers of Australia the opportunity to be in a situation where they pick and choose whom they work for, and I am proud to be in a country where we want to bring in more skilled workers.</para>

<para>—My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. My question concerns the explosive allegations levelled last night by a DIMIA whistleblower. Can the minister confirm that officials from Queensland Health, police and corrective services have already stated that they are unable to testify before the Palmer inquiry due to a lack of basic judicial protections? Is the minister also aware that the <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> whistleblower, known only as ‘Jamie’, is too afraid to give evidence to Mr Palmer or to Mr Comrie because he fears retribution and that he has alleged that departmental officers have already been moved out of sensitive areas so they cannot be called before the inquiry? Is it time that the minister admitted that the closed-door Palmer inquiry is an abject failure with no powers to protect witnesses or to compel testimony from responsible officers who have been hidden elsewhere in the department? Is it not now time for the minister to have a royal commission?</para>

<para>—I am aware of the <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> program that was run last night with allegations from an alleged whistleblower within the department. I have had a quick look at the transcript of that program. There is some history here that might be relevant. <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline>, in an earlier program, alleged that they had a whistleblower who was not, at that point, identified. In that program, I indicated that if anyone—in the department, particularly, but also outside—had concerns, they should raise them firstly with the secretary of the department or, if they were not happy with that, with their minister. That piece was put to air by <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline>. The following question from <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> was: ‘and would you agree to see someone if they approached you?’ The automatic and immediate answer was yes. <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> editors can answer why they chose not to run that portion of the program. I do not know whether the person interviewed last night saw that and why they have chosen to go to the media as opposed to going where any public servant should go first—that is, to their secretary or, if not, to their minister. But, in any event, I am aware of the allegations by one person.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The previous person who made allegations turned out to be no longer employed by DIMIA, and I thought the previous set of allegations were quite easily answered. I will have a close look, when I get a minute, at what this person has had to say and see if there is anything I can do with it. As to who has and has not been approached by the Palmer inquiry, that is a matter for Mr Palmer to comment on. I simply make the point that at the moment Ms Rau is in a mental health facility in South Australia and getting all the appropriate support that she needs. Calls, from Queensland in particular, for a public inquiry are somewhat puzzling in light of the Queensland government’s response to the death of Mr Doomadgee.</para>

<para>—I want to ask a question about a matter that has been of concern to me for the last 30 years, and it is to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone. Is it a fact that there are now four Chinese dissidents reported to be seeking asylum in Australia? How many other dissidents is the government aware of who are seeking asylum in Australia? How will the government assist them to escape persecution in China, or does the government believe the words uttered by the Chinese ambassador that no harm will come to these people? How will the government ensure that no other dissidents will be betrayed to the Chinese government?</para>

<para>—Senator Harradine, I will answer your question as best I possibly can without going into the detail of the caseload. You would understand—albeit I do not think the opposition do, and I certainly do not think the media do—that it is simply not appropriate when someone has made a request for protection for all the details of that to be bandied about publicly. There are very good reasons for that. Nonetheless, I can give you some general advice that you might find helpful.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>DIMIA receive about 3,000 applications for protection visas every year from a range of nationalities. It is not new to receive protection visa applications from PRC nationals. We might have 700, 900 or 1,000 in any one year. So, quite the opposite to the media drama of this being particularly unusual, we have quite a lot of protection claims from China. Every protection visa is assessed on its individual merits and takes into account up-to-date country information. On the advice I have, about five or six per cent of the applications are successful in the end, and by that I mean taking primary and review decisions into account. What I am trying to convey is that the government does not accept the proposition that everyone who applies for protection should get it; nor does it take the proposition that everyone who applies should not get it. Each case is dealt with—as it ought to be—individually on its merits.</para>

<para>—Senator Harradine, I understood that you were not referring to ones that were specifically economic; neither was I. The figures I gave you relate to general applications for refugee protection visas. I certainly do not have at this point available to me a breakdown within each country—or, for that matter, across the board—as to the basis of each claim. Each claim is considered individually. I do not have summary information—it may be available, but I certainly do not have it at this point—as to the types of claims that are made. It is a regrettable development in immigration law that there are people who put in a protection visa claim for the purpose of staying in Australia longer, while their claim is heard.</para>

<para>—My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Is the minister aware of a branch briefing by senior Immigration official Karen Stanley held in Brisbane on 8 June 2005, at which some 100 staff were in attendance? Can the minister confirm that the following advice was given by Ms Stanley, the Queensland state manager, at that meeting? She advised: (1) to ignore the existing legislation as it is too slow to change; (2) policy is being rewritten as fast as it can but in the meantime, even though we can legally refuse a visa, we should now ask ourselves to consider if it is the right decision; (3) the staff were invited to imagine that they are Amanda and the client is Kerry O’Brien, and Kerry is concerned not about the law but only about the rightness of the decision; and (4) to prioritise handling of cases according to media potential. Did the minister herself authorise the issue of any such or similar directives to DIMIA staff to ignore their own legislation or did the authorisation come from her office?</para>

</talker>
<para>—I thank Senator Fifield for that good question on tax and I acknowledge his very keen interest in lowering the tax burden on ordinary Australians. It is good to get a question on tax. We thought that Labor were coming in here breathing fire and brimstone to talk about tax and to make that the big issue of the week. We have had five Labor questions today and not one mention of income tax. It shows how important that issue is to the Labor Party.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Unlike Labor, we are very keen on lowering the tax burden on all Australians. Since the year 2000 we have announced four instalments of personal income tax cuts for Australians. The effect of these cuts has been to reduce the tax paid by Australians on incomes of $10,000 by 53 per cent, of $20,000 by 33 per cent, of $40,000 by 20 per cent, of $50,000 by 23 per cent and of $80,000 by 25 per cent. They are substantial cuts and they are skewed to those on low incomes. Those cuts are complemented by the rise in real wages under this government, unlike under Labor. This gives a very big rise in real disposable income for Australians. A single person on average weekly earnings will have received a 21 per cent improvement in real disposable income in the 10 years from 1996 to 1997. That sort of rise in real disposable income applies right through the income-earning profile of ordinary Australians.</para>
<para>Those figures do take into account the tax cuts that we announced in the 2005-06 budget. The tax cuts we announced in the 2005-06 budget will be delivered. But, of course, despite the inevitability of those tax cuts coming into effect, the Labor Party have spent the last five weeks since the budget creating total and utter confusion not only amongst themselves, of course, but also amongst ordinary Australians and for Australian businesses, which do not know what sort of tax they should deduct from their workers’ incomes on 1 July. It has prevented the tax commissioner from sending out the schedules to employers. So 850,000 Australian businesses have been in a state of total confusion—like the Labor Party’s state of confusion—about how much tax they deduct on 1 July.</para>
<para>Mr Beazley has been all over the place. He has refused to tell us what his position is on the tax schedules. He will not say anything about his position until the legislation is debated. Everybody knows that this is a completely absurd position. The press gallery knows it, the Labor Party know it and all Australians know it. It is apparently all right for other senators in this place to state a position on the schedules, but it is apparently not all right for the Labor Party. We have seen statements from Senator Harris and from the Australian Greens, and today we have had a position from the Australian Democrats, making it clear and making a decision that they will not vote to disallow these tax schedules. But apparently not the Labor Party—they are resolutely irresolute on the question of what to do about the tax schedules. They cannot make up their minds. They have agonised for weeks and weeks, not knowing what to do. Around this place, it is known as the cock-up in the lock-up. After that cock-up, the Labor Party have been reduced to total irrelevance on this question.</para>
<para>Five weeks of bluster and bluff from Mr Beazley and five weeks of uncertainty for employers have amounted to absolutely nothing. Their farcical position on this issue just shows how unfit the Labor Party are to govern. This is one of the all-time great own goals in the history of Australian politics. The Labor Party know that they are entitled to announce a different position. They could have announced that on budget night and then got out of the way and let ordinary Australians have their tax cuts, which they will now get on 1 July.</para>

<para>—My question is directed to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. My question again concerns the allegations aired last night by the DIMIA whistleblower.

In particular, it says:</para>

<para>—I thank the senator for the question. Senator, you will be aware that, under the previous government, there were hundreds and hundreds of children in detention centres. Under the previous government, as you will be aware, there were no residential housing projects. This government take the view that it is not anywhere near ideal and we do not want to see children in detention. It is one of the last things we would like to see. But we do not want to separate children from parents and equally we do not want to say to families that, if they come with children, they will be out scot-free. So there is a difficult balance to be found. It is a very difficult balance. I do not think it is appropriate to release children into some sort of care without their parents.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What the government have done has been to work quite assiduously at providing a midway mark—that is, the housing project and other forms of alternative detention where there are families with children. We have consistently done that. As a matter of fact, we have at the moment 23 children in alternative detention arrangements. That would be in the housing project or in community based alternative detention arrangements, including foster care. There are six kids on Christmas Island and 29 in the mainland immigration detention centres. Of those 29, 27 were detained as a consequence of compliance action and are therefore not expected to be there as long as others would be. Two were unauthorised air arrivals. There are no unaccompanied minors in Australian immigration detention centres, which is a record that Labor cannot say they were ever able to achieve.</para>
<para>Having said that, we are always looking to find better ways to do things, and one of those is to maintain the very strong border protection policies that we implemented. We had thousands of people coming unannounced. For example, in the first three weeks of August 2001 we had over 1,000 people arrive—1,200 people in the first three weeks of August 2001. We are very proud of the fact that we stopped those boats coming—very proud—and we are not backing down on those policies at all. But we are constantly looking for ways to soften the individual impact and we will continue to do that.</para>
<para>As to the mental health aspects, this issue got some coverage over the estimates period. I refer you to the, I think, opening statement made by Mr Palmer, and to some of the transcript of the estimates <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, where you will see some changes that are already under way, which I presume you would welcome.</para>

<para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for her answer and acknowledge that she did finally get to the essential part of the question regarding mental health. But the question went to the statements made last night. My supplementary question is this: how is it that the minister’s department could have known that this was an issue of concern back in 2002, as is evidenced by the HREOC report, and yet the then minister publicly denied that mental health problems were widespread among the detainee population? Is not the real problem here that the government’s attitude, as evidenced by the then minister’s comment on the HREOC report, is one of sheer arrogance and denial? Why is it that the children still continue to suffer and be exposed to serious risk of mental health problems developing?</para>

I assumed he was here for all of question time and had heard me say that I would look at those, but that what I had seen at this point, prior to question time, was pretty generalised complaints. They are very hard, of course, to disprove, so they are easy allegations to make.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But let make this clear. There have been disagreements about mental health issues; there is no doubt about that. But I will not allow the proposition to be put that the department or the government has not cared about mental health issues. We have had differences of opinion about them. That is what has happened. The senator puts a proposition that because the government does not agree with one argument that is put that therefore it does not care. That is simply not a useful or correct proposition to put.</para>

<para>—My question is to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan. Telstra’s new CEO, Solomon Trujillo is reported today as saying he will take an aggressive stance against increased regulation, and that competition was not the answer to meet the needs of end users. Does the minister agree with Mr Trujillo’s assessment, particularly given that phone costs are much lower in the US, where there is more competition and a regulator with a lot more teeth than in Australia? Will his comments deter the government from tightening the regulatory regime and promoting more competition? Was the minister or Minister Minchin, on behalf of the majority shareholder, the Australian public, consulted prior to Mr Trujillo’s appointment and made aware of his views?</para>

</talker>
<para>—Thank you to Senator Cherry for what will probably be your last question—I will miss you. The answer is that of course the government was consulted on the appointment of Mr Trujillo. It would not be appropriate to discuss entirely the substance of what the communications were, but obviously there is an obligation under the act to consult the shareholder ministers, and we were so consulted.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As to Mr Trujillo’s views, I can say that the government has welcomed the appointment of such an outstanding CEO as Mr Trujillo to take the helm of Telstra, at a time when the government is considering whether or not to proceed with the sale of the remainder of the government’s interest in Telstra. As we have said, we will do so subject to conditions which include the adequacy of services in rural and regional Australia, value for taxpayers and, of course, legislation passing the Senate giving the authority to so proceed. As Senator Cherry would be aware, as part of the government considering the regulatory environment that ought to accompany the telecommunications industry more broadly—whether or not Telstra is sold—we have instigated a paper, an inquiry and a review into the regulatory environment and what adjustments may be necessary to ensure that there is competition and adequate incentives for investment going forward.</para>
<para>So the government’s position on competition is clear. We have in place a process to get the review organised. We think that competition is important, and the chairman of Telstra has the same view that it is appropriate that there be some transparency between Telstra’s retail and wholesale operations. That is a matter of agreement. So far as I have been able to tell from Mr Trujillo’s comments, there is certainly nothing at odds with the government’s position on the competitive environment relating to Telstra and, indeed, to other competitors. There certainly seems to have been, in what has been put to Mr Trujillo in some of the interviews that I have seen, some confusion on the part of those who put questions to him about whether they are talking about full structural separation, functional separation or operational separation. Mr Trujillo would understand very well the critical difference with full structural separation. That is what he has resisted and, in fact, he has suggested and asserted that that could hardly be in Telstra’s interests. So, in the context of those comments—admittedly we have not yet had an opportunity to really thrash these matters out with Mr Trujillo—I do not see that there is any great distance between his view of what is necessary for a competitive regime and the way in which the government would see it as appropriate to conduct the review on competition regulation and to get the very best telecommunication environment for Australia going forward.</para>

It is an entirely speculative question, but let me say that the government has always been very clear. Our policy has been clear for a number of years that, subject to all the conditions being met that the government has articulated consistently—certainly since I have been in the portfolio it has been consistently said—the government would consider whether or not to proceed with the full sale of Telstra. I do not think I need to repeat them again, because I elucidated them in my initial answer to Senator Cherry. So in those circumstances it is entirely speculative, and I am not going to engage in speculation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—If we do have the opportunity to implement our policy, the great thing about it is that there will be proceeds. Instead of having some $30 billion tied up in a telephone company, there will be proceeds which can be better deployed and put to better use for the Australian people. We have said that we will establish a Future Fund to ensure that we can, as a government and as a people, ensure that the unfunded superannuation liabilities, which this government has inherited after 100 years of public sector employment, can be met from that Future Fund.</para>
</talk.start>

<para>We have indicated a disposition to have the proceeds of the Telstra sale go into the Future Fund. I think the Treasurer on budget night did not indicate his personal view that the Telstra proceeds should all go into the Future Fund. The government has not as yet made any formal decision on that matter, because as yet there are no proceeds. The Labor Party should finally get mugged by reality, accept the reality that the government should not continue to own over 50 per cent of Australia’s major corporation and that it is ridiculous for the government to have some $30 billion tied up in a telephone company—</para>

<para>—For all the bluster about the Labor Party being committed to economic reform and setting Australia up for the 21st century, it should abandon its socialist objective and recognise that the government should not own half of Australia’s major corporation. This is an idiotic position which most left-wing governments around the world have abandoned and which we want to abandon. We hope the Senate will in due course give the government the authority to proceed with the sale. When we have that legislative authority we will then make a decision as to whether the circumstances are right for us to proceed to a sale. Once we have a sale and sale proceeds we will then make a formal decision about the direction in which those proceeds should go. It is certainly our disposition that the proceeds should go to the Future Fund.</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Barnett very much for that question. Since the Senate last met we have launched the Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement. Senator Barnett and his Liberal colleagues from Tasmania were instrumental in getting that very good outcome for the Tasmanian people and for the Tasmanian environment.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>That program will achieve sustainable forestry and it will support jobs and workers in country communities. The $250 million package will provide for a total of one million hectares in old-growth forest reserves. That is 100 million trees in reserves in Tasmania. That puts the lie on the campaign of the Greens which suggests that there are only a few old-growth trees left—there will be 100 million trees reserved in Tasmania. The package also provides money for upgrading mills and ensuring that workers in Tasmania do have jobs into the future. Those jobs will be throughout the whole of the state of Tasmania and really do demonstrate that the Howard government is interested in workers’ jobs.</para>
<para>I know Senator Barnett was interested in any possible alternative policies that might be around. I am pleased to say that the opposition leader, Mr Beazley, has dumped the policy of his predecessor Mr Latham and has supported the Howard government’s program in Tasmania. Of course, Mr Beazley flip-flops so much you do not know what his policy is likely to be next week, but at least today he does support it.</para>
<para>I am aware that other Labor leaders do not share the Howard government’s interest in workers’ jobs. For example, in my own home state of Queensland the Labor premier, Mr Beattie, is in the process of shutting down the western hardwood industry at a cost of some 300 unionists’ jobs. To overcome that he has promised to create 50 new jobs in the Queensland Environmental Protection Agency to make up for the 300 unionists who will be sacked as a result of his forest policies in Queensland. In New South Wales, the Labor premier is shutting down the forestry industry in the Brigalow region, which will cost 472 jobs. In Victoria, the Labor premier, Mr Bracks, is shutting down production forests and causing problems with jobs.</para>
<para>I expect the Greens have different policies. They understand that as the Howard government attends to all of these significant environmental problems their backing and the cash that supports them will fade away. They unsuccessfully try to create issues artificially, but they realise now that the Howard government is the real government of the environment.</para>
<para>Finally, I suggest to the Labor senators that they might warn their state colleagues about abandoning workers. Mr Latham abandoned the workers in Tasmania and look what happened to him. The Labor senators would be doing the state premiers a favour if they reminded the state premiers of what happens to a Labor party when it rejects the workers of the nation and disregards entirely the jobs and the communities that depend upon those jobs in country Australia.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked today relating to immigration.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">While the government seems to have the view that there is no issue here, all Australians are concerned about the administration of the immigration department and the minister’s performance. Today was another example of the minister not being on top of what is going on in her own department, unable to provide answers to the most basic questions about a Chinese citizen, Mr Chen, who sought political or territorial asylum in this country.</para>
<para>The minister was unable to offer us any information, despite four or five questions on these issues, other than to refer us to a week-old press release put out by her department. That is the extent of her grasp—that is the extent of her knowledge of these matters and the extent to which she has informed herself about Mr Chen’s plight. The best she can do is read a week-old press release from the department in which it seeks to defend itself against accusations he has made about his treatment.</para>
<para>It is not good enough. It was not good enough for Ms Rau, it was not good enough for Ms Alvarez-Solon and it is certainly not good enough for Mr Chen. This is a minister who has totally lost control of her portfolio and a department that seems to have no idea of what the right thing to do is. We have had no explanation today—no detail and no answers to the legitimate questions about why a person in fear of his life and the life of his family was not granted political asylum and was not assisted.</para>
<para>Instead, what we got was an explanation which beggared belief. The explanation was, ‘Mr Chen did come into the DIMIA office. He did come in to have a chat with us. We didn’t know why he was there, but we rang up the Chinese consulate and discussed who he was with them.’ Mr Chen has produced a letter which is headed, ‘Seeking political asylum in Australia.’ We know he gave that to DIMIA at some stage, but DIMIA and the minister would have us believe that they did not know why this chap popped in. He popped in, he introduced himself and what do they do? Give the Chinese consulate a call and have a chat about him! DIMIA did not know why he was there but they gave the Chinese consulate a call. This is a man who is seeking political asylum because he fears for his life. We hear from Mr Chen in fact that within minutes he received a call on his mobile, while still in the immigration department’s offices.</para>
<para>What is the explanation for this? None. What answers can the minister provide? None. The minister was asked whether or not DIMIA were in fact in breach of the Migration Act, which provides protection for people seeking political asylum—section 336F of the Migration Act prohibits disclosure of information identifying an applicant to the foreign government from whom protection is sought. It is pretty straightforward: if you are looking to get political asylum, the Migration Act says you have got certain protections. But what does DIMIA do? On the face of it, it rings up the Chinese consulate and says, ‘We’ve got this bloke here. Is he really one of yours?’</para>

<para>—That is what he says happened; that is what the minister said happened today: ‘We didn’t know why he was there but we just gave them a call and mentioned that this bloke was here.’ Mr Downer, when asked, said, ‘He didn’t really formally apply for political asylum; he didn’t fill in the form.’ There is no form. He produced a letter seeking political asylum and Mr Downer tried to say he didn’t fill in the proper form. What we now know is that there is no form.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>What he did was to seek protection and asylum from persecution and this government ignored him and tried to fob him off. They rang the Chinese consulate. That is not good enough, and the minister’s explanation today was not good enough. Something is deeply wrong inside that department and something is deeply wrong with her administration of that department. Mr Chen’s case is just another example. I understand that in the other place today Mr Downer admitted to a conversation with the Chinese ambassador about Mr Chen’s case. This will come out; we will get to the bottom of this. This government is arrogantly refusing to answer questions about how they have dealt with this man, a man who was in fear of his life and the life of his family. It is not good enough. It is not good enough for the minister to come in and try to close the asking of questions by simply referring to a week-old press release from her department. She has to be more accountable to this parliament.</para>
<para>There was no accountability today. What we are seeing is arrogance creeping into this government. They are not prepared to provide details as to why this man was fobbed off or why this man had DIMIA ring the consulate and effectively alert them to the fact that he was seeking asylum. These are serious issues that go to someone’s liberty and life. They are serious issues that deserve answers. Whether Mr Chen’s story is 100 per cent right, I do not know. But what we know from the minister today is that she is unable to provide an alternative version. She did not come clean. She read a week-old press release. That is not good enough. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—It is not coincidental that we are participating in this take note debate at the end of question time while at the same time we in this place and those in the other place are debating the merit of the government’s <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline>. This take note debate today is a political debate, as have been all the other debates initiated in this place on this issue by senators opposite. This debate, like all the other debates, is about getting the minister. The opposition is obsessively pursuing a witch-hunt against a minister who fulfils her responsibilities in a diligent and effective manner.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is a debate that seeks to divert attention away from Labor’s dismal policy and leadership failures in the vital area of taxation, and to particularly divert attention away from the government’s reduction of the taxes that are levied on all Australians. That is what this debate is all about, as was the similar debate a week or two ago. The main reason why we are having this debate today is to divert attention from the Labor Party’s shameless and ignorant attitude and position in relation to the government’s tax cuts. Australians are not fooled by debates such as this.</para>
<para>Today the opposition raised several issues relating to Minister Vanstone’s administration of her department, including, among others, claims by a current Immigration officer on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> on Monday, 13 June 2005 and the handling of an asylum claim of a Chinese national. We just heard the leader of the Labor Party in this place talk about the minister not providing answers to questions asked of her. I listened very carefully to what the minister had to say in here today and, in relation to the claims made by a current Immigration officer on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> last night, there were several salient points which can and should be made and which obviously the leader of the Labor Party in this place missed taking note of.</para>
<para>The minister said today that if any officer within the department had any specific issues of concern, or still has specific issues of concern that they would like to make known, she is always available to see them and listen to them. We know that. Members opposite, including the leader of the Labor Party in this place, certainly know that. Anonymous claims, as the minister said, are obviously open to interpretation. Claims should not be made anonymously, particularly when the minister’s door is open.</para>
<para>Having said this, Australia’s asylum processes are world class. Claims of bias against unauthorised arrivals just do not stand up to even the most superficial scrutiny. It should be noted—and I know that all reasonable Australians will note this—that of the 10,000 unauthorised boat arrivals seeking protection since 1999, almost 80 per cent have been granted protection in the first instance by the minister’s department. Given this record, it is hard to see how claims of bias stand up. I respectfully suggest to honourable senators opposite that it is a matter for praise not criticism that the department was able to cope with the sheer number of unauthorised boat arrivals between 1999 and 2001.</para>
<para>In relation to the handling of the asylum claim by the Chinese national, the minister has also made several very relevant points which again senators opposite seek to ignore. But it is worth again going on the record very clearly and very precisely with what happened. This person’s visa application is being processed on its merits in the normal manner, although I stress here that it has priority. The circumstances demand that it be handled as a priority. Mr Chen was provided with a briefing on his visa options before he lodged a protection visa application with the department on Friday, 3 June 2005. That is a matter of public record. He was contacted by DIMIA early in the following week and offered the opportunity for a protection visa interview to be held later that week. At his request—and I stress that this was at his request—this interview has been rescheduled for a date acceptable to him, as he and his representative wanted more time to prepare his case. That again is a matter of public record which honourable senators opposite seek to ignore.</para>
<para>Much has been made of the minister’s reference to the media release. But it is a matter of public record that the department issued a press release making it clear that contact with the PRC consulate was short and that it only confirmed that the person in question worked with the consulate. It did not disclose any information about that person’s whereabouts or intentions. Again, honourable senators opposite ignore that. His position and his status were in no way compromised. The fact that he was seeking protection was not known to the department at the time, so how could they pass on any information to that effect? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—What we have heard today from Senator Vanstone only confirms for the opposition that the department and the minister responsible for it should discontinue the view that the Palmer inquiry is a fix-all. It is not. It is not going to produce the results. The minister continues to hide behind the fact that the Palmer inquiry will provide an answer to all of the woes that currently beset the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Yet all we have had from the case of Rau onwards is mistake after mistake. These mistakes even go to areas which hitherto we would not have considered. We look at the Chen matter and we find another episode of DIMIA bungling administered by the minister.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>More information entered the public arena through ‘Jamie’ on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> last night, when it came to light that people are not going to come forward to the Palmer inquiry. People are concerned about the way that they may be treated as a consequence of putting their hand up and saying, ‘I’ve got information that may assist. I’ve got information that may expose how the department of immigration actually works’—not how it should work or could work. Instead, we have people—and I suspect that there are more than simply the person on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> last night—who are too concerned, too afraid to demonstrate who they are and what the actual issues are because of the retribution that may be visited upon them. That is a culture within the department administered by the minister. It is not a culture that has just grown up without both former Minister Ruddock and now Minister Vanstone having anything to do with it. They are not in a position to be able to divorce themselves from the truth. The truth is that the department of immigration has gone downhill under their control and under their watch and something needs to be done—not something such as the Palmer inquiry, where Mr Palmer, for all his good intentions, is going to leave after the Rau case, as we understand it. We then find that Mr Comrie is going to take up the cudgels in relation to some 200 other cases that might need to be investigated, including the case of Ms Solon.</para>
<para>We need the minister to come into the chamber, to cut through all of this and to indicate that a royal commission is the only way that these issues will be dealt with, and dealt with in a serious and profound manner once and for all. Otherwise what we will face is this issue continuing to bubble through and other people coming forward and saying, ‘I was a bit concerned about making this known during the Palmer inquiry and I have more to add.’ Today Gerard Henderson, former chief of staff to John Howard, had this to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is one matter for department officers to be given such powers of assessment, detention and deportation—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">and, as an aside, very serious powers. Mr Henderson continued:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is quite another matter when it is accepted by the minister that the same officers have a cultural problem with the way in which they handle asylum and migration issues.</para>
<para class="block">The deauthorised department cannot be reformed without radical and all embracing change. In the meantime, victims of its deficient culture should have their cases reviewed by someone not in the need of “cultural change”.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That means that a royal commission is the only way that we are going to be presented with what actually happened, how it happened, what happened and when it happened, and not the farce we have at present, whereby Mr Palmer will hand down his full and complete report to the secretary of the very department that he is inquiring into. We may never know all of the issues that are ventilated in the report. The minister has not given us a guarantee that the report will be made public. It is a convenient way and it is a sleight of hand means of saying: ‘This is what we will do. We will get the report and we will consider what we will release. We will consider the recommendations.’ It is a filter. That is what the minister has in fact said she will do.</para>
<para>What we do not know is when the Palmer inquiry will finalise its report and for how long it will sit on the minister’s desk. Will she then sit on it until next Friday and release it at the end of this session of parliament so that we do not have an opportunity of seeing it? That is the usual course that this government would take and someone on that side should put a stop to it. We already heard that Mr Georgiou is not going to put up with it. He has not reached an agreement with the Howard government. He thinks the department of immigration is still in need of a fix-it job and he is going to introduce his bill today as well. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The government and Minister Vanstone have responded promptly and appropriately to the request of Mr Chen, the Chinese national, for safety and protection. Mr Chen’s protection visa application was lodged, I understand, on 3 June. I also understand that it is being treated as a priority. Mr Chen has been contacted concerning his application and he has deferred the interview so that he and his advisers can further prepare for it. The government will follow normal processes in determining his status. Above all, he will be given a full and fair hearing. Mr Chen’s supporters also want Australia to provide him with territorial asylum. Mr Chen is like any other person seeking asylum. It will only be granted if he is considered to be at great personal risk. His application for a temporary protection visa is considered to be the most appropriate way to respond and to move forward, and that process is in place at the moment.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Australia has an enviable record in the strength and the administration of its immigration program. Australia will receive about 110,000 new Australians under our general immigration intake in 2004-05 and around another 10,000 to 12,000 under our humanitarian intake. This will include a large number of refugees and others who might qualify under TPV guidelines. Over one million potential Australian citizens take out papers to seek immigration to Australia each year. I think it is more than that; it is approaching 1.2 million. We are probably the destination of choice for many tens of millions around the world who wish to make a better life for themselves away from their country of birth.</para>
<para>We acknowledge our established responsibilities in this area and have done so consistently since World War II. More than seven million new Australians have made their way to our shores since that time to begin a new life for themselves. Included in that number are over 600,000 people who came here with a status that was based on humanitarian grounds. Australia has a non-discriminatory immigration policy. Above all, that policy is about nation building and it is based on priorities that most Australians feel comfortable with and in fact most Australians feel proud of. It is very much part of the make-up of our country and the way we see ourselves and, as a government, we will work very hard to maintain it.</para>
<para>The minister has responded to Mr Chen’s self-created status in an appropriate way. His rights will be considered in a proper way, and I understand that he and his family are safe. I might finish by saying that continued criticism of DIMIA and the minister is entirely counterproductive and should be seen for what it is—political opportunism from the Labor Party.</para>

<para>—I note that the second speaker in support of Senator Vanstone managed to go for just three minutes in defence. That is not a very good effort from you, Senator Macdonald. I want to say that, in a government that is characterised by shoddy ministers and shoddy ministerial performance, Senator Vanstone takes the cake—not the birthday cake, of course, but what she herself now describes as a ‘sorry cake’. And what a sorry saga it is. Let us have a look at the ministerial record of Senator Vanstone and her predecessor, Mr Ruddock.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We have the case of Cornelia Rau, an Australian resident detained. We have the case of Vivian Alvarez Solon, an Australian citizen deported. We have a situation where an Australian citizen of Chinese origin was wrongfully detained because he was not carrying his passport. We have the case of a mentally ill person who was improperly detained, despite the fact that DIMIA itself sought to have him psychiatrically assessed. We have a judicial decision saying that DIMIA was responsible for culpable neglect and breached duty of care in relation to the refusal of psychiatric treatment for two detainees at Baxter. Neither detainee had seen a psychiatrist for 12 and 21 months respectively. We have the Chinese defector, Chen Yonglin, whose desire to defect was blown to the Chinese embassy by the very DIMIA staff that he had turned to for help. We have 201 other possible bungles that are being investigated by Mr Palmer. We have seen Minister Vanstone forced to backtrack over the fiasco surrounding East Timorese refugees. We have seen the minister overruled by Mr Howard when she tried to send newborn baby Michael Andrew Tran to Christmas Island with his parents. And, of course, we have a situation where Liberal Party backbenchers are in open revolt over the policies that Minister Vanstone is pursuing and over her administration of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.</para>
<para>It is no wonder that they are in such open revolt, because we do have a government department that seems to be out of control. It is out of control because there is no ministerial responsibility or no ministerial hand being applied to deal with the problems. Minister Vanstone is either unwilling or unable to fix these problems. What is the minister’s response to these issues? It is blame shifting. The two people who are responsible for the situation in which we find ourselves in relation to immigration policy and the administration of the department of immigration are Mr Ruddock, the previous minister, and Senator Vanstone, the current minister. They are the two people who are responsible—Mr Ruddock and Senator Vanstone—and the only response from Senator Vanstone is blame shifting. She always blames the department. She never accepts responsibility herself, and Mr Ruddock never accepts responsibility for his appalling administration. And do you know who the sacrificial lamb is going to be, Mr Deputy President Hogg? I will tell you. The sacrificial lamb will be Mr Bill Farmer, the secretary of the department of immigration—and if you did not know it before the weekend, you certainly know it now, because he has already been rewarded with an Order of Australia. Yes, the writing is on the wall for Mr Farmer. He is a goner. He is getting the blame. The end is nigh for Mr Farmer. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I accept Senator Faulkner’s thanks. However, I do have to put on the record that the Labor Party’s case in relation to exposing human rights abuses in China, particularly recently, has been a little less than sparkling. The Democrats have attempted in the past to draw attention to these issues. However, motions I have tried to move highlighting the issues involving Falun Gong practitioners and their persecution have not been supported by the Labor Party. Similarly, as I am sure honourable senators would recall, in the lead-up to the visits from both President Bush and President Hu, there were motions bringing the parliament’s attention to human rights abuses in both of those countries. Extraordinarily, the Labor Party supported the motion that exposed US problems but did not support the motion involving human rights abuses in China. So the Labor Party start from a pretty low base.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>But, even saying that, in this case the Labor Party have gone on recording stating that a number of individual cases—cases where application has been made for asylum—are worth supporting, and they should be heard on that issue. I also asked a question on this in the parliament today. In particular, I was curious to know what moves the government had made in terms of looking into the issue of the Lan Fu kidnapping. Given that the case is a few years old, I would have thought that the Minister for Justice and Customs would have had a little more to report today, but he did not.</para>
<para>In relation to ASIO or any other government agency’s investigation into the substance or otherwise of the claims that have been made by Mr Chen, again, there has been a lack of information provided to the chamber by the minister. When Mr Chen’s case first came to light, I said that the first and foremost priority for our government must be to ensure the safety of Mr Chen and his family. Of course, the same must be said of other Chinese defectors who have sought asylum in this country. In this respect, the government’s actions deserve further questioning. Although the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs came out yesterday assuring the public that Mr Chen’s case would be given priority by the department, she has failed to explain to the chamber why Mr Hao’s case has received low priority. I think his application was made in February. What about the applications made by Professor Yuan Hong Bing and his assistant Zhao Jing? They also remain unresolved after a year. So it is not just Mr Chen’s case; there are many other cases that we feel the department and the government should come clean about. Given that numerous states, international bodies and human rights organisations around the world have condemned human rights abuses—</para>

<para>—You cannot argue that you want to be taken seriously and then talk and laugh through any discussion about human rights abuses in China. Human rights organisations have condemned human rights abuses in China. There is widespread evidence of ongoing human rights violations currently, so it seems extraordinary to me and to the Democrats that the government should take such a long time to establish that these individuals are likely or not likely to be persecuted if they return. We need information from the government on those particular cases.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The Chen case also raises a number of issues in relation to application for political asylum in Australia. Our law does provide for individuals to seek political asylum in Australia. I would assume that Mr Chen’s circumstances, are the precise circumstances in which political asylum could reasonably be granted. Mr Chen, it has been indicated, has been told that it is more appropriate that he apply for a protection visa. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said there have been only two successful claims for asylum under the political asylum category in Australia. Is that being used as an excuse: the fact that this particular category is invoked rarely and therefore it is unlikely that he would be successful or that it is inappropriate for him to claim under that particular asylum or visa category? Our law allows for it, and he should be allowed to apply successfully. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

The Committee is, however, concerned that the version gazetted on 17 July 2004 was taken to have been revoked by the Explanatory Statement accompanying the full version. An Explanatory Statement accompanying an instrument has no legislative character and as such the statement revoking the previous version on 17 July 2004 has no effect. The Committee therefore suggests that the status of the earlier Guidelines should be clarified with their revocation by another legislative instrument.

<para class="block">Dear Minister</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-size="12pt">I refer to the</inline> Guidelines in relation to the exercise of Compliance Powers in the Building and Construction Industry made under section 88AGA of the <inline font-style="italic">Workplace Relations Act 1996</inline>. These Guidelines specify guidelines to be used by a delegate of the Secretary to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in exercising powers under Part VA of the Act, such as requiring a person to provide information or documents in relation to a building industry investigation. The Committee raises the following matters with regard to some of the provisions contained in these Guidelines.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-size="12pt">These Guidelines commence on the date from which Schedule 4 to the </inline>
<inline font-style="italic" font-size="12pt">Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Act 2004</inline>
<inline font-size="12pt"> commences. The Explanatory Statement does not give any indication of a likely or anticipated commencement date for that Schedule although the Summary to the Guidelines indicates that this date was expected to be in September 2004. Schedule 4 does not appear to have commenced at this time and the commencement of these Guidelines remains uncertain. The Committee would therefore appreciate your advice on the expected commencement of the amendment Act.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">Clause 15 of these Guidelines specifies limitations on the use of the power to issue a notice. Paragraph (a) states that a power must only be used for building industry investigations, but must not be used for matters that are minor or petty. This reflects subsection 88AA(3) of the <inline font-style="italic">Workplace Relations Act 1996</inline> (as amended). There may be differences of opinion as to whether a matter is ‘minor or petty’. The Committee therefore seeks your advice as to the processes to be followed when a recipient of a notice believes that the matter is minor or petty.</para>
<para class="block">Further, clause 15(b) of the Guidelines states that the power to issue a notice must be used in good faith and not for a collateral purpose. Subsection 88AA(1) of the Act requires the Secretary to have reasonable grounds for believing that a notice should be issued. The Committee suggests it may be preferable if the good faith/non-collateral purpose requirement was also specified in this subsection, rather than the Guidelines.</para>
<para class="block">Finally, the Committee seeks your advice as to whether there are procedures for the return of documents that have been supplied in response to a notice.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 22 January 2005, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Guidelines.

<para class="block">Thank you for your letter of 6 December 2004 concerning the Guidelines in relation to the exercise of Compliance Powers in the Building and Construction industry made under section 88AGA of the <inline font-style="italic">Workplace Relations Act 1996.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">You asked for advice as to when Schedule 4 of the <inline font-style="italic">Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Act</inline> 2004 commences. The Act provides that Schedule 4 will commence on a single day to be fixed by Proclamation or six months after the Act receives the Royal Assent. As the Schedule has not been proclaimed it will commence on the 13 January 2005. However the Guidelines will not commence until after a disallowance period. The period for disallowance commenced on 16 November, the first day of the 41<inline font-variant="superscript">st</inline> parliament. The Building Industry Taskforce can not exercise the Schedule 4 powers until the Guidelines have passed the disallowance period.</para>
<para class="block">You asked for advice as to the processes to be followed when a recipient of a notice to produce documents believes that the matter is minor or petty. The legislation and Guidelines include sufficient safeguards, including extensive preliminary procedures the delegate must satisfy before issuing a notice, which should prevent notices relating to minor or petty issues being issued. However, if a person believes that the power is being used for a minor or petty purpose they may refuse to comply, just as they can refuse to comply if some other element of the requirements has not been complied with. It would also be open for a person to seek a declaration from the Federal Court that the notice was invalid.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee’s suggestion that it may be preferable if the good faith/non-collateral purpose requirement be specified in subsection 88AA(1), rather than the Guidelines is noted. However, given the safeguards contained in the Guidelines and legislation I consider that it is sufficient that such requirements are contained only in the Guidelines.</para>
<para class="block">You asked for advice as to whether there are procedures for the return of documents that have been supplied in response to a notice. The process and procedures by which documents are returned would be a matter for the Building Industry Taskforce or the Secretary to determine. However it should be noted that the Secretary or delegate can only keep a document for as long as it is necessary for the purposes of the conduct of the investigation to which the document is relevant (subsection 88AD(1)). The person that is otherwise entitled to possession of the document is entitled to be supplied with a certified copy of the document (subsection 88AD(2)). The processes put in place will ensure that the Secretary or Building Industry Taskforce do not retain documents for any longer than they are legally entitled to.</para>

<para class="block">Thank you for your letter of 10 February 2005 seeking further advice on behalf of the Standing Committee regarding the Guidelines for the exercise of Compliance Powers in the Building and Construction Industry made under section 88AGA of the <inline font-style="italic">Workplace Relations Act 1996.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">You seek confirmation that the Guidelines do not contemplate a way of resolving such a matter without compelling the involvement of the Court.</para>
<para class="block">The Guidelines, which are closely modelled on Guidelines issued by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in relation to the exercise of information gathering powers under section 155 of the <inline font-style="italic">Trade Practices Act 1974,</inline> have been carefully devised to ensure that there are adequate safeguards to prevent a notice being issued for a minor or improper purpose.</para>
<para class="block">The Guidelines make it clear that seeking information or documents voluntarily is to be preferred and that resort to the compliance powers should only be contemplated in circumstances in which other avenues have been pursued. A notice is not to be issued without a ‘belief on reasonable grounds’ in relation to the matter. It is made clear in the Guidelines that the power cannot be exercised for minor or petty purposes.</para>
<para class="block">The Guidelines also refer to directions to be issued by the Secretary to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations that will, amongst other matters, provide that the Secretary will have to approve each exercise of the powers.</para>
<para class="block">The Guidelines and directions taken together will ensure a high level of scrutiny of the issuing of a notice to ensure that it is issued for proper purposes.</para>
<para class="block">The combined effect of the Guidelines and the Secretary’s Directions will ensure that the powers are not used for minor or petty matters. As there are sufficient safeguards contained in the Guidelines and Secretary’s Directions it is not necessary to provide a process for a person to challenge the notice. Doing so would only provide a means for any person who receives a notice to seek to avoid or delay compliance with that notice.</para>
<para class="block">The compliance powers are similar to those contained in section 155 of the <inline font-style="italic">Trade Practices Act 1974.</inline> It is noteworthy that neither the <inline font-style="italic">Trade Practices Act</inline> nor the Guidelines issued by the ACCC provide any process for a person to challenge a notice.</para>
<para class="block">You also seek advice on the consequences for a recipient who simply refuses to comply because he or she considers the matter to be minor.</para>
<para class="block">Section 88AA(7) provides that failure to comply with a notice is an offence. However, this will only be the case if the notice is valid. If a notice was issued for the purpose of an investigation that was minor or petty it would not be a valid notice.</para>
<para class="block">As noted in my response to your previous letter, it would also be open to a person to seek a declaration from the Federal Court.</para>

<para class="block">Dear Minister</para>
<para class="block">Thank you for your letter of 2 March 2005 providing further advice in relation to the Guidelines for the exercise of Compliance Powers in the Building and Construction Industry made under section 88AGA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. The letter raises two further issues in relation to which the Committee seeks clarification.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee previously sought advice on the processes to be followed where the recipient of a notice to produce documents believes that the matter is minor or petty. In your letter you advise that the “combined effect of the Guidelines and the Secretary’s Directions will ensure that the powers are not used for minor or petty matters,” and that “as there are sufficient safeguards contained in the Guidelines and Secretary’s Directions it is not necessary to provide a process for a person to challenge the notice”. Given the significance of the Secretary’s Directions in regulating the exercise of power in this area, the Committee would appreciate an opportunity to examine those Directions.</para>
<para class="block">Secondly, in your letter you note that section 88AA(7) of the Act provides that failure to comply with a notice is an offence. However, this is only the case if a notice is valid, and a notice issued for the purpose of a minor or petty investigation would not be a valid notice. Ultimately, it becomes a matter for challenge in the Federal Court. This approach seems to continue a trend of imposing an obligation on recipients of notices and other ‘offenders’ to challenge the validity of actions taken against them. As a matter of principle, applicants should bear the burden of having to demonstrate the validity of their claims. Defendants should not have to bear the burden of, in effect, disproving the validity of claims made against them.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee would appreciate your further advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 26 April 2005, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Guidelines. In the meantime, the Committee has given a notice of motion to disallow the Guidelines pending your response on these matters.

<para class="block">You have requested an opportunity to examine the Secretary’s Directions in relation to the exercise of these powers. My Department is currently developing these Directions but they are not expected to be finalised until the powers take effect. However, I consider that the Guidelines provide comprehensive insight into what the Directions will ultimately contain. At page 5 of the Guidelines, there is a comprehensive section dealing with what the Directions will contain.</para>
<para class="block">Essentially the Guidelines will be the main source of the Directions. The relevant sections setting out what will be in the Directions is extracted below.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">The Secretary’s directions require:</inline>
</para>
<list type="loweralpha">
<item label="(a)">
<para>Taskforce investigations to be initiated using the general powers available to Taskforce investigators under the Act e.g. section 86.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>The voluntary provision of information/documentation and the use of pre-existing information gathering powers are to be the preferred forms of obtaining information/documentation directed at ensuring compliance with and/or investigating suspected/alleged breaches of the Act or an agreement or award made under the Act.</para>
</item>
<item label="(c)">
<para>Resort to the use of Pt VA compliance powers should only be contemplated by the delegate in circumstances in which other avenues available to the Taskforce to obtain information on a voluntary basis or by use of information gathering powers under section 83BH and 86 of the Act have been pursued or are not considered to be adequate to obtain information necessary for an investigation, because for example there is a risk that the information may be destroyed, not provided or provided only on terms unacceptable to the Secretary or the delegate.</para>
</item>
<item label="(d)">
<para>Where the delegate proposes to exercise the power under subsection 88AA(1), by written notice, and require a person to give information, produce documents, or attend and answer questions on oath or affirmation, the delegate will advise the Secretary prior to issuing a notice and will provide the Secretary with details of  the types of the information/documentation/evidence being sought; a summary of the alleged incident, conduct/behavior or case being investigated and the reasons for his belief that the power should be exercised in this case. In accordance with subsection 88A1(2) the Secretary will provide, the Ombudsman with such information and access to documents as required.</para>
</item>
<item label="(e)">
<para>The Secretary will consider the delegate’s advice and convey in writing to the delegate whether he agrees with the delegate’s decision to do so.</para>
</item>
<item label="(f)">
<para>The delegate will not issue a notice without the Secretary’s agreement.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">The Directions will simply be a brief document outlining the requirements as detailed above.</para>
<para class="block">In addition to the Secretary’s Directions, I would draw your attention to the following sections from the Guidelines indicating the ‘Limits on the use of powers’ (p8) and the ‘Requirements of a valid notice’ (p9):</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">‘Limits on the use of powers’</inline>
</para>
<list type="unadorned">
<item label="">
<para>15.   There are a number of limitations on the use of the power.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>16.   The investigative power does not extend to evidence gathering once an investigation is concluded and proceedings commenced. The delegate may not be able to issue a notice after legal proceedings have commenced if doing so would interfere with a person’s rights to protection against self-incrimination and self-exposure to a penalty which apply in court proceedings and/or would interfere with the court’s inherent power to conduct its own proceedings.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>17.   While it is not possible to provide guidance on all possible circumstances, the delegate will generally not issue a notice to a private individual or a corporate respondent involved in proceedings. Rather, the delegate will rather rely on court procedures, such as discovery, notices to produce and admit, interrogatories and subpoenas.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>18.   The power to issue a notice for the purposes of a Taskforce investigation is not affected by another party instituting proceedings against the proposed addressee of the notice. A decision by the Taskforce to begin proceedings, as distinct from actually beginning proceedings, does not necessarily preclude it from issuing a section 88AA notice.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">These limits are one of the many safeguards against the improper use of these powers. The protections that the limits on the use of the powers provide include that the power can not be used for a matter that is minor or petty, that the power to issue a notice must be used in good faith and that the notice should not be unreasonably burdensome. They place conditions on when the powers may be exercised and require that the potential burden on a recipient be considered.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">‘Requirements of a valid notice’</inline>
</para>
<list type="unadorned">
<item label="">
<para>19.   A notice requiring the addressee to provide information or documents must:</para>
<list type="loweralpha-dotted">
<item label="a.">
<para>disclose on its face the nature of the building industry investigation in relation to which the Secretary or delegate believes on reasonable grounds that a person has information, documents or evidence relevant to a building industry investigation;</para>
</item>
<item label="b.">
<para>specify the information or documents in enough detail to provide the addressee with a point of reference by which to judge whether the notice validly requires information/documents/evidence to be provided; and</para>
</item>
<item label="c.">
<para>request information or documents relevant to the investigation.</para>
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>20.   If a notice requires a person to attend an oral examination, the description of the nature of the building industry investigation determines the scope of the questions that can be asked at the examination.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>21.   Given the investigative nature of the notice, there is no requirement that it will set out all the facts necessary to constitute a contravention or possible contravention. Nor is it necessary to set out the relevant evidence or information on which the delegate decided to issue the notice.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>22.   The nature of the investigation will be described simply but in enough detail for the addressee to know what the subject matter (and possible contravention of the Act) is.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">These criteria should ensure that a notice is only issued for a valid purpose. They require the nature of the investigation to be disclosed in the notice, for the notice to give enough detail of the information or documents required and that the notice must request information or documents relevant to the investigation. The detail that must be provided in a notice will make it clear the matter is not to be minor or petty.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Scope of information and documents that can be required</inline>
</para>
<list type="unadorned">
<item label="">
<para>23.   Information/documents shall not be sought that would:</para>
<list type="loweralpha-dotted">
<item label="a.">
<para>require the addressee to give an interpretation of a document, except where explanations of symbols, codes, etc. may be necessary; or</para>
</item>
<item label="b.">
<para>require the addressee to seek out information or documents which are not in its possession, custody or control or to formulate an opinion on a particular matter.</para>
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>24.   A notice may be directed to a body corporate, but where information about awareness, knowledge or belief is required; the notice should be directed to particular persons, for example company officers, directors or employees.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">This restriction on the scope of information should further ensure the appropriate exercise of these powers.</para>
<para class="block">As I explained in my previous letter, these Directions taken in conjunction with the limitations contained in the Guidelines provide sufficient safeguards to ensure that the powers are not used for minor or petty matters.</para>
<para class="block">The purpose of these powers is to facilitate compliance activity in the building and construction industry. There are limits imposed on the operation of these powers and the Taskforce will be required to satisfy extensive requirements before they issue a notice. It is the nature of an investigation of this kind that the powers should operate in this way and I consider that too many conditions would render these powers ineffective. I am confident that there are sufficient safeguards to ensure they are used appropriately.</para>
<para class="block">In the process of drawing up the Guidelines, my Department has drawn upon its extensive legal experience in drafting legislation specifically for the construction industry. As a result, I believe that we have struck a balance between ensuring that the powers are used appropriately and ensuring that the powers are able to be effective. I consider that too many additional conditions would now render these powers ineffective. I am confident that there are sufficient safeguards to ensure they are used appropriately.</para>
<para class="block">It should be noted that it would be for the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute any case involving failure to comply with a notice to produce documents or give evidence. The ‘Prosecution Policy of the Commonwealth’ sets out criteria governing the decision to proceed. Key amongst these criteria are considerations of fairness and consistency. The criteria governing the decision to prosecute specifically state that “[t]he initial consideration in the exercise of this discretion is whether the evidence is sufficient to justify the institution or continuation of a prosecution.” Applying these Guidelines would mean that it would be extremely unlikely that a prosecution would be pursued in a case of a notice being issued for a minor or petty purpose.</para>
<para class="block">I do not accept your concerns that the defendant is bearing an unreasonable burden in a situation where they consider that a notice is invalid as it relates to a minor or petty matter.</para>
<para class="block">My Department has sought advice from the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) about whether it would be for the prosecution or defence to establish that a notice had been issued for a minor or petty purpose. AGS have advised that if a prosecution has been commenced against a person for non-compliance with a notice and the person claims, at any point, that the notice has been issued for a minor or petty purpose then the prosecution would have to prove the notice was not issued for the purposes of an investigation that is minor or petty. The prosecution would have to prove this beyond a reasonable doubt. I have attached a copy of that advice for your information.</para>
<para class="block">In conclusion, I would also note that the Guidelines are modelled on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Guidelines for their information-gathering powers. In addition section 88AI of the Act provides that there will be an annual review by the Ombudsman of the exercise of the section 88AA power. The Secretary must provide the Ombudsman with such information and access to documents as the Ombudsman requires. The Ombudsman must cause a copy of each report to be tabled in each House of the Parliament.</para>
<para class="block">As set out in this letter and in my previous letters there are more than sufficient safeguards to ensure that the powers are used properly.</para>
<para class="block">Thank you for bringing the Committee’s concerns to my attention. I trust that this letter will resolve all of the Committee’s concerns.</para>
<para class="block">If you have further concerns I am happy to arrange for a member of my staff or a departmental officer to meet with you and/or members of the Committee in the interests of resolving the Committee’s concerns expediently.</para>
<para class="block">Please contact Peter Cully on (02) 6121 7237 if you would like to discuss these matters further or to arrange a meeting.</para>

<para>10.   The burden of proving each of the elements of the offence in subsection 88AA(7) would be borne by the prosecution. An essential element of the offence is that the conduct of the defendant is in response to the issue of a notice under subsection 88AA(1). In our view, this presupposes a requirement to prove that a notice has been validly issued, should that issue be raised.</para>
<para>11.   The issuing of a notice under s.88AA(1) is subject to s.88AA(3) which states that a notice may not be issued ‘for the purposes of an investigation that is minor or petty’. Therefore, if an objection to the notice was raised in the course of proceedings, it would be for the prosecution to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the notice was validly issued.</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">When an evidential burden may be placed an the defence</inline>

<item label="">
<para>12.   There are certain circumstances in which the Criminal Code places what is referred to as an ‘evidential burden’ on the defence. These circumstances can include when the defendant is relying upon some excuse or justification provided for by the law creating the offence. We do not consider those circumstances apply here but we mention them for completeness.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>13.   For purposes of the present discussion, we refer to s.13.3 of the Criminal Code, which relevantly provides:</para>

<para class="block">evidential burden, in relation to a matter, means the burden of adducing or pointing to evidence that suggests a reasonable possibility that the matter exists or does not exist</para>
<list type="unadorned">
<item label="">
<para>14.   All that is required to discharge an evidential burden is for the defendant to point to some evidence to support the contention that the exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification applies to his or her circumstances. The defendant does have the burden of proving his or her case in that regard. The burden of disproving the matter remains with the prosecution, and it must do so beyond a reasonable doubt; s.13.2 of the Criminal Code provides:</para>
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(2)">
<para>The prosecution also bears a legal burden of disproving any matter in relation to which the defendant has discharged an evidential burden of proof imposed on the defendant.</para>
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>15.   In any event, we do not consider that the circumstances of an alleged offence against s.88AA(7), on which you have requested advice, give rise to any evidential burden for the defendant. As we have noted, the validity of the notice under s.88AA(1) (including that it was not issued for the purposes of an investigation that is minor or petty) would become an essential element of the offence for the prosecution to prove, if the matter was put in issue. (The defence would merely have to raise it as an issue rather than satisfy any evidential burden.) Moreover, s.88AA(3) of the WR Act exists as a qualification on the valid exercise of the power under s:88AA(1). That provision is not ‘an exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification provided by the law creating an offence’ (which is s.88A(7)). Hence, we are of the view that s13.3.(3) of the Criminal Code would not apply.</para>

<para class="block">The purpose of the work is to provide 50 houses to meet the operational requirements of Defence, mainly to service the nearby Enoggera Army Base. It is intended that the houses will be ready for occupation in November 2006.</para>

This correspondence was forwarded to the Defence Housing Authority and the Committee recommends that the Authority continue to engage in close consultation with owners of neighbouring properties and the wider McDowall community.

<inline font-weight="bold">Provision of Facilities for Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre Additional Accommodation and Related Works, Maribyrnong, Victoria</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Committee’s third report of 2005 addresses a proposal from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to provide additional accommodation and carry out related works at the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre at Maribyrnong in Victoria.</para>
<para class="block">This work was referred to the Committee for consideration and report on 9 December 2004 at an estimated cost of $7 million.</para>
<para class="block">The Department’s proposal is driven chiefly by the need to provide adequate separation for different categories of detainees. In its current form, the Centre allows only for the separation of adult males from females and families. The facility needs to be expanded and reconfigured in order to protect the welfare of residents and staff.</para>
<para class="block">The Department intends that the proposed works should deliver:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>the ability to separate different detainee groups;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>an increase in capacity of some 50 places;</para>
</item>

<item>
<para>improved OH&amp;S conditions for staff; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>the provision of some self-catering facilities.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">In order to achieve these outcomes, the Department proposes to construct additional accommodation in the form of demountable buildings and to reconfigure existing facilities to accommodate a further 50 detainees within the existing Centre boundaries. The Department intends that the proposed works will:</para>
<para class="block">“…achieve additional accommodation that provides improved amenity and demonstrates a clear regard for the personal needs and dignity of the residents” and</para>
<para class="block">“…provide detention infrastructure that is humane, non-punitive and sensitive to the needs of people held under administrative detention.”</para>
<para class="block">The Committee visited the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre on 23 February 2005 and conducted public hearings in Melbourne on 23 February and in Canberra on 7 March.</para>
<para class="block">During its investigations, the Committee considered a range of matters relating to the need, purpose, scope, cost and value-for-money of the proposed work.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee was primarily concerned at the Department’s proposal to accommodate a further 50 detainees within the boundary of the existing site. The Committee acknowledges the considerable challenges faced by the Department in respect of providing additional places at the Maribyrnong facility and is appreciative of the efforts made to make the best possible use of the limited space available. However, the Committee does not believe that a population increase of the magnitude proposed would enhance amenity to residents or satisfy the Department’s intention to provide “humane and non-punitive detention infrastructure”.</para>
<para class="block">Following their inspection of the existing facilities, members were in no doubt as to the pressing need for refurbishment, particularly in respect of the existing ablutions and family accommodation area. Members were disappointed to note that the detailed project cost estimate did not include specific amounts for extensive refurbishment of the existing accommodation. The Committee was unanimous in its view that the proposal did not appear to be accomplishing the stated purpose of improving the overall amenity of the facility and providing “humane and non-punitive detention infrastructure”—particularly considering the proposed 65 per cent increase in occupancy. The Committee therefore recommends that, in order to maintain a reasonable level of amenity, the current maximum occupancy of the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre be increased by no more than 20 places, with a total maximum occupancy in surge periods of not more than 100 detainees.</para>
<para class="block">In respect of the project scope, the Committee noted the Department’s intention to utilise portable accommodation units at the site and recommends that these be of an acceptable standard to ensure a reasonable level of comfort and amenity for detainees.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee was concerned to learn that there is no single national or international building code or standard for immigration detention facilities and believes that this deficiency should be addressed. The Committee does not believe that remand centres and backpacker hostels are entirely appropriate analogies for detention accommodation as the freedom of movement available to the occupants of such facilities are markedly different. In respect of building codes and standards, the Committee therefore recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs consult with appropriate government and professional bodies to establish a national benchmark for the construction and fit-out of Immigration Detention Centres and Immigration Reception and Processing Centres.</para>
<para class="block">Similarly, the Committee noted that there is no agreed standard for the per capita provision of space and amenities at immigration detention facilities In respect of the ratio between living/recreation space, amenities and occupancy, the Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs consult with appropriate government and professional bodies with a view to establishing a national benchmark for room occupancy and related indoor and outdoor recreation areas, ablutions, kitchen and laundry facilities at Immigration Detention Centres and Immigration Reception and Processing Centres.</para>
<para class="block">Members were also concerned to note that accommodation at the Centre is based on quadruple occupancy of double bunk rooms. Whilst the rooms in the proposed new accommodation zone will measure 15 square metres plus ensuite, some rooms in the existing section are only 11 square metres, with access to shared ablutions. Members concluded that, whilst quadruple occupancy of the larger ensuite rooms proposed for construction under the extension project would be acceptable, quadruple occupancy of the existing non-ensuite rooms did not represent an appropriate level of amenity. In order to fulfil the Department’s objective of providing “humane and non-punitive detention infrastructure”, the Committee recommends that the Department reduce the number of detainees accommodated in the existing double-bunk rooms at the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre to two persons per room. Moreover, the Committee recommends that, wherever possible, occupancy of new ensuite rooms should be kept below the maximum of four, especially in cases where the detention period is prolonged.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee is of the view that the Department should act promptly to redress the shortcomings of the existing accommodation at Maribyrnong in order to meet the stated project objective of providing “humane and non-punitive” detention facilities. The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs expedite the proposed routine maintenance and upgrade of existing ablutions and accommodation facilities in order to reduce the disparity in quality of accommodation between the old and new wings of the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre.</para>
<para class="block">During their visit to the Centre, members observed that the existing bedrooms do not have doors, but were pleased to note that the Department includes improved privacy for residents among the anticipated project outcomes. In order to fulfil the Department’s objective of providing “humane and non-punitive detention infrastructure which provides a clear regard for the personal needs and dignity of residents”, the Committee recommends that the Department install bedroom doors or bed-curtaining in all rooms at the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre to ensure an appropriate level of privacy for detainees.</para>
<para class="block">In respect of the reconfiguration of the Centre, members questioned whether the design represented the best solution in terms of access to recreational space for families and children, as the selected option will not provide families with immediate and unescorted access to the largest outdoor recreation area. The Committee questions whether this solution adequately meets the Department’s intention to improve “…amenity for residents, particularly women and children…”. In view of this, the Committee recommends that the Department give consideration to using the proposed new Zone A of the extended Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre for the accommodation of families in order to allow children greater access to the centre’s largest outdoor recreation area.</para>
<para class="block">Having reviewed the evidence presented to it, the Committee recommends that the works proceed subject to the acceptance of recommendations 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 of its report. Further, the Committee seeks a response from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in respect of the Department’s intention to adopt the recommendations made herewith.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak to the motion moved by Senator McGauran in relation to the four reports of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Public Works. I specifically want to speak to the report on the proposed Maribyrnong immigration detention centre. The motion moved by Senator McGauran was that the Senate take note of that report and the other reports before us.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I must emphasise that I am not a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, so I have not seen the report and was not able to participate in the specific inquiry. The Joint Standing Committee on Public Works does have a very narrow term of reference. It does not relate specifically to policy matters per se; it looks much more narrowly at public works—usually buildings, defence housing and other government facilities.</para>
<para>The issue at the heart of this report, the proposed new Maribyrnong immigration detention centre, is an issue that I believe needs further noting, not so much in terms of whether we are getting value for money—whether we are picking the right quality cement and those sorts of things—but in terms of whether it is actually necessary, desirable and appropriate to be building expanded immigration detention facilities. People would say that, if we are going to have better quality facilities, that is better for the people who are detained within them—and I do not dispute that. Any opportunity to have better facilities for people whilst they are in detention is, on the face of it, desirable. But the bigger question, of course, is whether we should be having so many of those people in detention facilities.</para>
<para>Senators would know that the Australian Democrats have long opposed mandatory detention in this country. Our record on that is totally consistent and very longstanding, over more than a decade. But the bigger issue here is not even mandatory detention. Many people misrepresent the position of the Democrats and others who oppose mandatory detention, saying that we support an open door policy and believe there should be no detention at all. That is not the case. Certainly, on behalf of the Democrats, I state that we do not support an open door policy and we certainly do not suggest that there are not circumstances where it may be appropriate to have people in detention for migration related matters. But the fact is that we have far too many people in migration detention and far too many of those people are in there for far too long. We have people in there, including children, who are in detention for months and years.</para>
<para>The simple matter is that, if we did not have that policy—an unjustified, immoral and unnecessary policy—we would not need this report at all. We would not need the additional accommodation or the related works because we would not need the detention centre. As I said before, there is a case for people being detained for migration purposes in select circumstances for specific reasons and for limited periods of time. If we had that policy, obviously we would need to have one or two facilities somewhere. But we would certainly not need to have the vast and continuing endless expenditure on building, expanding, refurbishing and adding new detention centres, time after time. If we look at the amount of expenditure in this area over recent years, we see it is simply scandalous.</para>
<para>The broader issue here that underpins what these reports are about is value for money for the taxpayer. There is no way that it is value for money for the taxpayer to be spending hundreds of millions of dollars on new facilities and on expanding and upgrading facilities to detain people when we do not need to be doing that in the first place. The Maribyrnong centre, which is in Melbourne, is small bickies compared to some of the others. It is estimated, depending on which document you read, that the one that is still proposed for Christmas Island, which will accommodate a total of around 800 people, will cost over $300 million. That is $300 million to build a detention facility on Christmas Island, when we have an empty detention facility, in mothballs, at Port Hedland, when we have the Baxter detention facility at less than half capacity, and when we have an empty facility—it has been empty for a few years—in Darwin, which we are now going to spend more money on to upgrade. We have a proposal for a facility in Brisbane still on the books, and we have the facility at Woomera. Enormous amounts of money have been spent upgrading and expanding that facility—mainly on security—and then within a year or two that money is mothballed.</para>
<para>Billions of dollars have been spent on a totally unnecessary policy that causes immense harm to people, distorts the rule of law, subverts due process and, on any objective criteria, does not contribute one bit to border protection under any sensible meaning of the term. It is a stupid waste of money purely because the government will not admit the blatantly obvious: that this policy is not necessary, that it causes immense harm and that there are alternatives that are not only more humane but more workable and much more in accordance with our legal and democratic traditions, and they would save us a fortune.</para>
<para>I for one believe that it is time to start saying no to more and more public money being spent on more and more detention facilities, with a few little bandaids around the side now and then to take the pressure off the Prime Minister whenever one case comes up that makes things look difficult. It is time to recognise that the whole policy does not work, and you cannot continue to adjust, amend and build on something when its foundations are completely and utterly in ruins. The foundations of the mandatory detention policy—its legal foundations, its ethical and moral foundations, and its policy foundations—are completely bankrupt. Continuing to build on and amend that policy, whether it is building new centres or changing the way that the policy works so that it can operate in a supposedly more flexible or more humane way, is ignoring the core problem, which is that the policy, the law itself, is corrupt.</para>
<para>Until we acknowledge that, we will continue to waste more money. It is bad enough to be wasting money but this is wasting money to generate human suffering for no good end, other than political ends for a government that refuse to admit that they have got it wrong—and both major parties have refused to admit that they have got it wrong. Time after time they have kept cracking down, one thing after another, and they have never taken a step back and said: ‘Maybe we’ve gone in the wrong direction. Maybe we need to choose another path.’ Surely there is enough evidence out there now that we need to choose another path. It certainly does not involve building more detention centres, additional accommodation and related works, even if it means good value for money, and we are getting top quality bricks and cement and nice clean floors. The simple fact is that the policy that is behind the construction of these detention centres is wrong. It is time for that policy to be changed.</para>

<para>—I also rise to speak to the report of the Public Works Committee on the Maribyrnong detention centre. As a Victorian I want to make some brief remarks about this report. I have not yet had the benefit of seeing it, but being a regular visitor to Maribyrnong I do know something of the background to this. It is not a bad thing that we are improving that accommodation, although I agree with my colleague that quite a few of the people who are at Maribyrnong ought not be there.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I agree too that we should not be increasing accommodation in detention centres overall, including Maribyrnong. One of the reasons is that this will take over a substantial area of open space at the present time—space which had been denied to detainees for about two years because the government argued that security arrangements were not in place, despite several-metres-high steel walls and ribbon wire and what appeared to me to be a very secure environment. These detainees have only just had access to that outdoor space—a pretty miserable outdoor space too—but this development is proposing to use much of that space up. The problem is that, when people are there for lengths of time—many years in some cases; the people that I have talked with are still there or have been kept there for five years or more—whilst nothing is more important than getting them out, if they cannot move around in this very confined environment it is obviously not good for their mental health.</para>
<para>I point out as well that Maribyrnong council has been very opposed to this expansion. I think the government let the council know that this was happening, but that was about the extent of the consultation that took place. This does matter to the Maribyrnong City Council because adjacent to the Maribyrnong detention centre is a brand new housing development. Quite a substantial area of land has been set aside for redevelopment. You are going to have some quite expensive housing, I would say, which will back onto the detention centre. In fact, the mayor, when I last spoke with her, indicated that the plan was to put up another very large fence so that the people in this new housing development would not have to look onto the misery of the Maribyrnong detention centre and very obviously prison-like circumstances in which people live—that is, as I said, with razor wire and very high walls.</para>
<para>Having said all of that, I should also say that the conditions inside the Maribyrnong centre—and I am told this is better than most other detention centres—are pretty miserable. In the male quarters the dormitory spaces are occupied by four men in very narrow, short, steel double bunks, with a very narrow space in between those two sets of beds. There is very little by way of furniture—a simple metal cabinet—and there are bars on the window and a pretty miserable outlook. Together with that there are the so-called isolation rooms, which have nothing in them. All in all, this is not good place for anyone to be. I welcome any proposal to improve those conditions.</para>
<para>However, I reiterate what my colleague has just said: most of the people who are there should not be there in the first place. They are there because they are asylum seekers and they are going through a process. It makes no sense to be locking them up when most of them are waiting for some court process to take place. They are the last ones likely to abscond. It puzzles me. Even the minister today said, ‘We’re not going to let people off scot-free.’ These people are not going to wander off and disappear. It is in their interest to have visas and full permanent residency in this country. I cannot see them running off and disappearing, particularly those people with children. Children have to be put through school and looked after. It would be extremely difficult, I would suggest, for a couple or an individual with children to simply ‘get off scot-free’, as the minister suggested, as if they had committed a crime—and, of course, the majority of asylum seekers have not. As a Victorian senator I want to add my voice and express my concern at this proposal—a concern which, from what I can gather, has been echoed to some extent in some of the comments and content of this report.</para>

<para>—I rise to take note of report of the Public Works Committee on the Maribyrnong detention centre. The Senate, in taking note of this document, is being asked effectively to approve the building of more immigration detention centres—this one at Maribyrnong. Last Thursday I was out the front of Villawood detention centre when the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs turned the first three sods of the new detention centre to be built at Villawood. I thought then, as I think now, that, in the midst of all of the claims about the way in which we need to be ending this system of mandatory detention, the minister on Thursday opened and turned those first sods of a brand new detention centre that is not just any detention centre but a new detention centre that is designed specifically for locking up women and children.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The minister seeks on these sorts of occasions, as she did on Thursday and has subsequently, to claim that this is an opportunity for families to live in the community. As for these residential housing projects that the minister was opening at Villawood last Thursday, I have been to visit such a residential housing project in Port Augusta. It is quite incredible to see the way in which this government is able to transform a normal suburban street into a prison. What they do is build two large fences all of the way around it. Regularly around it they position cameras, which give 24-hour monitoring of people who are held within that particular facility. There are motion detectors so that, if anyone opens the window after 11 o’clock at night, an alarm goes off, given the expectation that they are going to escape over the two fences, through the motion detectors, past the 24-hour security cameras and out into the community.</para>
<para>If there are schoolchildren in that area—and there often are—then, on their way to school, they go through an X-ray. An X-ray wand is waved over them, as is done in our airports, and their bags are also searched. On the way home from school, yet again their bags are searched and they go through an X-ray by these guards. Regularly throughout the day in these places—and the minister likes to describe this as families living in the community—guards from the private security company contracted to run our immigration detention centres come into people’s homes every couple of hours to do a head count. When I went and visited one of those homes in a residential housing project in Port Augusta, the place was in disarray. One woman had been in there for an indeterminate period of time. She did not know how much longer she was going to be in there. She was being held in there away from her partner, who was elsewhere. Often the partner is in another immigration detention centre and mothers are held there with their children away from and without any ability to engage with the community, certainly without any ability to know what is going on and for how much longer they will be held there.</para>
<para>When I visited those women and children they told me about the circumstance where, once a week, they are being taken by the guards to the local shopping centre. They have a specific allowance—that is the only money they are allowed to spend—for buying food that they may cook for their family in the residential housing project. When they are there we have the circumstance where, if they seek to spend any more money than that allowance or to spend that money inappropriately, the private security guard argues with the mother at the checkout about what she can be buy and how much money she can spend buying food for her children. If that is not a paternalistic attitude about the way in which asylum seekers and mothers should be able to look after their own children, I do not know what it is. But the minister claims that this is about women and children being able to live in the community. You are not living in the community when, as occurs in these residential housing projects, if you run into somebody in the supermarket that you know and enter into a conversation, the guard not only removes you from that situation but also can deny you the right to go the shopping centre the next week to buy food for your children. That is not living in the community. It is not living in the community if you cannot talk to people in your local shopping centre. It is not living in the community if you cannot lean over the two fences and the security cameras to talk to your neighbours. It is not living in the community if you have your bag searched on the way to school when you are a six-year-old. It is not living in the community if you have a security guard arguing with you at the checkout about what you can and cannot buy to feed your children. And yet the minister puts up this ridiculous idea that this is about allowing women and children to live in the community.</para>
<para>Today we hear more announcements. The government, in their negotiations with Petro Georgiou and others, are saying perhaps we should allow fathers to live in this environment as well. That is not living in the community. Allowing fathers to be able to be treated in this degrading way and to be a part of an area that has turned from a suburban street into a prison is not living in the community. It is just another form of prison. The minister for immigration, in response to the concerns we have seen now for years—particularly about children in detention but, in general, about the operations of our immigration detention centres—responds to these concerns by opening a new detention centre for women and children last Thursday. And here in the Senate we are again being asked to consider more changes and the building of more expansive detention centres, this time in Victoria. That is not a minister who is taking seriously her responsibility to her portfolio and to her individual duty of care for the people that she holds in detention.</para>
<para>A minister who was responsible would not respond to this crisis by going out and turning three sods of soil, like the minister did on Thursday, for the building of another detention centre for children and women to be locked up in. That is not an appropriate way to be dealing with this immigration detention debacle that the current minister is presiding over. An appropriate way would be to set up a judicial inquiry—an open, public inquiry—where we can hear about the way in which this department and this minister are administering this system of mandatory detention. The Greens certainly say that we need to go further than that. The system of mandatory detention that exists in this country, which this government, minister and department preside over, is one which says, ‘We will lock people up and ask questions later.’ That is not appropriate. Think of all of the scandals that we have seen, whether it be Vivian Alvarez, Cornelia Rau or three-year-old Naomi Leong, who has spent all her life up until a couple of weeks ago when she appeared on the front page of the newspaper, living in a detention centre. I think it has been 10 children now living in detention centres who have been born there. All of those people do not deserve to have a minister who sends these issues off to a closed inquiry. They deserve for there to be an open, public and transparent inquiry. They do not deserve to have a system of mandatory detention supported by both the major parties which says, ‘We are going to lock these people up. Maybe if they appear on the front page of the newspaper we will ask some questions later.’ That is an utterly irresponsible way for the government to run public administration of these affairs.</para>
<para>The way in which, scandal after scandal, the department changes and manipulates the way it deals with these issues is outrageous. It is an outrageous way to run this administration. During the estimates committee process I asked a number of questions about particular detainees. One of those was an Iraqi man with a hand deformed because members of Saddam Hussein’s Baathist regime had hit it with a burning metal rod. They also tortured and killed his father. That man was sitting in Baxter detention centre at the time I asked the minister questions about whether he could be released on a bridging visa for the torture and trauma that he had faced. Two days later, I got a message to say the man had been released. I asked another question about a man in immigration detention who, out of desperation—he had been in there for five years and was the longest serving detainee in Villawood detention centre—had drunk a bottle of bleach the night before the estimates hearings. That is the action of a desperate man in a desperate situation—a man who happens to have been one of the carers for the three-year-old in Villawood, Naomi Leong, who I mentioned before. I asked questions about that particular man of Immigration and a week later, I think it was, he was released from detention.</para>
<para>I hope that the asking of those questions and the release of those detainees were not connected. I hope sincerely that this government, minister and department are not making decisions on the basis of issues being raised in the Senate, the estimates process, the media or wherever it may be, and to decide only then to release people from detention. If that is so, it is an appalling way to run public administration of the department of immigration, or any other department for that matter. So I hope those issues, the asking of questions about detainees and the subsequent release of those particular individuals, are entirely unrelated. We should not be supporting the building of any new detention centres. We should be supporting the dismantling of this system of mandatory detention which says, ‘Lock people up first and ask questions later.’</para>

In particular, on this occasion, the States and Territories were provided with more notice than previous listings and consultation occurred between the Prime Minister and Premiers and Chief Ministers as required under subclause 3.4(6) of the Inter-Governmental Agreement on Counter-terrorism Laws.</para>
<para class="block">However, consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade still appears to be somewhat inadequate. The Committee would encourage DFAT to provide more detailed advice to the Attorney-General’s Department in future listings under the Criminal Code. This advice may include an assessment of the foreign policy implications of a listing and any information relating to Australia’s obligations to the United Nations on the particular organisation.</para>
<para class="block">In its previous report, Review of the listing of six terrorist organisations, the Committee recommended that a comprehensive information program, that takes account of relevant community groups, be conducted in relation to any listing of an organisation as a terrorist organisation. At the hearing on this listing, the Attorney-General’s Department advised that they are developing a response to the Committee’s recommendation on community consultation and the Committee looks forward to the implementation of this recommendation.</para>
<para class="block">At the hearing for the Committee’s earlier report, Review of the listing of six terrorist organisations, ASIO advised the Committee of their evaluation process in selecting entities for proscription under the Criminal Code. In this review, the Committee examined ASIO’s criteria in more detail and continues to gain a better understanding of the process of selecting organisations for listing. The proscription of an organisation under the Criminal Code creates serious criminal offences and the Committee would like to stress the need for clear reasons explaining why it is necessary to proscribe an organisation.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee is pleased that links to Australia is one of the factors considered by ASIO. Although the Committee understands that direct links to Australia are not legally necessary in order for an organisation to be listed under the Criminal Code, it is the Committee’s view that it should be a primary consideration in determining whether to proscribe an organisation.</para>
<para class="block">In this review, the Committee measured the al-Zarqawi network against ASIO’s stated evaluation process. The al-Zarqawi network has engaged in and continues to engage in violent terrorist acts, in particular, the organisation has claimed responsibility for an attack on an Australian Defence Force convoy in Baghdad last year and a vehicle bombing near the Australian Embassy in Baghdad in January of this year. The Committee was also advised that the organisation does have some links to Australia.</para>
<para class="block">It is therefore the Committee’s view that the proscription of the al-Zarqawi network in Australia is potentially useful insofar as it prevents Australians from assisting the organisation either financially or personally.</para>
<para class="block">In this review, there continued to be much debate between the Committee and government officials on the selection processes for proscription under the Criminal Code. It is hoped that this will be a continuing and constructive dialogue.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee does not recommend to the Parliament that this regulation be disallowed.</para>
<para class="block">I recommend the report to the Senate.</para>

<inline ref="R2363">ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS (MANAGEMENT OF COMMONWEALTH LIABILITIES) (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2005</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 provides for the repeal of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee legislation. The main Bill will transfer liabilities relating to current claims to Comcare. Following this, the Consequential and Transitional Provisions Bill will transfer any remaining liabilities of SIFC to the Commonwealth.</para>
<para class="block">Once the liabilities have been transferred, Schedule 2 of the Consequential and Transitional Provisions Bill will repeal the following Acts: the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee Act 1977, the Stevedoring Industry Levy Act 1977, and the Stevedoring Industry Levy Collection Act 1977.</para>
<para class="block">Asbestos-related liabilities which were transferred from SIFC to the Commonwealth will then be capable of being automatically transferred to Comcare under the transfer provisions of the main Bill.</para>
<para class="block">As the Committee will no longer perform any other functions after the transferral of liabilities for asbestos-related claims to Comcare, it is appropriate to repeal the relevant legislation. The stevedoring industry levy collection Acts have been redundant for several years.</para>
<para class="block">There will also be consequential amendments to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 to take account of Comcare’s new function in managing asbestos-related common law claims.</para>

<para class="block">
<inline ref="R2365">ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS (MANAGEMENT OF COMMONWEALTH LIABILITIES) BILL 2005</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) Bill 2005 will allow Comcare to manage all asbestos-related claims brought at common law against the Government. It will achieve this by transferring the liability for such claims from the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities to Comcare.</para>
<para class="block">Currently, the majority of common law asbestos claims against the Government are managed by the particular agencies against which the claims are made. This has resulted in some inefficiencies and inconsistencies in case management across portfolios.</para>
<para class="block">Comcare’s current legislative authority allows it to manage asbestos-related disease claims from only current and former employees of the Government, and their dependants.</para>
<para class="block">The bill will give Comcare the legislative authority to manage common law claims against the Government by contractors, tenants, bystanders, etc. Comcare will also have the authority to manage claims from former waterside workers whose asbestos claims are currently managed by the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee.</para>
<para class="block">It is proposed that Defence-related common law asbestos claims will continue to be managed by the Department of Defence, at the delegation of Comcare, pending a review of these arrangements by July 2006.</para>
<para class="block">Statutory claims made under the Safety, Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 1988, the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 are not included in the application of this bill, and claims made under these Acts will continue to be managed by Comcare and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs.</para>
<para class="block">Integrating the management of asbestos claims against the Government will lead to more consistent decision making and more equitable and efficient outcomes. It will result in a standardised approach to management of asbestos claims. Furthermore, it will facilitate a better understanding of the nature of asbestos claims through improved knowledge and experience. The long latency period for asbestos-related diseases warrants special consideration for managing resulting personal injury claims.</para>
<para class="block">The Government’s asbestos liabilities over the next 50 years have been estimated to be $0.9 billion, the majority of which will be common law claims. Comcare will be fully funded for the cost of managing the claims. While the Government’s 2005-06 Budget proposals provided $86 million to the Employment and Workplace Relations portfolio over a five year period for the costs of asbestos claims, this bill is not expected to have a significant effect on the level of asbestos liabilities.</para>

<inline ref="R2357">IMPORT PROCESSING CHARGES AMENDMENT BILL 2005</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">This bill is the first of two in the legislative package for the restructure of the cost recovery regime for import related services which was originally proposed to support the new management and processing of cargo by customs. Cost recovery for import related services has been in place since 1997.</para>
<para class="block">This bill provides the legislative authority to restructure the import declaration and the warehouse declaration processing charges contained in the Import Processing Charges Act 2001 (the IPC Act 2001). The structure under the existing IPC Act 2001 is based on the value of imported goods and applies the same charge irrespective of the method of importation. It is proposed to change this structure and instead base the charges on the method of importation, either by sea, air or post without reference to the value of the imported goods. This new structure will be the same as the original charging structure currently operating under the Import Processing Charges Act 1997. In addition, the second bill in this package will repeal two cargo reporting charges relating to low value consignments, which will be incorporated into the restructured import declaration and warehouse declaration processing charges.</para>
<para class="block">Consultation with industry in relation to the restructuring proposal has occurred. Industry representatives support the requirement to restructure the charges as proposed and also support the amalgamation of the charges for low value consignments into the import declaration and warehouse declaration processing charges.</para>
<para class="block">As previously stated this bill will ensure that the charges are equitable in their application to the users of import processing services.</para>

<inline ref="R2348">CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (IMPORT PROCESSING CHARGES) BILL 2005</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">This bill is the second of two in the legislative package for the restructure of the cost recovery regime for import related services.</para>
<para class="block">This bill provides the legislative authority to repeal the self assessed clearance declaration charge and the screening charge. These charges apply to the processing of low value consignments that do not require an import declaration or a warehouse declaration. The costs associated with the processing of these low value consignments will be incorporated into the charges being amended by the first Bill of this package. These amendments are consistent with Commonwealth cost recovery guidelines whereby charges that detract from administrative simplicity are eliminated thus enhancing the cost effectiveness of the total Customs cost recovery regime.</para>
<para class="block">Since introduction of the current cost recovery regime in 1997, Customs has consulted with industry on a regular basis under the auspices of the Customs National Consultative Committee. The Committee comprises representatives from the various sectors of the importing community. Due to industry concerns raised in the Committee and in other forums in relation to the charges imposed on low value consignments, the Government has decided to streamline the total charging package.</para>
<para class="block">It is projected that the self assessed clearance declaration charge and the screening charge would apply to two million low value consignments in the financial year 2005-06. These consignments would predominantly be imported by air. Both of these charges will be repealed, resulting in cost reductions in the administrative burden placed on the importing community and significant savings for importers of low value consignments.</para>
<para class="block">Industry agrees with elimination of these two charges and there incorporation into the import declaration and warehouse declaration processing charges.</para>
<para class="block">As already stated, this package will streamline the Customs cost recovery regime and significantly reduce administrative complexity.</para>

<inline ref="R2329">SUPERANNUATION BILL 2005</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Superannuation Bill 2005 (the bill), together with the Superannuation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2005 (the Consequential Bill), will provide for the separation of the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, the PSSAP, from the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, the PSS.</para>
<para class="block">The bill will also provide a framework for Australian Government employers to offer employees and office holders with choice of fund.</para>
<para class="block">The PSSAP will be established as a fully funded accumulation scheme for new Australian Government employees and office holders and certain other persons from 1 July 2005. It was established as a sub plan of the PSS by the 20th Amending Deed, which amended the Trust Deed and Rules under the Superannuation Act 1990.</para>
<para class="block">The bill will provide for the PSSAP to commence as a scheme separate from the PSS. This will allow it to operate on the same basis as similar superannuation schemes.</para>
<para class="block">While it exists as part of the PSS, the PSSAP must operate within the framework of a largely unfunded defined benefit scheme, rather than a framework appropriate for a fully funded accumulation scheme. This requires it to include features that are not usual for accumulation schemes</para>
<para class="block">Although the PSSAP will be separate from the PSS, the PSS Board will continue to be responsible for the PSSAP and the Commissioner for Superannuation will continue to provide administrative services to the Board in respect of the new scheme. The PSS Board will also be responsible for the new PSSAP Fund established by the bill.</para>
<para class="block">Like the PSS, the Rules for the PSSAP will be provided for by Trust Deed. Following the passage of the bill a new Trust Deed and Rules will be made for the PSSAP in essentially the same form as the existing Rules for the PSSAP as a sub plan of the PSS.</para>
<para class="block">It is intended that Australian Government employees and office holders will be treated in the separate superannuation scheme in the same way as they would have been treated in the sub plan of the PSS and employer contributions will be payable in the same circumstances.</para>
<para class="block">However the bill, together with the Consequential Bill, will require new Australian Government employees and office holders to be given choice of fund arrangements from 1 July 2006. Their employer may also offer them choice of fund from as early as 1 July 2005. This framework will provide them with unprecedented flexibility for investing their superannuation savings and will address the rigid arrangements currently in place where membership of one scheme is mandated for most employees.</para>
<para class="block">From 1 July 2006, Australian Government employers will be required to comply with the choice requirements of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 Act (SG Act), like most private sector employers.</para>
<para class="block">The legislation also provides that the PSSAP will be the employer (or default) fund for Australian Public Service employees and certain other prescribed persons who do not choose a fund. Other employers will have the flexibility to nominate the PSSAP or another appropriate complying superannuation fund or Retirement Savings Account in these circumstances.</para>
<para class="block">The proposed changes do not affect existing Australian Government employees at 30 June 2005, including those employees who are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme or the PSS.</para>
<para class="block">Also the arrangements will not generally affect those new employees who have an existing relevant interest in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS) or the PSS, for example where a person has a PSS preserved benefit. Those employees will continue to be eligible to join those schemes as appropriate.</para>

<inline ref="R2327">SUPERANNUATION (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2005</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Superannuation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2005 (the bill) will amend eight Acts and the Trust Deed under the Superannuation Act 1990 as a consequence of the establishment of the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, the PSSAP, as a separate superannuation scheme and will allow Australian Government employees and office holders to have choice of fund. The Superannuation Bill 2005 will establish the PSSAP as a separate scheme from the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, the PSS.</para>
<para class="block">The Superannuation Act 1990, which provides for the PSS, will confirm that the PSS will close to new employees from 1 July 2005 with the commencement of the PSSAP.</para>
<para class="block">The Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 is being amended to allow Australian Government employers to comply with the choice of fund requirements until 1 July 2006 in respect of employees who are PSSAP members. From that date, employers will be required to meet the choice of fund requirements in respect of new employees in the same manner as most private sector employers.</para>
<para class="block">The Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988 provides for Superannuation Guarantee type contributions for Australian Government employees and office holders who are not Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme or PSS members. The bill will amend that Act so that it does not apply to new employees and office holders from 1 July 2006. Superannuation will be provided for these persons as agreed with their employer subject to employers providing contributions at least in accordance with the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. Also, these employees and office holders may join the PSSAP if eligible to do so.</para>
<para class="block">The bill will also amend the Productivity Benefit Act to ensure that the Act does not apply in respect of PSSAP members who have chosen to cease PSSAP membership in accordance with the choice of fund arrangements.</para>
<para class="block">The Governor-General Act 1974 and the Judges’ Pensions Act 1968 are being amended as a consequence of the closure of the Productivity Benefit Act to new employees. The amendments provide safety net Superannuation Guarantee minimum support to the Governor-General and Judges in rare circumstances where the benefit otherwise payable would be less than the Superannuation Guarantee minimum employer superannuation.</para>
<para class="block">The bill makes minor amendments to the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and to the Trust Deed PSS. These amendments concern the establishment of the PSSAP as a separate scheme. The Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990 also includes minor amendments to allow Australian Government employers to provide employees with choice of funds.</para>

<inline ref="R2351">SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF SURCHARGE) BILL 2005</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">Over the past few years the government has made a number of significant announcements and implemented a number of important measures aimed at improving the superannuation and retirement income arrangements for all Australians. These changes have demonstrated the government’s commitment to assisting Australians to build financial self-reliance for their retirement. Initiatives announced in the 2001 policy statement A Better Superannuation System have enhanced the overall attractiveness, accessibility and security of superannuation. This included the introduction of the co-contribution scheme for eligible low-income earners who make voluntary superannuation contributions, and reductions in superannuation surcharge rates. The policy paper A More Flexible and Adaptable Retirement Income System, released on 25 February 2004, outlined further measures to improve the accessibility, flexibility and integrity of the retirement income system and to reduce red tape. This included the removal of work tests for individuals under the age of 65 who wanted to contribute to superannuation.</para>
<para class="block">A significant boost to superannuation savings was also provided in the 2004-05 budget, which contained incentives to save for retirement worth $2.8 billion over four years, including an expansion of the co-contribution scheme and further reductions in the superannuation surcharge rates. More recently, the government has secured the passage of legislation to deliver choice of fund and reconfirmed its commitment to the superannuation contribution splitting policy. Unfortunately, both of these measures had been held up in the Senate during the last term of the last parliament. In the 2002-03 budget, the government announced that the superannuation surcharge would be reduced at the rate of 1½ per cent per annum from 2002-03 so that it would have reduced to 10.5 per cent in 2004-05. Unfortunately, that reduction was opposed in the Senate and the government was only able to secure through the Senate a reduction to 13½ per cent in 2004-05. In the 2004-05 budget, however, the government announced a policy to reduce the superannuation surcharge, at a rate of 2½ per cent per annum, to 12½ per cent in 2004-05 and reducing to 7½ per cent in 2006-07. Again, unfortunately, opposition from the Labor Party in the Senate prevented the reduction as announced in that budget. The government undertook at the last election to reduce further the maximum surcharge rates.</para>
<para class="block">In pursuance of the policy that we took to the last election, the government has now reviewed the superannuation surcharge. The government now proposes to remove this impost on superannuation savings and abolish the surcharge payable on individual surchargeable contributions and relevant termination payments with effect from 1 July 2005. Approximately 600,000 Australians will receive a boost to their superannuation savings as a result of this measure. It is estimated to cost $2.5 billion over the forward estimates. The superannuation surcharge was introduced in 1996 at a time when the budget was deeply in deficit as a result of Labor’s economic mismanagement. It was introduced in 1996 in part to drive the budget back into balance. The government laid down a policy in 1996 to drive the budget back into balance from a $10.3 billion deficit which the Labor Party had left in place.</para>
<para class="block">After bringing down 10 budgets and eight surpluses this measure is no longer required to keep the budget in balance. Accordingly, the government is moving in this parliament to abolish it from 1 July 2005. As I said, 600,000 Australians will receive a boost to their superannuation savings as a result of this measure. The measure presented in this bill will also provide incentives for individuals to make additional voluntary savings through the superannuation system and simplify the operation of the superannuation system.</para>
<para class="block">This will be a major improvement in terms of reducing complexity. The government, when it looked at reducing the rates, as it had tried to do in the 2002-03 budget, was minded of the fact that as the rates reduced, and therefore the revenue raised by it reduced, the administration costs as a proportion increased, because there is quite some considerable complexity in the administration of a superannuation surcharge. That is, administration and compliance costs which may have been justified by a rate of 15 per cent could no longer be sustained at lower rates and as a consequence it makes sense to abolish the superannuation surcharge in its entirety.</para>
<para class="block">The bill that I have commended will do that. We look forward to support from all sides of politics in the abolition of the superannuation surcharge. I commend the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Abolition of Surcharge) Bill 2005.</para>

<inline ref="R2352">AGED CARE AMENDMENT (EXTRA SERVICE) BILL 2005</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">This bill demonstrates the Government’s strong commitment to ensuring a robust and viable aged care sector for the future where the element of choice is a key ingredient for both residents and providers of aged care services. This bill implements one of the measures from the Australian Government’s 2005-06 Budget package.</para>
<para class="block">Expansion of the Extra Service program will allow the sector to respond to rising consumer expectations through providing residents with increased choice in relation to hotel-type services. At the same time, removing the requirement to renew Extra Service status after five years will both decrease red tape for providers and increase their ability to access capital for rebuilding or refurbishing.</para>
<para class="block">The individual needs of older Australians remain this Government’s priority. This measure seeks to increase the opportunity for consumer choice in residential aged care through the further reform of the Extra Service program. An aged care service with Extra Service status allows residents to choose, and pay for, a higher than average level of hotel-type services, including accommodation, the range and quality of food and the provision of non-care services such as recreational and personal interest activities.</para>
<para class="block">While Government programs, including accreditation and certification, have raised significantly the standards of care and accommodation, Extra Service offers greater choice in non-care related services.</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that the aged care sector is capable of delivering high quality and affordable care to older Australians. In this bill it removes a significant impediment to expansion of the Extra Service program in aged care by removing some of the red tape involved.</para>
<para class="block">Aged care providers have long felt that the high level of Government regulation of the Extra Service program has stymied its expansion. In particular, they have singled out the requirement that they have to reapply for Extra Service status every five years—notwithstanding that during those five years they may have had no complaints and no problems with compliance. The process of reapplying for Extra Service status is not only time-consuming and expensive, because it involves looking at each and every “extra” service which is offered by the particular home, but prevents long-term planning in relation to the capital needs of the home and may act as a deterrent to financiers and other investors.</para>
<para class="block">Considerable investment in infrastructure is needed over the next decade to ensure the supply and quality of aged care homes grows in line with the increase in the number of older Australians who need care. The Australian Government recognises that over the next decade there will be a continuing need for capital funding so that existing homes can be well maintained, new homes built and existing facilities refurbished.</para>
<para class="block">The ability of the aged care industry to make this investment will depend on its ability to raise capital. The Report on the Review of Pricing Arrangements in Aged Care by Professor Warren Hogan noted that there were significant levels of investment in new buildings and upgrading older buildings. It was reported that in 2002-03, $821.4 million of new building, refurbishment and upgrading work in aged care was completed, involving an estimated 22.8 per cent of all residential aged care services. A further $2 billion of building work was completed or underway in 2003-04 with 25 per cent of all homes planning new work.</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Government has invested almost $1 billion in aged care homes for capital improvements or as increases in subsidy payments. This included over $513 million (or $3,500 per resident) as a one-off payment to providers of residential services in recognition of the forward plan for improved building standards for aged care homes.</para>
<para class="block">Aged care providers have argued that a lack of access to capital has been an impediment to the expansion of the Extra Service program. As well as building new homes, capital can be used to upgrade existing aged care homes to better provide quality buildings, furniture, fittings and equipment that enhance the comfort and amenity of residents. Services may choose to focus on delivering higher standards of amenity for those residents who elect to pay for these higher standards.</para>
<para class="block">Growing demand, as the population ages, means that we must ensure that the aged care sector is sustainable over the long term. The challenge is to balance cost-sharing with equity of access, while continuing to improve the quality of care and the fabric of the buildings in which such care is delivered.</para>
<para class="block">This measure, in allowing certainty for Extra Service providers and increasing their access to capital, will ultimately allow increased choice for consumers. This will not come at the expense of people who cannot afford to pay. The current limit of a maximum of 15 per cent of residential aged care places in each State or Territory will remain to ensure that access to care is not affected for people who cannot afford to pay for Extra Service or do not desire such extra services.</para>
<para class="block">These changes are the result of the government listening to and responding to address these issues. We have acted in a timely and sensitive way to keep the benefits of the aged care reforms flowing to older Australians now and into the future.</para>

<inline ref="R2311">CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill (the bill) will make a number of amendments to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 (the Act).</para>
<para class="block">Firstly, this bill will amend the Governor-General’s regulation-making power to allow regulations to be made that are inconsistent with the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (DDA) and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (SDA), if the inconsistency is necessary for aviation safety.</para>
<para class="block">In terms of allowing existing and future regulations to be inconsistent with the SDA, the bill will limit this inconsistency to regulations relating to medical standards, where necessary for aviation safety. For example, there may be a need to impose special conditions on pregnant pilots in their final trimester, to minimise any risk to aviation safety arising as a result of sudden complications.</para>
<para class="block">On the other hand, in terms of allowing existing and future regulations to be inconsistent with the DDA, the inconsistency will unavoidably need to be broader. For example, passengers sitting next to aircraft emergency exits should not be suffering from any disability which would render them incapable of opening the exit hatch in an emergency. Aircraft must conform to onerous design standards which may, in a limited number of cases, render them incapable of being modified to provide unassisted access for some disabled passengers. These types of provisions are important for aviation safety, and should not be construed as being unlawfully discriminatory.</para>
<para class="block">The bill also includes provisions that put beyond doubt the validity of existing regulations and past actions based on those regulations. This amendment is necessary to clarify existing uncertainty in relation to the validity of actions carried out in accordance with existing safety regulations where such actions may appear to have been inconsistent with either the DDA or the SDA.</para>
<para class="block">However, the amendments regarding inconsistency with the DDA and SDA, build in a consultation mechanism requiring the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to consult the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in the preparation of future regulations that contain provisions that are inconsistent with the DDA and the SDA. This was a recommendation of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References and Legislation Committee that conducted an inquiry into the bill in June 2004.</para>
<para class="block">In addition, regulations which have the potential to be inconsistent with the DDA and SDA will be subject to clearance by the Human Rights Branch of the Attorney-General’s Department, and will undergo comprehensive consultation and Parliamentary scrutiny.</para>
<para class="block">Although the Government acknowledges that these amendments will allow inconsistency between aviation safety regulations and anti-discrimination legislation, it is the Government’s belief that any such regulations will not be unnecessarily restrictive or discriminatory, especially when viewed in the context of the Government’s obligation to protect the safety of flight crew, fare-paying passengers, other aircraft and people on the ground.</para>
<para class="block">These elements of the bill re-introduce the content of the Civil Aviation (Relationship with Anti-Discrimination Legislation) Bill 2004, which lapsed with the August 2004 dissolution of Parliament.</para>
<para class="block">The amendments will allow Australia to harmonise its aviation safety regulations with international standards and meet its international obligations as a member State of the International Civil Aviation Organization.</para>
<para class="block">The bill will also insert a reference note into both the DDA and the SDA to inform members of the public about the amendments to the Governor-General’s regulation-making power that this bill is introducing.</para>
<para class="block">Lastly, the bill will make a range of minor technical amendments that will correct errors and standardise references in the Act in relation to aircraft that are registered in countries other than Australia. The amendments will also create a requirement in the Act that the holders of an Air Operator Certificate (AOC) must continue to satisfy CASA that they meet the conditions in their AOC. At present, this requirement is included in a Civil Aviation Order and it is more appropriate for it to be included in the provisions relating to AOCs that are in the Act. These amendments were being progressed under the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment (Mutual Recognition with New Zealand and Other Matters) Bill 2003 which also lapsed when Parliament was prorogued on 31 August 2004.</para>
<para class="block">Each one of the amendments in this bill is testimony to the Government’s commitment to measured reform which ensures efficient and effective regulation, accessibility and a world class standard of safety for operators and consumers alike.</para>

</para>
<para class="block">I am pleased to announce that the major components of the Higher Education Support Act 2003 have come into effect as of 1 January this year. The reforms contained in the new legislative framework give universities access to the funding they need to deliver world-class higher education, with a focus on quality learning outcomes. Laying the foundation for this is an increase in public investment in the sector of around $2.6 billion over five years from 2004. The Australian Government will provide some $11 billion over ten years in new support for the higher education sector from 2004.</para>
<para class="block">There will be almost 36,000 new Commonwealth supported student places added to the higher education sector over the next five years and more funding for each Commonwealth supported student, linked to improvements in how universities are managed. In addition, there are extra funds for regional universities and new schemes and funding to encourage excellence in teaching, more collaboration between institutions and a renewed focus on equity. There will also be new places for the National Priority areas of nursing and teaching and special fee arrangements to encourage people to enrol in these fields.</para>
<para class="block">The benefits to the Australian higher education system will become increasingly apparent as students and higher education providers take full advantage of the opportunities that the reforms provide.</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Government is taking this opportunity to make a number of technical revisions to refine and enhance the effective implementation of the Act and give certainty to higher education providers and students.</para>

</para>
<para class="block">The primary purpose of this bill is to amend the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to appropriate additional funding to support the provision of high quality tutorial assistance to Indigenous students who move away from their remote community to attend school.</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Government places great importance on achieving better educational outcomes for Indigenous students. It is strategically targeting funding to maximise school performance and to more heavily support Indigenous students of greatest disadvantage—those from remote areas.</para>
<para class="block">For many Indigenous children in remote areas, their best chance for educational success is to leave their community and attend a school in a non-remote location. For some Indigenous children, it is the only option they have. This transition can however be difficult. Failure to keep pace with peers academically can be a key reason for Indigenous students not settling into a new school or dropping out of school early and returning to their community. Students from remote communities require significant levels of support to make an effective transition.</para>
<para class="block">The new funding appropriated by this bill will provide Indigenous students from remote communities with tutorial support in their first year of schooling when they move to a non-remote location to continue their education. These students will receive up to four hours tuition per week for up to 32 weeks in their first year away from home.</para>
<para class="block">Between 2006 and 2008, this extra tutorial assistance will help an estimated 2,040 students undertake and complete their schooling.</para>
<para class="block">A further purpose of this bill is to facilitate improved vocational education and training arrangements for Indigenous Australians. The move to a new national training system from 1 July 2005 and the negotiation of a new Commonwealth-State vocational education and training funding agreement with States and Territories present us with a valuable opportunity to make significant improvements to the economic, social and personal lives of Indigenous Australians.</para>

<inline ref="R2362">MARITIME TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL 2005</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">It is a reality that national security remains a high priority for this Government. It is essential that we continue to protect the maritime industry from very real threats. It is in this context that I present this bill for the Parliament’s consideration.</para>
<para class="block">Maritime security is under constant review to ensure that measures remain appropriate given current intelligence threats to the Australian maritime industry. During 2004 a review of maritime security was undertaken and a range of measures to further strengthen Australia’s preventative maritime security arrangements were recommended.</para>
<para class="block">This included the establishment of a special taskforce to undertake a comprehensive review of the security arrangements for offshore oil and gas facilities, and the introduction of the Maritime Security Identification Card (MSIC). The MSIC will be issued to persons requiring unmonitored access to maritime security zones on completion of satisfactory background checks.</para>
<para class="block">The Maritime Transport Security Amendment Bill 2005 has two parts. The first part will security regulate Australia’s offshore oil and gas industry, and is necessary for the protection of offshore oil and gas industry personnel, to safeguard oil and gas supplies, and for the protection of offshore oil and gas infrastructure. The second part introduces a range of minor amendments to support the introduction of the MSIC Scheme.</para>
<para class="block">There is evidence to suggest that Australia’s offshore oil and gas industry is a potential terrorist target. Indeed, in newspaper reports this year the following statement appeared:</para>
<para class="block">In 2002, Ubeid al-Qurashi, a pseudonym of an Osama Bin Laden lieutenant, wrote an article saying that Western economies cannot stand high oil prices. One way to strike fear into the West, he wrote is by repeated attacks on oil installations or on tankers. After the attack on the French tanker Limburg, in October 2002, the al-Qa’eda political bureau described the attack as not merely an attack on a tanker. Rather, al-Qaeda said, it was an attack against international transport lines and an attack on the West’s commercial lifeline, petroleum.</para>
<para class="block">In addition, in April 2004 terrorists attacked two offshore oil facilities south of the Iraqi city of Basra, using multiple boat borne explosives. Three coalition sailors died intercepting this attack. Al-Qa’ida has recently threatened to target western economies, including the oil and gas industry. There is therefore a need for the implementation of effective security measures to limit the capacity of terrorists to adversely affect the Australian offshore oil and gas industry.</para>
<para class="block">The potential impacts of a terrorist attack on an Australian offshore oil and gas facility include economic loss, loss of life, and the disruption of Australia’s domestic and international oil and gas supplies. The annual contribution of the oil and gas sector to the Australian economy exceeds 18 billion dollars. Victorian industrial and residential gas supplies were interrupted for two weeks, following the 1998 Longford gas explosion. The impact of this disaster and the substantial contribution of the oil and gas sector to the Australian economy emphasise the need for the implementation of appropriate offshore oil and gas preventive security measures.</para>
<para class="block">Given the intent and potential capability terrorist groups have to target offshore oil and gas facilities, the Australian Government decided to establish the Taskforce on Offshore Maritime Security. This taskforce reviewed the security arrangements of offshore oil and gas facilities. In December 2004, following the recommendations of that Taskforce, the Australian Government announced it would be extending the Maritime Transport Security Act 2003; to security regulate Australia’s offshore oil and gas industry.</para>
<para class="block">The Maritime Transport Security Amendment Bill 2005 security regulates offshore oil and gas facilities located within the boundaries of Australia’s territorial sea, the Exclusive Economic Zone and the continental shelf. The bill applies to offshore oil and gas facilities used in the extraction of oil and gas, including fixed production platforms, and floating production and storage facilities. The bill also security regulates offshore oil and gas service providers, such as helicopter and supply vessel operators servicing offshore oil and gas facilities. The security regulation of offshore oil and gas facilities will contribute to the secure transit of security regulated ships currently interacting with offshore oil and gas facilities.</para>
<para class="block">The Maritime Transport Security Amendment Bill 2005 establishes an outcomes based security framework for Australia’s offshore oil and gas industry. Offshore oil and gas industry participants will be required to submit security plans that consider the practical needs of the operators, as well as the special nature and location of individual facilities. These security plans will need to be based on the findings of offshore facility site specific security risk assessments, and should complement, rather than duplicate existing management and safety plans.</para>
<para class="block">The Department of Transport and Regional Services will be responsible for regulating the offshore oil and gas industry’s security arrangements. Offshore oil and gas industry participants will be required to submit security plans to the Department of Transport and Regional Services for approval. This Department will also be responsible for auditing offshore oil and gas facilities to ensure these facilities are compliant with the requirements set out in their approved security plans.</para>
<para class="block">Like maritime industry participants, offshore oil and gas industry participants will be responsible for funding the security measures specified in their security plans. The Australian Government recognises this may impose costs on offshore oil and gas facility operators, however given the global security environment, these costs are now part of the cost of doing business.</para>
<para class="block">Now, moving on to the Maritime Security Identity Card. Currently there are no legislative requirements to check the background of people working in Australian Ports, Ships and Offshore Oil and Gas Facilities, as is the case in the Aviation Industry. The MSIC Scheme will provide the maritime and offshore sectors, with assurance that personnel requiring unmonitored access to sensitive areas have met background checking requirements.</para>
<para class="block">Whilst the current provisions in the Maritime Transport Security Act 2003 provides the power to make most of the regulations required to introduce and implement the MSIC Scheme, the Amendment Bill clarifies and makes explicit two aspects of the scheme. The bill ensures that any reasonable costs incurred by MSIC Issuing Bodies in the issue and production of an MSIC can be recovered.</para>
<para class="block">The second amendment enables regulation making powers in the disclosure of information between entities involved in coordinating and conducting background checks of applicants for the purpose of determining if a person is eligible to hold an MSIC.</para>
<para class="block">The Maritime Transport Security Amendment Bill 2005 is vital for the protection of Australia’s offshore oil and gas infrastructure, the protection of offshore oil and gas industry personnel, and for ensuring the uninterrupted supply of Australian oil and gas to both the domestic and international energy markets. The bill also includes amendments to support the introduction of the MSIC Scheme. The MSIC Scheme will require maritime and offshore oil and gas personnel to undergo background checking before they can be granted unmonitored access to maritime security zones.</para>

</para>
<para class="block">The primary purpose of this bill is to increase the existing maximum allowable rate for the rice research and development (R&amp;D) levy from $2 to $3 per tonne. This proposed increase has been progressed after a request from the rice industry.</para>
<para class="block">The rice industry is now facing a third year of significant drought related production downturns which have placed financial pressures on the industry’s R&amp;D programmes due to subsequent reductions in levy revenue. The rice industry is seeking an increase in the maximum allowable levy rate to provide them with the flexibility to better manage future fluctuations in levy revenue. This will allow the industry to ensure adequate funding is maintained for core R&amp;D programmes.</para>
<para class="block">The Government believes that by using innovation to drive productivity growth and boost profitability on farms, Australia’s rural industries can continue to play a key part in maintaining our national prosperity. Australia’s rural industries have also long recognised this principle and have shown a longstanding and widespread willingness to invest in innovation through industry-wide levies. In this context the Government was happy to put forward these changes to assist the rice industry manage their R&amp;D programmes into the future and for producers to continue to take up R&amp;D outputs, whether they be to adopt new practices or bring out new products.</para>
<para class="block">The bill will also provide mechanisms for the introduction of regulations for the implementation of the operative rate of the rice R&amp;D levy. Currently, changes to the rate of the levy are done through a Ministerial Declaration published in the Gazette. This bill enables these functions to be rolled into new regulations which will be tabled soon after this bill receives Royal Assent. By switching to regulations it will bring the operation of the rice levy into line with the majority of other primary industry levies. It will also provide a greater level of scrutiny by Parliament than is available under the existing arrangements.</para>
<para class="block">The Government will only favourably consider a request to raise the operative levy rate beyond the current $2 cap if the request demonstrates compliance with the Government’s Levy Principles and Guidelines. These guidelines include a requirement that there be widespread industry support for such a request. The current operative levy rate will not be affected by this bill.</para>

</para>
<para class="block">The Government is committed to achieving the best education outcomes for male and female schools students throughout Australia.</para>
<para class="block">A House of Representatives Inquiry into the education of boys in June 2003 <inline font-style="italic">Boys: Getting it Right</inline> examined the problems particular to the education of boys.</para>
<para class="block">That Report noted that boys are not achieving as well as girls across abroad spectrum of measures of educational attainment.</para>
<para class="block">The report identified significant public concern about the decline in the number of male teachers in schools, in particular in primary schools, in Australia, and expressed support for more men in schools.</para>
<para class="block">The figures speak for themselves.</para>
<para class="block">In 2003, only 20.9 percent of primary teaching staff in Australia were men.</para>
<para class="block">This problem is only getting worse.</para>
<para class="block">In 2003, males constituted 26.5% of the 37,530 domestic students enrolled in initial teaching courses specifically for primary and secondary teaching in Australia.</para>
<para class="block">In 2003, males were only 18.8 percent of domestic students training to become primary school teachers.</para>
<para class="block">The Government’s Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill will assist in addressing the problem by amending the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to provide that a person may offer scholarships for persons of a particular gender in respect of participation in a teaching course.</para>
<para class="block">The section would apply only if the purpose of doing so is to redress a gender imbalance in teaching, that is, an imbalance in the ratio of male to female teachers in schools in Australia, or in a category of schools or in a particular school.</para>
<para class="block">This Bill means that educational authorities and others can offer scholarships to encourage male teachers into the profession in a manner consistent with the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill is drafted in gender neutral language which means that the amendments would allow discrimination in favour of females if a gender imbalance in favour of males were to emerge generally or in a region or sector.</para>
<para class="block">The Government’s acknowledgement of the importance of both men and women in teaching in our society, and the Government’s commitment to encouraging men into the profession, will help to change people’s perceptions about the role of men in the profession for the future.</para>
<para class="block">Students throughout Australia will benefit from having both male and female role models in the teaching profession.</para>
<para class="block">This Bill is a vital measure for addressing the existing gender imbalance in the profession.</para>
<para class="block">It complements the Government’s other major strategies for addressing the particular challenge of increasing education outcomes for boys, including:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>Boys’ education is a priority area for the $159.2 million Australian Government Quality Teacher Program; and</para>

<item>
<para>The provision of $27 million over six years to 2008 for boys’ education, including over $19 million for the Success for Boys initiative, through which grants will be provided to 1600 schools to implement projects focussing particularly on opportunities for boys to benefit from positive male role models, around $8 million already committed for initiatives such as the Boys’ Education Lighthouse Schools (BELS) initiative and research into significant areas of education relevant to boys’ education.</para>

<inline ref="R2361">SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2005</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">This bill gives effect to announcements made by the Government earlier this year to ease the transition to superannuation choice for businesses and employees, and minimise the burden on employers in complying with their choice obligations.</para>
<para class="block">The Superannuation Holding Account Special Account was originally established to receive small superannuation amounts from employers who cannot find a superannuation fund. This facility is no longer needed, as Retirement Savings Accounts (RSAs) offer similar low-cost benefits for employers. This bill will amend the legislation to make the Superannuation Holding Account Special Account an eligible choice fund until 30 June 2006, giving employers a further year to make arrangements to contribute to a superannuation fund or retirement savings account. From 1 July 2006, the Superannuation Holding Account Special Account will be closed to new employer deposits.</para>
<para class="block">This bill will amend the choice of fund legislation to specify additional circumstances where an employer does not have to provide an employee with the standard choice form, thus avoiding the imposition of unnecessary cost on some employers.</para>
<para class="block">It is important that employees are not discouraged from exercising their right to choose a fund through the actions of their employer. This bill ensures that employers can not recoup part or all of the administrative costs associated with implementing their choice of fund obligations by charging employees.</para>
<para class="block">The choice legislation ensures that fund trustees do not try to inappropriately induce employers to move their employee’s contributions to the trustee’s fund by offering them personal incentives. This bill will make the Australian Securities and Investment Commission the agency that administers this provision.</para>
<para class="block">The bill clarifies a number of matters, such as the test for whether a defined benefit fund is in surplus, the obligation on the employer to contribute to the fund specified as the default fund on the standard choice form, and the choice of fund penalty provisions.</para>
<para class="block">Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I commend this bill.</para>

<inline ref="R2334">TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES No. 3) BILL 2005</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">This bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of changes and improvements to Australia’s taxation system.</para>
<para class="block">Firstly, the bill will implement a number of proposals to increase flexibility for charitable funds, ancillary funds and prescribed private funds, and hence further encourage charitable giving in Australia. The bill expands the concessions relating to the capital gains tax provisions, distributions by charitable funds, the income tax exemption for charities and the refund of franking credits provisions. The measure gives effect to the Government’s announcement in the 2004-05 Budget.</para>
<para class="block">The amendment in Schedule 2 to this bill is technical in nature and deals with of the recently expanded foreign branch profits exemption. The expanded exemption, in conjunction with Australia’s treaties, could have resulted in foreign branch income and gains derived from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic not being taxed in Australia or the country in which the company operates. Schedule 2 to this bill reinstates the way Australian companies with foreign branch income and gains from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic were taxed prior to the implementation of the expanded foreign branch income exemption. This will ensure that such amounts continue to be taxed in Australia.</para>
<para class="block">The Commissioner of Taxation can release taxpayer information to certain law enforcement agencies such as police forces and various Crime Commissions, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the information is relevant to establishing whether a serious offence has been committed or to the making of a proceeds of crime order. The third measure will add the Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia to the list of law enforcement agencies to which taxpayer information can be provided.</para>
<para class="block">The fourth measure will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to make a technical correction, to clarify that certain government institutions that are charitable institutions at law are not eligible fringe benefits tax rebatable employer status from 1 July 2005. This amendment will ensure that the status quo is not changed.</para>
<para class="block">Finally, this bill introduces a standard definition of a dependant: a child less than 21 years or a full-time student less than 25 years. This means there will be a single set of age criteria for the housekeeper, child housekeeper, medical expenses and zone tax offsets, as well as the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge. It will provide consistency for taxpayers and will allow more taxpayers to access the dependant-related offsets, the concessional Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge thresholds offsets and the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge family thresholds.</para>

<para class="block">Australia’s fisheries industry makes a significant contribution to the wealth of the nation, and the Commonwealth government plays a pivotal role in the regulation and management of the industries surrounding the exploitation of our marine resources. While the Australian Democrats are very supportive of the fisheries industry, we are concerned that Commonwealth-managed fisheries are not being managed on a sustainable basis. Fisheries managers seek to maximise the sustainable yield of our fisheries; however, they do so on the basis of incomplete information and without adequate regard for the precautionary principle.</para>
<para>At least a dozen species targeted in Commonwealth-managed fisheries are known to be overfished, and in many more the status of the fish stocks remains unknown. The state of the stock of southern bluefin tuna, however, remains in little doubt. Southern bluefin tuna, SBT, is a species highly prized on international markets. Australia, as one of the major fishing nations for this species, has participated for a number of years at an international level in failed efforts to form the groundwork for sustainable fishing throughout the species’ range.</para>
<para>Time and time again research has indicated that the parental biomass of SBT continues to decline and is currently at historically low levels. It has declined by up to 93 per cent since 1960, when substantial fishing had already occurred. Southern bluefin tuna has undergone a population reduction of at least 80 per cent over three generations according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. The government’s Bureau of Rural Sciences has put present SBT parental biomass in the order of seven to 15 per cent of that which existed in 1960, a time when substantial reductions had already occurred, and in the order of 25 to 53 per cent of the 1980 level. These are drastic and biologically unsustainable declines that show no signs of reversal.</para>
<para>SBT has been fished extensively, primarily by Australia, Japan and New Zealand. The SBT fishery began in earnest in the 1950s, with Japan exploiting stock on the high seas and Australia fishing the species within its own coastal waters. The Japanese fishery expanded rapidly, culminating in a peak long-line catch for Japan in the early 1960s of some 81,605 tonnes. In contrast to that, today the total global allowable catch for SBT remains at around 15,000 tonnes—and yet stocks still show no sign of recovery. The 1996 report of the Scientific Committee of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, CCSBT, estimated that the parental biomass in 1995 was five to eight per cent of the 1960 parental biomass, which had already declined due to significant catches by Japanese fleets in the 1950s. In fact, 1961, 1960 and 1959 were the peak three years for total global SBT catch in the history of the fishery. The 2003 spawning stock biomass was estimated to be between 25 and 47 per cent of that in 1980 and between 37 and 58 per cent of that in 1986—equivalent to a 50 per cent decline in a single generation.</para>
<para>Further, projections over the years 1992 to 1997 consistently overestimated the parental biomass in the following two years by up to 60 per cent. Whilst virtual population analyses by both Australia and Japan have indicated continuous parental biomass decline between 1980 and 1993, all assessments since 1984 have predicted that reversal of parental biomass decline would occur two to three years after the year of assessment. Population estimates and projections by Australian and New Zealand scientists indicate continued population decline. To date, these estimates are considered to be overoptimistic, as predicted trends have failed to match the actual persistent decline in spawning fish. There has been no evidence of a reversal of the species’ decline to date.</para>
<para>It became evident in the early 1980s that the parental stock had been dangerously overfished. As a consequence, Japan, Australia and New Zealand introduced a voluntary limit to their total catch through annual trilateral agreements within the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna and eventually introduced quotas. In the 1980s, SBT numbers had undergone such a reduction that less than 75 per cent of the agreed quota was caught.</para>
<para>Within Australia’s fisheries, SBT has been identified by the federal government’s own agencies as the species most under threat, with its status listed as ‘overfished’ for many years now. A large decline in catch per unit of effort is evident over the past 30 years, with a decrease by 1992 of 56 per cent of the 1980 catch per unit of effort, or CPUE, levels. Nominal CPUE of the parental fish is now 26 per cent of the 1980 level and just two per cent of the 1960 level. SBT parental biomass remains at historically low levels and present parental stock levels are significantly below the biologically safe level. As an indicator of the status of the SBT fishery, the CPUE figures correspond with findings that excessive fishing has reduced significantly the number of spawning SBT. Under current global catch rates, the SBT spawning stock will not recover by 2020, and therefore there is a distinct probability that it will not increase at all. In this context, the decision by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Campbell, to accredit the fishery as sustainable is even more incomprehensible.</para>
<para>The biological characteristics of the SBT make the species slow to recover from overfishing and vulnerable to particular fishing methods. SBT is a highly migratory pelagic fish that is long-lived—up to 40 years—slow growing and late to mature, with maturation at 10 to12 years or older. Very few fish less than 10 years old are caught in spawning grounds. Mature SBT have a tendency to aggregate on the spawning grounds, which makes them vulnerable to long-lining and purse seining, and localised overfishing can easily occur. Further, pelagic fish such as SBT aggregate when numbers decline, worsening pre-existing threats and making them easy targets for well-resourced fishing fleets.</para>
<para>Despite our current voluntary international catch quota of 5,265 tonnes, Australia exported more than 9,000 tonnes, predominantly to Japan, in the 2003-04 season. Industry figures claim that ranching operations which are fattening fish in Port Lincoln can account for the extra 4,000 tonnes of SBT exported from Australia during the season. However, the Democrats remain concerned that a lack of comprehensive observer coverage of the SBT fleet, the high value of individual fish, and the many loopholes in the weighing and accounting system for SBT are grounds enough for tighter policing of our export quota. For the minister to approve the species for export without tying his accreditation to quotas set out under CCSBT was irresponsible and leaves Australia’s fisheries management regime open to criticism. It may also have locked in further declines in SBT fish stock, already internationally recognised as critically endangered.</para>
<para>Since 1997 Japan, Australia and New Zealand have been unable to agree on catch limits for this species; however, the fishery is no longer dominated by these three players. Korea, with a voluntary quota of 1,140 tonnes, has recently joined CCSBT; and Taiwan, also with a voluntary quota of 1,140 tonnes, has joined the extended commission. The CCSBT has agreed to a total world catch of 14,030 tonnes: Japan, 6,065 tonnes; Australia, 5,265 tonnes; Korea, 1,140 tonnes; Taiwan, 1,140 tonnes; New Zealand, 420 tonnes; and 900 tonnes for non-members Indonesia, the Philippines and South Africa. CCSBT has acknowledged the advice of its scientific committee that, at a global catch of about 15,000 tonnes, there is an equal probability that the critically endangered stock could decline or improve.</para>
<para>In 1999 Indonesia, whose waters share the sole breeding grounds, took 2,483 tonnes. In 2002 CCSBT expressed concerns regarding the level of catch outside the commission and recent significant increases of catch by some non-members. In addition to the current CCSBT quota, of which Australia takes almost half, catches by non-parties to the CCSBT have grown rapidly in the past decade, exceeding 7,500 tonnes by the year 2000. CCSBT also acknowledged that ‘there is little chance that the SBT spawning stock would be rebuilt to the 1980 levels by 2020’, as had been set as an interim goal and identified as the biologically safe level for continuation of species viability. How the minister found evidence that this fishery is based on a sustainable management regime which will ensure the future of both this highly lucrative species and the industry that relies on it is difficult to understand.</para>
<para>Under current management regimes, there has been no evidence of recovery. CCSBT has shown itself unable to achieve its stated recovery objectives for this species. Ongoing negotiations over quota allocations and total allowable catch continue, predicted parental stock increases have failed a number of times to be realised, and aims to bring the population back to the 1980 level, regarded as ‘biologically safe’, have not in any way been met. The Australian government’s Endangered Species Scientific Subcommittee in 1999 noted a breakdown in negotiations in the CCSBT forum in 1999 and expressed the concern that ‘if current management actions to address the past decline of the species are not successful, and populations decline further, the species might become threatened’. It is our view that regional management regimes working towards the conservation of SBT have floundered, resulting in real and imminent threats to this species’ ecological viability. Yet Australia remains one of the predominant fishers of the species.</para>
<para>The species is now listed under both Victorian and New South Wales state laws as a threatened species, and conservationists continue to push for a listing under federal environment laws. The science underpinning the population statistics suggests such a listing would be well within the legislative requirements for threatened species recognition. I also understand that some environment groups have launched legal action in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal objecting to the accreditation of this fishery as ecologically sustainable. There can be little doubt that while the southern bluefin tuna fishery continues to exploit an already heavily depleted target species Australia’s reputation as a world leader in fisheries management will be undermined.</para>
<para>Ongoing commercial targeting of this species and the inability of those with commercial interests to achieve recovery objectives suggest a significant level of failure to address problems inherent in species conservation, and yet Senator Ian Campbell, in one of his first acts as environment minister, signed off on commercial targeting of SBT as an environmentally sustainable industry and, despite its depleted status and the risk of its extinction, accredited export of this species. With existing examples of abundant fish species, such as Atlantic cod, crumbling under the ongoing weight of commercial pressures, and southern bluefin tuna already listed as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, we Democrats believe there is an urgent need for much stronger action on behalf of the government to rein in Australia’s SBT quota, which has not changed since 1984 despite ongoing declines.</para>
<para>This is a highly valuable species that not only is fished through the targeted catch of the Commonwealth southern bluefin tuna fishery, currently with 99 statutory fishing right holders and just a dozen major operators, but also is regarded as by-product within other Commonwealth and state fisheries. International pressures on fish stocks are only increasing, and globally pelagic fish stocks are considered to be at great risk from overexploitation. Of those, southern bluefin tuna appears to be the most valuable and at greatest risk.</para>
<para>We Democrats call on all senators to support our disallowance of the government’s environmental accreditation for this fishery on the grounds that it is in no way ecologically sustainable. All the evidence points to ongoing and serious declines in the breeding stocks of this fishery and to increasing fishing pressures on remaining stocks from our regional neighbours. Australia remains one of the largest exploiters of the southern bluefin fishery and is largely responsible for its ongoing declines. We cannot stand idly by while our environment minister and our fisheries minister, Senator Ian Macdonald, bury their heads in the sand and blame other nations for the ongoing declines. As one of the longstanding fishers of this species, we Australians have an obligation and an inherent responsibility to manage the stocks in a sustainable way. Accrediting export with no change in quota will in no way progress the sustainable use of this fish.</para>

<para>—Just before question time I was speaking about the issue of poverty, which NATSEM, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, estimates affects almost two million Australians. I was speaking about a report that was released last month by the St Vincent de Paul Society into income equality, which speaks about the growing gap between the rich and the poor in Australia and the fact that the income of the bottom 10 per cent of income earners has risen by just $26 per week whereas the income for the top 10 per cent of income earners has risen by $762 a week. The report notes that inequality of income is an open door to inequality in access to health services, housing services, public education, transport, communications, child care, aged care services and other sorts of social amenities, such as going to the cinema or going to a sporting event.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This inequality could easily be addressed by investing in social services and by investing in better income support and secure employment with fair pay. Professor Peter Saunders of the University of New South Wales Social Policy Research Centre has estimated that it would cost as little as two per cent of gross national income to eradicate poverty in Australia. He concludes that it is not a matter of affordability, it is a matter of choice. The coalition government has chosen yet again in this budget to make life easier for the wealthy and more difficult for the poor. The government’s welfare to work policy without a doubt will push more people into poverty. So much for the family friendly government. We see the budget and the huge tax cuts for the well off as being, as the Greens have indicated before, antifamily.</para>
<para>The National Council of Single Mothers and their Children has advised me of a number of examples of sole parents in different circumstances who will be disadvantaged under the government’s welfare to work policy. They tell me of the case of a single mother who has a nine-year-old child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and who gets no assistance from the child’s father. She is needed to volunteer at her local school because this public school is short of resources. There is no after school care available, although she does have her child on a waiting list. She currently does 10 hours of paid work. The question to the government is: will this be deemed enough, or will she be forced to seek more paid work and therefore have to reduce the care that she offers to her child and the voluntary work that she does at her child’s local school? What impact will occur on such schools if single parents cannot continue to do the voluntary work that many of them are now carrying out?</para>
<para>Another question that the National Council for Single Mothers and their Children have asked is, most importantly: what will happen when children are sick? They ask: how will the government legislate to protect mothers from being forced to attend to employment requirements rather than care for their sick child? What Job Network provider or employer is going to be willing to accommodate the needs of their sick child? For example, if you have something like chickenpox running through a family over many weeks, what is going to happen to the mother’s income over that period? Mothers will be in an untenable situation of having to decide whether to leave their children unattended or risk their income support. What happens when child welfare agencies are called and a mother is considered neglectful because she made the choice to leave her sick children unattended so that she did not risk her income support?</para>
<para>Single parents will also be disadvantaged by the government’s Welfare to Work measure because of the low rate of income support that they will receive compared to the rate that they currently get and the higher effective marginal tax rates that they will pay. In this bill the government has chosen to reduce the top marginal tax rate for the wealthy whilst failing to reduce sufficiently the effective marginal tax rate for the lowest income earners. The effective marginal tax rate is 40 per cent for some welfare beneficiaries, but it will be 60 per cent for single parents, low-income parents and people with a disability, who are forced to look for paid work under the government’s new policy. This favouring of the wealthy over the most needy comes at the same time that the government are privatising many of our essential services. They are making decisions such as lifting the cost of tertiary education for students and introducing more government funded private technical colleges. Both the government and the opposition voted to increase the cost to patients of essential medicines in the lead-up to this budget, and in this budget we see this government also lifting the threshold for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme safety net, meaning people will have to spend more before they get any support.</para>
<para>The government continues yet again in this budget to give priority to the private health insurance rebate, which means that next financial year $2.88 billion of public money out of our health budget will be spent to provide benefits—that is, private health insurance—mostly for the well off, rather than investing that money in our essential public health services, which desperately need it. The government, for example, chose in this federal budget to commit just $170 million to Indigenous health care when we all know from listening to organisations like the AMA that this is a fraction of what is needed to redress the extreme disadvantage that Indigenous Australians suffer and to address the great disparity whereby Indigenous Australians die 20 years younger than non-Indigenous Australians. The government has also decided to lift the Medicare safety net threshold and is now promising to look at allowing private health insurance funds to move into the area of covering non-hospital health services, a proposal that it had previously rejected in 2003.</para>
<para>The government is also reducing investment in public housing whilst encouraging private investment in the high-priced residential property market through its taxation policy. It is introducing an inflationary and regressive tax rebate for child-care fees when it should have and could have put this money into the more progressive child-care benefit or provided more of the child-care places that are desperately needed by mothers.</para>
<para>All through this budget the government are introducing changes to tax cuts, with Welfare to Work amongst these changes. They are also in this term of government seeking to attack the wages and conditions of ordinary working Australians and their families, requiring the lowest paid workers in the community to bear responsibility for any unemployment that may occur through the new minimum wage fixing procedure. I spoke earlier about this government perceiving the current minimum wage rate as too high already, even though it is half what the Treasurer acknowledges Australian families are struggling to survive on. The government are seeking to promote insecure work through individual contracts and giving employers the right to sack employees at whim.</para>
<para>The Labor Party was right to condemn the budget tax cuts as unfair, but we believe it is on the wrong track with its call for redistribution. Doubling the tax cut for low- and middle-income earners from $6 to $12 a week is still wasteful when it is compared to the many other useful purposes to which the funds could be put, such as investing in public services—health, education, the environment and the like, things I spoke about earlier.</para>
<para>Labor leader Kim Beazley, answering a question from Laurie Oakes on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program on 15 May, said that Labor had recognised a political imperative to reduce the tax paid by those who aspire to more—the so-called aspirational voters. This political imperative that Mr Beazley was speaking about is eating away at our sense of fairness and decency. It is distorting our sense of proportion as to who is really most in need. Around 4.5 million Australians live in households that struggle on $400 a week. Full-time adult ordinary time earnings are $993.10 a week, or $51,641 a year, and we know that plenty of people cannot find enough paid work to make up a full working week.

<para>—I rise to speak too on the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline> before us today. I want to start by noting that this is the second tax package which has delivered substantial tax cuts to people on high incomes. What the Democrats most want to point out in this whole debate is that there are people on very low incomes who will receive almost nothing out of this package. The average earner will save around $1.54 per week if they are on $10,000. If they are lucky enough to be on $120,000 then the amount that is saved is $60.62 a week. So we say that this is unfair. This package is unfair. Not so long ago we dealt with a previous tax package which delivered tax savings to people on more than $52,000 a year—$21.7 billion over four years to give high-income earners the greatest benefits of this package.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Democrats support a taxation system that is broadly based. We support the principle of indexing taxes in general with income tax brackets and regularly adjusting what is known as bracket creep. We believe that income tax brackets should be linked to meaningful social indicators and we think that the tax-free threshold should be raised to at least the poverty line. At the present time we tax people who earn a mere $6,000 a year. Even if we were just to index that $6,000—which was established, as I understand it, in 2001—the threshold would at least be $1,000 higher at the current time. The fact that this package effectively indexes rates at the higher levels but leaves the threshold in place we think is highly problematic.</para>
<para>In our view the first budget priority should have been the underspend in areas such as health and education, the environment and infrastructure. It is essential, though, that we see some tax relief for low-income earners, because these are the people who pay very high effective marginal tax rates—and that is why the Democrats will be moving some amendments on that. We want to see their disposable income increase and their living standards improve as a result and to see this package used as a way in which we can encourage the transition from welfare to work through these incentives. At the present time there are in fact disincentives in place for people to get into the work force.</para>
<para>We would also support the bracket creep adjustments for higher income earners but we say that they need to be funded through cracking down on unnecessary tax concessions and loopholes. The fact that the government used the tax cuts as an election-winning device perverts the real policy need for structural income tax reform and is in effect just some sort of periodic relief.</para>
<para>On the tax-free threshold in this package, we will move amendments to increase it to $10,000. We think that $12,500 makes sense because that is the Henderson poverty line—or the minimum subsistence line, as it is known—and then we should be looking longer term at increasing that threshold to $20,000. By doing that everyone gets a tax cut, but it is much fairer on those people at low-income levels. We say the tax cut priorities the government has in this bill are all wrong. There is the need for tax relief for low-income earners and so, as I said, we will be moving to lift that tax-free threshold to $10,000, delivering $680 a year to benefit all taxpayers.</para>
<para>We think there is an argument for rationalisation of the tax system. At the present time we are predicting a $9 billion annual surplus. So we are not opposed to tax cuts per se, but our approach is to start with low-income earners before going beyond that. High-income earners will receive a tax cut of $4,502 a year whilst the average income earner will receive $312 a year. When you add to that $4,502 the $1,500 that high-income earners will receive from the scrapping of the superannuation surcharge, that is a very substantial tax cut indeed.</para>
<para>We have announced today that we will support the ALP’s amendments to this bill. I hope they will seriously consider ours, but we have indicated that we will support theirs. They are a fall-back mechanism only and we do not think they go far enough. They are not as fair as our proposed package but, nonetheless, we will be supporting the ALP on those amendments and we certainly hope the ALP stick to them. One of the problems in recent times is that the ALP have very much had a patch-up approach to tax cuts, and it is not altogether clear what the ALP stand for. I want to reiterate today that our highest priority is people on low incomes. People on low incomes are our first priority, and we have a plan, as I said earlier, to raise the threshold to $10,000, then $12,500 and then $20,000. That is what is known as a long-reaching plan but, at the present time, we do not know what Labor propose. Nonetheless, we will, as I have said, support their amendments.</para>
<para>It is worth bearing in mind that there are 1.8 million Australians who earn less than $10,000 a year. I think that is an alarming statistic. Most of them, it is true, do not currently pay tax. If our policy were supported around 400,000 more taxpayers would no longer be paying income tax. If our amendments to raise the threshold do not get supported in this chamber—and I think it is fair to say the ALP has suggested it will not support them—we will move to split the tax bills. We will attempt to support the cuts for those people earning up to $21,600—that is, the cut from 17c in the dollar to 15c in the dollar—and we will oppose those income tax cuts for people on higher incomes. The other point I want to make today is about the tax schedules.</para>

<para>I announced this morning that the Democrats, along with most others I have heard speak on this subject, will not be supporting a disallowance should it be moved. It is a very hypothetical question. Nobody so far, as far I know, has said that they will disallow the schedules. We do not think it makes a lot of sense at the end of the day. After 1 July the government will be able to introduce whatever schedule it likes, and effectively others in this chamber will not have much say over that. It is an administrative vehicle—it is the schedule which lets employers know what they should take out of wages in tax. We see no purpose in artificially stopping that schedule for a matter of a few weeks.</para>
<para>Mr Costello asked us late last week to give an undertaking. I said I would take that to my colleagues. I have now done that, and I have advised the Treasurer that this is our position. The schedules are simply mathematical calculations of an administrative nature. That does not mean that we are voting for the government’s tax package—we are certainly not; we are going to protest right to the end—but we do not see the point in unnecessarily delaying the situation and costing business, with the confusion that might arise should those schedules have to be relied upon for the first couple of months. As I said, the government can in any case introduce schedules at any time it chooses, so it seems to us to be a pointless exercise.</para>
<para>However, we will stand very much on principle on the question of the bills and we will vote against them if the amendments are not won. We certainly hope that the Labor Party stand firm on their amendments and do not give in when they are bounced back from the House of Representatives. This was a great opportunity for tax reform in this country. I think the government has messed up. These are the wrong tax cuts for us to consider, and it is a great pity that an opportunity to take people out of poverty has not been taken up in this legislation.</para>

<para>—Thank you Mr President. It is with great pride and honour that I rise this evening to make my maiden speech. My presence here today follows the retirement of Senator John Tierney on 14 April. On behalf of the people of New South Wales I pay tribute to him for his service to the Liberal Party and the Senate. I wish John and Pam all the very best for the future. I would like to thank the Clerk of the Senate and his staff and other senators for their kind assistance and guidance in acquainting me with this place and its procedures. I especially thank Andrea Griffiths-Ianson, Black Rod, for her friendship and guidance over many years. I was proud to be welcomed by her to this place on 9 May.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>My family’s journey began on 14 February 1953, when a young man of 24 years of age arrived alone on the docks at Sydney. He had travelled from Italy. He had left everything he knew and loved, including his fiancee. He spoke no English. His old suitcase carried the dreams and aspirations that had motivated his migration to so far away a land. That man was my dad. He first lived in single quarters near the old steelworks at Port Kembla. Later he travelled to North Queensland to cut sugar cane. He saved enough money for a deposit on a home. He returned to Port Kembla and bought a small cottage. My mother joined him in 1959. They had been engaged for 13 years. They married. I was born a year later and my brother five years later. Pops, could you ever have imagined when you arrived that one day you would be sitting here watching your daughter in the Australian Senate?</para>
<para>Mr President, with hard work, determination, dedication and the will to succeed you can do anything, you can be anyone and you can go anywhere. My parents and millions of other migrants who came here were guided by this ideal. This is what makes Australia such a wonderful place. Today I could be the daughter of any migrant to Australia. The philosophy of individual effort for just reward is embodied in the stories of millions just like my parents who have helped shape the destiny of this great nation. It is also the philosophy behind the great party I am privileged to represent. Today I would like to share with you the values and beliefs that have helped shape my life and which will underpin my service to the people of New South Wales as their senator.</para>
<para>I grew up in Port Kembla, the industrial heart of the Illawarra. My father worked at the steelworks. My mother stayed at home. I am grateful for the many sacrifices that my parents made to ensure that our family had the best that hard work could give. Today, many who come to this country are assisted by generous settlement services. When my parents arrived there were no such services. Self-sufficiency and employment became the cornerstones on the road to building a better life for yourself and for your children. Family and family life have always been very important to me. I believe in the traditional family as the bedrock institution of our society. I will support policies which strengthen and enhance the value and importance of the family.</para>
<para>My education in the Catholic school system began with kindergarten at St Francis of Assisi, overlooking the steelworks. Seventy-five kids started school with me. Only a few spoke English, and I was not one of them. My primary schooling at St Patrick’s was under the shadow of the chimney stack at Port Kembla. I completed my secondary education at St Mary’s College in Wollongong. From these early days I have followed the Christian faith. I believe in the values and virtues that it teaches. They have guided me and will continue to do so in the years ahead.</para>
<para>During this period I also learnt the importance of choice. When my father worked at the steelworks, the union movement was very strong. I remember vividly when the unions would call a strike. My father was the sole breadwinner, so working every day was very important to him. When the unions called a strike, I saw the inner turmoil in my father. He needed to go to work but, like many other workers, could not afford to break ranks. Regardless of the merits of the issue, they could not go against the power of the unions. They did what they were told. I respect the right of the individual to choose to be part of a collective bargaining regime but there should be no compulsion. I say to the elements of the union movement that are gearing up for a fight against the Howard government on industrial relations: use argument and reason, not threats and compulsion—remember who you are representing. Mr President, I will be supporting changes to industrial relations laws that encourage flexibility, fairness and freedom; a system that increases job growth, productivity and innovation—that will give Australians true choice.</para>
<para>After completing my secondary schooling, I attended the Australian National University in Canberra where I studied political science, languages and law. In 1984, I commenced my 20-year career as a lawyer with the Australian Government Solicitor and I pay tribute to my former colleagues, some of whom are here today. Having had the opportunity to represent many government departments and statutory authorities over the years, I bring to this place a broad and practical knowledge of the workings of government. Having defended both good and bad decisions of government, I have taken a keen interest in good public administration. Acting for the Australian Taxation Office, I wound up companies that did not pay their tax. I retain a particular concern about corporate responsibility and corporate morality, especially in dealings with workers entitlements.</para>
<para>I also have an interest in simplifying the tax system. When I first started practising law, the tax legislation was in one volume; it is now in four. An even, balanced or alternatively flat tax regime could be an option in simplifying the system. The Howard government has made significant reforms in this area for the benefit of the average taxpayer and small business. More can and should be done.</para>
<para>During my career, I particularly valued the work I did for the Department of Defence. This coupled with my husband’s service in the Royal Australian Navy has fostered a keen interest in defence matters, which I would like to pursue in this place. I would like to thank our many friends from the armed services who are here today. I especially value the importance of tradition and service to one’s country. I believe in the spirit of Anzac and what it means to the soul of Australia.</para>
<para>My work in politics started as a policy adviser with the Hon. Jim Carlton. Jim’s guidance and support over many years has prepared me well for my new role and I thank him very much. I then became senior private secretary to the Hon. John Fahey, then Premier of New South Wales. It was a great privilege and a fantastic opportunity to work for him in the engine room of a coalition government. I would also like to thank Alan McArthur, who gave me my start in law and most recently employed me as a consultant with Minter Ellison Lawyers in Sydney.</para>
<para>Community service has been an important feature of my life since I was young. As the daughter of migrants I was frequently called upon to help my parents and others in the community, translating and assisting people with simple tasks to help them in their daily lives. Over the years, I have been privileged to work for many different groups and associations as a volunteer. I am honoured that many of the people I worked with are here today to share this special day with me.</para>
<para>I am a proud member of the Australian-Italian community and have been honoured to serve them as a national and international representative. I would like to acknowledge the presence today of representatives from Italian government bodies: the embassy, the consulate, the Italian Institute of Culture and the trade commission. I would especially like to acknowledge my dear friends Nick and Silvana Papallo and Irvin and Lottie Vidor. Thank you for your total faith in me. It is a source of great pride to come to this place as the first Australian woman of Italian origin. I believe I am also the first Australian of Italian origin to the Senate from New South Wales. I will continue to strengthen relationships with Italy in particular and more broadly with Europe.</para>
<para>Over the years, I have also supported a number of important causes. I support our current constitutional arrangements. Through my work with Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy, I have worked for its retention. I also uphold our flag as an unchanging and timeless symbol of the values and virtues that unify our society. Over the years, I have been involved in many charitable activities, but none has impacted more on me than my work with Father Chris Riley’s Youth off the Streets. I am honoured that Father Chris is here today, together with some board members and staff. Father, you taught me that there is no such thing as a bad child, just bad circumstances. I have come to understand the resilience of our youth against terrible adversity. A child is abused every 13 minutes across Australia. Perpetrators of crimes against children and those who protect them deserve the severest of punishment. We must confront and end child abuse and the exploitation of youth once and for all. My work with Youth off the Streets has also reaffirmed my view of the importance of family support to young people, of zero tolerance on drugs and my opposition to heroin injecting rooms and lowering the age of consent. In contrast, programs such as Tough on Drugs and Values in Schools have been very successful. As a senator, I will be advocating their continued support and expansion.</para>
<para>Throughout my community service, I have come to value highly the contribution of volunteers in Australia, whether this be in the family, amongst the sick, the disabled, the young or the aged. This is the social glue that binds our society together and gives us a sense of belonging in our communities. The complex social challenges facing our society will never be solved by governments working alone, but in partnership with civil society. As a senator, I shall work to foster community participation and volunteerism so that individuals, welfare organisations, business and government can unite and together generate true social capital.</para>
<para>Australia today is a country forged from different cultures and tied by a set of common beliefs and values—a belief in a free and competitive market system; in freedom of choice; of respect for human life; of the rule of law and a fair go for all. The promotion of these values and beliefs across the diversity of our contemporary Australian society is vital to our continued social cohesion.</para>
<para>I have lived my life across the diversity that is Australia. Whilst cultural diversity has brought us many advantages, there are also challenges. When my parents first came to this country, they, like many others, experienced prejudice. It was a fact of life. They got on with it. They assimilated, they shared their culture, traditions, values and beliefs—they accepted and became accepted. Through this, they and many others helped forge the unique Australian way of life we have today.</para>
<para>While some seek to gloss over divisions in our society by affirming a desire for harmonious coexistence and religious tolerance, divisions do exist. We need to address them before the rifts become so deep that our society’s very existence is threatened. Australia is a tolerant and compassionate society founded on understanding and respecting social and religious differences. Our success as a culturally diverse society comes from putting our commitment to Australia first.</para>
<para>Values and beliefs are important in the mainstream of Australian political life. However, there are those in our society who find talk about values abhorrent—the so-called ‘chattering classes’, the elites whose view of life is distorted by their inane fixation with the politics of the lowest common denominator, an outdated socialist ideology that rejects a belief in the power of the individual. The success of the Howard government has been to reject this ideology.</para>
<para>My journey began under the shadow of the chimney stack at Port Kembla. It now takes me back to where I started. I return to my roots. My office will be in Wollongong and I look forward to giving the people of the Illawarra an alternative and effective voice in government. The Illawarra is yet to realise its full potential. I want to see more exports leave Port Kembla, to see more industry developed and more jobs created. I want to ensure that, when my nephews grow up and look for a job in Wollongong, they will not be forced to move away to find work, as I was. Future growth for the Illawarra will require all sectors of the community working together with all levels of government. I look forward to the challenge.</para>
<para>Here tonight there are many friends who have helped me to make my journey. I cannot mention you all by name. You know who you are and I thank you wholeheartedly. I thank the Liberal Party and the New South Wales Division. Over the years, I have had extensive involvement at many levels of the party and I am honoured to represent the Liberal Party as a senator. I would especially like to mention some of my parliamentary colleagues—Bronwyn Bishop, Helen Coonan, Teresa Gambaro, Bill Heffernan, Jackie Kelly, Nick Minchin, Brendan Nelson, Alby Schultz and Santo Santoro—and state colleagues—David Clarke, Charlie Lynn and Anthony Roberts. Thank you for your guidance and support over many years.</para>
<para>There are many in the Liberal Party I would also like to thank. I would especially like to acknowledge and thank Nick Campbell, Michael Cooke, Alex Hawke, Natasha Maclaren and the Young Liberal Movement, Italo Mazzola and the New South Wales Italian Special Branch, Hollie Nolan, Peter Phelps, Marlene Scott and the Illawarra Liberals, Rhondda Vanzella, Helen Wayland and my many friends and supporters in the Women’s Council, Robyn and Harry Young, Mervyn and Ann Youl, and the late Judith Barton. I would also like to thank my staff and the many volunteers who have helped make this my very special day.</para>
<para>Thank you to my family: Mammina and Pops for your love and selfless sacrifices; Canio, the best brother a girl could ever have; Karen and my beautiful nephews, Beppi and Luca; my stepchildren, Alasdair and Amelia; my aunt and uncle, cousins and their families; my mother-in-law, Frances, sisters-in-law and their families; and my husband, John, my biggest fan, for your patience, understanding, love and support.</para>
<para>I have tried to lead the past 25 years of my life in service to the community and to the public. People often ask me why I want to serve in public life. For me, the answer is simple. My parents came to this country to build a better life for themselves and for their children. Their journey is but a snapshot of millions of similar journeys. They are not published anywhere except written deep in the hearts and memories of those who took the journey and those, like me, who follow them. This country gave my parents so much—I have always wanted to give something back. And so, as I stand here today, I honour the journeys of those before me and I look forward with dedication and resolve to my journey ahead.</para>

<para>—This is not the first time that I have risen in this place to speak on tax legislation. I was heavily and directly involved in the major tax package which included the GST back in the late 1990s. At that stage, we had months of committee hearings and long debates. This emphasised very much for me that, when we are changing the tax system, it is not something that we should do lightly, without proper consideration or quickly as a response to a particular lobby or pressure group. And it is not something we should do simply to implement what is supposedly a publicly popular measure of cutting taxes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Tax should be about national and public interests as well as individual interests. We should be talking about tax reform and, in particular, about how changes to the system impact on various sections of the economy as well as on individuals. One of my major achievements in this place was ensuring that those major changes—what became known as the ANTS package—actually went through this place but that they only went through after considerable negotiations and considerable changes so that we did have a package that was environmentally and socially responsible.</para>
<para>Why did I support the tax changes back in 1999 when saying no was obviously much easier and a much less risky course to take? There were a number of national priorities that could no longer be ignored. Indeed, the Democrats had already seen this and had been undertaking a series of tax negotiations and tax discussions across all divisions in all states and both territories for some time. That led to a party ballot in which the Australian Democrats voted to impose a tax on services. The ALP also knew that a GST was essential and that personal income tax cuts would need to go with it, but they chose what they thought at the time was a politically expedient road and opposed the tax package entirely.</para>
<para>I will now move on to some of the reasons why change was necessary. Governments could no longer continue to build up debt and/or sell off assets. Borrowing and selling to fund our daily needs simply was not able to continue. The states and territories had to get access to the money they needed to provide public services and infrastructure. That has now been done, and we can see the extra money from the GST flowing to schools and hospitals. There are extra roads, police et cetera. In my home state, there is a raft of positive changes in the way services are being funded.</para>
<para>Another reason I supported the 1999 package was that we had to remove the hidden taxes that were embedded in our manufactured goods and so reduce the cost of Australian goods to make Australia more competitive. That has been achieved. But, as we made the raft of changes back then, we had to ensure that tax reform was socially responsible and equitable. Basically, we had to protect those on low incomes. That was done, with some $5 billion of fairness injected into the 1999 GST reform package, and that is what is now being partly undone. By ‘undone’, I mean that we are now losing a lot of the fairness that was negotiated into Australia’s tax system at that time.</para>
<para>In those tax negotiations, we had to boost pensions and benefits more than the government planned, because they were working on averages and that was simply not equitable. We needed to take food out of the package, because that has the biggest impact on those on low incomes, and we had to make a number of other changes, including boosting support through SAPs for people who are homeless and boosting opportunities for children living on low incomes—in particular, a childhood nutrition program. All of those changes were to help those on the bottom rung. In 1999 dollars, we negotiated roughly an extra $7 a fortnight for disability pensioners, and about $11 for a couple. It was more for people who were on single-parent benefits. Basically, it had to be an equitable social response to tax changes.</para>
<para>Under this package, together with changes to our social security system, many on low incomes are going to lose not just once but twice. Firstly, they lose because of the piddling tax cuts they get that are barely going to keep up with inflation. Secondly, many people will also lose through the lowering of their incomes with the move from pensions to enhanced Newstart. In particular, I mention here single parents and those newly diagnosed with a disability. Many Australians who apply for help in the future—when, I must stress here, the Senate will be in government hands and therefore compliant—will be actually worse off. In 1999, those of us who worked constructively with this government on tax reform also succeeded in reducing the tax cuts that were then planned for the wealthy. We rolled those back. That is certainly being undone with this package before us now.</para>
<para>I am not arguing—indeed, I do not think anyone in this place is arguing—that we do not need tax cuts. We do need them. Inflation has taken care of that; it is a certainty. But a tax system should be fair, and any changes that we make to that system should be assessed as to whether they are fair or not. In this case we see that those who desperately need tax cuts get few, if any.</para>
<para>What we actually need now is tax reform, not just tax cuts. It is not logical, as some have argued—including some in this place—to say that we have to give people more incentives at the top by giving them more tax cuts and giving them more money in their pockets and that the way to give incentive to those Australians who are already struggling is to reduce what they have in their pockets, to cut their incomes. I have great difficulty when I try to follow the arguments about how this can possibly be reasonable and fair. These tax bills are a great disappointment as I leave this place. Certainly the changes to social security legislation are. I ask opposition senators who seem so delighted at the prospect of these tax cuts: why should Australians who are living below the poverty line pay any income tax at all?</para>
<para>I would ask that government senators speaking in support of the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline> not mention my name in their speeches. Yes, I did support you in the past on tax reform but I do not support what you are doing now. This package is simply unfair. It is un-Australian. It is not a fair go for all, as our most recent senator just noted. It may well be supported very vocally by some in the media, but that does not make it right and it does not mean we have to go along with it. I will oppose these changes wherever I can. Yes, the tax cuts are going through, but they will not have my vote and they will not have my name on them.</para>

<para>—I am disappointed that Senator Lees will not support taxation cuts for many, many Australians. I cannot understand it. I can understand someone putting up an alternative point of view. The <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline> implements the tax cuts announced in the May budget for all Australian workers. Some get more than others, but all Australian workers get a benefit. The bill ensures that the top tax rate applies only to three per cent of the working population. That is something that everyone has been pushing for, including Bill Shorten, who is supposed to be the new saviour of the Labor Party. He has said quite openly:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the maximum marginal income tax rate cuts in at a relatively low-income level, which harms work incentives and skill acquisition. Effective marginal tax rates also remain high for low-income earners, deterring participation by secondary earners and older workers.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He has even suggested that the government needs to perform radical surgery—in fact, it could even need to apply the death penalty—on the tax regime. The government has listened to one of the leading lights and the hope of the Labor side, Bill Shorten, and has actually done what this new leading figure of the ALP wishes—and has got kicked in the head by the ALP in this place. I do not want to condemn all members of the ALP, because there are many in the ALP who think it is absolutely ridiculous to deny Australians tax cuts. Peter Beattie says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We welcome the tax cuts. They are the right thing to do. I make no apology for saying that ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is what he told state parliament. He is a successful leader. Clare Martin, the Northern Territory Chief Minister, said she made it clear to the Northern Territory federal representatives that they should support the budget on behalf of Territorians. She said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">But that is the Federal Budget, and I wouldn’t be opposing tax cuts.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">She said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... every Australian will be looking forward to them, every territorian.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Geoff Gallop said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If we look at the tax cuts, which I think are excellent—and we have been advocating that for some time. They’re essentially built off the back of the WA economy. The hard work of the West Australian people, the strength of our economy, has given Peter Costello the surplus he needs to deliver these tax cuts.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So he wants them. Everyone wants them—everyone except Wayne Swan, Senator Conroy and a few others in here. I made an inappropriate comment when I first heard about what was happening with the Labor Party refusing to back these tax cuts. I could not understand it. I have been in politics for something like 30 years and it just seemed to me to be the most stupid, idiotic thing that I have ever seen done by an opposition. All the things that I believed were wrong and all the things that I thought would happen to the ALP have happened.</para>
<para>Mr Beazley, stuck there like a rabbit caught in a spotlight, does not know which way to move. One of the things I learnt when I first got into parliament was: if you cannot say something, never go on television, because you look ineffective and weak. I do not think anyone looked weaker and more ineffective than the Leader of the Opposition on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> last Wednesday or Thursday night. He has been handed something that he just cannot handle. I do not blame him for not being able to handle it, because no-one could handle the poisoned chalice that the Labor Party’s economic spokesmen have given him. It was a disaster.</para>
<para>I thought the ALP and Senator Conroy would come storming into the Senate today to defend their position. In fact, I mentioned it in the joint party room. I said: ‘Beware of the attack. They’ll have to defend this.’ I was expecting a barrage on tax cuts at question time. I do not think there was one question bowled up to any of the economic ministers about tax cuts. I said to the party room—and I hope I am not disclosing any confidences: ‘There will be a line-up of ALP speakers a mile long, coming in here to defend what many of them think to be the indefensible.’ What have we seen on the speakers list? I think there are three speakers: Senator Conroy will be one, Senator Evans will be another and there is one other floating around. Senator Evans has to be up for it, to defend the position. Senator Conroy is an economic spokesman. He, too, will have to defend the position. But they could only muster three people—three kamikaze pilots. That is all they could muster: a squadron of three.</para>
<para>I am surprised. After 30 years of political life, I cannot understand how anyone could deny the people of Australia a tax cut. What the ALP has forgotten, or has never understood, is that there are many Australians that traditionally vote for the ALP who are on $60,000 and above. There are many of them. Many of them are in Capricornia, a seat that the ALP has held and holds now. They are scattered right throughout Australia. In the mining industry, $93,000 is a starting rate. Many people fly in, work two weeks in a row—12 hours a day, seven days a week—and then come home and have a week at home. They really work hard for their money. They are traditional ALP supporters, or they were. How can you deny those people a tax cut? Those people start on a salary of $93,000 and their salaries go up with the skills that they develop. The people that drive those big draglines are probably on $120,000 or $130,000 a year. Those skills are needed, they are appreciated and they are paid for. What are you denying those people? For a person on say, $90,000, you are taking $40 a week away from them. That is $40 a week that they work damn hard for. They fly in, work 12 hours a day, seven days a week, day in, day out for two weeks, sometimes three weeks, and then go home for a week. You are taking $40 a week away from those people, from the people who support the economy of Australia, the mining industry of Australia—the coalminers, the people that drive the draglines, the other miners. It is very hard, it is very nasty. It is hard yakka, and it carries a certain element of danger with it.</para>
<para>I am also concerned about the abattoir workers. You would not find, if you went around all of Australia, an industry that supports the ALP more than meatworkers do. And what have you done to them? A lot of those people do earn incomes between $25,000 and $55,000, but the skilled workers, the boners, the foremen, the top workers—the people that can work on the chain and keep the chain running—are on $65,000 to $75,000 a year with all the benefits. What are you going to cost them? It is around $25 a week. Twenty-five dollars a week is a lot of money to people that are living away from the cities, living away from the benefits that many people get in the cities, and where things are more expensive. What are you doing? Don’t you understand that it is not only the minimum wage worker that backs the ALP? There are many workers in the abattoir industry.</para>
<para>I could nominate quite a number of people out there—for example, truck drivers—that live out in the bush, that are rural and regional dwellers, that earn reasonable money. They work hard for the money. They roll up their sleeves and they really get into it. An interstate truck driver might be on $75,000 to $95,000 a year. He will lose $96 per month. Do you really expect that these people are going to vote for you? I cannot believe how anyone could get themselves in such an unbelievable mess—and neither can most people in the ALP. There are many unsourced quotes from people in the ALP. I will find them in a minute. I cannot understand how the ALP thinks it can ignore and walk away from not only the workers who are going to earn $6 extra a week—$6 dollars is not a lot of money, but it is worth having—but also, when you start getting to $20 and $30 a week, the skilled abattoir workers and miners. What about the waterside workers that load beef or sugar in Mackay? Those sorts of people are on around $80,000 a year with their overtime. They are going to be $170 worse off. I do not know how you can come into this place and defend it.</para>
<para>In October last year an election took place and the government ran hard on its economic performance. It not only won an additional four or five seats but also won, for the first time since 1974, control of the Senate. Is there any more striking example of the people supporting this government because they believe in its economic performance? Is there any more striking example of ignorance than trying to take these tax cuts away? I have never seen it before and I do not think I will ever see it again. There is a certain point where a party becomes unelectable. I think you have just about reached the point where a party becomes unelectable. The decisions you have made on these tax cuts are so reprehensible that no-one can understand them.</para>
<para>The people who are battling want their $6 a week. The people who are out there with their sleeves rolled up driving huge dragline machines, scooping up the wealth for Australia, putting it in trucks, taking it down to the ports, loading it on the ports and working 12 hours a day seven days a week have been neglected by the ALP. You say that you are trying to create a difference. You have certainly done that. You have created the greatest difference—between a government that has economic credentials and an opposition that, economically, cannot add up at all.</para>
<para>There are many, many workers in rural and regional Australia who are traditionally ALP supporters. They are the people who have held the faith. They have stuck by you. They have not come over to The Nationals or the Liberal Party as yet. They have held the line. You have walked away from those in the bush. You have never given them good representation. You do not even put up a reasonable candidate. You put up the name of some union hack from Brisbane and then go out and try to say you are running in Maranoa, Kennedy or somewhere else. You walked away from them politically and now you have walked away from them economically.</para>
<para>I thought that Capricornia was a seat that we could not win. We can win it on big swings. I would now say that you have opened that seat up for The Nationals. It is one seat where I now do not believe you will get a vote from the mining industry or the abattoirs. There will be the true believers who will hang on—those whom you could walk over, kick in the head and flog and who would still vote for you. You have virtually done that. You have left every rural and regional worker—and there are many, many of them who spend many hours of their lives with their sleeves rolled up to get into that higher bracket of income tax, paying it all out in tax and, as Bill Shorten has said, finding no incentive to work—and you have walked away from them. There is only one result from that: if you walk away from your constituency, they will walk away from you at the next election.</para>

</talker>
<para>—Today in this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005 Labor draws a clear dividing line between the opposition and an increasingly arrogant coalition government. We do so on behalf of millions of hardworking Australians on low to middle incomes who are crying out for some tax relief after years of being squeezed by the highest taxing government that this country has ever known. In 2005-06 tax revenue is forecast to hit $235 billion. Tax paid per taxpayer has increased by $12,200 since the Howard government came to power. There can be no doubt that tax reform is required.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Unfortunately, that is not what the tax changes contained in this legislation deliver. The measures contained in this bill fail every test of decent tax reform. They are monstrously unfair, enriching the wealthy few at the expense of millions of hardworking Australians. They represent a wasted opportunity to reform the tax system in a way that promotes economic growth by encouraging work force participation. They also threaten to overheat the economy at a time when the Reserve Bank has already issued warnings that a strong consumer demand and capacity constraints may force it to raise interest rates.</para>
<para>For these reasons, Labor has consistently stated since budget night that it does not support the Howard government’s inequitable and economically irresponsible tax plan. But Labor has not just opposed the government’s flawed legislation; it has also developed an alternative proposal. It is a plan that more fairly distributes tax relief. It is a plan that will encourage people to move from welfare to work and provide increased incentive to work right across the income spectrum, not just at the top. It is a plan that minimises the danger that tax cuts will fuel inflationary pressures at this stage of the economic cycle and force the Reserve Bank to further increase interest rates.</para>
<para>Before talking about Labor’s alternative, I would like to take some time to detail some of the flaws in the government’s proposal. I will start with the rank unfairness of the tax cuts announced by the Treasurer in last month’s budget. Like many Australians, Labor was dismayed on budget night to see that the government could spend $22 billion on tax cuts but find a tax cut of only $6 per week for seven million Australian workers on incomes between $30,000 and $60,000.</para>
<para>We have come to expect arrogance from this government, and this Treasurer in particular, but a new low was established on budget night. The Treasurer decided to court the votes of the coalition backbench in the forthcoming leadership battle by giving them a tax cut of $65 a week while giving the typical hardworking nurse or teacher a measly $6. Surging revenues allowed the government to serve up a tax cut feast on budget night, but the vast majority of Australian workers were only offered the scraps from the table.</para>
<para>The top 10 per cent of taxpayers will pocket around 45 per cent of the tax cuts. Only around three per cent of taxpayers will receive the maximum tax cut. That is right: three per cent of taxpayers will receive the top tax cut. And this is from a Liberal Party that promised in 1996 to govern for all of us. The Australian people have learned from bitter experience over the years that the coalition’s definition of ‘all of us’ is a very narrow one. In the case of these tax cuts it includes lawyers, stockbrokers and the coalition backbench, but it excludes workers on average incomes.</para>
<para>There are only five federal electorates in this country where the average worker will receive more than $6 per week. These are the blue-ribbon seats of Warringah, North Sydney, Higgins, Bradfield and Wentworth. Shame on you, Senator McGauran; shame on you! The government would like to have the public believe that low- and middle-income earners have been looked after in previous budgets, but this claim just does not stand up. Since the GST was introduced five years ago, people on average incomes have received tax cuts of just $10 per week. In contrast, if this legislation is passed, taxpayers on $125,000 will have received tax cuts amounting to $119 per week. That is right: people on average incomes will have received $10 from this government, but if you earned $125,000-plus you will have received $119 per week.</para>
<para>In successive budgets the Howard government has attacked the progressivity of the tax system. Who could forget last year’s budget where the 80 per cent of workers earning under $52,000 received no tax cut at all? Since budget night, Labor have consistently argued that the distribution of tax cuts was not fair and that we would not support the Treasurer’s proposal. Two days after the budget, Kim Beazley unveiled Labor’s plan for fairer tax cuts. For around the same cost as the government’s tax plan and its changes to the superannuation surcharge, Labor produced a proposal that would double the tax cut delivered to workers on incomes between $30,000 and $60,000. That is right: double the tax cut. Under Labor’s plan, from 1 January 2006 the threshold where the 30 per cent marginal rate cuts in would be raised by $4,800, from $21,600 to $26,400. This change would deliver workers on average incomes a tax cut of $12 per week. In July 2006, Labor would increase the threshold where the 42 per cent marginal rate cuts in by $4,000, from $63,000 to $67,000.</para>
<para>Labor is also concerned that the tax system should be internationally competitive. Under the existing tax legislation, the threshold for the top marginal tax rate will be $80,000 in 2005-06. This threshold kicks in at around 1.5 times average earnings. Labor believes that this is just too low. Many skilled workers are now subject to this high rate of tax. Eighty thousand dollars is not a lot of money in cities like Sydney and Melbourne where housing costs have skyrocketed. Under Labor’s plan, from July 2006 the threshold for the top marginal rate would be lifted by $20,000 to $100,000. This would deliver a worker earning $100,000 a $40 per week tax cut. Labor’s plan differs from that of the government in that workers earning over $100,000 would receive around a third less in tax cuts than the government has proposed.</para>
<para>Of course Labor’s plan has not been popular with the Treasurer and his sycophantic supporters—not that there are many, as Senator Minchin worked so assiduously to ensure—who have been salivating at the prospect of a massive tax cut delivered at the expense of low- and middle-income workers. Some sections of the media in particular have displayed incredible double standards. Two years ago, the pathetic $4 sandwich-and-milkshake tax cuts were widely and justifiably condemned. This time around, with average taxpayers receiving just a $6 tax cut, the same commentators have dubbed the Treasurer a working-class hero and a genius. What could possibly explain this inability to maintain a consistent analysis of tax policy? Despite the inability of some sections of the media to see past the fistful of dollars, Labor is confident that its proposals for fairer tax cuts are well supported by the community.</para>
<para>Senators need only look to today’s <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> to see an indication of this support. A loaded question was posed: should Labor delay the government’s tax cuts? It could not be more pejorative. It was not, ‘Do you want Labor’s $12 tax cut or the government’s $6 tax cut?’ That would be a fairer question. A loaded question—should Labor delay the government’s tax cuts?—attracted the support of 52 per cent of those surveyed. That is right. The vast majority of working Australians—the seven million Australians who know they are getting only $6—are not fooled. They are not sucked in by the headlines that the newspapers are running. They are not sucked in by the Treasurer’s posturing, while he preens himself to try to get votes from the coalition, to try to see if he needs to move out of the phone box of support. They are not fooled; they understand the difference between $6 and $12. They understand the difference between a party committed to fairness and a party committed to looking after its own. Imagine if the question had been fairly and accurately phrased to something like ‘Do you support Labor’s plan to double the weekly tax cut to seven million Australian workers?’ Can you imagine the response? We dare the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> to ask that question.</para>
<para>Unlike some in the media, the Treasurer is aware of the flaws in his tax plan. He has not wanted to debate the merits of his tax proposal against Labor’s alternative proposal. Peter Costello, the Treasurer, has sought to distract attention from his unfair tax changes by talking incessantly about the tax schedules and when they will come into effect. Senator Minchin has been doing exactly the same: ‘Let’s avoid the substance of the debate. Let’s not talk about the seven million Australians who could get $12 from Labor as opposed to $6 from the government.’ Labor has simply said, ‘Let’s put first things first.’ If our amendments are passed by the Senate and this government is shamed into giving Australian workers the tax cuts they deserve, those tax schedules would be incorrect. Demanding that Labor vote for them, when the tax schedules are subordinate legislation, is putting the cart before the horse. The long established practice of this parliament is that we debate primary legislation—that is, bills—before considering any instruments purporting to give effect to those bills.</para>
<para>It has been a scam by the Treasurer, it has been a scam by Senator Minchin and it has been a scam by the Prime Minister: ‘Do anything, say anything, just don’t let anyone notice that we are offering only half the tax cuts that the Labor Party are offering to seven million Australians.’ This controversy about the schedules has just been a sideshow orchestrated by the Treasurer to deflect attention from his unjust tax proposals.</para>
<para>We have also been told by the government that Labor’s position is based on the politics of envy. Our opponents seek to deny the legitimacy and relevance of principles such as equity and fairness in the tax debate. Let me assure the Senate and those listening today: this is a proposition that Labor simply cannot and will not accept. High-income earners are not the only group of Australians working hard and deserving some tax relief. The Treasurer misjudged the Australian Labor Party if he thought that we would support this proposal. Labor members were not put in this place to wave through proposals such as the one we have before us today. We have put forward a fairer alternative, and we will be challenging coalition senators to vote in the interests of the seven million constituents rather than in their own self-interest.</para>
<para>In addition to being monstrously unfair, the government’s tax package is also economically irresponsible. It comes at the expense of measures to strengthen the Australian economy. For people paying off a mortgage, it enhances the risk that the Reserve Bank will be forced to raise interest rates to deal with inflationary pressures caused by strong consumer demand and capacity constraints. Australia needs tax reform, not just tax cuts. The government forfeited the chance to institute real tax reform; instead, it took the opportunity to reward its political base of high-income earners.</para>
<para>The Treasury has repeatedly advised of the need to increase work force participation if economic growth is to be sustained as the population ages. The government’s tax cuts ignore the economic imperative to address the demographic challenge facing Australia. In contrast, Labor’s plan is not only fairer but also more economically efficient. A key feature of Labor’s plan is the introduction of a new low-income Welfare to Work bonus. For people earning up to $20,000 per year, the low-income and Welfare to Work tax offset would deliver an effective tax-free threshold of $10,000. This would reduce the crippling effective marginal tax rates for those on low incomes. Currently, single allowance recipients can face effective marginal tax rates of up to 75c in the dollar. That is right: 75c in the dollar.</para>
<para>Single income families with dependants can face effective marginal tax rates of over 100 per cent. The new tax offset proposed by Labor would phase out at a taper rate of five per cent. Under Labor’s proposal, in 2006-07 workers earning up to $31,000 would benefit from the tax offset. This tax offset tackles the problem of high effective marginal tax rates faced by welfare recipients returning to work. These measures will strengthen the Australian economy by enhancing labour force participation.</para>
<para>As my colleague the shadow Treasurer has noted, the economic literature on labour supply elasticity indicates that low-income workers are more likely to be responsive to incentives than high-income earners. That is right, Senator McGauran—that is the economic literature. If you choose to look beyond your own vested self-interest, the economic literature is clear: low-income workers are more likely to be responsive to incentives than high-income earners. But do not let the facts get in the way of a good bit of political bull. In other words, if you want to increase labour force participation, you get far more bang for your buck by focusing tax reform on reducing effective marginal tax rates for low-income earners. This is the approach that Labor has taken.</para>
<para>Labor is also concerned that tax cuts should not add to inflationary pressures and force the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates. Low- and middle-income mortgagees are well aware that any increase in interest rates would quickly swallow up any tax relief. During the last election campaign the coalition made much of its promise to keep interest rates low. At the same time in the run-up to last year’s election the government engaged in a reckless $66 billion spending spree to buy its way back into power. Labor warned then that mortgagees would pay the price for the government’s irresponsible fiscal policy. In March the seeds sown by the government in 2004 bore their bitter fruit when the Reserve Bank lifted interest rates by 0.25 per cent. There is macho man, Finance Minister Minchin, who allowed this runaway spending. What did you think when you passed up to the Prime Minister for his campaign speech, ‘Here, pick one from these six or seven options,’ and he took the lot? You laugh, but you should be ashamed of yourself. The hard man of the Liberal Party right wing! <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I also join this debate on the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline>, which in reality comprises, as the debate is showing today, the tax cuts announced on budget night. We all know, Senator Minchin, better than anyone sitting in cabinet, that tax is often a pious debate at the best of times. We heard the Democrats outdoing the Labor Party in their bidding. It is often a bidding war, and we know, whatever tax cuts we put up, even the public would want more than is delivered. It is often a pious debate, but nothing could have been more pious than Senator Conroy’s speech here today. It absolutely takes the cake. He has outdone the two other speakers from the non-government side. Senator Conroy has delivered something more pious and more fake than the other two, who did a very good job. He hid behind some <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> poll, if we are meant to believe the figures of that. I will be checking the <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> later on. He mentioned a <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> poll. He called the government’s tax cuts a scam.</para>

<para>The second speaker, Senator Sherry, enters the chamber. The Labor Party only had three speakers. You are never short of getting speakers in the Senate. It is the place of debate. It has been the most filibustering, obstructionist Senate for the nine years of this government. We are never short of getting Labor Party speakers to come in here day and night. The backbench would queue up. In fact, it was very hard to get a government speaker on before one o’clock at night sometimes. But today what do we have? Three speakers joined the debate. I was shocked. In fact, The Nationals contributed two speakers to the Labor Party’s three. What a joke. I had to rush this speech through.

<para>—What I am trying to point out, Senator Sherry, as you say, ‘Get on with the debate’—I will—is that you have lost support from your own backbench. None of them will come forward and argue the indefensible. They know this is ridiculous and the sooner it is over the better; the less said the better. That is the new approach to this tax debate. Senator Sherry tried. The only thing Senator Conroy did was not come in here with his usual over the top style of debating, because even he has been quelled on this. It is absolutely absurd. Senator Conroy claims that we have misjudged the Labor Party and the tactic that they would take in blocking this tax cut. He is right. We utterly misjudged the Labor Party, that the Labor Party would be so stupid, so idiotic, so dangerous.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>As Senator Boswell said, you have almost reached the stage where you have become unelectable. I remember that when we were in opposition there was a ridiculous stage we had reached—never so bad as this, of course; we knew never to deny the Australian people a tax cut of any sort—in 1993, which Senator Boswell will remember, where we would not take any amendment cuts on the Native Title Bill. That is when you know you have been in opposition too long. My point is that you reach a stage where you really do become unelectable. You become so obstructionist, so caught up in your own internal politics, so idiotic and political that you cannot see the wood for the trees. That is the stage that you have reached today in denying the tax cuts to the Australian people. Senator Conroy is absolutely correct: we utterly misjudged you. We never thought you would do this.</para>
<para>Senator Conroy finished his 20-minute contribution by raising the fact that the government promised during the election period to spend $66 billion on commitments and promises, which we are fully committed to and are fulfilling—in the last budget all those promises were met. He finished by saying that that was a threat to low interest rates and that the Reserve Bank has sent out that warning, as if to say we should not even be introducing any tax cuts. I know those cuts were a big surprise to the Labor Party on budget night. It caught them flat-footed. It caught the shadow minister, Mr Swan, flat-footed and caught Mr Smith and obviously Mr Beazley totally flat-footed. So they went into what they instinctively know, and that is to object, to go into their negative mode. They were caught flat-footed, so much so that they decided to reject these tax cuts.</para>
<para>So Senator Conroy—just to finish that point on Senator Conroy and move on from his idiotic speech—was suggesting that tax cuts actually feed into higher interest rates, and the Reserve Bank have sent out that warning. So what he is really saying is that their offer is not really an offer at all. If the Labor Party ever got into government, no-one would believe that they would deliver. Even so, the suggestion that the tax cuts would feed into higher interest rates is ridiculous.</para>
<para>The truth of the matter is that these tax cuts announced on budget night were unexpected but indeed most welcome. Unlike the Labor Party, who were caught flat-footed on the night, we actually had a structure, a philosophy and a policy behind it all. As the Treasurer said in his speech, setting out the philosophy behind these tax cuts:</para>
<quote>
<para>After we balance our budget, reduce Labor’s debt, and fund our services we should reduce taxes as far as is prudent.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So it is quite obvious that the philosophy behind these tax cuts is like a dividend to the Australian people. Good economic management right from our first budget, our first tough budget in 1996, allows us to pay these dividends. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the Treasurer’s 10th budget was his best. He increased spending in all portfolios. He reduced debt, which will be zero by 2007. What government can increase spending, reduce debt, cut taxes and maintain the reform momentum all at the same time? This was the Treasurer’s finest budget ever, his finest hour, and we are proud to say that he was able to include these tax cuts.</para>
<para>On each occasion the government got to the point where we were able to offer these tax cuts as they came along because we took the first tough steps in 1996 and have in every budget since. But the Labor Party, from 1996, have objected to every reform this government have tried to introduce. To date you have rejected our industrial relations reform, but has anyone heard of any strikes down at the waterfront lately? Has anyone noticed the country going out in sympathy with regard to secondary boycotts or anything like that? No. That reform has brought peace and harmony to the economy, but the Labor Party were against our initial industrial relations reform.</para>
<para>In the area of welfare we have introduced mutual obligation and we have targeted welfare fraud. The Labor Party were against that, yet that was all part of producing a surplus budget and being responsible economically. It is the same with regard to the Medicare safety net, and so it goes on in the area of education. You are even against reforms to support rural and regional areas such as Regional Partnerships. I am sure—you can remind me, Senator Boswell—that just about everything in the rural and regional area that we put up has been obstructed by the Labor Party in this house, either by filibustering or by voting it down.</para>
<para>You have paid a high price for that, just as you will pay a high price for your rejection and obstruction of these personal income tax cuts. The price you paid at the last election was the highest yet. Political pundits probably though that they would never see the day in modern politics when a government would again hold the majority in the Senate. How wrong they were. When the opposition get so weak and put up such a dangerous leader, do you really think you are going to put that over the Australian people? That is where we will be after 1 July. That is the answer the Australian people gave you at the last election: they told you to get your economic management in order. You are not listening. You have not listened. If this is your response then we are likely to increase our majority in the Senate after the next election. That is the price you paid at the last election; you are heading down the same track again. But far be it from me to give you gratuitous advice. I am quite enjoying the level of absurdity that the opposition have reached. Senator Buckland sits over there as Opposition Whip—</para>

<para>—Yes, Senator Boswell, he certainly was when it came to forestry issues. I just noticed Senator Brown over there; I must thank him for his strong stance in the area of forestry at the last election. It certainly sucked in Mr Latham and the Labor Party. I must thank him for the lack of reality that he has contributed to the Labor Party. Senator Brown ignores me, but he knows only too well that it was his advice to the last leader of the Labor Party—we await his book coming out in October; that should be another fine read!—and his lack of reality and the Greens’ lack of reality that led to the absurdity that we had in Tasmania with regard to forestry policy. Paul Lennon, the Premier of Tasmania then and now, rejected the Labor Party policy on old-growth forests, as he rejects your policy on tax cuts. He is standing up to you, in other words.

At least, that is what I think they are doing; unless he too is going to ride right over the top of them. But he had some wise words to say. He put it quite simply, saying that his own union and all tradesmen will benefit from these tax cuts. It is an absolute fallacy what the Labor Party is selling, that these tax cuts are not directed to the working man and woman of Australia. They are directed to the heart of the working man and woman.

That is Bill Shorten talking to you from within your own party, a man who is from the union and has all the credentials to be able to influence you, but what do you choose? You choose to listen to Mr Swan. I have a strong suspicion it may well be the last time that the Labor Party listen to Mr Swan—I would say that would be the last time. It is just a matter of time before Mr Swan is graciously, I suspect, moved on.</para>
<para>The truth of the matter is that this government has a record of tax reform. We have undertaken major tax reform. There have been income tax cuts in 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2005. We have cut company tax, we have halved capital gains tax and we had the courage to fundamentally restructure the tax system and go to the people in the 1998 election with the GST, which included income tax cuts. We had the courage like no other government to face the Australian people with regard to the GST, which cut wholesale sales tax and taxes from exporters and so on. The Australian people had confidence in us, and we brought that system in in 2000. So we are a continuing reform government—unlike the Labor Party, who, when they were in government, simply increased taxes. They increased company tax—first you decreased it and then you could not take that, so you increased it. In just about every budget you increased wholesale sales taxes. You jacked up the excise tax on petrol in just about every single budget until you got sick of the political reaction to that and then you simply indexed it.</para>
<para>But personal income tax reform goes down in political folklore and political legend with regard to the l-a-w law tax cuts. You promised, before an election, major personal income tax cuts. You legislated for it—it was law to deliver those tax cuts. Then you had the nerve on the other side of the 1993 election to come in here and overturn the law on personal income tax cuts—a promise on which people had voted for you. Of course, you introduced the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax and so it goes on. So your whole culture is shown up here today—your tax culture. It is a simple cliche but it sums you up: a big-spending, big-taxing party—that is what you were in government and that is what you will be. This is just a facade, just a front you are putting up to posture, knowing you will never have to deliver.</para>
<para>As the last speaker I can see that my colleagues want to get to the vote on this. Let us test the mettle. Let us see if those backbenchers who have been hiding all day from this whole debate front up and vote. You watch them: when this debate is over and the bill is through the Senate, they will all be back on the speakers list, pontificating. But when it comes to important issues like dollars in the pockets of the Australian people, where are they? They skedaddle. Their first loyalty is to the Labor Party, the Labor caucus. It is not to their electorate, not to the Australian people and not to building an incentive into the economy; it is to their own personal caucus. You have paid a high price in the past and you will continue to pay a high price for the decision you are going to make today.</para>

<para>—I wrap up this second reading debate on the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline> by thanking all those who have spoken on the bill, particularly my colleagues Senator Boswell and Senator McGauran. I want to make a couple of points. I guess the Labor Party in their private moments would now accept that they made a terrible mistake on budget night to decide to vote against the government tax cuts. It is one thing to rhetorically claim that the tax cuts are unfair or whatever it is that the Labor Party believe—that is fair enough; that is democracy—but clearly it was an enormous error of political judgment, for which the Labor Party have paid a very high price, to rush to a decision on budget night and say that they would do what they are about to do and seek effectively to block our tax cuts.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The ancillary point is that I would have thought the Labor Party in particular would have some great reservations about doing that. We are a government that have just been re-elected with a swing in our favour. I would have thought that that does give us in a democracy, as the duly elected government, the right to bring down a budget, propose our tax cuts and not have the power of the Senate used to try to stop those tax cuts being brought into effect. That is, in effect, to announce to the public that you are going to block a central part of the budget of the newly re-elected government. I would have thought the Labor Party of all parties would have thought that was inappropriate. Nevertheless, we will go through this debate. We will see if the Senate does effectively block these proposals.</para>
<para>I would like to conclude these remarks by thanking the Democrats, the Greens and the Independent senators on behalf of the government for at least acknowledging the democratic right of the duly elected government to give effect to its proposals for tax cuts by announcing that they will not support any disallowance of the proposed tax schedule to give effect to those tax cuts. I think it has left the Labor Party in a terrible position. I gather Mr Beazley has still not said whether or not he will move disallowance of those tax schedules in this chamber. So I thank, on behalf of all Australian taxpayers, the minor parties and the Independents for recognising the reality of the prerogative of a duly elected government to give effect to its vision for tax reform in this country.</para>

<para>—I am going to assume, Minister Minchin and shadow minister Sherry, that you pretty well understand the arguments we have put. I do not intend to repeat my remarks at length. We are going to move amendment (1), and if this amendment goes down we will then move amendments (2) and (3). Of course, if by some miracle amendment (1) got up, then we would not need to move amendments (2) and (3). So that is how they will be dealt with. I therefore move Democrat amendment (1):</para>

<para class="block">Amendment (1) is a quite simple item. It increases the tax-free threshold from the present $6,000 to $10,000. The effect of that would be to provide a tax cut of $680 a year to everyone earning over $10,000—everyone earning under $10,000 will not be subject to income tax. There would then be an additional 400,000 taxpayers presently paying tax who would no longer pay tax. You would therefore end up with some 1.8 million income earners below $10,000 not subject to income tax. The cost is estimated by the Democrats—and we do not have the ability to model this—to be between $5.39 billion and $5.6 billion each year for the next three years. This is roughly the same as for the government’s tax proposal. In fact, this amendment is meant to reflect our alternative proposal to that of the government. Our estimate is that around 7.5 million Australians will be better off under the Democrats proposal—and that is about half a million more than I have heard the Labor Party say will be better off as a result of their proposal.</para>
<para>Put simply, the Australian Democrats accept that tax cuts are warranted as a result of there being a very substantial budget surplus. However, we believe very strongly that the greatest tax burden is on low-income earners and they have the highest effective marginal tax rates. We are also convinced that improving their tax situation will improve welfare-to-work possibilities, lift disposable income and living standards considerably and lessen the pressure on the minimum wage case. We are not averse to high-income earners getting tax cuts; we just do not believe that they should get them first. We have spelt out that position very clearly in our various press releases and it was also spelt out in the speech I made earlier today in the second reading debate on the bill.</para>
<para>Our structural reform proposal over a number of years would be to raise the tax-free threshold, certainly to this $10,000 we are putting here today and then to $12,500, which is the poverty or minimum subsistence line, and then towards $20,000, which only some retired Australians presently get the benefit of. We argue that the income tax rates should be indexed. We argue that raising the top rate—and I have suggested $120,000, which is not far away from the government’s $125,000—requires the base to be broadened. We are advocating strong structural tax reform, but you can only do what is affordable, and what is affordable right now from our perspective is to increase the tax-free threshold. We consider that that would deliver a better tax outcome to nearly everyone earning under $60,000, with respect to Labor’s proposal, and everyone earning under $65,000, with respect to the coalition’s proposal. The question of course is whether there is support in the chamber for this approach.</para>

<para>—I do want to make some specific comments about the Democrat amendments but I also want to touch on the themes or the propositions that were put by Senator Minchin in his concluding remarks, the principles in terms of the tax issues we are considering and some issues relating to the Greens’ second reading amendment that was just defeated.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Firstly, on Senator Minchin: I must admit Senator McGauran was a hard act to follow but, unlike Senator McGauran, Senator Minchin kept his contribution mercifully short. But I put that aside. Senator Minchin referred to us, the Labor Party, with words to the effect that we had made a terrible mistake, made a political judgment and rushed the decision to block the government’s tax cuts. That was the basic theme of one of his sets of comments. The Labor Party decided not to support the government’s tax package because it was immediately obvious to the Labor Party that it was not a fair package and it was not balanced. It was not hard to make a call in those circumstances. I outlined why in my speech in the second reading debate. I will give a little bit more detail of Labor’s alternative package and alternative set of propositions when we get to those amendments.</para>
<para>Senator Minchin made the point that the government had just been re-elected, it had brought down a budget and it had a fundamental right to do what it was proposing. With a little bit of reflection on history, I should remind Senator Minchin that we were in a very similar position—in principle, an identical position—after the 1998 election. The Labor Party refused to support a GST and there was, frankly, a rush by the Democrats to engage and negotiate with the government of the day on that GST package. Even though that package had been presented as part of the 1998 election, the Labor Party decided that the GST was not a fair tax, and we stood on that principle, as we are doing here today. The Labor Party made a decision that we would fight this issue. Whether it is at a political cost or not, we will see. We made a decision we would fight on principle and we would present a fairer and more balanced alternative, and that is precisely what we are doing.</para>
<para>I might remind the government that this package we are considering from the government was not presented to the electorate at the last election. The government won the election. That is the reality of life. You move on. But it does not mean that a Labor opposition, because we lost the election, have to automatically vote in support of every government measure that is then presented to the Senate after that election.</para>

<para>—Or do away with the Senate. I have to say I do not remember this attitude—Senator Minchin was not here at the time—after the 1993 election when the Labor budget of 1994 was presented. There were some tax changes in that budget and the now government fought and opposed those tax changes tooth and nail. The Labor Party argued a lot of issues around the tax changes in the 1994 budget. We did not argue that the Liberal Party should automatically sign up because we had just been re-elected. I just make those observations about the issues surrounding principles.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>One central principle for the Labor Party is: is this tax package fundamentally fair both in the context of the budget and the 10 years of this government? Labor—rightly, in my view, and I believe this passionately—came to the conclusion that it was not fair, we should not support it and we should offer a positive alternative. The bottom line is it is $6 a week for low- and middle-income Australians from this Liberal government. Labor have developed and costed an alternative proposal that responsibly delivers double that figure—$12 a week for low- and middle-income earners in this country.</para>
<para>I will make a couple of comments about the approach in principle of the Greens. They moved an amendment on the second reading, which has been defeated. In summary: it opposed any tax cut and argued that the money should be allocated towards improving government services, health, education and the like. I would just like to draw the attention of the Senate to the Greens’ policy platform, which specifically commits the Greens to:</para>

</motion>
<para class="block">This is a report from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission of an inquiry into complaints by immigration detainees concerning their detention at the Curtin Immigration Reception and Processing Centre. This report is another example—one amongst the now countless number of examples—of what the minister herself and the department head of DIMIA have now acknowledged is a major problem with the culture of the immigration department.</para>
<para>This report shows that that problem goes back a long way, because it deals with complaints made by a range of detainees—all of them asylum seekers—back in 2000-01. It has taken that long for this report to even be tabled in the parliament. That is example No. 1 of why the current so-called checks and balances are inadequate. The department often says, ‘If people have problems, they can complain to the Human Rights Commissioner and the Ombudsman.’ These people complained about their treatment back in 2001, and here is the report four years later.</para>
<para>The finding of the Human Rights Commissioner was quite unequivocal. The finding was that the rights of most of the people who complained under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights had been breached. Another example of how far out of whack everything in this area has gone is the fact that reports like this, in which the Human Rights Commissioner can find that the immigration department and the then detention centre providers, ACM, have breached people’s human rights, are tabled here with no comment and with barely a yawn. If I had not stood up to speak to it, it would have passed without any notice at all.</para>
<para>Our government breaches the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as determined under our own law through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, but nobody cares. It is par for the course for the government and the department to ignore these findings, as they have in the past. This is not the first time such a finding has occurred. The specific aspect of these complaints was that a range of people—26 complainants—were put in separation detention in Curtin detention centre for significant periods of time. According to DIMIA’s own figures, the greatest of those periods was 264 days. Separation detention is when people are put in a separate area when they first arrive in detention and can have no contact with anyone outside that area. They can have no contact with the outside world and no contact with anybody else even within the facility. They can have no contact with a lawyer or the Ombudsman unless specifically requested. Again, that is a clear example of the problem with the culture. They put people away from everything else. They do not even let them know their rights, and it is only if detainees know the magic words to specifically request a lawyer or specifically know to request to talk to the Ombudsman, for example, that they then can speak to them—and only about that specific issue.</para>
<para>The commissioner, in looking at the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, looked at the relevant law and what is called the body of principles that has been developed around that international law for the protection of all persons under any form of detention. One example of the sort of sophistry and distortion of culture that DIMIA had developed even four or five years ago is the fact that they said those laws did not apply because it is not penal or correctional detention; it is immigration detention. The department’s answer was, ‘We don’t even need to comply with those basic minimum principles because it’s not correctional detention; it is administrative detention, so we can operate on worse principles than the basic principles for correctional detention.’ That is bad enough, but the fact is that they were wrong anyway. It is quite clearly stated that the body of principles is meant to apply to all people under any form of detention. This report gives page after page of blatant breaches and blatant contempt for any due process and for the basic humanity of people. This was four or five years ago. The same is happening today. If anything, it is possibly worse because they have been allowed to get away with it for all that length of time and, not surprisingly, they have therefore become more and more blase about that sort of treatment of human beings. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

<para>—One of the nice things about the privilege of serving in Australia’s parliament for such a long time is seeing things that I have been involved in mature and come to fruition. Tonight I would like to draw the Senate’s attention to the environment and to the health of our environment. The way we live with our environment, use it, abuse it and protect it is the single most important factor in Australia’s national security and long-term prosperity. Our dependence on more and more intensive use of resources, more and more land clearing, more and more ploughing of marginal sandy soils and more and more greenhouse gas emissions cannot continue. Already we are realising there is a problem with water use in the Murray-Darling Basin, but this is just one of the problems that must be addressed as a matter of urgency. This is not scaremongering; it is a simple assessment drawn from history and from looking at the steadily worsening environmental indicators and the steadily increasing clean-up costs.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I have committed a lot of time to environment issues during my period as a senator because I believe they are so fundamentally important. While I have certainly added my voice to protect various species and various places, I have also pinpointed the processes that are causing such detrimental change. I believe you need four things to happen if you are to consider your time in this chamber worth while. Firstly, you need to be able to point to—to shine light on—specific issues for your constituents, issues that you care about. Secondly, you need to make responsible policy and legislative change. Thirdly, you need to make changes to funding, both to add investment or dollars to your area of concern and to take money, subsidies or incentives away from destructive practices or in some cases put in penalties if all else fails. Fourthly, you need to bring others with you, through compromise, through gradually moving the majority in the direction that makes a difference and that makes Australia a better place. Let me take these in turn, particularly as they relate to the environment.</para>
<para>Shining a light is easy. There are many opportunities built into the Senate structure for standing up and talking about the things that really matter to you and speaking on behalf of your constituents. I imagine that will be more difficult in the new Senate. But shining a light or highlighting an issue is only the first step. Extracts from speeches may make great fill in senators’ newsletters, but words do not in the end save a single tree. In fact, I would describe them on their own as just no-brainers.</para>
<para>Some take an ecocentric view of the world. They think only of the environment. When they think of the environment they say: ‘All species are victims; all humans are destroyers.’ Anyone who wants to protect species is innocent; anyone who they see as threatening them is a destroyer. It is a very simple world to live in. There are a number of individuals and some environment lobby groups who operate to this formula. These ecocentrics never compromise. The other side is always wrong and, more than that, the other side is always evil. For the ecocentrics, the sky is always falling down. Catastrophe is just around the corner. Disaster is looming. They always want environmental nirvana, and they want utopia and nirvana now. They have the odd titular political head, who is worshipped as long as this person does not compromise.</para>
<para>Their warnings about the environment are often fairly accurate but their methods of achieving change are highly questionable. You see, making the rest of us out to be planet destroyers and never compromising leads to really achieving nothing. In fact, you get 100 per cent of nothing. It is indulgent behaviour, and it is behaviour that is failing us because little is achieved on the ground other than getting other people’s backs up. So things actually continue to get worse. Sure, they may be able to point at the odd piece of wilderness they have saved. As a matter of fact, I can point out a few that I have contributed to protecting—most recently, the Brooklyn station in Queensland. But, as I said, the route of words alone is a no-brainer route.</para>
<para>I will consider the second and third ways to make one’s time in the Senate worth while together. Making policy and legislative change and getting funding shifted from destructive practices to positive practices is difficult. It often wins you very few friends, particularly in the short term; it is hard work; and it is long hours spent poring through the detail. It is many meetings and long arguments. It is proving your point with research. It is consulting up-to-date experts and it is the use of persuasion. It is being accommodating when other arguments are put to you that you consider fair and reasonable. It involves relentless pressure from others, particularly from those lobby groups and often from the media. It involves carefully checking arguments before either accepting or dismissing them. It involves having a purpose and a commitment to achieving real change and wearing the flak.</para>
<para>In the late 1990s I decided to negotiate seriously with the current government on the complete rewrite of most of Australia’s federal environment laws. With a number of environment groups against it and with pressure on me to say no under any circumstances, this was difficult. However, I could not ignore the fact that it was processes in the existing laws that were leading to Franklin dams, the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef, the killing of species and the destruction of habitat, and development being done without any consideration for the environmental impact. As well, state and federal governments were running rampant with ever-decreasing environmental protection laws.</para>
<para>No, I did not get everything I wanted in the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, but neither did the government. I got most of what I wanted. The legislation passed in 1999. The result is the world’s first comprehensive biodiversity legislation that carries jail terms as well as monetary penalties—legislation that protected world heritage and wetlands properly, that protected endangered species very thoroughly, that drew the states into line and that meant the federal environment minister, not the resources minister, made environment decisions. It is a piece of legislation with extensive third-party powers for legal action to protect the environment. That was a first in Australia.</para>
<para>Strangely, the ACF, the Wilderness Society, Greenpeace and Senator Brown rejected the legislation without reading the outcomes of all the negotiations, without reading the clauses or understanding how they would work. They started screaming injustice straightaway. Their press comments on nearly 600 meticulous amendments representing sweeping and fundamental changes to the draft came very quickly after they were published. They persuaded a gullible ALP, who were desperate to look different from this government on something—anything—to go with them and to vote against the bill. In doing so, they locked themselves into an uncompromising position of saying no to good policy reform. They were led all the way by Senator Brown from the Greens, the champion no-compromiser.</para>
<para>Many good people, sadly, fell victim to ideology and did not see the realistic and good public policy outcomes that were achieved. Fortunately, groups like the Queensland Conservation Council, the Humane Society International, the Tasmanian Conservation Trust and WWF were focused on fixing the law, and we worked diligently together to do just that and make the new legislation. But it came at a price. Considerable invective was thrown at us, privately and publicly, by the likes of Senator Brown, the ACF, Greenpeace and the Wilderness Society. They tried some quite nasty things behind the scenes, including pressure to get one of the supportive conservationists sacked. Publicly, they berated us in interviews and in press releases and set in place a grudge they wore on their sleeves for a number of years.</para>
<para>It is now six years, almost to the day, since those negotiations and I want to quickly bring the Senate up to date by addressing the fourth way I listed to make our time in the Senate worth while, and that is to bring others with you—moving the majority in a direction that does make a difference in the longer term. We now have an extensive web site for the EPBC Act, which shows every step of the way as an environment decision travels through the processes. That helps both conservationists and individuals in the local community. I have been informed that this is a model of public transparency and decision making that is world recognised. We have extensive environmental administration and governance coming from a stronger federal environment department. We have nearly all state and territory governments amending their legislation to bring it up to the federal standard. We have developers who work with the federal environment department from the beginning of their projects to make sure they put in enough protection to make a permit possible. Indeed, there is even one running seminars on how to do it.</para>
<para>There are many stories of proponents now talking environment from the word go rather than ignoring it all the way through. We have had considerable positive feedback from utilities, corporations and, yes, conservationists and local communities on the functioning of the act. There have been injunctions to protect species, force the environment minister to take more action and, in a full Federal Court decision, even put downstream and cumulative effects into the environment minister’s area of consideration.</para>
<para>I have one more thing to note. Six years on, Greenpeace have investigated using the act in a legal case. The ACF underwrote the Nathan Dam case, which was the most favourable win for conservationists in a decade. The Wilderness Society has used the act, and now even Senator Bob Brown is heading into the court brandishing it, with his usual moral outrage fuelling his feet. May you use the act often and wisely and well, Senator Brown. And may you one day have the courage to admit that you were wrong—you should not have opposed it absolutely; you should have worked with us to help improve it.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak about this government’s betrayal of the people of Tasmania, particularly in the area of industrial relations. The Prime Minister continues to make the Orwellian claim that his government is the best friend of the Australian worker. Yet we know, and those opposite know, that this is simply untrue. It is untrue for Australia, and doubly so for my home state of Tasmania.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is because many Tasmanians rely on the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to provide them with a decent living wage. Sadly, for up to 100,000 Tasmanians, last week’s decision by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to grant an extra $17 per week to low-paid workers will be the last piece of good news they will receive. The award increase of $17 per week lifts the minimum weekly wage to $484.40 and will help keep the wages of low-paid Tasmanian workers ahead of projected inflation. But if the Prime Minister had had his way last week, up to 100,000 Tasmanian workers would have received $6 a week less—that is $312 less over the coming year. The amount of $312 is not much for members of the Howard government. In fact, it is not much more than five weeks worth of tax cuts that they have decided to award themselves. But it is a hell of a lot for Tasmanian workers on the minimum wage.</para>
<para>In the current national wage case, the Prime Minister supported an increase in the minimum wage of just 2.35 per cent, or an extra 29c per hour. That is less than the rate of inflation and would have resulted in a continuing real wage reduction for up to 100,000 Tasmanians. Since coming into power in 1996, the Howard government has opposed every minimum wage case outcome. Since 1996, if the Prime Minister—the alleged workers’ best friend—had had his way, many Tasmanian workers and their families would today be $50 per week, or $2,600 per year, worse off. The Howard government’s ongoing support for a reduction in real wages is a worrying sign for the lowest paid workers in Tasmania. Under its industrial relations plan, the independent Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which has delivered fair and sustainable wage increases for low-paid workers for 98 years, will be replaced by a hand-picked low-pay commission. The low-pay commission is likely to be little more than a rubber stamp, allowing the Howard government to cut the real wages of low-paid Tasmanians as it has sought to do in national wage cases during the entirety of its life in government.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations have refused to guarantee that individual Australian workers and their families will not be worse off under their proposed industrial relations changes. In the wake of this latest Australian Industrial Relations Commission wage case, and the refusal of the government to guarantee that workers will not be worse off, Senators Abetz, Barnett, Colbeck, Watson and Calvert must explain to the people of Tasmania why their government thinks low-paid Tasmanians deserve to have their real wages cut. The Prime Minister has defended his industrial relations package—his latest attack on a fair go for Australian workers—on the basis that it will create new jobs. A key component of the package is, of course, regressive changes to the unfair dismissal laws. The link between job creation and making it lawful to sack people unfairly has not been explained by the Howard government, its acolytes in the media and, of course, those right-wing think tanks that seem to always support it. The government has a responsibility to make the case and so far it has failed miserably to do so.</para>
<para>The shallowness of the government’s position is exposed by the results of the latest survey of national business expectations by Dun and Bradstreet. The survey reveals that, when questioned specifically about the impact of the unfair dismissal component of the Howard government’s industrial relations reforms, more than 80 per cent of businesses said they expected they would have little or no impact on their intention to employ new staff. That puts paid to the Prime Minister’s claims that unfair dismissal laws have held back jobs growth in Australia. Instead, it is the Howard government which has held back small business and jobs growth by creating red tape and neglecting to invest in the skills and infrastructure Australia so desperately needs.</para>
<para>It was the Howard government which crippled small business with the red tape of the business activity statement. And it is the Howard government which, from July this year, will increase the red tape burden on small business when the choice of superannuation legislation takes effect. The coalition claims to be the best friend small business ever had, yet it lumps its small business best friends with hours of extra paperwork under choice of super legislation, and threatens to fine or even imprison small business operators who make an honest mistake in contravention of the complex compliance procedures under the new super choice regime.</para>
<para>If Mr Howard wanted to assist Tasmanian businesses, surely he would take the axe to the red tape his government is creating instead of taking the axe to the wages and conditions of Tasmanian workers. The Tasmanian people know they should take cover whenever members of this government start talking about being their best friend. Before the last election the Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, said the Howard government was the best friend Medicare has ever had. Unbelievably, he is still saying it. But, as we all know, within months of the poll—in a backflip that, even by the low standards of the Howard government, is one of the most disgraceful in Australian political history—it had trashed the Medicare safety net. That backflip has made government MPs like Michael Ferguson and Mark Baker look pretty silly, given how they campaigned on the Medicare safety net prior to the last election. But, worse, that feat of acrobatics will cost Tasmanian families and workers hundreds extra each year in health costs.</para>
<para>The Howard government claims it is the best friend that families have ever had, but the interest rate rise of March this year—and those still to come—can be attributed to its neglect of investment in skills and infrastructure, Australia’s blossoming debt balloon and the government’s preparedness to blow $66 billion in taxpayers’ funds to get itself re-elected. The Tasmanian people are right to worry when the Howard government declares itself to be their best friend, because with friends like the Howard government, frankly, who needs enemies?</para>

</talker>
<para>—In three weeks time, after 22 years in this place, I will leave the Senate and end my formal political career. But tonight I do not want to make a valedictory speech—that will come next week. Tonight, I want to talk on what is more in the form of a last word on a serious issue. That serious issue is the creeping attempt by the federal government to remake the Constitution of Australia—and to remake it by the use of executive power and the power of incumbency.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let me explain. Since the election of the Howard government, it has been made clear that it intends to intrude on the rights of states in several ways. There is a pattern to what is emerging. It is emerging from the same cabinet and therefore one must assume it is working to the same theme by that cabinet. This government intends to enact legislation—and we will deal with those bills in this sitting fortnight, so I will not go into them in any detail now—to impose a new industrial relation system in a cavalier way that overrides the established industrial relations systems of the states. This is not something negotiated between the Commonwealth and the states; this is something to be imposed on the states by the Commonwealth. It intends to do this by utilising a section of the Constitution—the corporations power—which is not intended for industrial relations.</para>
<para>The Australian Constitution has a particular section in it that deals with industrial disputes going beyond the borders of one state and it is from that section that our constitutional forebears, when they inserted it, knew a national system of industrial relations would grow up. Governments over the last century have used that section to legislate. This government intends to use a different section, never intended by our constitutional forebears to legislate on industrial relations, to impose a system over the states. If this view had been apparent at the time of the constitutional conventions in the 19th century leading into the establishment of the federation of Australia, Australia would not exist as a national entity now. It would have been seen as a power grab by a central government over the authority of the then colonies and now states. It would have been enough to kill the referendum and the support for a one-country Australia.</para>
<para>As well, this government intends—and is part way down the track of doing this—to take over some of the training and skills training responsibilities of the states by duplicating some of the work that state governments already do. This government has flagged that it intends to exert a bigger role over the states on health issues. The Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, has blithely—and, if reports are to be believed, without the approval or consultation of his cabinet colleagues—announced that he intends the Commonwealth to take control over the infrastructure supply chain for goods and services to our ports. The Treasurer has started to try to monster the states by blackmailing them with the income stream derived from the GST over what mix of state taxes should be imposed in state budgets. One could go on. These forays into state jurisdictions go well beyond the traditional methods of tied grants or, as we have seen since this government came to power, blackmailing universities or construction companies on which laws should apply in the industrial relations system.</para>
<para>Put together, this is a full-throated power grab which remakes the constitutional structure of the federation—and it is nothing short of that. This is an attempt at revolution of the Australian Constitution using the powers of incumbency, using the taxing power which provides the financial succour that the states need to support their services and using other mechanisms to force federal authority over the states. If Gough Whitlam had the reputation—and there was a perception of this—that he was an ardent centralist, then this goes well beyond any Whitlamesque dream of central authority in Australia and takes controls off the states.</para>
<para>It is appropriate that these remarks be made in this chamber. The Senate is, after all, a states house. It is appropriate that these remarks be made in this chamber and that senators representing the states in this chamber stand up and defend the rights of their states. In doing so, I need to make one thing clear: I am not an absolute states rightist, come rain, hail or snow. I believe states have rights and I believe the Commonwealth has rights. It would be a good thing if we could find a more effective mechanism than we have in the hundred years since Federation to work out those differences more cooperatively, but we have not.</para>
<para>What is true on the political landscape of Australia is that, at state level, voters prefer Labor. What is also unfortunately true, from my perspective, is that at federal level, over the last couple of elections, voters have preferred a conservative government. On that analysis, it means that voters want to see the efficient delivery of services that they know Labor believes in and can deliver at their local level. In terms of political theory, it may mean that in these days of terrorism they are more comfortable at federal level with a government that they perceive—in my submission, wrongly, but nonetheless—as being of a more militaristic bent than Labor has an image for. Whatever the case, the fact that the federal government has been elected does not give it an authority to undermine the power of the states.</para>
<para>I am surprised that in this chamber little or nothing has been said about the manoeuvres by the federal government to intrude upon state authority. I will defend the rights of states where it is constitutionally appropriate, because this power grab by the Commonwealth has not been preceded by a referendum. It has not been preceded by proper federal-state negotiations inviting the ceding of powers by the states, which is the other way of changing the federal Constitution. And it would be thrown out of court, if it ever went to the High Court, because it is such a radical revolution in the meaning of this Constitution that, even in the wildest of fancies, at federal level no judges sitting true and good in the High Court could interpret the actions of this government as conforming with anything that is a semblance of the Constitution. So it is appropriate that this chamber direct its attention to a government that is out of control constitutionally and is trying to strip the states of authoritative power.</para>
<para>Later in this sitting fortnight I intend to speak specifically about the role that the Treasurer has taken unto himself in demanding tax changes of state governments at state level. He has—in my view, fraudulently—put forward his argument based on understandings achieved at the time the GST was enacted. It is true, and I will say this now, that when the GST was mooted there was an understanding between the Commonwealth and the states about which state taxes would be collapsed in favour of a revenue stream from the GST, but this chamber knows better than any other chamber in this Commonwealth that the GST legislation was amended, and it was amended here. It was amended to take food out of the GST, which junked all of the previous arrangements that applied and invited and obtained a new set of arrangements which altered the commitment of the states to remove certain taxes. For the Treasurer now to pretend that the first deal is still intact is of course laughable. When I speak later on this in more detail I will go to the instruments of federal-state understanding which establish that point.</para>

There are things that are passing fancies in terms of popular politics which may not be constitutional, but ministers and governments—and this federal government—have an obligation to uphold the Constitution, not subvert it, in my view, and I think that is the view of any reasonable Australian.</para>

<para>In my own state of Western Australia some of these changes have been greeted by the conservative opposition in that state with a big thumbs down. Industrial relations is one of them. The new state leader in Western Australia, Matt Birney, has made it clear—to the embarrassment of the federal industrial relations minister, Kevin Andrews, standing on the same platform—that he does not support the power grab from the Commonwealth. And full marks to Matt Birney for defending the rights of Western Australians. He wants to obtain and maintain the right to legislate in this important area at a state level. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I begin by acknowledging Senator Cook’s speech. If I do not get an opportunity to wish him well in post-Senate life, I do so now: you are in fine form. I look forward to future speeches, certainly in the next couple of weeks. But tonight I wish to talk about a project in my home state of South Australia that is having a significant impact on women in developing countries around the world. It is the birthing kit project conducted by the Zonta Club of the Adelaide Hills. As I am sure honourable senators would be aware, Zonta is an international service organisation of women executives in business and the professions working together to advance the status of women generally. I recently had the privilege of being guest speaker at their annual general meeting and dinner in Adelaide.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The United Nations World Health Organisation estimated in 1996 that 585,000 women died annually in childbirth. Developing countries accounted for 99 per cent of these deaths. For every woman who dies in childbirth, a further 30 women incur injuries and infections, many of which are disabling, painful, embarrassing and lifelong. There are ways that are recommended to overcome or reduce these statistics. They include (1) preventing unwanted pregnancies, (2) improving antenatal care, (3) improving capacity for dealing with obstetric complications and (4), pretty simple, providing clean birthing conditions. This is where the Zonta Club of the Adelaide Hills comes in.</para>
<para>In 1995, Dr Joy O’Hazy, a member of the Zonta Club of the Adelaide Hills, attended the Fourth World Conference for Women in Beijing. There she heard Sally Field, the actor, talk about the success of simple birthing kits that were being used in Nepal. This led to Dr O’Hazy researching the basic resource requirements for a birthing kit, in consultation with Professor Anthony Radford, an international health consultant. In 1999, under the supervision of an experienced community development worker, the first 100 birthing kits were sent to Ferguson Island, Papua New Guinea, to be trialled by the village birth attendants in rural villages.</para>
<para>According to the PNG health department, in rural PNG there was a one in seven mortality rate in childbirth from infection. Hence, a clean birth would have the potential to make an enormous difference to the health of both the mother and the child. After receiving positive feedback from the community worker, the birthing kits became an integral part of the training of village birth attendants under the AusAID-sponsored Women’s and Children’s Health Project. In 2000, the project became nationally accepted and supported 12 provinces within PNG. To date, more than 13,000 kits have been provided to PNG.</para>
<para>Birthing kits provide for a clean birth, which may decrease the risk of death from infection and bleeding. A birthing kit works by providing the seven ‘cleans’ for a clean birth: a clean birth site, preventing delivery onto the floor; clean hands, to prevent the birth attendant transmitting germs to mother and baby; clean ties, to prevent bleeding from the umbilical cord for mother and baby; a clean razor, to reduce infection caused by other implements; clean gauze to wipe away birth canal secretions from the eyes, which reduces eye infections; a clean umbilical cord, because washing and drying the stumps prevents infection; and a clean perineum. The kit consists of a number of things, including a square metre plastic sheet for the mother to lie on, a piece of soap, two gloves, five gauze squares, three cord ties and a sterile scalpel blade—all contained in a press-seal plastic bag. It costs 70c to produce one of these kits.</para>
<para>Sixty million women give birth each year, with the assistance of a traditional birth attendant or with no assistance at all. These women need a birthing kit. The Zonta Club of the Adelaide Hills Birthing Kit Project did not stop at PNG. In addition to the 13,000 kits that were distributed in PNG, Zonta has distributed more than 11,000 kits to 12 countries. This amazing group of women have established the program with other NGOs and organisations in 22 countries, including Timor-Leste, Vietnam, Fiji, Ethiopia, Myanmar and Afghanistan. They have never lost a consignment in five years. They research all aspects of transport for the most reliable and cheapest way to move the kits around the world. There is no compromise when it comes to quality and accountability. The birthing kits are sent only to places where they have been requested. They are always distributed through health professionals in hospitals or health clinics—frequently where there are training programs for birth attendants. The health professional undertakes responsibility for training people in how to use the kits and how to dispose of waste.</para>
<para>The Adelaide Hills birthing kit project has been so successful and worthy that it has now become a Zonta national project. By the end of 2006, more than 550,000 Zonta birthing kits will have been requested from 22 developing countries. Through a partnership with the National Foundation for Australian Women, they have achieved tax deductibility status for donations to the project. I acknowledge the support of Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, in approving an AusAID grant to the project last year of $113,000 on a dollar for dollar basis, and I do remind him that the club is anticipating a further grant in July 2005.</para>
<para>The Zonta club have some impressive plans for the future: they will now encourage the local women to assemble their own birthing kits, as has occurred in Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea; they want to expand the project, using the successful model in Australia, to other Zonta countries worldwide; they want to make this a worldwide Zonta International Service Project; they want to create a birthing kit foundation; and they seek to conduct an epidemiological study of the impact of the birthing kits.</para>
<para>Assembly days for the kits are real community affairs, with participation from Zonta members, students of local schools, family members, friends and volunteers. At the 2004 assembly day, 60 volunteers assembled 2,000 birthing kits in three hours. I am informed that, on Saturday, 7 May 2005, they broke that record and assembled 2,400 kits. I commend the work of the project managers—Dr Julie Monis-Ivett and Dr Joy O’Hazy—the women of the Adelaide Hills branch of Zonta, and the wider Zonta International organisation for their dedication to this project, which is among many for which they are responsible when it comes to advancing the status of women across the world. I think women and families in developing countries are certainly better off for it.</para>

<para>—At the weekend, I had the honour and the privilege of attending and taking part in the annual tribute to the American dead of Bakers Creek and Mackay. These 40 Americans died in 1943 in what remains Australia’s worst air crash. Today is the 62nd anniversary of that crash. Before these American servicemen died so far away from their homes and their loved ones, they had become part of Mackay’s extended family of the wartime years. They are remembered today—and honoured in that memory—by the civic government of the city, the residents of Mackay, and their immediate families and descendants in America.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Australian-American connection is very deep, and the Bakers Creek Memorial signifies that relationship in a very special way. The memorial is also unique in that it marks a civil accident in a time of war and it exists on two continents. This year’s Washington commemoration is due to start in a few hours. Our links with America, and America’s with us, are soundly based on shared values: democracy, the rule of law, heritage, decency, the determination to face down evil and the commitment to stand up for what is right. It is firmly based on commonsense and mutual interest.</para>
<para>In Mackay on Saturday night we gathered as friends, from both sides of the Pacific Ocean, for fellowship, to renew acquaintance, to make new friends and to celebrate the lives of the Bakers Creek heroes. They were heroes, not victims, and we must never forget it. They died in a foreign land while engaged in a deadly fight against a determined enemy in conditions of total war. In wartime secrets must be kept and at times information must be withheld from family and kin. But when the conflict is over and the operational reasons for secrecy no longer exist, important information must be revealed. The tremendous work of the two Bakers Creek associations—here in Australia and across our shared ocean in America—has kept the flame alive. It has helped some of our American friends finally understand what happened to their loved one who went away to war and did not return. That is a public service of the highest degree.</para>
<para>There are two catalysts for the Bakers Creek Memorial: the historian of the Mackay RSL, Col Benson, and American professor Bob Cutler in Washington, DC. They are themselves heroes—heroes to history, for ensuring that a story from the past does not die. They are certainly heroes to the families of the Bakers Creek dead for pursuing the dream of a proper memorial. To reveal the truth, to help bring closure after some desperately sad event, even six decades later, is an act of kindness. So often these things come down to the energy and commitment of individuals, people who just will not let go. Great endeavours, like great causes, need catalysts. Col and Bob are very good catalysts indeed.</para>
<para>The memorial dinner on Saturday night was a convivial occasion, presided over with skill by the master of ceremonies for the occasion, Mr John Pickup. One of Australia’s two Vietnam War Victoria Cross winners, Keith Payne, was also at the dinner and read the Ode to the Fallen. Warrant Officer Payne is as feisty in retirement as he ever was in the Army, by the way. I believe our American guests—Brigadier-General Bradley Baker, Vice Commander, 5th Air Force, who was here from Japan for the anniversary; Jack and Ginger Ogren from New Hampshire; and Frank Smith III and his wife Dot with Frank Smith IV and sister Kelly Sellers—enjoyed themselves.</para>
<para>The commemoration on Sunday was a solemn occasion, as was proper. Visiting the site of the crash was a most moving experience for both the American visitors and the accompanying party. The emotion was palpable in the relatives of two of the American servicemen who perished on that fateful day in 1943. The site is surrounded by very healthy mangroves. The site itself, which was mangroves at the time, remains bereft of trees today.</para>
<para>The Bakers Creek air crash is one of an innumerable compendium of human disasters from World War II. Each man who died in that crash was a casualty of war. They were not where they were by misadventure; they were there because their country told them to be there. That is why we must always honour them. We know that six decades ago the people of Mackay took these men to their hearts. We know they made them feel as much at home as possible in the circumstances of war and so far away from their real homes and loved ones. And the people of Mackay, both individually and through their civic government, continue doing that today. Bakers Creek is part of their history too. Mackay of course is a very special place inhabited by special people: people such as Ed Casey, the veteran former state member for the area, who played an initial—and absolutely vital, I add—role in the project to make a permanent memorial.</para>
<para>I became interested in the project and the history behind it when in 2003 I had the honour of meeting the American party here in Australia for the 60th anniversary. I told the Senate about it in an adjournment speech at the time. On that occasion the Bakers Creek pilgrims were led by Alvin—Mo—and Vera Berg, from Texas. I believe they enjoyed the Brisbane hospitality that was afforded to them. There is also today significant interest in the Bakers Creek story in the American legislature. For today’s Washington ceremony at the new World War II memorial there, Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania has contributed a message, and there is legislation in congress to provide for a memorial marker, perhaps at Arlington.</para>
<para>The Americans who died at Bakers Creek 62 years ago were in our country on furlough, what we would nowadays call R&amp;R. They were resting from the conflict then raging in the south-west Pacific. Tragedy gave them a permanent home in our country. For all time, these men are part of our story too. Today again we stand with the Americans in defence of freedom. We are companions, again, on a dangerous journey through a world that is threatened by new and deadly challenges. That single fact—the fact that we must again work together to confront evil and to protect ourselves and our communities and our way of life—gives extra reason to remember the sacrifice of those who went before. Times change and the benefits of hard won freedom, both social and economic, have immeasurably altered how all of us live. Former enemies are now friends. We move on, but we do not forget. Every nation is entitled to its remembrance and to honour its dead.</para>
<para>I want to continue my remarks by speaking about the Water Smart Australia program, a great initiative of the forward-thinking Howard government. I also want to canvass some of the details of a very practical initiative that has come forward for funding consideration from the great Queensland city of Toowoomba. As so many Australians know to their own direct cost, many areas of our country are subject to highly variable rainfall patterns. Consistency is not nature’s way. Water crises happen quickly in Australia. As a community we have to react quickly too. For example, from July sprinklers are to be banned in Brisbane, a sensible response to water shortage but an imperative to suburban gardeners to find better ways of creating and sustaining cool green gardens.</para>
<para>The recent good rains in the south-east of Australia have brought some relief to farmers and agricultural communities in South Australia and Victoria and in parts of New South Wales. But the rain has not reached northern NSW, which is desperately parched, or those many areas of Queensland that are afflicted by long-term drought. In any case, good follow-up rain is still needed. Water is life: there was never a truer statement made. As we also know, the drought of 2002—which for some Australian farmers has become the drought of 2002-05—revealed again the inconsistent nature of the water supply and our vulnerability. Our cities, agricultural industries and aspects of our environment are all subject to prolonged dry conditions and are all vulnerable to them. We know too that many water catchments and aquifers are under stress, and some are reaching the limits of their sustainable capacity. In these circumstances Australia must make use of the many opportunities that exist to better use the supplies of water already developed. We must make use too of human ingenuity to employ new technology and infrastructure, and to develop new and sustainable sources of supply. Australian clean water technology is world renowned, and rightly so. Only this month I was in China, where the great work that Hervey Bay City Council and Wide Bay Water are doing in the city of Leshan is an effective reminder of this.</para>
<para>It was with Australian ingenuity in mind that in June last year the federal government and most state governments agreed to implement the National Water Initiative. It was signed in recognition of the national imperative to increase the productivity and efficiency of Australia’s use of water in servicing population centres and sustaining healthful river and ground water systems. Under this agreement the $2 billion Australian government water fund came into being to provide investment funding for selected water projects. These projects need to be practical on-ground water projects that improve national water efficiency. They need to create opportunities for industries, private investment and employment—and at the same time protect, and where necessary restore, the environment.</para>
<para>This is not an impossible task, merely a very hard one that will require a lot of effort. Australians are good at meeting challenges. The key word is ‘practical’. It almost always is, and this is where some of the deeper green elements of the environmental lobby and their political representatives get a little off beam. A practical objective is to develop an agricultural and industrial sector that leads the world in the careful and efficient use of water, and to bring about sustainable household and garden water consumption. It is to provide greater preservation of Australia’s rivers and wetlands, which are unique, and to promote our water technology. These are among the practical objectives of the National Water Initiative for 2015, just a decade away. We obviously need to work towards achieving these objectives on a cooperative, community, national—and nationwide—basis.</para>
<para>In Queensland, three projects—at the Gold Coast, in Mackay where I was at the weekend and in Bundaberg—have already been approved for federal investment totalling $32.2 million under the Water Smart Australia component of the $2 billion Australian water fund. The Gold Coast project is particularly interesting to me, given that the Gold Coast is Queensland’s second largest city and a place where water is always an issue. It is getting $3.15 million over four years towards an investment of $9.45 million to reduce water leakage and stress on current water supplies and provide more water to the city through cutting waste.</para>
<para>Applications for funding under the first round of the National Water Initiative close on 30 June. One application that is coming forward in the first round is for $18.3 million from the Australian government water fund to assist with the $64 million Water Futures Toowoomba project. Toowoomba City Council, a highly progressive civic government very ably led by Mayor Dianne Thorley, believes its project can demonstrate to Australia the science of indirect potable reuse of water as a safe and sustainable component of future water supply. The $64 million project costs would be made up of $19.35 million from Toowoomba City Council, matched by $19.5 million from the Queensland government, the proposed AGWF grant of $18.3 million and private investment of $7 million.</para>
<para>Mayor Thorley and the Toowoomba City Council’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Chris Rose, came to see me recently to update me on the proposal. One interesting aspect of the proposal is that its cost is less than that of building a new dam to create Toowoomba’s fourth source of water. Toowoomba is an exciting and vibrant city. It would be, of course; it is in Queensland—and I am sure Senator Moore opposite would agree with me—</para>

<para>—Always. But it is also a city with some specific and indeed unique requirements as well as attributes. One of its benefits is its altitude. At 700 metres it enjoys a temperate climate and, as I have said in the Senate before, the city rivals Canberra in the colourful splendour of its exotic deciduous trees. But this is also a debit. It is a debit because its water has to be lifted almost 500 metres from its source dams. This costs $1.5 million a year and delivers water at 60c a kilolitre from Toowoomba’s taps. The city has the second highest water delivery costs in Australia after Kalgoorlie in WA, a fact that I am sure is appreciated by Senators Eggleston and Lightfoot, who are present in the chamber tonight.</para>

<para>Toowoomba has 94,000 people within its city boundaries. It is Queensland’s largest inland provincial city and also Australia’s largest regional inland city and serves a wider population base of 300,000. Significant drought over the past 10 years and consistent population growth, along with increasing demand, have made water supply the most significant issue for Toowoomba and the surrounding area. It is clear that the growth demands of the Brisbane coastal conurbation have ended any expectation that Toowoomba could source additional water from the giant Wivenhoe Dam in the Brisbane Valley. The urgency in finding reliable and sustainable irrigation water also sparked the proposal to pipe Brisbane’s grey water to the Lockyer Valley, incidentally. Of course, as the city’s civic government recognises, there is no one ideal water solution anywhere in Australia, the world’s driest continent. But responsible water management strategies will include multisource water supplies, maximising water resources, effective demand management strategies and a continuing—and, I would hope, over time significantly enhanced—community involvement.</para>
<para>Toowoomba City Council recently approved expenditure of $35 million to upgrade its waste water treatment plant to lift its outfall standard to class A water. This will not only provide a much improved outfall quality into the Murray-Darling catchment but also create a potential drinking water resource. The city council is pursuing opportunities for this resource, including its use by coal and energy producers and of course horticulturalists. Further refinement of this class A water would enable its urban direct non-potable reuse in an adjoining shire and, subject to Queensland Health approval, eventual indirect potable reuse—that is, as drinking water—within Toowoomba.</para>
<para>This is a strong and practical proposal from a proactive local government that really could rewrite the rules with regard to recycled water use. It would contribute significantly to advancing the cause of sustainable water resources in Australia. It would help Australian communities deal with a future in which precious water is likely to be even more finite than ever. The Water Smart program is practical policy development and implementation at its grassroots best and it deserves applause for this.</para>

</talker>
<para>—If nobody else wants to speak in this adjournment debate, can I conclude it by commenting on a very fine speech from Senator Santoro and a very fine speech from Senator Lees earlier on in the debate. I have not always agreed with Senator Lees and what the Democrats do, going back to the days when Senator Lees ably led the Democrats—when they were actually achieving goals—but I do agree with the point she makes: it is very important that all people work together to get good outcomes. Senator Lees very carefully, clearly and explicitly pointed out some of the hypocrisy and fraudulent approaches of the Greens party and some of their issues. They have a fixed position, which is simply to oppose the government regardless of the issue.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I thought Senator Lees, better than most, would be well aware of those issues, and her criticism—that is my description; I do not think she would agree with that—and comments concerning the inflexible and politically driven attitude of Senator Brown, the Wilderness Society and the ACF are worthy of note. I am delighted to have been in the chamber to hear Senator Lees’s speech. It is of some regret to me that we will not be able to benefit from that sort of advice and approach in the future.</para>
<para>Senator O’Brien gave a classic example of the Labor Party trying to catch up. He spoke about his own state of Tasmania, where the Labor Party were absolutely annihilated because the blue-collar workers voted against the Labor Party. The blue-collar workers in that state understood that the Labor Party stood for the latte set in Sydney and Melbourne and were not at all interested in workers, unionists and their jobs in country Tasmania. Senator O’Brien is desperately trying to catch up, trying to get some of the workers back on side, but the sorts of words he uses will not help get the workers back until the Labor Party start concentrating on what blue-collar workers need. It is quite clear that most working men and women of Australia now think—and think quite rightly, I might add—that the Howard government is the political party that supports their real interests. I am delighted to be a member of a party that is really looking after the working man’s and woman’s interests in Australia.</para>
<para>It is always a great delight to hear from Senator Cook and, again, there is going to be a real void in this chamber when he retires at the end of this month. I do not very often agree with what Senator Cook says but I always listen intently, because he has a very precise way of making his arguments. His arguments are all well constructed and very well argued. I could take issue with his conclusions in a lot of the matters he mentioned tonight, but there is going to be a void when Senator Cook is no longer in the Senate and we no longer get some of the more thoughtful contributions that we got from him.</para>
<para>Finally, I want to support Senator Santoro’s comments on the Water Smart program, part of the Howard government’s National Water Initiative and something that I am delighted to be involved in. Senator Ian Campbell and I will be handling the community water grants program, which we are about to launch and which will provide up to $50,000, even $100,000, for communities to do clever things with water in their local area. It is a program—some $200 million—that will be well received in the country and will make some forward steps, some progress, in saving and using water more cleverly. Senator Santoro is correct in his praise for Toowoomba. Mayor Di Thorley is a very innovative and enthusiastic leader and she lives, eats and breathes her particular project. Whilst it is inappropriate for me to comment on the ultimate fate of her application, it is a project which she argues for very well and which will obviously add value to her community and to the Australian government’s long-term aims for the wise use of water.</para>
<para>Peter Lindsay, the member for Herbert, also has some good Water Smart projects under way. I am delighted with the success of the Mackay project, which Senator Santoro has mentioned. I well remember when Mayor Julie Boyd first came to this building seeking some assistance. She had with her an adviser, Mr Ross Cunningham, who had some understanding of water. I remember when they first came here to raise this project many years ago. It started in a small way. They came down and made their case. The government did not have a program that could help them at the time, but it is interesting to see how a good lobbying effort and a good submission made very forcefully can over a period of time lead to some positive outcomes. The Mackay project will be a very good one.</para>
<para>Finally, whilst I am on my feet and talking about Senator Santoro, I thank him for going to the Mackay-Whitsunday area. He was in Mackay for the Bakers Creek function, as he mentioned, but also to assist me by opening the Whitsunday boating and leisure show at Airlie Beach. It was a job, I am told by reliable authorities, which Senator Santoro performed exceptionally well, and I thank him for filling in for me.</para>

A lot of interesting things are happening in Queensland, and it is good to be able to say a couple of words about them in these open-ended adjournment debates.</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>I assume the Senator is referring to question on notice no. 565 (3) (b) rather than 565 (3) (a).  Upon checking the information for this question, subsequent to previous question on notice no. 565, it became apparent that an incorrect vessel name was provided.  The response to question on notice no. 565 (3) (b) should read “During an extended hot pursuit of the <inline font-style="italic">Lena</inline> by the <inline font-style="italic">Southern Supporter</inline>, two foreign fishing vessels, the <inline font-style="italic">Florence</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Champion</inline>, assisted the <inline font-style="italic">Lena</inline> by firstly broadcasting bogus Emergency Position Indicating Rescue Beacon (EPIRB) signals in an attempt to get the <inline font-style="italic">Southern Supporter</inline> to break off its hot pursuit.  The <inline font-style="italic">Florence</inline> also re-fuelled the <inline font-style="italic">Lena</inline>.  Whilst there had not been any recorded observations of the <inline font-style="italic">Florence</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Champion</inline> fishing in the Australian fishing zone (AFZ) around HIMI at that time, both vessels were strongly suspected of involvement in IUU fishing”.</para>
<para>        The <inline font-style="italic">Volga</inline> did not initiate a false distress beacon alert during the <inline font-style="italic">Lena</inline> pursuit over December 2001 – January 2002.  However, a suspected sister ship, the <inline font-style="italic">Champion</inline> flagged to Bolivia did initiate a distress signal and AFMA forwarded a report on the incident to the Australian Maritime Surveillance Authority (AMSA) for further investigation.</para>
<para>        AMSA advised that the International Maritime Search and Rescue Convention 1979, covering Australia’s obligations in relation to providing search and rescue services in Australia’s designated search and rescue region, does not provide for the search and rescue authorities to investigate or take action over allegedly false distress beacon alerts.  Consequently, Australian search and rescue authorities did not conduct further investigations into this incident.</para>

<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The Australian Government supports the development of authoritative measures of the standard of literacy and numeracy achievement of all students. Parents require assurance that their child is achieving minimum acceptable literacy and numeracy standards.</para>
<para>        The development of the national literacy and numeracy benchmarks was realised through a cooperative process involving all State and Territory school authorities, the Australian Government and representatives of non-government schools. The development work was undertaken by Curriculum Corporation and informed by evidence such as levels of achievement as demonstrated in national surveys, State assessment programs and international data. The development process involved both technical expertise and extensive consultation. Those involved included all key school education authorities, academic experts in literacy and numeracy, educational testing experts, parent groups, teachers and teacher professional organisations.</para>
<para>        The national benchmarks that underpin the reporting of student achievement describe nationally agreed minimum acceptable standards for aspects of literacy and numeracy at particular year levels. That is, they represent the minimum acceptable standard of literacy and numeracy that a student must have at a particular year level in order for the student to continue to make progress at school.</para>
<para>        The benchmarks do not attempt to describe the whole range of literacy learning, nor the full range of what students are taught; nor do they try to describe the full range of student achievement. Instead, they represent important and essential elements of literacy at a minimum acceptable level.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Education Ministers agreed in July 2003 to move towards enhanced reporting of literacy and numeracy achievement. In addition to reporting the percentage of students achieving national literacy and numeracy benchmarks this would enable to range of student achievement to be reported.</para>
<para>        On 30 November 2004 the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Hon Dr Brendan Nelson, MP, announced details about the Australian Government National Inquiry into the Teaching of Literacy. The Inquiry will be a broad, independent examination of reading research, teacher preparation and practices for the teaching of literacy, particularly reading. One of the objectives of the Inquiry is to examine the effectiveness of assessment methods being used to monitor the progress of students’ early reading learning. A report of the Inquiry’s findings will be prepared in the second half of 2005.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>State and Territory standardised tests are currently the basis of assessment against national benchmarks. Under MCEETYA arrangements, brochures are being developed for parents to inform them of the national assessment programme including literacy assessments.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The Tutorial Voucher Initiative is a pilot programme and hence eligibility is limited to a defined group of students – those who were below the Year 3 national reading benchmark in 2003. Parents of all students who fall into this category are eligible to apply for a Tutorial Voucher. The Initiative will be independently evaluated. Any decision to extend the Initiative to other groups of students will be a matter for future consideration by the Government.</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>Did the Commissioner of Taxation on 6 October 1994 issue tax determination 94/80 on infrastructure bonds which had the status of a public ruling.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Given that the minority report of the Economics References Committee refers to retail investors in infrastructure bonds borrowing to lend, in total, multiples of the funds sought by the constructor, what were the actual multiples in: (a) the Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s (CBA) ‘Develop Australia Bonds’, with an offering memorandum of 23 April 1996; and (b) Legal and General’s ‘Infrastructure Funds 1996-2 and 1996-3’.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>Can the Minister confirm that for a cash payment of $17 000, Legal and General’s memorandum indicated that a tax refund of $20 370 should be available, and that the CBA indicated that a cash payment of $70 048 should result in a tax refund of $80 048.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>Can the Minister confirm that Price Waterhouse indicated on 27 May 1996 that the Legal and General financing facility would be ‘non-recourse’ to the investor.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>Can the Minister confirm that the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Carmody, made the following statement to the Taxation Institute on 19 March 1997: In the absence of any unusual arrangements surrounding the cited situations [including infrastructure bonds] there is no reason to suggest that Part IVA would apply, having regard to the factors in section 177D. Clearly, it would be incongruous for Part IVA to apply across the board to deny access to specific features of the tax system; nor does the Spotless decision suggest this is the case. In broad terms the Spotless decision turned not so much on the availability of the section 23(q) exemption as the analysis of the surrounding facts which lead to a conclusion that the arrangements were contrived to achieve the benefit of that exemption. So regard must be had to the wider context. For example, in the case of indirect infrastructure bonds at the retail level we will have regard to the whole financing structure including the direct infrastructure bond financing, the rate of interest relative to current market rates, any risk to the investor including whether they are locked in by options, the return on an after tax basis and how the funding took place including all other relevant matters.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>Can the Minister confirm that tax determination 94/80 provides: The extent to which interest paid by an investor on a loan used for the full purchase price of infrastructure borrowings will be tax deductible depends on an investors’ particular circumstances. In order for the interest to be deductible the investor must have entered into the loan solely for the purpose of funding the investment in or acquisition of the infrastructure borrowings. On indicator that the investor had a purpose other than, or in addition to, funding the infrastructure borrowings, would be where the deductions in relation to the infrastructure borrowings are greater than the exempt return on the infrastructure borrowings grossed up by the investor’s marginal tax rate as it would be but for the infrastructure borrowing investment and any related income and deductions.</para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>With reference to the ‘smell test’ advanced by the Commissioner on 19 March 1997, as well as the criteria of non-recourse loan, large upfront deductibles prior to 30 June, tax refund exceeding cash contribution, fraction of the borrowings going into the underlying business, and option to participate only for year one, can the Minister confirm: (a) whether the Commissioner viewed the CBA and Legal and General offerings as contrived; and (b) whether the dominant purpose of the promoter was other than to offer a tax benefit to the investor.</para>
</item>
<item label="(8)">
<para>Were these retail infrastructure bond investments referred to the Part IVA Panel, and if so how did it view them in the light of the warning in tax determination 94/80, and what was the result of its deliberations.</para>

<para>Measurements by the Australian Radiation Laboratory of 137Cs in the 1990s of sediments from Port Phillip Bay show activity concentrations in the range 2 to 5 Becquerel per kilogram. The contamination levels in Port Phillip Bay are similar to those found generally in soils and sediments throughout Australia.  In comparison the level of naturally occurring radionuclides in soils is approximately 1000 Becquerel per kilogram.</para>

<para>There is no evidence of high concentrations of 137Cs in Port Phillip Bay.  Any mixing of sediments as a result of channel deepening should not change the concentration.</para>

<para>The 137Cs in Port Phillip Bay is due to global fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing during the 1960s and 1970s.  In view of the relative numbers of atmospheric tests, most of the activity is from testing that occurred in the northern hemisphere. As noted in (2) and (3) above, the contamination levels in Port Phillip Bay are similar to those found generally in soils and sediments throughout Australia..</para>

<para>There have been extensive studies of global fallout and the resulting doses to humans from contaminated foods.  These studies have recently been summarised by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation in UNSCEAR 2000, Report to the General Assembly.  The continued impact of ingestion of 137Cs from global fallout in the year 2000 was estimated to be less than one thousandth of the level of natural background radiation and thus not of concern.</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>Recommendation 2 of the report on the Review of the Federal Magistrates Court is under consideration by the Government.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The Family Court has provided the following information in relation to questions (2), (3)  and (4).</para>
<para>        The Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) for the Family Court stipulates a client satisfaction target that ‘75% of clients are satisfied with Court resolution (i.e. mediation) processes’.  According to the 2003-04 Annual Report of the Family Court, in the 2004 Client Satisfaction Survey the Court achieved a client satisfaction level of 54% for Court resolution processes.</para>
<para>        The Court is concerned about the level of client satisfaction.  It notes that, having regard to the increasing availability of mediation services in the community and the role of the Federal Magistrates Court, less complex family disputes are increasingly likely to be resolved or determined without approaching the Family Court.  Consequently, the matters that do come to the Court are increasingly the more complex and difficult, involving more entrenched issues and disputes.  The Court considers that client satisfaction with the Court’s resolution services is impacted by the fact that court mediation occurs after clients’ personal positions have become entrenched and that, in such circumstances, it is likely that many clients’ assessment of the system is affected by the emotional turmoil associated with the relationship breakdown that they have experienced.  Accordingly, the Court considers that the client survey response is affected (at least in part) by clients’ experiences during relationship breakdowns (especially those involving children) as much as by the length of time to reach finalisation, the complexity of these cases, and the tangible costs involved for cases requiring judicial determination. </para>
<para>        The Court advises that the highest rated area of client satisfaction was with ‘Staff Professionalism’, at a national average of 87% client satisfaction. Clients were highly satisfied with staff behaviours and professionalism, reporting that staff were polite and approachable, sensitive to needs, and maintained privacy and confidentiality. Further, a significant number of clients rated themselves as being ‘neither satisfied nor dissatisfied’ with the relevant services provided by the Court. Under the survey methodology, these clients were effectively counted with those who gave an unsatisfactory rating.</para>
<para>        The Court notes that, from the survey, there is a direct correlation between increased client dissatisfaction and the duration of proceedings in the Court – that is, the longer their matter took to finalise, the more dissatisfied the client. This is a significant issue, which the Court is presently addressing through several major initiatives (reported below in response to Question (3)).</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The Court advises that it has responded promptly to the client needs identified in the client satisfaction survey. The Court analysed those characteristics that most influenced the level of client satisfaction with the Court’s performance. These were timeliness, informed and objective staff, and the conduct of events (i.e. clear explanation of event process, understanding expectations of behaviour, treatment with respect during event).  The Court advises it has already taken the following steps, based on the evidence from the survey, to improve the experiences of clients:</para>
</item>
</list>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>During a series of eight workshops between December 2004 and April 2005, the Court engaged in extensive consultation and discussion with a variety of stakeholders including all staff and the judiciary, clients, community based client groups and practitioners. The focus groups of external stakeholders were facilitated by an independent facilitator, without direct Court involvement in order to ensure robust and unfettered stakeholder opinion and input.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Registry Business Planning has adopted, as the key criteria to be addressed in action planning for 2005/06, timeliness, informed and objective staff, and improving how events are conducted.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Additional training is regularly being provided to staff on providing clear and accurate information and being balanced and impartial in their dealings.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>A variety of continuous client feedback mechanisms, including point of service surveying, are being employed to ensure the Court has a clear and accurate understanding of client issues on a real time basis. The results of this feedback will inform decision making processes across other strategic projects of the Court.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Registrars and Mediators have reviewed their conference processes including timing, opening statements and the desired outcomes of each event, to ensure that clients have a clear understanding of the purpose of each event.</para>
</item>
</list>
<list type="unadorned">
<item label="">
<para>The Court also advises that the steps it is taking to increase client satisfaction include two major innovations, which fundamentally alter the Court’s processes and structure, and other initiatives to target specific areas of client needs.  The major innovations are the Combined Registry Initiative and the Children’s Cases Program.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>The Combined Registry Initiative</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>The ‘Combined Registry’ initiative is part of the Government’s response to the report of the parliamentary inquiry into child custody arrangements in the event of family separation, ‘Every Picture Tells a Story’.  This initiative will fundamentally change the way the Family Court of Australia works with the Federal Magistrates Court. Implementation of a combined registry will simplify the process for clients entering the Courts, and will streamline the progression of matters to the point of determination, where that is required, resulting in a more efficient progression through the courts to conclusion. The Court has worked closely with the Federal Magistrates Court and the Attorney-General’s Department on this initiative, and has invested significantly in obtaining the input and feedback of other stakeholders by way of stakeholder workshops, which involved the Federal Magistrates Court and the legal profession.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>The Children’s Cases Program</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>The Children’s Cases Program is intended to enable a less adversarial process for clients of the Court, to reduce the number of necessary courtroom events (thus reducing costs), and to achieve more satisfactory and durable outcomes. The pilot in Parramatta and Sydney has accepted over 200 matters.  External, independent evaluators are monitoring pilot progress, and interim evaluation reports are expected in September 2005.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>Other initiatives include the following.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>Development of Client Perspective Model</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>The Development of the Client Perspective Model has involved the creation of ‘case coordinator’ positions – client service officers are assigned cases as soon as the application is lodged.  If the case becomes complex, the client receives additional support (i.e. with information about compliance, documents required, interpreters etc). Structures and positions have been reviewed in client service sections to ensure consistency across the Court. Service is more personalised and tailored to suit client needs. A comprehensive case management manual has been developed, and on-line training for staff is now available. Staff members are being multi-skilled across all registry activities, and two surveys to all staff regarding improvements to the model have been undertaken in the last 12 months, as a result of which the model has been further refined.</para>

<para>—The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">For the period July 2000 to date, there have been no cases of fraud against the department as a result of (a) forged drivers’ licences; (b) forged birth certificates; (c) forged Australian citizenship papers; (d) forged passports, either Australian or other nationalities; or (e) forged marriage certificates, either Australian or other nationalities.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">With respect to forged documentation generally, for the years 2000-01 and 2001-02, the department (and its relevant predecessor, the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business) did not disaggregate the records of incidents of fraud from records of incidents of contractual non-compliance. Accordingly, it would be an unreasonable diversion of the department’s investigatory resources to recall and revisit files in order to provide figures in respect of the number of cases of fraud against the department as a result of forged documentation for the financial years 2000-01 and 2001-02. However, it has been practicable for the department to identify that in one case committed in 2000-01, charges of forge and utter (s67(b) Crimes Act 1914) were proven, but no conviction was recorded.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">One case of forgery was allegedly committed in 2002-03. The matter has been referred to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration. No charges have been laid to date.</para>

</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>No formal review has been undertaken.  Consideration of the CSS Boards obligations under the Superannuation Act 1976 (the Super Act) and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (the SIS Act) was initiated after a request in April 2004 for information was made by a member concerned about superannuation entitlements in circumstances where a Commonwealth agency may be sold. </para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Following the above member inquiry, an analysis was undertaken of the relevant law in relation to the payment of particular CSS benefits. The outcome of that analysis was that in particular circumstances, that is where a member remains employed by the employer that contributed to their CSS super, the CSS Board is unable to make benefit payments available to members.  Certain payments to CSS members had been made previously in error.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>Relevant information has been published on the CSS website, and will be followed up in the relevant annual member statements.  The website material is as follows: </para>
<para>        “CEO provides clarification on benefit payments for CSS members employed by approved authorities”</para>
<para>        I am posting this notice to advise members that a benefit payment arrangement, previously made available to a number of CSS members employed by approved authorities, is in breach of superannuation law and therefore will no longer be available.</para>
<para>        This is contrary to the advice that some members may have received previously.</para>
<para>        We have personally contacted all members, of whom we are aware, that might be about to claim a benefit based on the arrangement that we now know is incorrect.</para>
<para>        The relevant payment arrangement was one that was made available to CSS members employed by approved authorities that offer the choice of an alternative super (superannuation) fund, such as:</para>
<para>        - Australian National University</para>
<para>        - Northern Territory Government</para>
<para>        - Telstra</para>
<para>        - University of Canberra</para>
<para>        CSS members in this situation are able to change super funds, thereby stopping their CSS contributory membership and deferring (or preserving) their CSS benefit.</para>
<para>        In the past, some members have then claimed their deferred benefit at the minimum retirement age (generally 55) although they continued to work for the same employer who contributed to their CSS super.</para>
<para>        On discovering this arrangement, the CSS Board immediately sought independent legal advice. This advice confirmed that a CSS retirement benefit cannot be paid if a member remains in continuous employment with the same employer who contributed to their CSS super. As a result, the CSS Board is unable, by law, to make any future benefit payments of this type.</para>
<para>        A CSS retirement benefit can only be paid if a CSS member reaches retirement age and meets conditions of release such as:</para>
<para>        - ceasing employment completely (i.e. total retirement); or</para>
<para>        - leaving the employer who contributed to their CSS superannuation (further conditions apply which vary according to the member’s age and type of exit).</para>
<para>        An error with members’ benefit payments is unacceptable, and we deeply regret that it has been made. Any affected members are welcome to meet with me and Leo Bator (the Commissioner for Superannuation) to discuss the matter further – you can send me an email direct using the button below. You may also choose to seek independent professional advice.</para>
<para>        This issue is very complex and, as a matter of priority, the CSS Board and its administrator ComSuper have established processes to ensure a situation such as this does not happen again.</para>
<para>        Already, we have updated all relevant information on our website and have contacted those members we know have been affected. I will keep members informed of any further results.</para>

<para>        In the case of statutory bodies, appointments are made in accordance with the provisions of the relevant legislation. In some cases, processes for appointments are also covered by the Cabinet Handbook and the Executive Council Handbook, both of which are public documents. For example, in the case of significant Government appointments, the Cabinet Handbook requires that “ministers must write to the Prime Minister seeking his or, at his discretion, Cabinet’s approval of the appointment.”</para>
<para>        In regard to fees and allowances, in most cases these are set by the Remuneration Tribunal and the information is publicly available. In the small number of cases where the fees and allowances are not set by the Remuneration Tribunal, they are generally set with reference to comparable positions determined by the Remuneration Tribunal and variations are made in line with variations to Remuneration Tribunal determinations.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The response to part (2) of the question provides general information on the travel entitlements provided to the members listed. The very detailed information sought in this part of the honourable Senator’s question is not readily available in consolidated form and it would be a major task to collect and assemble it. The practice of successive governments has been not to authorise the expenditure of time and money involved in assembling such information on a general basis.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>Where the bodies listed above are required by law to provide annual reports to the Government and/or Parliament, this is indicated in the attached table. Information is also provided in the table on other public documents.</para>

</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The response to this part of the question is provided in the attached table.</para>
<para>        In the case of statutory bodies, appointments are made in accordance with the provisions of the relevant legislation.  In some cases, processes for appointments are also covered by the Cabinet Handbook and the Executive Council Handbook, both of which are public documents.  For example, in the case of significant Government appointments, the Cabinet Handbook requires that “ministers must write to the Prime Minister seeking his or, at his discretion, Cabinet’s approval of the appointment.”</para>
<para>        In regard to fees and allowances, in most cases these are set by the Remuneration Tribunal and the information is publicly available.  In the small number of cases where the fees and allowances are not set by the Remuneration Tribunal, they are generally set with reference to comparable positions determined by the Remuneration Tribunal and variations are made in line with variations to Remuneration Tribunal determinations.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The response to part (2) of the question provides general information on the travel entitlements provided to the members listed.  The very detailed information sought in this part of the honourable Senator’s question is not readily available in consolidated form and it would be a major task to collect and assemble it. The practice of successive governments has been not to authorise the expenditure of time and money involved in assembling such information on a general basis.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>Where the bodies listed above are required by law to provide annual reports to the Government and/or Parliament, this is indicated in the attached table. Information is also provided in the table on other public documents.</para>
