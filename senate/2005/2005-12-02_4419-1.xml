<para>âI understand we have now moved to government amendment (160). From the Labor Partyâs perspective, we consider most of this debate was gone through last night. The only point we wanted to make is that the supposed right that the government is introducing to refuse to work on public holidays is really only a theoretical right. In order to enforce it, an employee has to go through the dispute resolutions clause which is contained in the bill, which effectively leads nowhere because the commission does not have the power to compel even attendance at a conference and the employer can choose not to attend the conference or discuss the matter and the commission has no power to order anything, so the only other avenue of remedy for an employee in this situation is to go to the Federal Magistrates Courtâto take legal proceedings, which would be expensive. One wonders how it is that, for example, a non-English-speaking background woman who is employed in the cleaning industry is going to find the resources to employ a lawyer to take a matter to court because she has been asked unreasonably to work on Christmas Day.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I want to make the pointâand Senator Joyce might not be aware of thisâthat there are a great many awards and agreements where employees do already have an existing right of refusal. I understand, for example, that in the retail industry there are a great many collective agreements where that is the case. What he has negotiated is a position that is in fact worse than that. But, as I said, from our perspective we are happy to vote on this reasonably soon. There was quite a lengthy debate on this last night.</para>

<para>âIn moving amendment (160), I indicate that I have made an amendment to the introductory statement to proposed section 170AG as circulated. I forget the fancy French word I was taught last night, but I think it is âchapeauâ. The words after âpublic holidayââthat is, âhave regard toââhave been deleted and the words âregard must be had toâ have been inserted. I passed that to Senator Wong last night.

<para class="block">We had a substantial debate last night. For those who have just tuned into the debate, that which Senator Wong said was of course not correct. Last night I went ad nauseam through the right to refuse. Any employee will have the right to refuse to work on Christmas Day if he or she can indicate reasonable grounds for so doing. Those reasonable grounds are set out in 12 or 13 separate paragraphs in the legislation. In the event that an employer still requires an employee to work on a public holiday, if that employer has acted unreasonably, they will face a substantial monetary penaltyâfor a corporation, it is up to $33,000âwhich will act as a huge disincentive to an employer behaving in an unreasonable manner. That way, the vast majority of employees will have protection from being required to work on public holidays against their will. I thank Senator Joyce, Senator Fielding and others for their work that has drawn this matter to the governmentâs attention. With the amendment I have just moved, we have no doubt that the bill is a better bill. We thank those senators who made a contribution to ensuring that the bill has been improved.</para>

<para>âThe difficulty we have with this amendment is the Prime Ministerâs attitude. The Prime Minister has expressed quite clearly, as recently as during the dinner with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a view that all these amendments are minor, with the implication being that they are insignificant. That probably stretches it too far, because I do not think even the Prime Minister would consider 98 pages and 337 amendments insignificant. But the fact is that we should not overstate the benefit that this amendment provides. Nevertheless, it would be ungenerous of me not to recognise that it improves the situation somewhat. I am glad that there has been some movement on the government side to address these issues.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I stand now, though, principally to move an amendment to the government amendment, because now is the proper time to do it. I move Democrat amendment (1) on sheet 4776:</para>
<amendments>
<amendment>
<para class="ParlAmend">(1)Â Â Â  Amendment to Government amendment (160), page 31, Sheet Number PN271, after paragraph 170AG(k), insert:</para>
<para class="indenta">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (ka)Â Â Â  whether the employee has previously been paid penalty rates by the employer and no longer will be paid penalty rates;</para>
</amendment>
</amendments>
<para class="block">Effectively, this goes right to the heart of reasonable grounds for refusing to work on Christmas Day. I maintain that it is a reasonable ground, if that employee had previously been paid penalty rates by the same employer, to say: âIf youâre not going to pay me penalty rates again then I donât have to work on Christmas Day.â That is a perfectly reasonable ground. Much of the debate in the media and some of the debate in the chamber has been about the issue of penalty rates. I am putting this fair and square, right at the middle, as a reasonable ground for rejection. I will be calling a division on this matter. I want to nail the governmentâs colours to the mast on this one. Given the length and extent of the debate we have had before, I do not think I need to explain the amendment much more but I would be glad to answer questions if people are unclear.</para>

<para>âWe had a fairly lengthy discussion on this last night and I do not want to just take up time for the sake of it but it is a very important issue. Family First are glad to have played some role in seeing some change in this area of public holidays, such as Anzac Day and Christmas Day, because they are sacrosanct. But the issue still at hand is that someone can refuse to take a day off and they will be paid for the day. A person who sometimes has little choice will work on that day, not spend time with family and get paid exactly the same as the person beside them who took the day off. They will have no opportunity to spend some time with their family like the other person does. There is no difference in what they get paid, but the issue to me and to Family First is family time. The issue is between having the ability to have âwork and familyâ, not âwork or familyâ, and being able to make sure that family time that would have been spent on those days if they are working can be made available somewhere else. That is the issue at hand.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Even though I am pleased to see that there has been some movement on this area of public holidays, and quite rightly so, it quite clearly shows that there was a problem with it. But there is still a problem and I would prefer to see this government amendment go through. I will support the government on this amendment but I would have preferred to have seen, in addition to that, the individual who works on a public holiday also given the choice of another dayâs leave so they can spend time with their family. We have this dilemma today. We are all grappling with the issue of time. This will undermine public holidays without having that particular issue catered for.</para>

<para>âThere was one issue I wanted to raise. The amendment says that a term in an agreement or an award which is contrary to the provision itself has no effect. I want to clarify this with the minister: if there is an agreementâand there are a number, particularly in the retail sectorâwhereby an employee has an absolute right to refuse to work on a public holiday, will such a term be overridden by proposed section 170AF(4) so that the employeeâs current right of refusal is pared back to what is in the bill?</para>

<para>âI will go through the contributions in order. Senator Murray has suggested the scenario where the employee has previously been paid penalty rates by the employer. I think that, in rough terms, is what Senator Murray is suggesting. I suppose we can think up all sorts of scenarios as to what could also been included. That is why we have got the catch-all of 170AG(l), which says, âany other relevant factors.â With due respectâand I think Senator Murray knows thisâif that were a particular circumstance, the tribunal considering the matter would see that as another relevant factor to be taken into account.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We can then expand what is already a lengthy list of 12 items into a list of 24 or 30 items. You can all think of different scenarios to include and say: âThis proves that weâre championing the public holiday more than the government because weâve got this extra clause that weâre trying to put into the bill.â But unless Senator Murray can assert that what he is saying is not covered by any other relevant factor then, with great respect, there is no need for his amendment. I would have thought that anybody who listened to the debate last night and then also this morning would understand that to force a division on this particular amendment when the totality of that amendment is covered by any other relevant factor is to score points and to make a point. I think Senator Murray indicated that he wanted to make a point, and good luck to him. That is what politics is all about but I am not sure that it is necessarily a good use of Senate time.</para>
<para>In relation to Senator Fieldingâs contribution, I would respectfully say to him again, as I tried to last night, that under our proposal the employee has a right to refuse on reasonable grounds. Under his proposal, there is no such right to refuse. All you get is an extra day in lieu. Senator Fielding says: âThat is so they can spend time with family.â With great respect to Senator Fielding, If I were to get a day off in lieu, let us say mid-week, chances are the kids are going to be at school. If my other family members are older and no longer at school and in employment, they will probably have their own employment obligations on the day that I am given in substitution. Unless you can give the kids a day off school on that day in substitution that you are given by the employer, or, if you have grown-up children or uncles and aunts who can take off that particular day in substitution so you can all get together as a family, being given a day of substitution, with respect, is no guarantee that you will be able to spend time with the family. So, whilst I understand the sentiment, I do not think the mechanism will have the practical effect that has been suggested.</para>
<para>In relation to Senator Wongâs matter, which was the final contribution of this raft of comments by honourable senators, I am advised that this is beneficial legislation and therefore it is unlikely to be construed in the way suggested by Senator Wong. Clear words would be required to cut down express beneficial rights. We are getting that confirmed further, but that seems to be the overarching legal principle.</para>

<para>âI thank the minister for the response. I think that he may have just overlooked that I said it was in addition to what the government has put forward about guaranteeing to refuse. What Family First was after was actually in addition to what the government is proposing. I think what the government has goes part of the way, and Family First was trying to complete, again, what the Prime Minister shared on a radio station in Melbourne. I think it really is important to look at this again. The Prime Minister was asked:</para>

<para>âI would be delighted if the ministerâs answer to me was correct and clause 170AG(l), which says, âany other relevant factorsâ applied to the extent that previous penalty rates were taken into account. Unfortunately, the bill is not explicit in that matter and therefore, if that was challenged by an employer, it would have to be determined in court, which would involve jurisprudence, costs and delays. It is just unreasonable. If the government accept the proposition that penalty rates have been previously paid and therefore employees are entitled to claim them for a new public holiday then they should put it into law. If they do not accept that then they will reject it.</para>

<para class="block">I want to draw attention to the importance of this amendment, and I must confess to having needed professional advice on this one because it goes to matters which I would not normally be completely cognisant of. The person who has assisted me with this is barrister Shane Prince, and I am grateful for his assistance. He made a submission to the Senate inquiry. With respect to this particular amendment I am moving, the present legislation will act to rob people who are presently before the state industrial courts and commissions of their existing legal rights. That is an extremely sensitive and important issue and I really do believe that we need to be very careful if that is the effect of the legislation.</para>
<para>Terminating existing legal rights would affect cases which involve the underpayment of wages and statutory entitlements, remedies for unfair contracts in Queensland and New South Wales and remedies for unfair dismissal which are presently before the courts. Clause 7C(1)(d) of the bill is intended to have the effect via section 109 of the Australian Constitution of invalidating section 106 of the Industrial Relations Act of New South Wales and other states, which allows the industrial relations commissions in court session to void or vary any contract whereby work is performed in an industry if it is unfair. It will preclude the exercise of any power by the commission under section 106 immediately, so any existing case will be frozen. Regardless of whether the government is of the opinion that existing cases are based on laws that it does not like and is now going to change, it is a basic principle of our legal system that existing cases are not interfered with and are allowed their full passage.</para>
<para>The commission, as a result of the act as it stands, will be unable to make any orders. This means that people in the middle of lengthy and costly litigation will immediately have their rights removed without any recourse. The practical effects will be devastating for individuals, many of whom are middle managers and those described in the media as battlers, and leave them with devastating legal costs, and there will be no remedy. Those people who are engaged in proceedings have obviously done nothing wrong, because they are acting in the terms of the law as it stands and they proceeded on the law as it stood. They must have had reasonable prospects to commence the proceedings under the Legal Profession Act. Through no fault of their own, without ever having been given the choice, they will be exposed to serious harm through this legislation once enacted. The government, as I understand itâ</para>

<para>âby leaveâWhat an extraordinary display from Senator Ronaldson. This is from a government that takes its riding instructions from ACCI and from a government that sits there and says, âWeâre not going to impose penalty rates because the bosses donât want them.â You do not want someone in the advisers box so you pick on an individual who is not elected to this place. If you want to pick on someone, Senator Ronaldson, pick on the opposition senators. Frankly, it is just another example of bullying and union-bashing by the other side. Senator Hill, you are the Leader of the Government in the Senate. You should draw him to order and you should be ashamed of yourselves. Yet again, we see two rules. They are happy to take their riding instructions from people like Rob Gerard. A donation of $1.1 million buys you a seat on the Reserve Bank board. Then the government pick on a couple of union officials because it looks good. People know that you govern for your matesâpeople like Rob Gerard and Peter Hendy in ACCIâbut you want to pick on union officials. People know that this government governs for its mates. Senator Ronaldson has demonstrated that yet again.</para>

<para>âI take the ministerâs interjection. Frankly, if Peter Anderson was in your box, I think it would do you credit. He is a chap of considerable acumen. I must say that I know the purpose of that remark: we are broadcasting live and it does make the point of tying the Labor Party to the ACTU and the campaign. But at the back of that is a real concern and it is something the government need to addressâthat is, they use the words âunionâ and âunion officialâ as an epithet, as a slander and as a swearword. A good portion of those people represent the workers of Australia. A couple of million of them do that and, in days gone by, there were many more. I think people who represent workers, as do people who represent employers, deserve to be treated with respect for the people they represent. The spitting out of the term âunionâ and âunion officialâ from the government benches in both houses as an epithet and as a slander reflects badly on the government, not on the opposition.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>As some would know from my minority reports to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I am strongly of the view that the relations between the unions and the Labor Party need to be far better regularised, and I would move laws to quite radically change that relationship. I would never translate that attitude, which is a matter of political governance, to a condemnation of union people and union officials because they are union people and union officials. It is right, proper and a great credit to the history of our nation that the unions exist and are represented by passionate advocates. I must say that I get extremely distressed when I hear the coalition use the terms âunionsâ and âunion officialsâ as if they are swearwords. Through you, Mr Temporary Chair, I apologise, Ms Bowtell, that you were exposed to some embarrassment on this occasion.</para>
<para>I return to my amendment. The point I was making is that this bill is concerning in its effects if it acts to result in existing cases under way being frozen and the applicants being affected accordingly. I say through the chair to the ministerâand perhaps the minister would make a noteâthat, if you end up rejecting my amendment and if the result is that individuals are in fact out of pocket, I think the government should consider a case for compensation under the special emergency compensation fund. I am not expecting you to answer on the floor, but perhaps you would make a note of the issue and address it.</para>
<para>As I understand it, the government are alert to this problem and are proposing to deal with this in regulation, but barrister Prince has advised us that it is important to note that no regulation can undo the effect that proposed section 7C(1)(d) will have once enacted, because of the operation of section 109 of the Constitution. I am not a barrister, so I take on faith what I have been told, but the explanation seems to make sense. He says to me that section 109 of the Constitution would operate automatically to invalidate section 106 of the New South Wales Industrial Relations Act once the Commonwealth covers a field by passing section 7C(1)(d) in its current form, assuming it to be otherwise constitutionally valid, of course. He uses as his reference the case of Wenn v AG (Vic) (1948) 77 CLR 84 at 120. Given that no regulation can be passed until after the act which authorises it to be made, a regulation could only ever seek to undo that which has already been done by the automatic effect of section 109 of the Constitution. Barrister Prince says that no subsequent law can change the characteristic of an earlier law for the purposes of the operation of section 109 of the Constitution. He cites the case of Wollongong University v Metwally (1984) 158 CLR 447.</para>
<para>That principle would apply with even greater force where the attempt to recharacterise the Commonwealth law is by regulation rather than by legislation. Even if the regulation clarifying the purpose of clause 7C(1)(d) were in effect before the enactment of clause 7C(1)(d), it would be unlikely to influence the meaning of the clause or change its effect. Not even parliament can bind future parliaments, let alone the executive, through regulation. The intention of schedule 1 of the bill and clause 7C(1)(d) would need to be determined by reference to the intention of the parliament when that legislation was enacted, not the intention of the executive beforehand.</para>
<para>As earlier submitted, there is only one way to prevent the serious injustice which will occur by operation of clause 7C(1)(d) on people involved in current litigation. That is to amend the clause to exclude from its scope any litigation which has been commenced prior to the bill being enacted. Our amendment R(2A) seeks to provide this remedy. We have obviously taken advice on this matter. I freely confess it is beyond the scope of my own expertise, but I am presenting it as a real problem and I would like a response from the minister.</para>

<para>First of all I would like to respond to Senator Wongâs Senator Sterlesque performance when things got a bit heated in an exchange earlier. Chances are I agree with Senator Wong: we govern for our matesâand they are the people of Australia, the sorts of mates that we saw at the Albert Hall in Launceston at the last federal election. They are the genuine people of Australia that we seek to govern for, and I unashamedly call them our mates. They are the people for whom we seek to govern.</para>
<para>I take Senator Murrayâs point that to spit out âunion officialâ in a derogatory way may not necessarily be appropriate. But let us keep in mind that union officials continually assert that they represent the workers, when they represent 17 per cent of the work force, and indeed 40 per cent of that 17 per cent vote for the coalition in any event. So those that make these grandiose claims that, because they are union officials, they represent all workers and have a mortgage on the interests of wage earners are of course wrong, given that 83 per cent of Australian workers have determined they do not want to be a member of a trade union.</para>
<para>Having said that, I will turn to the substance of Senator Murrayâs amendment. It is one of those things, I suppose: when you have two lawyers, you are going to get three opinions. That is, of course, how lawyers make their money: by disagreeing with each other. My adviceâand it is from the highest levels of the departmentâis that the matters to which Senator Murray refers can be fixed by regulation. It is the intention of the government to deal with these matters by regulation. The legal advice is that we have to be very careful in framing any language in relation to the transitional arrangements. In those circumstances I am advised that the amendment as drafted, because of its general application, may cause confusion about how it interacts with other parts of clause 7C, which excludes certain state laws.</para>
<para>The substance of what Senator Murray is saying is accepted by the government, but we say that we do not need a clause that covers everything, because it may not be appropriate that all such proceedings continue. For example, wage setting will move to the Fair Pay Commission and it would be inappropriate for state wage matters to continue after commencement. So there are those sorts of considerations as well. Therefore we believe the best way to handle it is by way of regulation. Senator Murray has legal advice that we cannot do that. I am advised by lawyers with better legal knowledge than mine, from the government side, and they assert with confidence that it can be done by regulation.</para>
<para>The matter that Senator Murray has addressed is a matter of concern to the government. It is being looked at and we intend to remedy it by regulation. My advice is that it can be done by regulation. The fact that Senator Murray has advice that it cannot be is, I suppose, an issue on which we will have to part companyâas well as on the basis that Senator Murrayâs amendment seeks to cover the complete field, whereas on closer examination it might be better to allow a degree of flexibility. That is why regulation would be the best mechanism.</para>

<para>âVery briefly, the circumstances which Senator Murray outlines are in general terms clearly undesirable. Regulation would allow those matters to hopefully be dealt with expeditiously. In relation to a fund, the government will consider that without any strings attached, and nobody should read too much into that. But, given the flexibility of being able to make regulations, I would like to think the potential for that to occur would be very narrow and it would only be in circumstances such as, for example, wage cases in the state commissions. But the points that Senator Murray makes are points that I can indicate, without divulging too much, have been raised in our own party room, so it is a matter of interest to the government. We have had feedback on it and we are seeking to address it.</para>

<para>âI want to deal briefly with one of the comments of the minister about unions not representing many people. I make the point that the trade union movement, over the last 100 years, has advocated for improvements in conditions and wages, such as the eight-hour day and improvements in the minimum wage, which are of general application to unionists and non-unionists alikeâa fact that seems to have escaped the mind of the government as it seeks to demonise anybody who calls themselves a representative of working people and is duly elected.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I will return to the issue that Senator Murray has raised. This is not the place for an esoteric legal argument, but we on this side of the chamber are concerned that there does not appear to be in this legislation something that prevents peopleâs current legal rights, obligations and entitlements from, in effect, being retrospectively altered mid action by the passage of the legislation. I take the ministerâs comments that he has legal advice that this can be done by regulation. Our point on that is simply that surely that is a matter that should be in the substantive bill, given that there is so much else in terms of the operation of this legislation insofar as it relates to the exclusion of state legislation or other matters. We would have thought that it was appropriate for it to be in the bill. We are supportive of the amendment, and we note the ministerâs assurance that this matter will be dealt with. I make the point that, if Senator Murray is correct and this is not able to be done by regulation, the government will then face difficulty bringing in an amendment later. We would effectively have to have retrospective legislation. It does not seem to us to be a very efficient way to make laws in this matter. So we are supportive of the amendment.</para>

<para>âThe amendments go to the question of executive powers. The legislation confers very broad law-making power upon the executive, including provisions which enable the executive to make, for example, regulations capable of overriding state laws as well as changing this proposed law. Provisions which authorise the executive to make such broad regulations and determinations include, for example, proposed new section 7C(4), which will permit the executive to make subordinate legislation, which purports to override state laws; proposed sections 7K(3) and 7N(3), which will permit the executive to change the wage setting procedures which are to be applied by the Australian Fair Pay Commission and, therefore, the way wage-setting decisions are made; proposed section 112, which grants the minister the power to declare the termination of a bargaining period which would only have to be gazetted and would not be subject to parliamentary scrutiny; and proposed section 2(1) of part 1 of schedule 4, which will enable the executive to make regulations which amend acts generally, including the Workplace Relations Act, as amended, at least during the period in which the transitional provisions will be applicable and with retrospective effect.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Insofar as these provisions permit subordinate legislation to change the law in the enabling act, the provisions can be referred to as what is quaintly known in the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, and indeed throughout the parliament, as Henry VIII clauses. As senators know, Henry VIII clauses effectively represent executive power without parliamentary oversight. The authorisation of executive law-making through parliament has been accepted by the High Court as constitutional, despite that pervasive doctrine of the separation of powers. Indeed, the High Court has upheld the delegation of very broad powers including, for example, where the executive was enabled to formulate and implement its own policies and the use of Henry VIII clauses. However, despite the extent to which authorisation has been accepted in our courts, some limitations do apply, including the delegated power remaining in the scope of those powers granted to the Commonwealth under the Constitution, which is the enumerated powers doctrine, and the delegation of power may be so vague or wide reaching that the delegation becomes invalid or the delegation amounts to an abdication of power.</para>
<para>Whether the delegation envisaged under this proposed legislation will comply with constitutional principle will depend upon the way in which the High Court may view the scope of regulation-making powers conferred upon the executive. For example, it seems at least possible that the High Court may accept arguments to the effect that these clauses enable the executive to impose its own intent upon the federal parliament, something which could be regarded as running contrary to the notion of parliamentary supremacy. Senators who have known me for a long time know that I extol the parliament above the executive. For those in the government and the alternative government who have a contrary view, we will always clash on that matter.</para>
<para>On the other hand, whether the delegation will comply with the enumerated powers doctrine will depend, firstly, upon the way the delegated power will be exercised by the executive and, secondly, upon the way in which the High Court will view the Commonwealthâs law-making powers in relation to industrial relations based predominantly on the corporations power.</para>
<para>Finally, whilst Professor Lane noted, based on past decisions of the High Court, that delegated legislation is unlikely to fail for uncertainty of width, it is important to note that the court has made obiter comments to the effect that a threshold from wherein the law becomes invalid exists. The key point is that some of the measures left to regulations are so fundamental and potentially change the nature of the Australian work force in such major ways that parliament should have the opportunity to fully debate them before they come into effect and not be left with the second-best option of attempting to disallow measures already implemented through executive action.</para>
<para>Having put that on the record, let me amplify those remarks in this way: it is absolutely vital that the parliament always defends and protects itself from the usurping of its power by the executive. It is vital that the parliament remembers that it represents all Australians, and in the composition of the Senate, in particular, 95 per cent of the votes of Australians are reflected by the party representation that is in this chamber. In contrast, any government only represents, in terms of the votes that it achieves, a portion of the population. It is for that reason that parliaments always have to assert themselves for the people against a particular executive. That is the issue of principle.</para>
<para>The next issue is one of practicality. It is extremely unwise to give excessive powers to an individual in an executive circumstance. You can have a cabinet of 17 or 20 people and one of them may be of a character likely to abuse such powers. As soon as you give excessive powers to a person who happens to have that characteristic, you will end up with problems.</para>
<para>My third point is that no government can foresee what future government will hold these powers. Whilst the coalition may think these powers are terrific in the hands of this particular set of ministers, in the hands of another set of ministers from the same party group or even from another party, such as the Labor Party, you might find it an uncomfortable situation. Worse, the people affected might find it uncomfortable.</para>
<para>One of the things I liked very much about the Keating-Brereton 1993 act and the 1996 actâwhich I shall, probably a bit extravagantly, call the Reith-Murray actâwas that they tried to assert that the enterprise should be the focus of much bargaining and that the matter should be resolved between employers and employees with limited third party interference. Giving excessive power in this sense allows for third party interference which has not been characterised in our system before. So I am alarmed about it and these amendments attempt to address that alarm.</para>

<para>âThe government opposes this raft of amendments. The first lot covers one area and then amendment (56) covers another. But we are having a cognate debate, which will allow me to deal with the first issues. The proposed amendment would remove the provision which allows regulations to be made to identify state industrial laws that are excluded by the legislation. The provision is intended to allow the government to address any doubt about whether a particular state law falls within the excluded laws described in the main parts of the provision. This amendment would remove the ability of the government to respond to any new state laws that attempt to regulate industrial relations. If the states were to make such laws, it could create confusion for employees and employers in the federal system about whether the laws applied to their employment relationship. Confusion about such laws would undermine a single unified system of workplace relations.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I now turn to amendment (56) and the reasons why we oppose it. The <inline ref="R2465">Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005</inline> provides for a new power for the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to quickly end protected industrial action by terminating a bargaining period where that action is having a significant adverse impact on the public interest. This power will be exercised according to the terms of the legislationâthat is, where the industrial action is affecting or would adversely affect the employees or the employer negotiating party and threatens to endanger the life, the personal safety, health or welfare of the Australian population, or part of it, or to cause significant damage to the Australian economy or an important part of it.</para>
<para>The legislation is framed so that this power cannot be exercised for a trivial reason. This power will enable the minister to act swiftly in the public interest. The commission will be able to make a workplace determination for the parties to settle their differences. The directions that the minister can make following the termination reinforce that his powers are to be directed to dealing only with the immediate threat. The minister will only be able to make directions that are reasonably directed to removing or reducing the threat. The power is similar to powers available to state governments under their essential services legislation. It is instructive to know that state Labor governments are happy to live with such power, but those opposite would not give it to the federal government. Of course, the only reason for that is that it is of a different political colour.</para>
<para>I do not accept that as being Senator Murrayâs rationale, which is consistent about this across the board, but it is very difficult for Labor senators to make this assertion as a matter of great principle when their state governments provide themselves with similar powers. Their robust argument is that if Liberal and National parties can do it it is bad, but if state Labor does it it is okay. That is not a consistent, robust or logical argument. This power is very tightly focused on the result of the industrial action rather than being available depending on the nature of the industry. It is an appropriate power which fairly balances the needs of the Australian population with a right for a particular employer or employees to take industrial action in support of enterprise bargaining.</para>

<para>âIn relation to Senator Murrayâs amendment, we have concerns in relation to the fact that too much power is being given to the executive by this legislation. I am sure that the amendment that Senator Murray is moving is seeking to remedy this. Senator Wong will speak to this in more detail in a moment and, I am sure, will speak most eloquently. I am sure that Senator Murrayâs amendment, had I had the opportunity to look at it in detail, is dealing with this also in a great deal of detail. When I sit down in my chair, I will take the opportunity to read it most thoroughly, having been put in this position.</para>

<para class="block">These are criticalâof course, much in this bill is criticalâamendments which refer to the Fair Pay Commissionâs wage-setting parameters. At the outset the Democrats oppose the bill as a whole âand this is a point that the minister picked up on earlier in the debateâand we oppose replacing the independent Australian Industrial Relations Commission with the Orwellian named Australian Fair Pay Commission. We do not use the term âOrwellianâ as a piece of rhetoric, because we are not convinced that the legislation guarantees that the decisions of the commission will be fair, nor are we convinced that the outcome will be anything but a relative lowering of wages for poorer people over time.</para>
<para>The Democrats have long been supporters of the Industrial Relations Commission as an independent umpire, and we have long thought that its deliberations have resulted in good overall decisions with respect to wage increases. The Industrial Relations Commissionâthat is, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, not the state commissionsâhas a brief to provide a safety net for employees who are unable to protect their own interests through enterprise bargaining and who need to achieve some real income growth. The commission must ensure that employment is not put at risk in doing so. The Workplace Relations Act already requires the Industrial Relations Commission to consider economic and employment issues. I refer you to sections 88 and 90.</para>
<para>The government have been boasting that workers real wages have increasedâI think this is the latest figureâby 14.9 per cent since 1996. This is not entirely their doing, although they are perfectly entitled to take some credit for it. Under the Workplace Relations Act, which they plan to gut with this bill, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the national wage case have delivered these outcomes. Yet the government propose to take the Industrial Relations Commissionâs power, trash it and introduce a low-pay commission that will reduce the very real wage increases that the Prime Minister has been boasting about.</para>
<para>It should be rememberedâand this point has been made frequently by others in the debateâthat the government argued on the basis that the minimum wage should be $50 a week less than it is now, which naturally, as a consequence, means that the 14.9 per cent increase in real wages would not have been achieved if the government had had its way. The government has refused to guarantee that that there will not be a decline in real wages, and I understand that, because there will be a decline in real wages. The government will not index the minimum wage. They will not give any idea of compensation in this area. It is quite clear to me, on reading the bill and listening to what ministers say, that over time real wages not only are likely to but will deteriorate.</para>
<para>The aim of our amendments is to put fairness and balance back into the wage setting objectives. Our amendments put back the provisions of the current act that have served Australia well. The amendments insert into the objectives of the Fair Pay Commission the key aspect of section 88B(2) of the current Workplace Relations Actâthat is, to âensure that a safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions of employment is established and maintained while promoting economic prosperityâ in Australia.</para>
<para>The amendments put back provision 88B(2)(a) of the current Workplace Relations Act, which requires the Fair Pay Commission to have regard to âthe need to provide fair minimum standards for employees in the context of living standards generally prevailing in the Australian communityâ. That is a specific social objective. Alongside this governmentâs new criteria that the Fair Pay Commission have regard to employment and competitivenessâthat government view is perfectly reasonableâour amendment puts back 88B(2)(b), which is, âeconomic factors, including levels of productivity and inflation, and the desirability of attaining a high level of employmentâ.</para>
<para>As I have said before, the marks of a civilised, successful, first-world liberal democracy are high living standards, equitably shared wealth, and an egalitarian society that respects and protects the working poor and the disadvantaged and has advanced working conditions. It is critical that, when setting a minimum wage, we ensure that the disadvantaged, the vulnerable and those who have no bargaining power are still provided an adequate standard of living. That requires a balance between the level of wages able to attract work and the level of wages able to provide for a reasonable living standard.</para>
<para>Our amendment introduces a new provision (d) that would require the Fair Pay Commission to have regard to relevant taxation and government transfer payments. On my web site, for anyone who is interested in esoteric, technical tax matters, is a technical tax paper on the tax-free threshold. In that paper I argue, as I argue elsewhere, that you have to attend to the tax and welfare intersects as well as the wage intersects when you are referring to this matter of low wages.</para>
<para>This is an important point that was highlighted by the Australian Catholic Commission for Employment Relations. The interaction between wage setting, taxation and welfare payments is an important issue. The Democrats believe that the living standard and employment costs conundrum can be more effectively dealt with through the tax and welfare systems. The government, however, has continued to ignore calls by the Democrats to raise the tax-free threshold, although I am delighted to see that Mr Turnbull, in the lower house, has picked up on our view that at least a $10,000 tax-free threshold should apply. Long before he came into the parliament, we introduced that as an amendment to the Taxation Administration Act, and it was rejected. The fundamental problem is that people are taxed too high at low-income levels. People earning as little as $12,500 a year are paying income tax on half their wagesâand $12,500 is the official poverty level recognised in this country.</para>
<para>Australia needs a much higher tax-free threshold. I argue for it to be at least $20,000 to match that which is already applicable for three million older Australians. Recent talk of tax reform suggests that the government have no intention of looking at the tax rates of the low paid and instead intend to continue to cut the tax rates of those who are wealthier. While the government continue to fail to address the tax issues for the low paid, tax and welfare payments should at least be taken into account when setting the minimum wage. The amendment also reinstates much of subsection 88B(3) of the current Workplace Relations Act, which would require the Fair Pay Commission to have regard to skills, training arrangements, people with disabilities and, critically, anti-discrimination provisions. The absence of anti-discrimination provisions in wage setting is of particular concern to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission. As HREOC pointed out, the potential exists for indirect discrimination to permeate the setting of minimum wages if, for example, the parameters contain unstated bias about the value of certain skills and attributes.</para>
<para>We have also included an additional clause which requires the Fair Pay Commission to have regard to the need to apply the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. That is an iconic statement in Australia: equal pay for work of equal value. This is an important amendment, given that women employed in the work force full time still earn 15 per cent less than men doing the same work.</para>
<para>We have also included an important amendment which addresses an issue the Democrats have campaigned on for a long timeâthat is, youth wages. We do not believe that an 18-year-old adult should be paid youth wages. Youth wages are one of the worst examples of age based discrimination. The coalitionâand Labor, I regret to sayâargue that increasing youth wages will lead to higher youth unemployment. The same argument was used to justify paying women less than men. Young people are required to pay the same amount for food, rent and clothing as other Australians. Only full-time students have access to cheaper public transport and other concessions. Australiaâs discriminatory practice is in breach of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Australia signed in 1948, which declares that everyone has the right to equal pay for equal work without discrimination. Youth and junior rates have been abolished in Canada, Greece, Hungary, Japan, Mexico, Poland and Spain and they are severely restricted in many other countries. In the United States, junior rates apply for only three months and only to those under 20 years of age, whereas in Australia they can apply for in excess of that time.</para>
<para>Subclause (2)(c) of item (5) in combination with item (20C) will change the definition of âyouthâ or âjunior employeeâ from 21 to 18. This requires the Fair Pay Commission to consider the need, using a case-by-case approach, to protect the competitive position of young people in the labour market; to promote youth employment, youth skills and community standards; and to assist in reducing youth unemployment through appropriate wage provisions. Those provision include, where appropriate, junior wages taking into account the extent of labour market disadvantage faced by young workers; the work value of young workers at different ages; the promotion of skills development and training of young workers to reduce their labour market disadvantages; the desirability of minimising discrimination on the basis of age in wage rates, only to the extent necessary to further these objectives; the structural efficiency principle; and that 18 years of age is considered an adult. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline>
</para>
<para>Referring to items (4) and (6) in particular, the Fair Pay Commission reviews wages annually. Currently, wages are reviewed on an annual basis by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Under the bill, the Fair Pay Commission determines the timing and frequency of wage reviews as well as the scope and manner in which wage reviews are conducted and the date when wage setting decisions are to come into effect. Therefore, under the proposed new arrangements, wages will not necessarily be reviewed on an annual basis. The government have indicated that the first decision of the Fair Pay Commission will be in spring 2006. The Democrats are concerned that there is no time frame placed on the Fair Pay Commission to review the minimum wage after that date. A lot can happen in a year and the Democrats think we should put an onus on the Fair Pay Commission to review wages annually. We have included an amendment accordingly.</para>
<para>Item (20) refers to indexing the minimum wage to the CPI. We are moving an amendment to provide an indexation of the minimum wage in line with the consumer price index in an attempt to keep the real wage at least at parity. The pension wage at present is indexed to AWOTE, which is a better and stronger measure. It seems odd to me that we would provide an indexation for pensioners but not for those on the lowest wage. The Democrats are moving this amendment accordinglyâto keep the minimum wage in line with changes in living standard. CPI indexation already occurs, as I said, for government benefits and indeed the amendment refers to the processes undertaken in the Social Security Act.</para>

<para>âAs a suggestion as to how we might deal with this batch of amendments, from the Labor Partyâs perspective, we would be happy to debate them together, although they will need to be put separately, obviously. It seems to us that the set of Democrat amendments which we are debating now, the next set and the subsequent amendments by the Australian Greens all fundamentally deal with the same issue. That does not obviate anybodyâs right to speak specifically to any aspect when they are moved, but I propose to address my remarks to a number of the amendments.</para>

<para>âSenator Abetz can laugh all he likes. But we know that last night the government took fairness out of the objectives of this legislation. Senator Abetz tries to put in place some sort of schoolboy debating argument by saying, âYou should have genuineness and you do not have genuineness in there.â</para>

<para>But I think most Australians understand that one of the principles there should be in setting our minimum wage in this country is fairness. It is a great Australian tradition: a fair dayâs pay for a fair dayâs work. This government has the gall to come into this chamber and put forward a piece of legislation describing the new body that will set minimum wages in this country as a âfair pay commissionâ but refuses to include any reference to fairness in the legislation in its objectives, which they voted against last night, or in the things to which the commission must have regard when setting minimum wages.</para>
<para>We will support Senator Murrayâs amendment but, frankly, we think it is quite clear that the government will vote against it. It is quite clear why they will vote against it. They will vote against it because this government do not want fair wages. If they wanted fair wages, they would make sure this act was amended accordingly. They would not just go again with the spin, the rhetoric, the meaningless words of calling something a fair pay commission when it does not have to have regard to fairness or to the needs of the low paid.</para>
<para>If you look at what the government are now setting as the objectives in the legislation, the things to which the Fair Pay Commissionâwhich I think should be called the âLow Pay Commissionââmust have regard, what you will see is that they have removed references to things such as fairness and the needs of the low paid. What they focus on is competitivenessâemployment and competitiveness across the economy. The minister last night said that there is nothing in the wage-setting parameters in the current legislation that this government are seeking to amend about the unemployed. He was wrong. There are clearly provisions in the act that do require the commission to look at the objective of maintaining a high level of employment in Australia.</para>

<para>âThe minister says it does not say âunemploymentââif it makes reference to employment then somehow that cannot include unemployment. Again, that is another schoolboy debating tactic from Senator Abetz. The fact is that the use of the word âcompetitivenessâ is code for low pay. That is what it is. It is saying: âWe want to make sure people are low paid, because they have to be competitive.â Those of us who have been listening to the debate and who have been through the Senate committee know that competitiveness means: âWe donât want people priced out of the employment marketâthat is, we want them paid less.â</para>

<para>This legislation will take an axe to the minimum wage. It will take an axe to the minimum safety net that Australians have come to rely on. It appears from the governmentâs approach this week that the Howard government says, âIf you are a Liberal party donor with a dodgy tax haven in the Virgin Islands, you deserve our help.â But, if you are a working Australian relying on the minimum wage, the Howard government says, âGo tell someone who cares.â I am sure Australians this week will compare the way the Howard government treats working Australians through this bill with the way it treats big-time tax dodgers. It appears that, if you donate $1.1 million to the Liberal Party, you can buy yourself a seat on the Reserve Bank board. But, if you are a minimum wage worker in this country, you do not deserve to have the body that sets your wages ensure that they are fair. You do not deserve the protection of fairness. That is what this legislation means.</para>
<para>I want to talk briefly about what this means for the women of Australia. We know that 60 per cent of award dependent people in this country are women. If you start to drive down the minimum wage, you are attacking the wages and conditions of women workersâwomen who tend to be less unionised, who tend to work in less industrially strong sectors, often in service industries, in highly casualised part-time employment. There is not a lot of bargaining power. This government says, âWell, it is fantastic for them because they have the choice.â I can tell you that when I worked, yes, as a union official and as a lawyer I acted for women such as cleaners, domestic cleaners, cleaners in hospitals and child-care workers. Not a lot of those women have a lot of industrial power and the ability to sit down and actually negotiate individually with their employer. For most of them, they just have to have the job. So they are extremely grateful for at least the minimum protections that the parliament can provide. These are the people in this governmentâs sights.</para>
<para>We come to the issue of pay equity. We know in this country that we still do not have equal pay. We know that women still trail men when it comes to the average wage. Unfortunately, the gap between womenâs and menâs earnings in percentage terms is growing under this government, particularly in the low-wage area. A lot of these women have been left behind, and they will be left further behind under this governmentâs legislation. Under the bill that we are debatingâand I note the Australian Greens have an amendment on thisâwhere do the women who are award dependent go to try to get pay equity? They cannot go to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. So where are they supposed to goâthe Fair Pay Commission? We are trying to work out how you actually get before the Fair Pay Commission.</para>
<para>Senator Murray indicated that one of the concerns that he has, which we share, is that there is not a requirement for a guaranteed annual increase. That is what this government is saying to Australian workers: âYou know the annual wage increase you get through the national wage case? Weâre not going to guarantee that. It is all left to the discretion of a few people we appoint to this commission.â That is, the unfair pay commission. So where are women who are award dependent supposed to go to try to get pay equity? We know from history, from fact, that the advances in terms of womenâs wages have, by and large, come through the award safety net, have by and large come from unions making applications to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for improvement in womenâs earnings. That avenue has been closed. Under this legislation, the pay equity situation will become worse, not better.</para>
<para>The government not only ties the hands of award dependent workers; it ties the hands of women workers when it comes to bargaining as well. Apart from the range of provisions in this bill, which give the employer so much more power, which tilt the balance of power in employment relations massively and disproportionately towards the employerâapart from all thatâthis government says that you cannot pattern bargain, because that would be bad. So what they are essentially saying to women such as child-care workers in the thousands of child-care centres around the country is: âYouâre not allowed to have a standard claim. All of you individually have to go to your boss and try to get a reasonable wage.â</para>

<para>âBut, as Senator Hogg quite rightly points out, the legislation I do not think prevents a standard AWA. So you get one rule for employers and one rule for employees. It is quite clear that, in this legislation, this government are saying: âWe donât want fairness in the Australian wage system. We want a situation where women workers are hamstrung in their ability to gain pay equity.â It is an extraordinary position for the government to be taking.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>There are a whole range of other matters in this bill which are bad for women workers and bad for low-paid workers. I am sure we will come to them. One could be something simple like the lack of protection for penalty rates and overtime. We all know that, in this legislation, this government is ensuring that overtime and penalty rates can be removed. That is bad for all workers because many workers, particularly low-paid workers, depend on overtime rates, shift allowances and penalty rates just to meet their mortgages. This is what they depend on; this is a part of their earnings on which they are reliant. This government is ensuring that they can lose them. That is what this legislation does. It ensures that low-paid workers can lose their penalty rates and overtime. So not only do low-paid workers not get a guarantee of an annual increase, a guarantee that wages will be fair or at least that fairness has to be something to which regard has to be had, they also get no guarantee of penalty rates, overtimes or shift allowances. What a slap in the face for Australian workers. What a slap in the face for Australian families.</para>
<para>One of the things the government does not understand, apart from the earnings implications of penalty rates and overtime, is that they act as breaks on irregular and unsocial hours. That is what they do. They act as breaks against antisocial hours. They say to employers: âIf you want to make someone work extra shifts or at times which are antisocial, youâre going to have to pay a premium.â So the employer gets compensated but there is also a disincentive for the employer to do that. All that can be removed under this legislation.</para>
<para>But I come back to the principal issue, which is one of fairness. Why is this government not guaranteeing an annual wage increase? Why does this government want fairness taken out of the act? Why does this government want to emphasise issues of competitiveness? I will tell you why. It does not want fairness in the act. It does not want a guaranteed annual wage increase. It wants to emphasise competitiveness because it wants to lower wages. It thinks the minimum wage is too high. Surprisingly we had some honest evidence before the Senate committee on this. We had a number of employers saying: âWe think the minimum wage increases have been too high.â</para>
<para>I think the current federal minimum is $12.75 an hour. It is not a princely sum. It is certainly not an amount on which it is easy to raise a family and to keep yourself and your loved ones in reasonable comfort. It is not a big wage. There are a lot of people in this country on that wage. But instead of protecting them and ensuring we have a decent wage floor in this country, this government wants to strip it away and take fairness out of the equation. It is saying to Australian workers in this legislation: âWe donât think that your wages need to be set with regard to fairness.â I think most Australians believe that a fair wage is a fundamentally Australian characteristic. I think most Australians understand that one of the things that have made this country good and that have ensured we have not gone down the American social model of the working poor is that we have accepted that, for the good of the community and for the nature of the sort of society we are, we set a fair minimum wage.</para>
<para>We do not want working poor in Australia. This is about the sort of Australia we are. We are a country that believes that there should be a decent floor and that there should be a fair wage set. People are entitled to fair wages for a fair dayâs workâdecent pay. These are Australian values, and this is what this government are seeking to strip away. They are taking an axe to the minimum wage. There is no other explanation for their complete opposition to amendments moved in this place to ensure that fairness is inserted into the act. They can come here and run as much spin and say as many words as they like but they cannot explain to the Australian people this fundamental issue of why this new Fair Pay Commission does not have to set a fair minimum wage.</para>
<para>I think most Australians will find it appalling that this government, which calls itself a government for all the people, is so clearly governing for those who have power and money. The example of Mr Gerard stands in stark contrast to the treatment of Australian workers that is being meted out by this legislation, by the intransigence of this government, by its refusal to ensure that the bill that is passed by this parliament has regard to fairness and by its refusal to ensure that a fair minimum wage remains a cornerstone of the Australian system. That is what it is doing. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âSenator Mur-rayâs amendments go to the very heart of the policy intention of this bill. Senator Murray and Senator Wong are dead right when they say that the policy outcome of the introduction of this bill will lead to lower wages for Australians across the board. The logic of that is plain for all to see. The governmentâs rhetoric is that this bill will lead to higher wages and better conditions for Australian workers. If that was a genuine policy intent, why has it lowered the minimum? Why has it lowered the minimum if it does not expect the minimum to be abided by from time to time?</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Presently, under the current industrial relations act, the minimum is set by the award conditions. People cannot go below a global no disadvantage test against the award. Those minimums now contain 20 allowable matters. This bill will have the impact of reducing those to five basic minimum conditions. If it was not the intention of the government to have people working under those five minimum conditions, why has it lowered the test? Why has it lowered the test of the minimum rates of pay and conditions for Australian workers down to what can only be described as the absolute worst pay and conditions for Australian workers, which will be significantly lower than they are now? Of course the plain logic of that is that people will be driven down to those five basic minimums. There will be a race to the bottom, because everything in this bill actually encourages that.</para>
<para>At the moment, under the current act, when an agreement expires it continues in force until it is replaced. One of the elements of this bill will be to enable an employer to unilaterally cancel the agreement once a 90-day period has gone by. What happens to your terms and conditions once your agreement has been terminated after that 90-day period? You fall back to the five basic minimum conditions set by this bill. It is apparent to everyone who has any practical understanding of how industrial relations work in the real world that that clause will drive many people out of the award system and back onto these legislated five minimum conditions.</para>
<para>The government argues that its policy intention for this bill is to create flexibility. It gives us numerous examples of where there are flexible working arrangements already in place, where award conditions have been modified to allow different hours of work and flexibility. The government actually argues against the need for this bill by doing so, because the reality is that there is not a single workplace flexibility that cannot be negotiated under the current actânot a single one. The only thing that you have to do is ensure that the award is not undermined by applying the global no disadvantage test. That provides the minimum. There can be flexibility, but the minimum test is still applied at all times. What does this bill do? It removes the no disadvantage test. Again, the minimum that any agreement must comply with will be the five basic conditions and the worst minimum rate of pay.</para>
<para>So when the government talks about improved flexibility, it does not mean improved flexibility, because every workplace flexibility is available under the current system. What it means is more flexibility without having to compensate the workers for it. That is what it meansâmore flexibility but it does not have to compensate you for it. It can move you down to the worst wage, the minimum wage that will be set, and the five minimum conditions in this bill without compensating you or getting the flexibility. Senator Wong is absolutely right.</para>
<para>How do we also know that? Because employers have told us so. During the inquiry into this bill employers came to us and said that they believe wages are too high. They seek to flatten wages, they seek to reduce and eliminate penalty rates and they seek to have the flexibility of operating 24/7â24 hours over seven days a weekâwithout restrictions or penalty rates and in industries where they say the wages are already too high. One of the classic examples was the Restaurant and Catering Industry Association, who were very upbeat about it. They were very receptive to the real policy intention of this government because they know it will enable their members to cut the wages and conditions that they have to apply now that are set by the award minimum as it is today.</para>
<para>What we are actually seeing is the introduction of the worst wages and conditions into this country. For the government to say that this will lead to higher wages and conditions beggars belief. It has no understanding of the practical application of industrial relations in the workplace. When you have employers in competition with each other and you get an employer cutting the wages and cutting the cost of providing the service that their business provides, you automatically invite other employers to do it.</para>
<para>There will be absolutely no generation of increased productivity brought by this because, again, the government has confused profitability with productivity. All the bill will do is provide the incentive for employers to increase their profits by driving down the cost of employing labour. That is a lazy way for businesses to operate, but this bill actually invites them to do it. So, instead of businesses concentrating on innovation, technical investment or proper service, all they will do is to start competing with a reduction of labour costs. And we will see the race to the bottom that we have been warning about ever sinceâ</para>

<para>âWell, ever since Work Choices. The reason you cannot have a race to the bottom now, Minister, under the award system, is because the awards provide that minimum standard. If you were true to your word, Minister, what you would say is: âIf Work Choices is going to improve wages and conditions, we will not lower the floor; we will keep the minimum test as it is now and let people move up from the minimum. That is what is available now. That is what we should keep in place.â Why have you lowered the minimum if you do not intend to use that? And, of course, it will not just be the government. What you are doing is providing legislation to enable every employer to take advantage of that. We say, time and time again, that we do not expect every employer to be miserable. We do not expect every employer to drive down wages immediately. But letâs just look at the competitive nature of business. People are in business to make money. If they are able to improve their profit margin and reduce labour costs, particularly when their competitors are doing it, that is exactly what they will have to do. They will be required to do so to remain in business.</para>

<para>The whole bill will be absolutely self-defeating. It will lower wages. It is an absolute disgrace. No wonder Senator Murray, through these amendments, is trying to put fairness back into the way the setting of absolute minimum wages is conducted in this country. And it is no surprise to me that that is why the government does not want the word âfairnessâ. It is happy to bandy it around over its glossy <inline font-style="italic">Workchoices</inline> leaflet, but when it comes to substanceâto actually having any real meaningâit does not want to have a bar of it, and it steers away from it. Senator Murrayâs questions really drive the nail into the heart of the policy intention of this government. They are worthy amendments, and the opposition will be supporting them.</para>

But I have been motivated to come into the chamber and say a few words, because what I have been hearing, as I listened to the debate on the houseâs internal television, is echoes. I have been hearing the echoes of Labor voices of the past, going back as far as 1996 when the government introduced the current legislation that we are amending. The same doomsday predictions were stated then. They have been echoed ever since, despite demonstrable and magnificent performance in the area of employee rights, remuneration and protection by this government under the 1996 workplace relations legislation. It has been amended many times amended since then, with a constant eye to improving the legislationâas this government is wont to do with any legislation and not just workplace relations legislation.</para>
<para>Anybody listening to this debateâwhether via the airwaves or in the public gallery or anywhere elseâwill have heard these basic propositions being put forward, particularly by Labor senators but also by some other senators on the crossbenches. I must admit, in the case of Senator Murray, they have been put in a less hysterical and far more constructive way. Senator Murray, we pay you the compliment, on this side of the chamber, of describing you as such, and we appreciate your considered contributions, even when they disagree very strongly with the position of the government.</para>
<para>But, just to be fair in my contribution, I will summarise the argument of senators opposite: the government is about reducing real wages; the government is about hurting the workers; provisions in the bill will be detrimental to the interests of women; and workers are going to be overwhelmingly disadvantaged.</para>

<para>The Howard model is quite simple. It is all about lower wages; it is about worse conditions; it is about a massive rise in industrial disputation; it is about the abolition of safety nets; and it is about pushing down or abolishing minimum standards. As a worker, you may have lots of doubts about the things that you might lose, but you can be absolutely sure of one thing: John Howard will reduce your living standards.</para>

That is what you did. Australian union members ran away from the organisations that you represented in massive numbers because you were just not delivering for them. What you did as a government during that time was to create 188,000 full-time jobs and 519,000 part-time jobs. There is nothing wrong with part-time jobs, by the way.

They criticise us for creating casual jobs, yet under Labor Party rule, during their almost 13 years in government, the equation was reversed: far more casual jobs, far more part-time jobs and fewer full-time jobsâand they criticise us for doing the opposite. I just do not understand their logic, and neither does the Australian public.

<para>âI have great pleasure in following Senator Santoro in the debate, because he started by saying that he heard echoes of the past, and Senator Abetz interjected and said the senator has a great record. I would like to focus on his record; I would like to focus on echoes. Remind me: who was the minister for industrial relations in the Queensland Liberal government when they lost? Who was that? Was it Minister Santoro? I think it might have been. Who lost his seat at the following election because of his record on industrial relations? I think it was a member called Santoro. I do not know if this is the same chap, but I understand that they had to dump him into the Senate because he was a complete failure at state politics. The Queensland people made a judgment. What did they make a judgment on? They made a judgment on his performance as industrial relations minister and they threw him out. He had a safe seat, and he lost it.</para>

<para>âI do not know what 60 per cent is to you, but that looks pretty safe to me. If 60 per cent is marginal, you are in a lot of trouble at the next election because, as I understand it, 60 per cent was his original vote and he managed to lose his seat over two elections. Why? Because he was identified with the Liberal Partyâs extreme industrial relations agenda. To be fair to the senator, he is not alone. In Western Australia, the same thing happened. Mr Graham Kierath introduced these reforms in almost exactly the same form as those we are debating today. He had a relatively safe seatânot as safe as the one that Senator Santoro lost but relatively safe. Whatever happened to him? He was thrown out by the Western Australian people. In the two states where the Liberals tried this on, both their employment ministers became unemployed very quickly afterwards. Senator Santoro managed to organise a factional arrangement that got him into the Senate. Unfortunately, Mr Kierath was not as well placed inside the WA Liberal Party and is now pursuing private opportunities. The point is, if you want an example of what this IR debate reflects, Senator Santoro is a classic, because he wasâ</para>

<para>âI will attempt to get Senator Santoroâs name correct. One of his colleagues in the chamber has a name I completely struggle with. Santoro is the easy one. Thank you for the correction, Senator Ferguson, but I cannot pretend I will get it right all the time. I do want to concentrate on the fact that the events I described are a reflection of what happened in the Australian community. They worked out in Queensland and in Western Australia that the Liberal governments in those states were not governing for them; they were governing from a commitment to some industry and business groups. They were delivering on an ideological right-wing agenda and the public worked it out. The public are pretty good at seeing through politicians. We may all think that somehow we get away with it, but they work it out. They worked it out in Queensland, they worked it out in Western Australia and they will work it out here. They know this is not legislation designed to be good for them.</para>

<para>The classic in this debateâand the clauses dealing with this are before us nowâis the Fair Pay Commission. They have abolished the Industrial Relations Commission, they have abolished the minimum-wage-setting mechanisms that have served this country well for 100 years, and they have created the âFair Pay Commission.â Goebbels would be very proud of that. Talk about misuse of language! The Fair Pay Commission will remove many of the protections that are available to Australian workers. It will remove the social objectives. We fought for years to get a 40-hour working week in this country. Workers campaigned for it and argued for it on the basis that an eight-hour day over five days would allow people to balance work, family and rest. It was a long campaign and Australia was one of the countries that adopted a 40-hour week as a reasonable compromise between the demands of work and the demands for a family and social life. But the social objectives that have governed our industrial relations system for many years have been removed.</para>
<para>The Fair Pay Commission is only interested in economic objectives. Workers are seen as units of production. They are not people; they are units of production. So all the protections, all the social objectives that have been in our IR legislation for many years have been abolished. Why have they been abolished? They have been abolished because the government does not want minimum protections. The best it could do is some very half-baked protections on five conditionsâfive conditions alone. From what we have seen in this debate and in the analysis of the bill, those protections are very weak indeed.</para>
<para>It is very hard to make any sense of the hours clause propositions now. We can go through all the amendments the government have got. I am not sure where it will leave us, when they pass them. I do not think they know either. But what we do know is that the protections that have been with us since 1948 are going to be abolished. In 1948 we had the acceptance of the 40-hour week throughout Australia. The protections that we gained in 1948 are abolished by this legislation. People say John Howard takes us back to the 1950sâthe white picket fence, his view of women cooking at home and not being in the work force et cetera. That is grossly unfair. He is taking us back to the 1940s, not the 1950s. He is taking us back to the time when you were not guaranteed a 40-hour week, let alone a 38-hour week. Those protections are gone.</para>
<para>When you get to the core of it, when you ask them, âWhy are you reducing the minimums?â they do not want to debate that, because there is only one answer. Think about it: why would you abolish the minimums? So as to allow people to go below them. What are minimums? They are the bottom point. They are the lowest point at which you can proceed. You can negotiate above minimums. You can seek extra pay and better conditions, but the minimums are a standard whereby Australian society says, âWe think every worker is entitled to this set of conditions as a minimum,â including provisions for pay, hours and protections. This government has said: âNo, we donât support that. We will pay lip-service to a set of five minimums, but effectively they are abolished. We donât want the minimum wage setting that we have seen in this country for more than 100 years, because that stifles innovation.â In other words, they want to be able to allow people to go below the minimums, otherwise why would they do it? It is not some theoretical thing. If you reduce the minimums, if you abolish the minimum wage, what effect does that have? It allows people to operate on less. That is the whole point, and that is the whole point of this legislation. That is why people like Senator Joyce have done nothing to protect Australians, because they have not protected those minimums.</para>
<para>It was interesting the other day: even when some minor amendments were suggested by the government, a couple of industry bodies came out and said: âWe donât want all that complexity. We donât want any suggestion that people might be guaranteed that they get paid fortnightly. We donât want any guarantee that they might be entitled to have their hours protected. We want to be able to be much more flexible. They might work 60 hours one week and 10 the next. We donât necessarily want to have to pay them the basic 38-hour week pay a fortnight.â They do not want that sort of complexity. There is that attitude from some employers that they do not want minimums, and this government is delivering.</para>
<para>I have got to be fair to the government: they are delivering. Certain employer groups in this country had an agendaânot an agenda taken to the election, not an agenda discussed with the Australian peopleâand the government are delivering. They are delivering for their mates. And I am sure they will be very grateful and I am sure that donations to the Liberal Party will be flooding in. And I am sure that under Senator Abetzâs regime they will not have to be declared either. It will be all very nice. It will be back to the good old days when you could do what you liked, donate to the Liberal Party and everything would be okay. Well, it is not okay.</para>
<para>The government spent $55 million of taxpayersâ money trying to convince the Australian public that they were right, that this was good for them. But the Australian public have worked it out and have asked: âWhy would the government spend $55 million of our money trying to sell this to us? If it is so obviously correct, if it is so clearly beneficial, why would they need to spend $55 million of our money?â Because they cannot win the argument. They needed the old Goebbels propaganda campaign again. They needed words like âFair Pay Commissionâ and they needed to spend taxpayersâ money to try and convince people it is good for them. Well, it is not good for them. Going back to the industrial conditions of the mid-1940s is not good for them. Taking us back to those sorts of industrial conditions is not good for us. We have made social progress in this country which is based on a fair go, based on Australian values, and there is nothing Australian about the values that underpin this legislation.</para>
<para>I do not want to take too long, but I do want to make the point that the Fair Pay Commission does not deliver the protections we have nowâthe protections for the low paid, for women and for young people. My experience in Western Australia of this very system in the state jurisdiction was that the people who got exploited were the young, the Indigenous, the migrants and the women. We have seen the research and the statistics about what happened. More than 50 per cent of workers in the retail and hospitality industries ended up on less than the award rate. The award rate used to be the minimum. The government freed that up, as they sayâthey like that languageâand 56 per cent of the people in those industries ended up on less than the award rate. That is the whole point: you allow the wages and conditions to fall. They will not fall for those in higher skills areas, they will not fall for those in higher demand areas, but they will fall for the most vulnerable.</para>
<para>That is not the Australia we want. That is not the Australia that the Australian people want. This government has to think very carefully about going down this American path where people work for low wages, where you have people parking cars for virtually nothing, where you have people working for tips. If you go into a restaurant in America and talk to the waitresses they might be on $3 an hour. How do they make their living? By tips. Do we want to have a community where people working in Australia have to rely on tips? That is not the sort of Australia I want. We want people to be guaranteed a fair dayâs pay for a fair dayâs work. That is what we thought we got in 1948. But, no, John Howard wants to take us back to before 1948, to a point where you were not guaranteed a 40-hour week, to a point where you were not guaranteed a fair dayâs pay for a fair dayâs work. We do not want to go back there.</para>
<para>I do not go in for political predictions terribly much because this is a very volatile game. But I have seen what happened in Queensland and I have seen what happened in Western Australia, and the Australian public are pretty savvy. They work it out. They have worked it out that this bill is not good for them; this is not in their interests. I think 2 December 2005, when this bill passes, will be the beginning of the end of the Howard-Costello government because they have overreached. They have gone to ideology. John Howard is a smart politician, but this is his ideological obsession. This is not governing for middle Australia. This is not governing for ordinary Australians. This is about an ideological obsession being fulfilled. He has overreached. The Liberal Party have overstepped the mark and there are an awful lot of marginal seat members in the House of Representatives representing the Liberal-National Party who will pay the price. Even Mr Howardâs seat is down to a fairly low margin these days, I notice. But they will pay the price because the Australian public will reject this legislation. Those people who so keenly joined the party backbench committee who wanted to help prosecute the governmentâs case will learn to their great cost that the Australian people do not accept this legislation. They do not accept the approach that it represents.</para>
<para>As I said, I think 2 December 2005 will mark the beginning of the end of this government. People do not forget. They realise that this legislation is not in their interests. They will seek to redress the balance. They know that the coalition has abused its power in the Senate, that the government is introducing legislation that is not for them, that it is for the governmentâs mates, and that, fundamentally, the values that underpin it are not Australian values. When you do that, you pay the price. I think they will pay the price. People who pretend that abolishing the protections in the current system is anything other than allowing us to see conditions fall are completely naive. The only reason you abolish minimums, the only reason you abolish that floor in the system, is to allow wages and conditions to fall below it. Otherwise, why would you do it? I say to the government: why are you doing this? Why would you do this unless you are entertaining the possibility that those minimums will not be protected in the future?</para>
<para>I urge coalition senators to rethink their position, to try and do something constructive to ameliorate the worst excesses of this legislation. Sure, we need flexibility. Sure, we need productivity. But this legislation does not take us there. This legislation takes us down the low-wage, low-skill path. It divides Australians and it ensures that the groups without bargaining power in our society are exploited because they do not have the power necessary to protect their conditions. They have been protected by legislation and industrial commissions for the last 100 years. This bill removes those protections.</para>

<para>âThe way that the opposition conduct this committee stage of the bill is up to them. I think most would accept that if there has been a 15-minute homily of empty rhetoric delivered, then I will rise to the challenge on behalf of the government. However, if people have short, sharp, crisp questionsâand that is what the committee stage is basically forâthen I try to give, as best I can, short, sharp, crisp answers. If the opposition want to use all their time on empty rhetoric, so be it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We had Senator Chris Evans trying to tell us about Senator Santoroâs political career. Just remind me: in recent times, who was sacked from the Senate shadow ministry? It wasnât Senator Chris Evans, was it? Then, because of the dearth of talent on the other side, after the election, they scratched around and said: âWe need a Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. Who can it be? Letâs go for that sacked opposition spokesman that even Mr Latham found too unpalatable to comprehend.â So they dragged around and placed him in the seat. No wonder so many people have made the adverse comments that they have on the Australian Labor Party and its current performance.</para>
<para>Senator Chris Evans talks about removing the term âfairâ from the legislation but, of course, he fails to tell us that the word âharmoniousâ has been inserted in the principal objects. As I said last night, how do you achieve harmony unless there is fairness to both sides? You will not receive harmony in the workplace if one side believes it is not being treated fairly. So we have this dishonest and pathetic debate from those opposite saying, âSee, theyâve removed the word âfairnessâ; therefore they do not want fairness.â Does that mean that because âharmoniousâ was not previously in the bill Labor never wanted a harmonious workplace? Of course not. So whether we say we want fair workplaces or harmonious workplaces, give us a break. Letâs get real. Letâs get to the meat and the substance of this legislation and not muck around with pathetic semantics and saying, âItâs not fair because the word is not in there.â I think the word âharmoniousâ more than covers the field.</para>
<para>In relation to legislation and people having mandates, Senator Chris Evans and his Labor Party promised the people l-a-w law tax cuts and, immediately upon their re-election, repealed the l-a-w law tax cuts. So, clothed with all that duplicity, they come into this place asserting moral superiority. Give me a break. You can fool the Australian people some of the time but, hopefully, not all of the time with your empty rhetoric and denial of your own history.</para>
<para>The anti-American sentiment seepingâit is not seeping; it is gushingâout of the opposition is such that they got rid of Latham as their leaderâor, I suppose, the Australian people didâbut the Lathamesque anti-Americanism is still there. It still goes around in their veins and their arteries. It is part of them. Of course, if Senator Chris Evans keeps this up, do you know what will happen? Mr Beazley will say: âOopsie, weâve gone too far. Where is the nearest American flag? Letâs hold a press conference in front of the American flag to prove that we are in fact friends of America, although we have been bagging America for the last six months flat out,â and will try to recover the ground, as his party did so pathetically before the last election.</para>
<para>Having said that, as I have said time and again, we are providing an Australian solution to Australiaâs unique situation for the benefit of individual Australians. Senator Chris Evans falsely asserted in his speech that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission was to be abolished. It is not to be abolished. You can repeat your misinformation as often as you like, but mere repetition does not obviate the need for facts to support your false assertions. Repeat it as much as you like, but it does not make it a fact. If you say it 100 times, it is false 100 times.</para>
<para>We are also asked why we are getting rid of the standards and putting the standards right down. Excuse me, but this is the first time ever that there is legislation before the Australian parliament to guarantee workers 10 days sick leave or personal leave. It is the first time ever that that is guaranteed by legislation. I suppose the big end of town knocked on our door and said to Minister Andrews: âMake sure you give the workers 10 days personal leave. We arenât doing it in the manufacturing sector at the moment but, yes, please do that.â They also undoubtedly said to us, âMake sure that the workers canât trade away those 10 days, as they currently can.â</para>
<para>We are protecting workers by legislation to ensure that 10 days personal leave will be a minimum standard. For some, it will be an increased standard, and it cannot be traded away. Do you think the big end of town told us to do that? Of course it did not. It is there because we have a rapport with the Australian people and the Australian work forceâpeople like those who met at the Albert Hall in the seat of Bass just before the election. We have empathy with those sorts of people and we understand their needs and their aspirations. That it also why, for the first time ever, we have guaranteed in this legislation that workers will have their annual leave protected. At the moment, they can trade away the lot of it. We are saying that you can only trade away two weeks.</para>
<para>We are protecting workersâ conditions like they have never been protected before. Let me remind those on the other side, who are so proud of their trade union credentialsâas they should be and as I want them to beâthat they represent 17 per cent of the Australian work force. Chances are that we represent the other 83 per cent of the Australian work force, and we are taking our direction and suggestions from the average Australian worker, not from those who have unions foisted upon them or, indeed, those who want union involvement. But we are even listening to that other 17 per cent as well, to assist us in informing the way we should be developing and delivering this legislation for the benefit of the Australian people. The oppositionâs bland assertion that this legislation will represent a diminution of workersâ rights is simply false.</para>
<para>I return to Senator Murrayâs amendment, which I understand is before the chamber. I encourage honourable senators to concentrate on the specific clauses. Let us deal with the questions and answers in that regard. Senator Murray, in what I hope was a slip of the tongue, suggested that the Fair Pay Commission would not be fair, or words to that effect. I think that is a bit of a slight on those who will be appointed. I do not think that those who are appointed to the Australian Fair Pay Commission will get up of a morning, make a cocktail of lemons and razor blades and swallow that before they go in to the commission and ask, âHow can we do over the workers of this country?â They will not be doing that. Of course they will not. They will take their jobs seriously and will do the very best for the Australian people: the employed andâspecifically mentioned for the first time everâthe unemployed.</para>
<para>Those champions opposite, who have lost the support of the working people in the trade union movement and the support of workers at elections, sat around the cabinet table with the ACTU under that great accordâremember the accord?âwhich delivered us one million Australians unemployed. What a fantastic record! Letâs re-elect the Labor government on the strength of that! They can deliver one million Australians unemployed. The Howard government have only 500,000 unemployed. What a great failure we must be for having halved the unemployment rate in this country, for having created, as Senator Santoro told us, 1.7 million jobs!</para>
<para>We have seen the lowest income earners share in the increased wealth of this country at a greater rate than the top end of income earners. That is why people in the seat of Braddon in Tasmania, which is one of the lowest income electorates in Australia, elected a Liberal member of parliament in 2004. I wonder why. It was because they know what we deliver. They know that we deliver the $600 family payment which, of course, those on the other side still say is not real money. When we go doorknocking in Burnie and places like that, the mums and dads tell us: âDo you know what? We could actually withdraw that $600 from the bank. We could take it to a local shop and spend it. We think it is real money.â So I say to the people of Australia: these are the people who brought you one million unemployed, the same people who told you that the $600 was not real. Ask yourselves: do you think they are being honest on this occasion when they seek to describe to you our Work Choices legislation?</para>
<para>As Senator Santoro so eloquently put it, those on the opposite side asserted 10 years ago, before we were even in government, that the Howard agenda would be to cut wages, it would be a race to the bottomâall the nasty things that you could think of, no matter what it would beâthe number of broken windows would increase if a Howard government were elected and car accidents would increase. No matter what the mayhem, it would increase if a Howard government were elected. The people of Australia know that they now have more job opportunities than ever before. We have seen the lowest rate of industrial disputation ever in this country and a 14.9 per cent increase in real wages. The workers know the facts. The pay packets speak a lot louder than the propaganda from those on the other side.</para>
<para>Also, Senator Marshall in this contribution sought to suggest that, if an award were to end, you would then be thrown onto the five minima. I corrected that last night; I correct him again this afternoon. I really do not know how often you have to say some of these things, but of course the Labor Party have their mantra going. They have been given their lines and, therefore, they will repeat them ad nauseam, irrespective of the facts.</para>
<para>For the benefit of people such as Senators Evans and Marshall, allow me to read what I think is a very apposite quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> of 28 May 2005. Let us see if those opposite can recognise the behaviour. This is what the very insightful editorial told us:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Drama merchants in the Labor Party and the unions are warning of horrors to come following changes to the industrial relations laws. They tell us bosses will sack workers at will and that wages and conditions will be cut. It is all nonsenseâa fantasy from union apologists frightened of change. Unions prospered in the old Australia when membership was compulsoryâ</para>

<para class="block">and, oh how it changed when it became voluntary, right down to 17 per centâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">and wage rates were decided by quasi-courts that established artificial comparisons between people doing completely different jobs at opposite ends of the country. It was a system that suited labour lawyers, union officials and employer representatives who liked a quiet life. But for other Australians it was a form of feudalism, paying us according to the lowest common denominator, no matter how hard we worked. ... The old industrial relations system assumed class war was the norm and was never relevant to the reality of our egalitarian, acquisitive culture, where workers have always assumed the right to build a better life.</para>

<para>âI am quite happy to take your interjections, if that is what you want, but I listened to you in silence. Three points have to be made. Between July 1992 and March 1996, the Labor government in this country created jobs growth of 2.34 per cent per annumâfact. Information provided by the Parliamentary Library. During the coalitionâs term, from 1996 annual jobs growth has averaged 1.94 per centâfact. Information provided by the Parliamentary Library. In the period 1992 to 1996, 68 per cent were full-time jobsâfact. Information provided by the Parliamentary Library. Full-time jobs growth under the coalition government was 51 per centâfact. Information provided by the Parliamentary Library. And over the 13 years of Labor government, from 1993 to 1996, annual jobs growth was 2.23 per centâfact. Information provided by the Parliamentary Library. So I would suggest that you check your facts, Senator Santoro, because I do not know where you got your figures from.</para>

<para>âIt is not a document that can be tabled. Let us look at wages. The reality is that, under the coalition government, wages for the top percentile of wage earners in this country increased by 13.8 per cent over the period of the Howard government. Wages for the bottom two percentiles grew by 1.2 per cent. That is despite the fact that there were a number of national wage cases which helped boost the wages income of the groups in the lowest two percentiles. Let us look at the issue of national wage cases and then I will come back to the issue of the Fair Pay Commission.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>From 1997 to 2005, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission awarded increases of the minimum weekly wage to $50 a week, or $2,600 a year, higher than it would have been if the commission had adopted the governmentâs submissions. In fact, the commission awarded wage increases at the bottom level substantially higher than the government was seeking. They also awarded wage increases that were something like $5,000 a year higher than what they would have achieved if the commission had adopted the submissions by ACCI, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which argued for zero wage increases in five of the nine cases between 1997 and 2005.</para>
<para>That brings me back to the point Senator Murray has been making about the Fair Pay Commission. If the government argues that we need a Fair Pay Commission, then the other side of that argument must be that the government believes that the Industrial Relations Commission is unfair in its judgment of wages. How does it believe it is unfair? It must believe that the commission is awarding wage increases that are too high. It would not see the commission as being unfair if it thought the wage increases being awarded were too low. The logic of the argument is that it must see those wage increases as too high; therefore the commission is unfair.</para>
<para>The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee heard the argument put by ACCI. I think it was one of the more honest arguments I heard. They said they did not like the Industrial Relations Commission because it did not pay enough attention to the economic arguments. It did not give enough weight to the economic arguments in making its judgments. In fact, ACCI were arguingâand I think it was Senator Murray who put this point to themâthat the commission was not giving enough weight to the economic arguments of ACCI. Therefore, they were not getting the results from the commission that they otherwise could have and should have expected.</para>
<para>Why is there support for the Fair Pay Commission? Quite frankly, ACCI support the Fair Pay Commission because they believe that they will get a slowing of wages growth as a result of the introduction of the Fair Pay Commission. They believe it will not award wage increases at the levels they have been awarded by the Industrial Relations Commission and, therefore, the outcome will be better for them. This view is also shared by employers. Two employer groups appeared before the committee. One was COSBOA and in response to some question about the Fair Pay Commission and how it would operate its representative said to us:</para>
<quote>
<para>What about a highly-skilled mother who is willing to work at a lower rate in return for the ability to pick up her children after school? If a small business can provide that flexibility, retain her skills and still travel along nicely in this economy, I think we would be very pleased.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words: if we can get the labour at a lower price for being a little bit flexibleâfor allowing women to go and pick up their kids from schoolâthat is a good result for us. But it is a clear indication that COSBOA expected that they would get a better wage outcome from the Fair Pay Commission than they would get from the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Mr Hart, who appeared for the Restaurant and Catering Association, told us:</para>
<quote>
<para>For our industry, as opposed to other industries, we are looking at less growth overall in wages. That does not mean that the decision, though, will be a lesser overall decisionâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I am not sure what it does meanâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">What we are hoping for is a package that is more palatable to our industry and more equitable across other industries.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para>The total amount expended on wages across the industry is too high.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">If that is not an argument that suggests that they expect to get a slowing of growth of wages out of the Fair Pay Commission, then I do not know what it is. That organisation is from an industry that is subsidised by the taxpayer. That industry has substantial subsidies from the taxpayer, because a very significant number of people who work in that industry work for cash in hand. They do not have awards, they do not have AWAs, they do not have individual contractsâthey have cash in hand. That is how the industry functions. To a very significant extent the restaurant and catering industry in Sydney functions based on cash-in-hand payments. But both those employer groups were quite clear about their expectations of the Fair Pay Commission. I come back to my first salient point, and that isâ</para>

<para>âMinister, for your edification again, that point is: if you want to put in place a Fair Pay Commission then why are you arguing that the Industrial Relations Commission is unfairâthat its treatment of wages has not been fair, proper and impartial? After all, the president of the commission is your appointment. Most of the people on the bench are your appointments. The place is very heavily stacked with people that have been appointed by your government. What is the difference? Explain to us the subtle difference between the two commissions.

At the end of the day, they have always been decisions that have been fair and balanced in terms of the needs of the work force. If there is nothing wrong with it then, as Senator Sherry asks, why change it? And, if you are going to change it, what are the reasons for changing it? There has to be a justification, a reason for changing it. You know what that reason is, Senator Abetzâit is setting up a structure that you will stack, that will ensure that you get outcomes that will ultimately slow wages growth in this country and that will allow the provisions of wages and living standards to fall over a period of time.</para>

</continue>
<para>In that respect, I support the amendments that have been put forward by Senator Murray. It is very appropriate to pick up those elements of the Industrial Relations Commissionâand I think that is what the amendments that we are talking about doâthat have been there for a significant period of time and have set the framework for the operation of the commission in the way it has made its judgments about wages in this country, and to ensure that at least those guidelines are used to underpin the operations of the Fair Pay Commissionâor the low pay commission, as it is more commonly referred to in the circles in which I travel.</para>

<para>âAs I was saying before that interruption, the comments that we have just heard from Senator Campbell reflect the reaction from the Labor Party to this legislation that has been consistent since its announcement and introductionâthat is, a response of hysteria, negative propaganda and misinformation. That in turn exactly mirrors the response which they gave to the reforms introduced by the Howard government back in 1996âhysteria, false information, misinformation and negative propaganda. That is what we saw during the whole period of the first round of industrial or workplace relations reforms initiated by the Howard government. It was debated in this chamber in October 1996, virtually nine years ago.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Those claims have been shown over the past nine years to be demonstrably false. What were the claims? Workers would be exploited and wages would fallâexactly the sort of nonsense we have just heard repeated by Senator Campbell this afternoon in this debate. In the remarks I made during the debate on that legislation on 8 October 1996, I referred to a comment that had been made by Mr McMullan on 30 May 1996. He said the legislationâthe 1996 legislationâwould âmark the end of a cooperative era of industrial relationsâ. Again, that is the sort of thing they are saying now. In fact what it did was open the door to a much more cooperative era of industrial relations, instead of industrial relations being determined in a centralised system by people who knew nothing of what was happening at the grassroots, the workplace, and the individual enterprise and workplace level. Over the last nine years we have seen conditions and work arrangements determined at the individual enterprise level, to the enormous benefit of those businesses and to the enormous benefit of their employees.</para>

I believe that is an offensive remark against persons who have been appointed to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and to the Federal Court, which hears appeals from the commission. Those officers were appointed by this very government, and include the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the Hon. Justice Geoff Giudice. I do not believe it is appropriate for a senator to make a statement that those judicial officers know nothing.</para>

<para>âI said they knew nothing about the circumstances of individual local enterprises, and of course that was demonstrated time and time again by decisions made by that body. The point I want to make is that, contrary to all of the fearmongering we saw from the Labor Party in 1996, over the last nine years we have seen real wages increase by 14.9 per cent, compared with a modest 1.2 per cent over the whole 13 years of the Labor government. We have seen industrial disputes consistently remain at their lowest level since records were first kept way back in 1913. We have seen 1.7 million new jobs created, and over the last year or so we have seen unemployment hover around five per cent to 5.1 per cent, consistently at a 30-year low.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Those have been the consequences of the reforms of 1996. They have been beneficial to businesses, which have grown and expanded, and beneficial to employees, whose wages have increased significantly in real terms. Importantly, they have also been beneficial to the unemployed, because with the creation of 1.7 million new jobs they have been able to gain employment. That, as I said, contrasts with what happened under the Labor Party.</para>
<para>Let me point out that Senator George Campbell misused statistics when he claimed that the salaries and wages, the incomes, of wealthier people had increased significantly more than those of the less well off. That is based on a study which is riddled with errors. It is an ACIRRT report, prepared for Unions New South Wales, and I think it is important to put on the record that there are a number of data input errors and methodological errors in that ACIRRT material. For example, ACIRRT asserted that real average weekly earnings for persons in the top 10 per cent of income earners grew by 13.8 per cent between 1998 and 2004, when in fact they grew by 5.5 per cent.</para>

<para>âI would say it is a substantial error, Minister. It was a data input error and a methodological error, and that error has formed the core of the claim by Unions New South Wales that higher income earners have benefited more than lower income owners under the current government and as a result of the much-needed reforms that were introduced in 1996.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>When we come to debate the Fair Pay Commission and interfering with the way in which wages and conditions are going to be determined, need I remind this chamber that back in 1988 the then Labor government sacked the whole Australian Industrial Relations Commission because they wanted to get rid of one particular commissioner. I think it was Justice Staples they wanted to get rid of. They sacked the whole commission and then reappointed them! So we are seeing hypocrisy from the Labor Party on this issue.</para>
<para>The fact is that the reforms that are part of this legislation are much needed, as were the 1996 reforms. But they are evolutionary reforms; they are not revolutionary. They are relatively modest reforms but, nevertheless, they are important reforms. I would say they are reforms that are about a quarter of century too late. They should have been introduced in 1980. I recall advocating very strongly in the other place and also in some seminars back in 1980 that a less regulated, decentralised workplace relations system was what Australia needed. I think that I can claim, with some pride, to have been the first Liberal parliamentarian to have done so, even before our present Prime Minister saw the light on this issue.</para>
<para>This is an issue that has been around for some 25 years, and at long last it is being brought to fruition and the necessary reforms are being made to free up our workplace relations system and provide a more productive system that will be of benefit to both businesses and employees. It is with some regret that I recall that the Fraser government failed to embrace those necessary reforms back in 1980, although I must give them some credit, as they did make some modest changes to our workplace relations system at that time to bring about some improvements.</para>
<para>The Labor government that then came into office failed dismally in regard to the need to reform our workplace relations system. Certainly, they introduced some reforms to the financial markets and to our industry, trade and protection policies, but they singularly failed to introduce reform of industrial relations. On the contrary, the changes that they made and sought to make to our industrial relations system during their term of office were based very largely on two inquiriesâthe Hancock report, called the <inline font-style="italic">Report of the committee of review into Australian industrial relations law and systems</inline>, and another union based document, called <inline font-style="italic">Australia reconstructed</inline>. They were the basis of Laborâs reforms to our industrial relations system, leading to responses that entrenched and enhanced union power, rather than freeing up the system as was essential.</para>

<para>âYes, it certainly had that effect. I recall that at the time Professor Richard Blandy, who is certainly no barracker for the Liberal Party, described Laborâs reforms based on the Hancock report as âthe last hurrah of the past, rather than a blueprint for the futureâ. Labor introduced reforms that were very much based on history, on 19th century, out-of-date worker-employer confrontation, rather than reforms that would foster the cooperation which was going to be so important for Australiaâs future as we moved into the 21st century.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>It is to the enormous credit of the Howard government that they have initiated reforms, firstly in 1996 to the extent that they were able to do so. Lacking a majority in the Senate, they made some modest reforms that have certainly had enormous benefit for our workplace relations structures and systems. As I said earlier, they have been to the great benefit of employees. Now, as a result of the wisdom of the Australian voters last year when they at last gave the government a majority in the Senate, we are able to press on with further reforms that will make an enormous contribution to the future potential for wealth creation in this countryâto be shared, again, by both businesses and employees. It is important that this legislation is passed unchanged by the amendments that have been put up by the Democrats and the opposition.</para>
<para>With regard to Laborâs scaremongering on this issue, I want to refer to a very good article that I saw earlier this week in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>. It was written by Mark Christensen, an economic consultant who has been an adviser to the Queensland Treasury and the Productivity Commissionâso he is someone of good repute. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Despite the propaganda, labour market reform is entirely consistent with our cultural ideal of a fair go.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is Laborâs argument: workers will not get a fair go under this new system. As Mr Christensen says, it is âentirely consistentâ with the Australian ideal of a fair go. He goes on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The most endearing aspect of Australian culture is a willingness to assume the best of others. Efforts to discredit Work Choicesâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">this legislationâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">represent a faithless act that only demonstrates that those involved are deficient in the very attribute they claim to be defending.</para>
<para>Which view actually presumes a fair go: trusting that employers and workers can sort things out, or a fear-infested willingness to draw a line between us and them?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is what Labor want to continue to propagateâthis âus and themâ mentalityâwhile completely failing to recognise that in a 21st-century economy employers, businessmen and employees have a strong common interest in making their enterprise work effectively, and this legislation will enable that effective working together to occur. You can have all the regulations and rules in the book but unless you recognise the cooperative nature of enterprises today then you are not going to achieve a strong economic position and strong growth for firms, jobs and wages. As Mr Christensen also says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... economic security comes from accepting that there is no fail-safe method for securing it ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words, you have to let the market operate and you have to encourage productivity on that basis. In that way jobs, wages and businesses will be secure. The record stands for itself. What has occurred over the last nine years should be comparedâneed I remind the chamber againâwith the high interest rates, the recession, the loss of jobs and the relatively low wage increases that occurred, particularly in the late 1980s and early 1990s, under the previous Labor government.</para>
<para>The need for reform is generally recognised. It has been recognised by the International Monetary Fund which, in its Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation with Australia, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Further reforms of industrial relations are needed to expand labour demand and facilitate productivity gains.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Indeed, David Burton, the IMF Asia and Pacific Department director wrote to Sharan Burrow at the ACTU saying:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Looking forward, the IMF staff views the proposed industrial relations reformsâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is, the reforms being introduced by this legislationâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">as further steps ... which will improve the functioning of the labour market and help sustain Australiaâs strong economic performance in future.</para>
<para class="block">... IMF staff took into consideration that strong protections for employees would remain in place.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Again, that is an important thing to note. Despite all the bleating we hear from the other side of the chamber, strong protections for employees do remain in place in this legislation.</para>
<para>The OECD said that there needs to be further workplace relations reform. In its Economic Survey of Australia in February this year it said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The government is now in a position to address these issues and should proceed as soon as practicable.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Clearly, these reforms are not being introduced on the basis of an ideological whim, which again is misinformation that Labor Party propaganda is putting around. The reforms are indeed clearly supported by a number of bodies, not only within Australia but also internationallyâorganisations that have the responsibility of overseeing economic wellbeing and reporting on it.</para>
<para>It is important to note that these reforms are evolutionary, not revolutionary. If we look back over the workplace relations debates of the last 25 years, we can see that there is a desperate need for these reforms. I recall in 1987 that Senator George Campbell, when he was in another role, was described by the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, as the man with â100,000 dead men around his neckâ. That was a direct result of the misuse of union power causing job losses. Since that timeâindeed since 1976, I might noteâunion membership has dropped from 51 per cent of the work force to 22.7 per cent of the work force in 2004, and in the private sector it is only 17.4 per cent of the work force. Unions have lost their relevance, and the opposition to this legislation is a desperate attempt by the Labor Party, which is beholden to and dependent on the union movement, to try to maintain some relevance for the union movement. It is a goal that is destined to fail, because the broad body of the Australian community understand only too well the benefits that have been derived from the legislation that was introduced and the reforms that came in in 1996, and when these present reforms are in place they will understand only too well the benefits that they will also derive. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

The amendments that the Democrats have put up, and the similar ones that the Australian Greens have put up, go to addressing what we believe should have been in the legislation if we were talking about an Australian âFairâ Pay Commission.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>You might at first be mistaken in thinking that there was a slight oversight in that there are no provisions in the bill that implement the âfairâ part of the Australian Fair Pay Commission. Yesterday, we had some quite substantive discussion and questions and answers on the intent of the bill and why the provisions of âfairâ had not been put in it. During the debate we were told that it is implied in the bill. My question still stands: why isnât it explicit?</para>
<para>The previous act, and the provisions that the Australian Greens have tried to put back in, are to address that issue of âfairâ. The existing provisions in the act say that in performing functions under this part the commission âmust ensure a safety net of minimum standards and conditionsâ. It says that it must look at that. Whereas, the provisions in the bill say that there must be âregard to providing a safety net for the low paidâ. It does not define âsafety netâ, whereas in the previous act it was definedââa safety net of fair minimum wagesâ. âSafety netâ is not defined in the current bill. When I asked yesterday, I was told that it was not in the bill and that people understand what it is.</para>
<para>Â âLow paidâ is not defined in the bill. We probably all understand that one, but it should be defined. Nor is the function of the safety net defined in the bill. So the amendments that the Australian Greens are trying to move go to the very heart of what you would think would be in a fair pay commission. If you have the word âfairâ in the name of the commission, anybody in the community would think that that would then be explicitly pointed out in this bill. This bill addresses the so-called economic side of things, but it does not address the human side of things. It does not address fairness for the community or the need of workers to maintain a reasonable standard of living.</para>
<para>It is fair enough if you want to address bothâwe do need a balanceâbut all that is in this bill is one side and not the other. One side is clearly spelt outâhaving regard to the economyâand it is explicit. The other side is impliedâhaving regard to workers and the need for workers to have a reasonable standard of livingâand it is not explicit. One is explicit; one is implied. Why not make both explicit? The Greens are moving this amendment in an attempt to make this a fair billâto make it fair to the community, as its name suggests. If that is not put into the bill, if it is not made explicit, the Greens are moving an amendment to take the word âfairâ out, so that it is quite clear what this is about. It is about looking after the economy and looking after business mates; it is not about looking after Australian workers. Alternatively, we could call it the âFairy Pay Commissionâ, because somehow workers are magically going to get a fair go! But fairness is not explicit in the bill, so let us take out the word âfairâ, call a spade a spade, and make sure that the community understands that this is not about looking after them but about looking after the governmentâs business mates.</para>
<para>We keep hearing about evidence. We have heard about what happened in Western Australia when similarâalthough I believe less harshâmeasures were introduced in the 1990s, and that is that the minimum wage dropped. It dropped by $50 a week. That is not fair. That is why we need provisions in this legislation to protect peoplesâ minimum standards. We need it in the legislation so that people know where they stand.</para>
<para>We have put up two amendments. One is to fix the Fair Pay Commission so that it really does deliver fair wages. The existing actâand this is where I think the government is playing with semanticsâdoes require economic factors. It does require including levels of productivity and inflation and the desirability of obtaining a high-level of employment. So the existing act has both; the new one has only one side of things because fairness is implied, not because it is in there. Let us put it in there. So let us either fix the Australian Fair Pay Commission or get honest and let the community know what is going on, and call it the âAustralian Pay Commissionâ so that its name reflects what is in the legislation.</para>

<para>âI want to address some points raised by Senator Evans, particularly in relation to Senator Santoro. I thought it was quite an unreasonable attack on him. I asked Senator Santoro to provide me with some information and some figures on what his achievements were when he was a Queensland minister. It makes very interesting reading. For example, during his time unemployment dropped. During his time, 52 per cent of all employment growth in Australia took place in Queensland. Employment growth ran at 4.3 per cent in the 12 months up to March 1998, in comparison to the national rate of 1.5 per cent. Industrial disputation fell consistently subsequent to the proclamation of the legislation. In March 1977, 172 working days were lost per 1,000 employees, whereas in March 1998 that figure had fallen to 70 working days lost per 1,000 employees. But of greatest interest is the challenge that Senator Santoro threw out to the Labor Party on the supposed abuse of the exemption to the unfair dismissal laws. Senator Santoroâs challenge to the Labor Party in Queensland was to nominate one case of abuse under those changed circumstances, and not one case of abuse was brought forward.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I also want to address another matter which I think has really underpinned the debate from the other side, and it has been used again and again. That is the obvious, almost pathological, hatred of employers and, particularly, of small business. I know that Senator Joyce is going to refer to some of those matters soon, so I will not address them. The trouble with the line that has underpinned the debate from the other side over the last three days is that there is an assumption that good employers are going to become bad employers. That is the rationale of the debate that we have heard over the last three days. The reality is that, despite the best endeavours of everyoneâand I include everyone in this chamber, both political parties, and organisations everywhereâthere are bad employers under the existing law. Therefore, if you want to be a bad employer now, you can be. So why is it that the great bulk of employers, and particularly the great majority of small business people, are good employers under an environment in which we know they can be bad employers? Why is that?</para>
<para>Why is the Labor Party using this fallacy as an argument? What underpins the relationship and what makes employers be good under a system that enables them to be bad is mutual respect between the employer and the employee. What frustrates me, and it has for the last three days and for some time, is the complete and utter lack of understanding from those opposite about the relationship between small business employers and their employees. Regrettably, it comes from the fact that the members of the Labor Party have no experience in being small business employers and therefore they do not understand the relationship and they are unable to intellectually or philosophically rationalise that relationship.</para>
<para>The bottom line is that small businesses have a quite extraordinary relationship with their employees. That relationship is based on mutual respect and trust. That is the core of the relationship: mutual trust, understanding and respect. In many small businesses, people are not employees; they are part of the business and they are assumed to be part of the business. This is because they are pivotal to the running of the business. It is everyone working together to achieve an outcome. That is what makes small business work. That is why small business is such an extraordinary part of our economy. Senator Joyce is going to be referring to that, so I will not go further.</para>

<para>âI will be talking about the legislation in a general senseâas Senator George Campbell didâfor only about six minutes, and then I will be sitting down. I do not want to take up the 15 minutes. Small business employers invest an enormous amount of time in their staff, as do staff in their employers. Employers train their staff. They often pay for training. Do you think that realistically anyone is going to suddenly start abusing the system and removing loyal, trained, dedicated and professional staff? Do you genuinely think that that is going to be the scenario?</para>

<para>âSenator Hogg can interject, but under the present law bad employers can exist. The simple fact is that the great majority of employers are good employers under a system that allows them to be bad employers if they want to be. The very reason that the great majority of small business people are good employers under a system that would allow them to be bad employers is because of the relationship they have with their staff. They are often family businesses, in which their staff are members of the family. To think that the world will suddenly change this afternoon at 6 oâclock and those good employers will become bad employers and abuse their staff is patent nonsense. It shows an almost obscene misunderstanding, deliberate or otherwise, of the relationship between small businesses and their employees, and a real misunderstanding of the way businesses operate.</para>

<para>âThe argument that has been posed by those on the other side of the Senate today is that the sky will fall as of tonight and the world will end. If that is not the case, those on the other side are going to look rather foolish. But I will take up the challenge and pick up the gauntlet. They believe the sky is going to fall, and I believe it is not. If, when we arrive in this chamber next week, the worldâwith the new legislation in placeâis continuing on basically the way it did, and that continues over time and over the next year, then I suggest that the weight of the argument will move in our direction. Once more, they will be held to account because they predicted the end of the world and it did not come to pass.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let us look at the facts about the Australian Fair Pay Commission. An additional $29.1 million in funding over four years will be provided for the establishment of the Australian Fair Pay Commission. There is a belief that we are moving into a world in which things will be completely unregulated, there will be no control and people will be completely at the behest of the crocodiles. Supposedly, there will be no protection mechanisms and all of a sudden every employer will morph into some arbitrary mechanism of exploitation. This is great theatre. It has certainly workedâit has scared people. I can scare the kids as well. It is easy to go out and terrorise people and make them fear the future, rather than go forward on a constructive path and create a future for them. I am going to debunk the myth that this is completely arbitrary. There is a process in place, the government is in control of it and the government has a mind to the welfare of workers. The Fair Pay Commission is a great article of faith in that.</para>
<para>The Fair Pay Commission will set and adjust: federal minimum wages; minimum award classification rates of pay; federal minimum wages for juniors and trainees, including school based apprentices and employees with disabilities; minimum wages for pieceworkers; and casual loadings. We have already heard the theatrics about how waiters will have to rely on tips and all that sort of conjectureâor, alternatively, rubbish. That is not the case. The Fair Pay Commission is not going to take into account the tips you may get. These are the theatrics needed to peddle an argument when the substance of it has failed. I like to talk about facts. The minimum award classifications will be protected at the level set by the Australian Industrial Relations Commissionâs 2005 safety net review. Minimum and award classifications will not fall below that level and will increase as decided by the Fair Pay Commission.</para>
<para>Once more, I wish to debunk the myth that there is no safety net, that there is nothing happening, that it is all going to end as of six oâclock tonight, that the world will come to a conclusion and that next week people will be being paid, as we heard today, $3 an hour. It is about getting the fear factor out thereâmake the masses scared, work on their fear and work to the lowest common denominator. When all else fails, just charge for the lowest common denominatorâthat is, work on the fear factor.</para>
<para>The first decision of the Fair Pay Commission will be no later than spring 2006 and will take into account the time since the Australian Industrial Relations Commission was last involved. Mind you, we have heard in this chamber today that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is being abolished. It is news to me that the AIRC is being abolished. I will have to tell Senator Abetz. It is not being abolished.</para>

They say, âWe cannot rely on the substance of our argument, so we will go to the lowest common denominator, we will go to the essence, and we will make you insecure.â The Labor Party will inspire insecurity in you, because they are hoping for a depression. The only way they will ever get memberships is to wait for a time of misery. They are looking forward to a time of misery to rebuild their union membership.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Union membership is an interesting issue. Let us talk about that for a little while. Do you realise that at the moment there are 1.84 million people in unions? That sounds great, but there are 1.92 million people involved in small businesses. The number of people in small businesses has now exceeded the number of union members. Do you know why that is? It is because people want to take control of their destiny. People want to be master of their own ship. It is what people in the National and Liberal parties aspire toâthat you take control of your own destiny, that you make your own future, that you believe in yourself with such structure that you think that you can determine your way forward. We believe in the absolute right that you should be able to be master of your own ship. We wish to inspire in people the highest sense of freedom in their life by being master of their own ship.</para>
<para>Do you realise that there are 5.1 million active ABNs out there in Australia at the moment? Do you know why? It is because people want to be in business. They like the idea of being master of their own ship. It must be galling to those on the other side who rely on union membership to see the end, to see the demise, to see that the sun is going down on union membership and that they have to determine a new agenda to be relevant. They just have to look to Tony Blair. You have to start reading about Tony Blair. Determine a new agenda and move to that new horizon, or you will die and the Greens will take over the left-hand side of your constituency and we will bite into the right-hand side of your constituency and you will become further and furtherâ</para>

The Fair Pay Commission will be made up of five members: a chairman, who can be appointed for a period of up to five years on a full-time or part-time basis, and four commissioners, who can be appointed for a period of up to four years on a part-time basis. The chairman will be required to have high-level skills in business and economics, while the commissioners must have experience in one or more of the following: businesses, community organisations, workplace relations and economics. It could be the caseâand this terrifyingâthat in the future the commission could be made up of union members. What a terrible idea that would be. It could be the future.

<para>âMr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I think that is defying your ruling. I put the proposition to you this way. Earlier what was remarked was the following: the advertising campaign of the government was âGoebbels like propagandaâ. If the government senators want to take issue with that they can. At no time was âGoebbelsâ, âNaziâ, âfascistâ or any of those titles used with respect to the members of the Fair Pay Commission. The senator, in raising that matter yet again, is defying your ruling and, frankly, showing contempt for the proposition you have put.</para>

<para>âI withdraw. Let us get back into the real game. The real game is this: over the period of the National-Liberal, Liberal-National coalition, there has been a 14.6 per cent real growth in wages. If it stands to form that we are the grand arbiters of people, trying to drive down the worker and basically exploit them, then we have gone about it in a very peculiar way, in that we have actually had a real increase in wages of 14.6 per cent. I think that is a bit of a record. I do not think it has been matched; I do not think the Labor Party matched that. So in our attempt to exploit the workers we have managed to deliver a better outcome than the Labor Party ever did.</para>

<para>âSenator Ronaldson tells me that it was 1.2 per cent in 13 years. Thank you for your assistance. We are on the record for what we have done. The fear factor that the opposition are trying to drive into the debate is not factually correct. You have to be able to base the premise of your argument on fact, and it is lacking in fact. Under the National-Liberal, Liberal-National coalition, 1.7 million new jobs have been created. So the premise of the argument that we have been exploiting workers is unfounded. The substance of the oppositionâs argument is without form. There is no logic. When an argument is tired of logic and substance, you go to the emotionâand that is where they live at the moment: they live in the emotion because there is no factual content to what they say.</para>

<para>The Australian people will realise on Monday that the sky has not fallen and there is a clear direction. They take on trust what the government is intending to do. There is a program forward. That program will lead to a greater prosperity. There will continue to be a growth in small businesses. There will continue to be a growth in new ABNs. There will continue to be a growth in the economy. There will be a continued belief that the National-Liberal coalition is the best form of government to take our nation forward, and we will be returned at the next election.</para>

<para class="block">Before I speak to that group of amendments, I want to reflect briefly on some of the remarks made in the earlier discussion. I am one of those people in this parliament who have great respect for and recognise the long political experience, acumen and ability of the Prime Minister, who, from the ranks of the coalition, is certainly pre-eminent in political skill. I suggest, through the chair, that Senator Joyce spend a bit of time at the feet of the Prime Minister and learn some words of wisdom. The one mistake the Prime Minister would never make would be to take the Australian people for granted. Senator Joyce stands up there, full of self-congratulation, and says, âWe will get re-elected.â Through you, Chair, the Prime Minister would never make that mistake. Never, ever take the Australian people for granted. I have heard him say that a thousand times, and his great wisdom on this is something that any new senator should absorb. I would urge you to avoid claiming that you are going to win the next election. Do not take the Australian people for granted. The Australian people will give you a whack if you do.</para>
<para>The second point I want to makeâand it refers to the general debateâis on this issue of fear. People are afraid of losing wages and conditions. Parliamentarians, who represent the people, need to recognise that, whether they are promoting the governmentâs agenda or opposing it. Those promoting the governmentâs agenda need to allay those fears and those opposing it need to expose those fears. The fact is that in 1996 the very strong objection of the Labor Party to what was proposed was of course to the bill as unamended. The bill was amended by the Democrats, and the 176 amendments that we put into that bill in fact enabled much of the fear to fall away. The consequence of those amendments was that the Workplace Relations Act remained economically effective but became socially acceptable.</para>
<para>The merits of that act are apparent in the good performance of the Australian economy. That act has made its contribution, and the Democrats can rightly claim to have played a part in that. It has made its contribution to lower disputation, higher real wages, higher employment, the growth of GDP and the 1.7 million jobs that it created. But there have also been other contributions, such as the economic reforms in the Labor years and the economic reforms in the coalition years. So, as Senator George Campbell would say, it is a multifactor kind of situation. But to claim that it is just fearmongering means that the people have not attended to the very radical nature of the changes that are presented, which do attack the institutional system that we presently have to address the issues of wages and conditions.</para>
<para>The third brief set of remarks that I wish to make is that many of the coalition speakers continue to spit out this class hatred of unions. It is quite amazing. It is amazing to me that they have a love of employer organisations and a hatred for unions on a sort of class, squirearchy, historical basis. Frankly, both are essential to our societyâboth those who represent collective capital and those who represent collective labour.</para>
<para>It is distressing but, I think, very revealing to see that the real intent of this bill is in fact political. You can hear it in the speeches. If they can hurt the unions and the union movement they are going to hurt the Labor Party. If they hurt the Labor Party they will get re-elected. If that is the motive you are exposing through your speeches then carry on, because the more you are broadcast, the more you are putting out that motive, people will read between the lines. They are up there in the galleries. They hear what we are saying, and they are getting the message loud and clear. This is about hammering the Labor Party through hammering the union movement. That is what you are saying. There is constant reiteration of âthe dreadful unionsâ, what the unions do and this and that about the unions. I think it reflects very badly on the government.</para>
<para>Senator Joyce is one of those who keep turning to facts. I agree with him: facts are important. That is why I have emphasised throughout this debate that, in complete contrast to the GST, there has been no modelling, no tables, no cameos, no economic data provided to substantiate the propositions being put by the government. If, therefore, what is exposed is a decades long held desire by a section of the conservative forces of this country to undo and attack the way in which work arrangements have been resolved in this country, if that is your motive and it is an honest motive, by all means expose it. But do not pretend that it is in the national interest if it is merely an expression of class hatred and class antagonisms which reach deep into the history of Australia. I must say that I am quite amazed at the openness with which they expose their real prejudices and loathings.</para>
<para>There are thugs who are employers; there are thugs who are unionists. Unfortunately, to pervert a biblical saying, the thugs will always be with us, and they will be with us on both sides. Because there are thugs in the union movement, that is no reason for the coalition to damn the entire union movement. It is also, of course, no reason to do the reverseâto damn the entire employer and business sector, who are so important and so vital to us. That brief reaction of mine will undoubtedly, as matters like this do, create a counter-reaction. Nevertheless, I felt it important to put on the record my observations, having listened to what went on earlier.</para>
<para>The other thing I would say is that, as is the way with these highly emotional and important debates, it is getting a bit ratty and thus descending to the equivalent of second reading debate speeches on both sides. I do not point the finger at the minister or the shadow minister in that respect, but it would probably be wise if, as we go on, we keptâwhich I have not quite, I might sayâto the amendments at hand because we have a lot of business still to get through.</para>
<para>In moving that group of amendments, I wish to speak briefly to them. The Australian Bureau of Statisticsâs latest social trend data shows that there is still a significant wage gap between men and women and that this gap has changed little under the Howard government. What is more, the governmentâs proposed industrial relations reforms are likely to increase the wage gap and force women out of the work force. The ABS social trend report found that women earned an average of $611.50 a week, or 68 per cent of the average $897.50 pay packet taken home by men. The report also looked at the average hourly ordinary-time earnings for full-time non-managerial adult workers, which showed that womenâs earnings were 92 per cent of menâs. Some analysts have argued in the past that the gender pay gap exists only because men work more hours. This data clearly shows that, when you compare average hourly rates, women are still earning less than men, even when they are doing the same jobsânot always, but as a general rule.</para>
<para>There was also evidence that, during the period of the Court government in Western Australia where an industrial relations system similar to that proposed by this bill was introduced, the result was that women in WA fared badly relative to males and to other women in Australia. The figures are that, in February 1992, the Western Australian gender pay gap was 22.5 per cent and by May 1995 it had widened to 27.8 per cent. HREOC submitted to the committee inquiring into this bill that the bill does not provide âadequate or appropriate mechanisms for equal remuneration to be achieved between men and womenâ. HREOC also argued that the existing equal remuneration provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and the previous Industrial Relations Act 1988 had been âsingularly unsuccessful in achieving pay equityâ. HREOC was concerned that the Work Choices bill will not address this issue. From those remarks, it is clear of course that this has been a long-term issue for governments of both persuasions.</para>
<para>The amendments that followed were recommended by HREOC as important to address pay equity for women. Our amendment (3) introduces into the function of the Fair Pay Commission a role for the Fair Pay Commission to monitor and investigate pay equity, to publish annually in relation to wage differentials between men and women in relation to work of equal and comparable value, to take into account outcomes of the above before setting the federal minimum wage and the pay and classification scales and to review any decision in relation to the federal minimum wage or the pay classification scales if gender related undervaluation has been identified as a result of a sex discrimination complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In combination, amendment R(20A) facilitates the provision in amendment (3) and states:</para>
<quote>
<para>In exercising any of its powers under this division, the AFPCâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is, the Fair Pay Commissionâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">is to have regard to any relevant recommendations made by HREOC with respect to discrimination, in accordance with powers conferred upon them under the <inline font-style="italic">Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act 1986</inline>.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Amendment (7) requires that the Fair Pay Commission consult with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission before introducing or changing an Australian pay and conditions standard. Amendments (19) and R(19A) aim to require the Employment Advocate to investigate, research and regularly publish results of a representative annual survey of both collective agreements and Australian workplace agreements for the purpose of determining wage differentials between men and women carrying out work of equal and comparable value. In performing its function, it must have regard to the principle that men and women should receive equal remuneration for work of equal value.</para>
<para>Democrats amendment (57) reinstates the Industrial Relations Commissionâs ability to deal with equal pay applications by repealing subsections (2) and (3) of section 170BAC in item 74. This amendment ensures that the Industrial Relations Commission can hear applications from women or groups of women employed on the APCSâthat is, women who would have formerly been award dependent women. The amendment is necessary because there is no capacity to initiate consideration by the Fair Pay Commission for equal pay to redress undervaluation. The amendment also removes the reference to comparatives, which is a reference that assumes that equal pay applications involve direct discrimination. This is not true. Indirect discrimination may also be a cause of unequal pay and so reference to comparatives unduly restricts the breadth of the equal pay provisions.</para>
<para>The final amendment in this group, amendment R(20B), relates to the definition of people with a disability. The bill requires the Fair Pay Commission to have regard to the principles contained in antidiscrimination law, including the Commonwealth Disability Discrimination Act 1992. It will be illegal to dismiss an employee because of his or her disability. The problem is that the bill defines an employee with a disability narrowly as someone who qualifies for a disability support pension in the Social Security Act. This is a very restrictive definition of disability in terms of protecting employees with disabilities, especially from unfair dismissal. We should recognise that there are people with disabilities who do not choose to register their disability because they are very proud and do not want to be seen as dependent on the Social Security Act. The definition will exclude people with a disability who are able to work, but who do not qualify for disability support provision. We have therefore broadened the definition to replicate the definition in the Disability Discrimination Act.</para>

<para>âI would like to make a few introductory comments and then get on to the thrust of the amendments Senator Murray has moved. I indicate to Senator Murray that there is no hatred of the trade union movement from this side of the chamber. There is a degree of credulity, though, in that I think people like Senator Murray and definitely those opposite believe that trade unions automatically should be seen as the voice of the Australian worker. The fact is, they represent 17 per centâless than one-fifthâof the Australian work force. Why is it that the other 83 per cent of Australian workers have made a decision not to be in a trade union?â</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We on this side believe that, whilst like any section of the community the trade union movement should be listened to, because we are interested in every single individual in Australia, the union movement has forfeited its right to claim the status it previously enjoyed because it no longer covers the work force. It is a minority of 17 per cent. The other 83 per cent need to have their voice given expression to as well. We believe that it is the likes of those who voted for us at the last election who represent that voice. Whilst we listen to the trade union voice, we believe that it has forfeited its right, given its abysmal support within the work force itself.</para>
<para>Senator Siewert previously made a comment that the word âfairâ should be deleted from the Australian Fair Pay Commission because it is no longer under the principal objects of the legislation. Now the word âharmoniousâ has been included, so possibly we could settle on it being called the âAustralian Harmony Councilâ. This is the level to which we have descended. I respectfully suggest that we move on from those debates, and I will. Let us move on to the amendments. I think I have thrown Senator Murray somewhat by indicating that we would agree to amendment R(17A), and that is why that particular amendment has been excised from this batch. When Senator Murray introduces it, I will not be speaking to it because we support it. I am sure Senator Murray will be putting his case.</para>
<para>In relation to amendments (3) and (7), proposed section 7K(2) on page 29 says that the Australian Fair Pay Commission may inform itself in any way it thinks appropriate, including by undertaking or commissioning research, community consultation, and monitoring and evaluating the impact of its decisions. The Australian Fair Pay Commission will also be required to apply the principle that men and women should receive equal remuneration for work of equal value, which is stated at proposed section 90ZR(1)(a) on page 99. It is a matter for the Australian Fair Pay Commission as to how it discharges its statutory duties within the broad parameters set by the bill. It would be open to the commission to consult with specialist bodies, such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Individual complaints about pay inequity will be dealt with by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission under division 2 of part VIA of the legislation.</para>
<para>Just whilst we are on the Industrial Relations Commissionâthe body that those opposite claim to be so supportive of and that is sacrosanct, should not be touched and should not be interfered withâlet us just remember what Labor did to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission when they were in government. They sacked the lot, abolished the commission and then re-established it under the guise of the Industrial Relations Commission. The judicial personnel of the new body were identical to the judicial personnel of the extinguished one, save one person, Justice Staples, who they then retired on a $90,000-a-year pension. So if this is some hallowed group of individuals that should be treated with such discretion and with such a hands-off approach, wellâexcuse meâyour actions speak louder than words. When it suits you, you are willing to abolish the whole lot, re-establish it and get rid of those people that you do not like. I do remind you that on one occasion Mr Kelty referred to an AIRC decision as âvomitâ. So if you ask us to treat that body with respect, as we do, then you have to make sure that you have treated it with respect. Of course, you have not in the past.</para>
<para>I move to Democrat amendment (19). It is not appropriate that the Office of the Employment Advocate be required to produce reports of the kinds suggested in the Democrat amendment. Section 358A of the act requires the minister to cause regular reports to be provided regarding developments in agreement making. This reporting obligation, which will be retained by the bill, includes reporting on the effect of bargaining during the relevant period upon womenâthat is mentionedâpart-time employees, persons from non-English-speaking backgrounds and young persons. Given this reporting requirement in section 358A, the amendment suggested by the Democrats, we submit, is unnecessary. I think what I have just read out covered both amendments (19) and R(19A) so I will move on to amendment R(20A). The Australian Fair Pay Commission can consult with a range of stakeholders, which would include bodies such as HREOC. It can also receive or ask for submissions and recommendations from such stakeholders. I do not think I need to delay any further on that.</para>
<para>In relation to amendment R(20B), the definition of âemployee with a disabilityâ is purposefully narrow in scope and application. The definition will only apply in relation to proposed division 2 in part VA. It is not relevant outside division 2. It ensures that the ability of the Australian Fair Pay Commission to determine an Australian pay and classification standard with a pro rata wage rate only applies to employees who are eligible for the disability support pensionâthat is, restricted to those employees who are unable to earn a full rate of pay. So whilst I accept that the Democrat amendment in this regard is well motivated and genuine, nevertheless, when you go through the detail of the legislation, it does make sense that it should be restricted to those employees who are unable to earn a full rate of pay. The Democrat amendment would allow such a classification scale to be provided for pro rata wage rates to apply to employees who can earn a full rate of pay, and we believe that that is not necessary.</para>
<para>In relation to amendment (57), I indicate that I think I have covered the matters in my previous contribution. Can I have an indication as to how long Senator Wong might be on this and how the proceedings are going in relation to potentially excusing myself from the chamber for about 15 minutes?</para>

<para>âFar be it from me to request that you stay in the chamber, Minister! I have had some brief discussions with my colleagues on the crossbenches. As senators and those who are present or listening may or may not know, the Senate is dealing with a bill and explanatory memorandum which I think would total close to 1,500 pages now. The bill itself is almost, I think, 700 pages, the explanatory memorandum for that is 600 or 700 pages and then there are 100 pages of amendments that were tabled yesterday about half an hour before the debate began. There is clearly not enough time to debate all of these issues, because the government has guillotined this debate to conclude at 4.30 and we are about two pages into a 10-page running sheet.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The opposition has tried, certainly, to progress through this. What we would be suggesting, and I think I indicated this at the outset of the discussion in relation to this set of amendments, is that we vote on the Democrat amendments before the chair, the subsequent Democrat amendments, the Greens amendments also before the chair and the government amendments. We would not propose from this side of the chamber to engage in substantial debate on those; we think those issues have been covered.</para>
<para>The opposition would propose, given that not all of this will be debated, that we move to the unfair dismissal amendments. We think that is a substantive debate. It is an issue that the Senate inquiry was not permitted to inquire into and it involves changes to unfair dismissal which I think even the government concedes go well beyond what it indicated to the electorate at the election. We think it is deserving of a debate. I put on record our concern that we are unable to engage in a substantive debate on so many other issues in this bill. We are in a position as senators in this chamber of having an extraordinarily limited time to deal with some very controversial and difficult amendments, which would be the largest changes in 100 years. But at this stage I would like to make clear that we do not want to have this bill passed without having the opportunity to debate at least unfair dismissal. There are a number of other issues as well, but that certainly would be our next priority.</para>

<para>âMinister, if you require us to talk whilst you are gone, we can do that. But, just to let you know, we do intend to call a division. It is up to the Labor whip, of courseâthey could offer you a pair for 15 minutes if that was necessary. I do not see why not, but that is up to them. The point I want to make through the chair is that you will need to guide us as to what the section is. As I understand it, we are being asked to shift, once page 2 on the running sheet is complete, to page 5âit starts with a government amendment on constructive dismissalâand then move on through page 6.

<para class="block">I have added the words âand societyâ. In item 2 I have again added the words âand societyâ. It is a specific attempt on my part to reinforce the values which have underpinned our system. Our system has said that for poor, disadvantaged or powerless people at the bottom of the scale, both employers and employees, society has to be taken into accountâin other words, the contribution that is made to the general social character and the social contract in Australia. The specific ideas of the fair go principle, of the safety net and indeed of minimum wages and so on are that the social impacts have to be taken account of.</para>
<para>Society is broader than the family, but it does include those very notions which lie behind the idea that every family should be able to receive an incomeâwhether it is a wage, a welfare income or a combination of the twoâwhich enables it to have a reasonable standard of living and which enables people to make progress in their lives and to ensure that their children can have better opportunities and lives than their parents did. By putting in the words âand societyâ I am specifically rejecting the conservative notion first expressed by Margaret Thatcher, former Prime Minister of Great Britain, when she said the equivalent of âSociety is deadâ. Society matters. The nation is its people and society should be taken into account. The impacts of any decision should be taken into account with respect to both the economy and society. What I am attempting to do here is to oppose the notion that all that matters are economic considerations.</para>

<para>âI would like to address the amendments but also previous comments as part of the general debate. In previous comments, Senator Murray challenged this side with a quote from a source who came before the committee saying that the 1993 industrial relations reforms that the Keating government introduced and the 1996 reforms, known as âthe greater leapâ, were singularly unsuccessful for women in the work force. That relates to the general debate as it relates to these particular amendments concerning those who may be most disadvantaged by these industrial relations reforms.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Senator Murray, what you said and gave credence to also reflects what Senator Wong has been presenting to this chamber and what the ACTU have presented in their public advertisements and public addresses. The leader of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow, said on International Womenâs Day that Australian women have a bleak future. I am instructed not to speak too long, but I just want to refer Senator Murray to the facts on the 1996 reforms. You do seek facts when you come in here. I agree with you: the whole week has been full of assertions, more so from the other side. We need to look at the facts and figures. The ABS have the facts and figures on how women have fared under the 1996 reforms right up to the year 2005.</para>
<para>Assertions are made, particularly by Senator Wong, that there have been reduced job security and lower wages for women, that there has been a widening gap in pay between men and women, that there is less capacity to balance work and family since 1996 and that women are at a disadvantage when making workplace agreements. They are disproved by the facts.</para>

There have been 863,000 new jobs created for Australian women. This equates to a 23.7 per cent rise in female employment under the Workplace Relations Act since 1996, so there has been an increase in the female employment rate. Also, some of the assertions relate to the casualisation of women in the work force. Again, the ABS figures show that nothing could be further from the truthânot that there is anything wrong with casual work. In fact, I would say that women seek casual work more than full-time work.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Unfortunately, time does not permit me to give you every detail of the ABS facts and figures, but I simply say in general terms that there has been an increase in women in employment, there has certainly been no increase in the casualisation of women in the work force, there has been an increase in the number of women taking up full-time employment and there has been a reduction in the gender gap since 1996. This all relates to the fact that they have been given greater flexibility and choice within the workplace.</para>
<para>As you know, this government has relied heavily on our record of commitment to the working men and women of Australia. Our record in general has been stated by previous speakersâthat is, the general unemployment rate has come down while general employment has increased and wages have generally increased across the economy. We can point to specific figures in relation to that sector of the work force that you paint as the most vulnerableâthat is, womenâwhich show that, since the 1996 reforms, standards have increased by every single benchmark you wish to use. If time permitted, I would read every single statistic out to you. I challenge you to refute those ABS figures with regard to the gender gap, full-time employment, job satisfaction and flexibility.</para>

<para>âI will make a very brief contribution to this debate. I cannot let that comment go unrefuted. I place on the record for everyone to understand that Senator McGauran is trying to defend the record of this government, and the government senators today have just voted against pay equity.

<para>âI thought Senator McGauran made some excellent points. He indicated that, since the 1993 act and the 1996 act, progress has been made, but this bill seeks to take away the mechanisms that allowed for that progress to be made. What the previous amendments did was try to put back those mechanisms which would allow more progress to be made and to put into the legislation the recommendations of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Pru Goward, and her team. I think Senator McGauran made an excellent case for why he should have supported the previous amendments.</para>

<para>âI am going to return to Senator Murrayâs amendments, which relate to the wage-setting parameters. I will be brief. They address the public interest in a way that calls for some comment from the government. My understanding is that, during the questioning of the ACTU, Senator Murray had indicated that the Democrats would move an amendment to the Work Choices legislation to include the current parameters that influence the decisions of the AIRC in the legislative parameters of the AFPC. As I understand the amendments, Senator Murray specifically proposes to include the current section 88B(2) and section 91. Senator Murray is particularly concerned, as I understand from the way in which he puts the support for his amendments, that the Fair Pay Commissionâs parameters do not adequately capture and reflect the public interest. The precise wording of the AFPCâs legislative parameters have been fully debated, and the parameters areâ</para>

<para>âI rise on a point of order, Madam Temporary Chairman. It is always difficult for a minister just standing in for the previous minister. Regrettably, Minister, you are referring to some other amendments, not to amendments (14) and (15) on sheet 4765 revised, which are before the chair at the moment. I do not criticise you for it, because we are dealing here with 150 different pages and to just walk in and have to stand in for somebody else for a short while is very difficult.</para>

<para>âSenator Murray, I thank you for the interjection and the concern that you show for my position of filling in for the minister for a short time, but my advice is that I was precisely on the point that the minister wished to have advanced in response to what you had put in support of your amendments. The parameters are intentionally designed to introduce greater vigour, certainly greater economic vigour, into the determination of minimum wages. The guiding objective of the AFPC is, of course, to promote the economic prosperity of the population more broadly. The tax transfer system is, in the governmentâs view, the appropriate mechanism to address broader social issues, by, for example, reducing the tax burden on low-paid workers or increasing family benefits. We believe very strongly that the legislative parameters do represent a significant improvement and that the public interest is appropriately reflected in the way that I have outlined.</para>

<para class="block">I do not intend to speak for very long; we have been through these issues quite substantially. Senator Joyce mentioned earlier that the AFPC was modelled on the British Low Pay Commission. I would like to point out that I believe that is taken slightly out of context. The analysis of the activities of the British Low Pay Commission in the wider context makes it clear that it is quite different from the proposal for the Australian Fair Pay Commission. The British Low Pay Commission fitted inside a wider social agenda. Evidence from the UK on the British version shows that there has been a 40 per cent increase in the national minimum wage since 1977. Overall employment has increased amongst this group of workers and the sectors which are affected by the Australian minimum wage. In other words, it is not correct to compare the proposed commission in Australia with the British version because it is substantially different. There are substantially different parameters around it and, despite the fact that the minimum wage has increased, we have also increased employment. Going back to the issue of putting fairness explicitly into the Fair Pay Commission, it is quite clear that you can deliver economic growth and equity and fairness for workers if it is in the requirements of the Fair Pay Commission. I will leave it at that.</para>

<para>âJust briefly, I think this debate has been canvassed but I want to reiterate that this is yet another amendment trying to put in what the government has taken out. The government has taken out fairness as a criterion for wage setting in this country. The government is proposing to remove what I think is a very good Australian value, that we have fair minimum wages in this country. We have seen the government over the last day consistently vote against amendments that put the concept of fairness back into this bill, which is fundamentally unfair. The opposition will support the Greensâ amendment. I anticipate that yet again the government will vote against fairness.</para>

<para>âAs Senator Wong has indicated, we have had this debate before. I have indicated that it is a highly sterile argument. Not voting for the word âfairâ does not mean that you do not believe in fairness. It was implicit throughout the terminology. Those opposite have this affected laughter, but are they really suggesting that those who will sit on the Australian Fair Pay Commission will have their cocktail of lemons and razor blades every morning before they walk in to ensure that they are not fair to the Australian work force? Of course not.</para>

<para>âWe are taking it out of the legislation, yes, and we are including the word âharmoniousâ, which was not in the legislation before. Taking that logic, those on the opposite side have never believed in harmony in Australian workplaces. For me to make that proposition is as ridiculous as it is for those opposite to suggest that we do not believe in fairness. Ask yourself this question: how do you get harmony in a workplace? How do you get harmony in a political partyâsomething those opposite might not understand? How do you get harmony in any relationship? By everybody in that relationship being fair and reasonable. Therefore, you do not have to spell out that it has to be fair, because it is implicit.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Of course, neither side has proposed the word âgoodââthat the Australian Fair Pay Commission has to make good decisions, or genuine decisions or sincere decisions. Does that mean that nobody in this parliament believes in good, genuine or sincere decisions? Of course it does not. You have to look at the actual parameters. Sure, the word âfairâ is no longer used; the word âharmoniousâ is. At the end of the dayâgive us a breakâI think the average Australian fully understands what the implication of all this is, and to try to play these semantic word games does those opposite no justice.</para>
<para>The proof of the pudding will be in the pay packets and not the propaganda. We have now had 10 years of propaganda from those opposite, saying that under a Howard government wages and standards will fall, when the exact opposite has been the truth, as is so easily demonstrated by objective information by any standard. There has been an increase in real wages, a decrease in unemployment and the lowest rate of industrial disputation ever. The facts speak so much louder than the propaganda from the other side.

<para>âI move amendment (4) on sheet 4744 revised:</para>
</talk.start>
<amendments>
<amendment>
<para class="ParlAmend">(4)Â Â Â  Schedule 1, item 71, page 177 (line 30), at the end of paragraph 101B(1)(b), add âprovided that the provisions in the agreement concerning penalty rates, loadings for working overtime or for shift work, and rest breaks, must be comparable to the relevant awardsâ.</para>
</amendment>
</amendments>
<para class="block">This amendment is in respect of overtime, penalty rates and shiftwork allowances. This is an important issue. It is probably worth going back to the original reason why overtime and penalty rates were introduced many decades ago. The issue is that they were part of the first paid work and family initiative. They were designed to act as a disincentive for employers to request their employees to work antisocial, long hours. We know that today these issues are also being used for purposes other than the original intent. For example, they are used by some to top up low pay and there have been some problems with them being used inappropriately, either by employees or employers, to try and top up low pay, because it is very hard to make ends meet.</para>
<para>The second issue is that for some businesses, especially small businesses, penalty rates or overtime allowances can hinder some of their expansion plans. It is not guaranteed that those things will be there for all; only for some, as they are to start with. Every hour and every day of the week is treated exactly the same. When I ask people on the streets about whether working at 2 am is the same as working at 2 pm, they say, âNo, itâs not.â They are concerned about what this bill will do in that regard. So the Family First amendment is about protecting that for all workers and not just some.</para>
<para>Going back some time, Family First proposed an inquiry into the very issue of overtime and penalty rates because we understand that they are not only serving the original intention but also causing a couple of consequences that were never intended. As I said before, they are being used to top up low pay and they are also acting as a disincentive for some small businesses. Those two issues themselves do not mean that we should just throw them out, because the original intention of the allowances and penalty rates was to ensure that there was some disincentive in the process so that employees were not requested to work long, antisocial hours and to make sure that working at 2 am was treated differently to working at 2 pm. That is the issue at hand here.</para>
<para>It is a real issue for most Australians who understand that at some stage down the track they may be presented with an individual agreement without those issues and they find out that they will lose eight hours pay a week because the overtime allowances are not there any more. The little luxuries in life, like going to the movies on the weekend or going down to the local pizza parlour could be compromised for some. I understand that for a lot of people this may not be the case, but some, who are in their current position because of awards or because someone has been able to negotiate enterprise bargaining agreements for them to level the playing field, will not be in a position to try to bargain for things like overtime allowances and penalty rates.</para>
<para>Family Firstâs concern is that, while we understand that overtime and penalty rates are causing some problems, the original intent and purpose of them is still legitimate and they are still needed. Before we throw them out, I think we should make sure we have something in their place. The Family First amendment goes towards making sure that, when agreements are struck, overtime and penalty rates are at least comparable to the awards that otherwise would be in effect.</para>
<para>I think this is more than fair and reasonable. As I said, people are surprised when they find out that eventually these could be taken out and that they have to bargain to get them back. That may work for some. You and I, Madam Temporary Chairman Crossin, may be able to bargain for those things, but a lot of people will not be in that position. So I ask all the senators to think and use their consciencesâwhich they would do in all cases, but I ask them to do so in this case in particularâas to whether it is right that these things will be taken out before we replace them with something else? I say the answer is no, and I encourage senators to vote with me on this issue and vote for the Family First amendment.</para>

<para>âCan I indicate the oppositionâs attitude to this. This amendment demonstrates one of the agendas at the heart of the governmentâs billâthat is, the governmentâs desire to ensure that employees in this country can be required to take a job on the basis that they have no entitlement to overtime, no entitlement to penalty rates, no entitlement to shift allowances and no entitlement to rest breaks. So, for all the rhetoric on the other side about this being about choice, under the governmentâs legislation a new employee can be given an AWA that has a single clause in it that says, âYour hourly rate contemplates all of these things: penalty rates, overtime, shift allowances, et cetera.â And you do not have to get anything other than the minimum applicable wage. So you give away all the rights and entitlements that Australian employees currently have, and what do you get for it? You get the minimum wage.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am sure the government will vote against this amendment. This amendment shows the governmentâs real agendaâthat is, to reduce the wages and rights of working Australians. It is quite clear under this legislation that new employees can simply be given an AWAâtake it or leave itâremoving all rights to overtime, penalty rates, shift allowances and rest breaks. Frankly, we on this side find it extraordinary that the government is taking this position. We find it is amazing that the government has the gall to say that this is about choice and that the Fair Pay Commission is about fair pay, when the government does not want to have any reference to fair minimum wages in the bill.</para>
<para>We think that Senator Fieldingâs amendment goes part way in dealing with the issues, and on that basis the opposition will support it. But we are fundamentally opposed to a situation where, under the guise of choice, this government puts in place a set of policies which ensure that Australian workers are no longer guaranteed access to overtime, penalty rates, shift allowances and rest breaks. That is what this legislation does.</para>
<para>I just want to make one point that I think I made briefly yesterday. It is not just new employeesâalthough that is bad enough because I think one in five Australian workers change jobs every year. One in five workers every year can be presented with this AWA removing overtime, penalty rates and shift allowances. If you are under a collective agreement or an AWA, provisions under the governmentâs legislation allow the employer to unilaterally terminate the agreement 90 days after the agreementâs technical expiry date. So, at that point, the employer can simply unilaterally terminate an existing collective agreement or an AWA of an employee, even if the agreement talks about a higher rate of pay or additional penalty rates or has some other arrangement in place. All the arrangements can be removed, and the employee falls back to the four minimum standards plus the ordinary hourly rate of pay.</para>
<para>Senator Fieldingâs amendment goes some way in trying to insert a modicum of fairness into the governmentâs bill, but it does not change the character of the legislation, which is that the wage floor in this country will be dropped below the awards to the ordinary hourly rate and the four minimum conditions. That is now the new minimum. That does not include overtime, penalty rates and shift allowances. While we will support Senator Fieldingâs amendment, I just want to make it clear: we do not think it goes far enough, because in this country we should have a fair set of minimum wages and conditions that all Australians are entitled to and for which they do not have to beg. Australians should not be put in the position of having to trade those things away for nothingâwhich is the governmentâs positionâin order to get or keep a job.</para>

<para>âI want to briefly speak again about the problems for new migrants to this country: people who are desperately looking for a job, whose English is very poor and who do not understand the nature of our industrial relations system. I think these people are most vulnerable to signing away their rights to penalties, shift rates and rest breaks, because they simply do not understand that these areâcurrently, anywayâthe norm for workers in Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am concerned that there does not appear to be a provision in the governmentâs legislation to ensure that employers provide adequate translation and protection for workers whose English skills may not be that good, to inform them of their rights and ensure that they do not sign workplace agreements without fully understanding not only what they are signingâit might be easy enough to get a translationâbut also what the normal conditions are for workers in Australia.</para>
<para>Migrants coming into this country often go into casual short-term employment. They are already vulnerable to exploitation on those grounds. They often go into areas, initially at least, like fruit picking and taxi driving, which are often high-turnover jobs for which employers are not looking to have long-term loyal employees. Employers probably know that these employees are going to go on to other jobs. But, even if these employees do go on to better jobs, that is no reason that even in the short-term they and their families should be exploited by lower wages and worse conditions than the rest of the work force. I certainly support the Family First amendment on the basis that it might give some relief. I oppose the whole of the governmentâs legislation, and one basis for that is that I think migrant employees and people with poor English are not adequately protected under the legislation.</para>

<para>âThe government opposes the Family First amendment. I understand there are some technical difficulties with it, but I will not bother canvassing those, because even if the technical difficulties were overcome we would not be supporting the detail or sentiment of the amendment. There is within the legislation a 38-hour standard for employees. It was interesting to hear Senator Fielding acknowledge that penalty rates in fact do hinder expansion plans. He acknowledged thatâI do not think I am verballing him. What does hindering expansion plans mean? It means hindering a business from growing. What happens when a business grows? It creates new employment. To paraphrase Frank Crean, a former Treasurer of this country, one manâs pay rise is another manâs job. In the case of Senator Fieldingâs example, he is basically saying that those sorts of rates are unfortunately denying other people employment opportunities. That is the corollary of what he is saying.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We specifically do believe that there should be flexibility in the workplace. As I have had opportunity to note on numerous occasions, people like Greg Combet are on the public record about this. He was asked the question by a journalist: have you ever been involved in negotiating away penalty rates? Answer: yes. If the unions can do it because even they can see the sense in it, it seems to me that individuals should be allowed to do it as well. If you are currently under an award with penalty rates, what you have got is what you keep. In relation to new agreements, if you trade away penalty rates it has to be specifically referred to in the agreement, keeping in mind what the basic standards are.</para>
<para>We have heard once again the rhetoric that this is all about reducing wages and doing the worker in the eye. All I ask is for the Australian people to remember the 9Â½ years of the Howard government, which have seen unemployment plummet. Unemployment has gone right down but it is still not low enough. We have also delivered real wage increases that Labor could have only ever dreamt of, in a time of the lowest rate of industrial disputation ever. I think we have got the employment trifecta pretty well spot-on with those sorts of results.</para>
<para>But there is not too much self-congratulation by the government on this side. We believe we need to go further. We had a bit of to-and-fro just before lunch as to why, if things are going so well, we need to change the system. I used the analogy yesterday that it is like an athlete who is absolutely at his physical peak. He is absolutely fit. Why should he bother training again? Why should he maintain that fitness? The first day he will not notice any difference. Chances are that the first week and the first month he will not notice any deterioration in his performance. But ultimately he will become less competitive. Similarly, with the Australian economy, if we believe the mantra of Mr Beazley that the industrial relations lemon is squeezed dry, that there is no need for reform and that everything that possibly can be done has been done, we are like the foolish athlete that says, âI am completely physically fit therefore there is no reason to maintain my fitness regime.â The economy needs to maintain a reform regime to ensure that those that are currently out of employment are given the opportunity of employment. The last 10 years of reform have seen unemployment plummet from one million to 500,000. We would like to see more reform to drive down that figure even further so that those in this country that are socially and economically repressed have the capacity to engage in the wealth that will be available if we free things up and make it flexible for the benefit of all.</para>

<para>âI will try to be brief because, as I indicated earlier, the opposition want to try to get on to the unfair dismissal provisions which dramatically reduce the rights of Australian workers. I have tried to be brief in my contributions this afternoon in order to facilitate that debate, but I think some of the misinformation that Senator Abetz has put on the record really needs correcting. It is a tired old tape that the minister keeps running every time the issue of penalty rates is mentioned. He has done it in question time over and over again; it is like he only has one answer and he just puts it in a tape recorder and presses the button. The fact is that, if there are agreements where penalty rates have been negotiated away, they have been done on the basis that workers are not disadvantaged overall. That is for two reasons. One is the statutory no disadvantage test which this government is removing. The second is that, if a union agreement is in place, you are seeking agreement to improve the position of employees.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The agreements where you have had penalty rate negotiations occur in the context of a statutory framework that ensures Australian workers are not disadvantaged overall. That is what the no disadvantage test connected to the awards does. What this government is removing is that test and the pre-eminence of awards as the wage and conditions floor in this country. Let no-one be under the misapprehension that this is business as usual. This is a fundamental change to the way in which entitlements, wages, conditions and rights in this country are regulated. What this government is saying is that these things can be traded away for nothing. That does not exist under the current system. The government is saying: âThese things can be traded away for nothing because we are removing the no disadvantage test and we are removing awards as the basis on which fairness and disadvantage are assessed.â The only things against which these issues will be assessed are the four minimum conditions and the minimum hourly rate.</para>
<para>I do not want anyone to be under the misapprehension that what the minister says is correctâthat somehow, because penalties have been the subject of negotiation before, this is no different. This is a fundamentally different system. It is a fundamentally different system that does not ensure that workers will not be disadvantaged. I do not want to spend too long having a discussion about economic argument and the rather strange reference to male athletesâI will leave it to the ministerâs mind if he wants to focus on athletesâbut I want to make this point. It is extraordinary that this government comes into this chamber and says: âWe have to do this for the economy; we have to be competitive.â As I said earlier today, it is quite clear that âcompetitiveâ means competition in terms of wages and a race to the bottom. That is what competitive means.</para>
<para>This government has turned away 270,000âI think that is the number; I could be wrongâyoung people from TAFE over the life of this government at a time when we have a massive and significant skills shortage, of which the government has been aware. And yet you come into this chamber and lecture us and, through this chamber, lecture the Australian workers about competitiveness when you are doing so little to ensure that our people, Australians, have the skills that they need to take our economy forward and to ensure productivity growth into this century. What you are saying to Australian workers is: âNo, we want you to be competitiveâthat is, we want your wages to drop.â You talk about disincentives. What you are saying is that you want to remove penalty rates because you want to ensure that the employers get what they want. We know that employers want this because they made this submission to the Senate inquiry. They think penalty rates are a fetter on the system; they are a disincentive. They think they are too high and they want to be able to negotiate them away.</para>
<para>I want to go back to something the Prime Minister said, so that we understand how long his agenda has been around and exactly what the agenda is. In October 1992, at the launch of the coalitionâs IR policy, the Prime Minister, who I think was then the shadow minister for industrial relations, saidâand I will quote this because I think it is clear from this what the agenda still is:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Iâve frequently said as Iâve gone around Australia ... talking about this policy that if we really want to modernise the Australian economy, if we really want to internationalise the work practices of Australia, if we really want to make the Australian workplace competitive with the rest of the world we have to embrace a very important principle, and that is if somebody makes a capital investment in this country they ought to be able to run that capital investment 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year without penalty as to the time of the day or night they run that investment.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is absolutely clear and on the public record what this legislation is. It is delivering exactly the commitment that the Prime Minister made when he was a shadow minister in relation to the removal of penalty rates.</para>

<para>âI would also like to put on the record our support for the amendments because they do go some way to address some of the glaring holes in this legislation. Business organisations that came before the Senate committee were quite clear, as has already been articulated, in their desire to see minimum wages drop. They were quite clear that it would help their businesses. Let us make no mistake: that is what this is about. We have also heard plenty of evidence to indicate that people do need overtime and penalty rates. They help top up wages for the low paid in this country. Study after study shows the impact that taking away penalty rates and overtime rates will have, particularly on young people and on women.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I will take a little moment to consider thatâthat is, the issue that women have done better recently. I agree with Senator Murray that these changes will take that away. The evidence in Western Australia is quite clear in relation to what happened in the 1990s. The gender pay gap widened through these types of reforms in the west in the 1990s. This provision will help redress some of those problems in this bill. We support these amendments.</para>

<para>âWhat we have from those opposite yet again is the telling of half the story. Is the no disadvantage test being removed? Answer: yes. What is it being replaced by? Legislated minimum standards that have not been in legislation beforeâlegislation such as 10 days personal leave or sick leave, which is a greater amount of sick leave or personal leave than currently exists in some awards. Of course, we have done that on the say-so of the employers, if you listen to the nonsense from those opposite. Can I tell you, there was no business group that I am aware of that told the government: âMake sure you ramp up personal leave to 10 days and then make sure it canât be traded away.â Which employer group made that suggestion to the government? Not a single one.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>You see, we as a government are not beholden to one group within the community. We listen to both sides. Unlike those opposite, who only take the one approach, we can listen to both the workers and the employers and then strike a balance down the middle. Indeed, when we came out with these reforms, the industry groups condemned us for not going far enough and the trade unions condemned us for going too far, which placed us as a government very comfortably in the middle. That is where we still are today.</para>
<para>So when those opposite and the trade union movement tell workers that âthey have removed the no disadvantage testâ, be honest and tell them that, in exchange, the workers of this country are being guaranteed 10 days personal leave that cannot be traded away. Currently under this much vaunted no disadvantage test, do you know what? Every single sick day can be traded away. We do not think that that is good enough. We believe that, for the family unit and for the social structure of our society, that should be kept apart from the negotiating table. Where is the recognition for that on behalf of the workers of Australia? If there was some balance in the views of the ACTU, they would at least say, âWeâve got to give the government a tick for that because they have gone even further than what we have been able to achieve.â But, no, their politics always come before the needs of workers.</para>
<para>What is another thing that we have legislated and protected by law? Currently under this much vaunted no disadvantage test, you can trade away every single day of your annual leave. What sort of quality time can you haveâand this is what those opposite allegedly are concerned aboutâwith your family if you can trade away every single day of your annual leave? None. As a resultâand it was not because of an employer group lobbying us, I can tell youâwe struck a balance in saying: âYou can only trade away 14 days of your annual leave. The rest will be kept safe and you cannot trade it away.â That is protected by law.</para>
<para>Do we hear the trade union movement saying: âWell done. Youâve really gone further than we have been able toâ? No, because no matter what this government does it will never be good enough because we do not adopt the trade union agenda holus-bolus. We accept some of it and we accept some of the employersâ, and we go down the middle. I suppose that that is why in this debate, to a certain extent, we do not have all that many friends because we have not delivered for either of the big groups, but we are looking after the vast majority of workers, to whom I referred to earlier in this debate as âour matesâ, and we are delivering for them.</para>
<para>With regard to this silly argument about the no disadvantage test being knocked out, that is true. But be honest and say that it is being replaced with something else that will guarantee workersâ rights. It is just like the sterile argument we have been having that the word âfairâ is being taken out of the principal object of the act; therefore, that shows the government is wanting to be unfair. It is true that we have taken the word âfairâ out but be honest and say that the word âharmoniousâ has, for the first time ever, been put into the principal object of the legislation. If workers hear that they will ask: âWhatâs the difference between fair and harmonious?â If you want a harmonious workplace, guess what? Chances are you need to have fairness in it to make it harmonious. So each time those opposite rise to make a point that the government has taken something out, I say to the Australian people: do not be deceived; ask the question: what is it being replaced by? When you observe what we are replacing the things with, you will see that it is a very fair and very balanced package.</para>
<para>We were told that there is a skills shortage in this country. Once again, that is quite right; there is a skills shortage in this country. But the Australian workers would prefer a skills shortage, as there is under us, to the huge skills surplus that there was under Labor when one million of our fellow Australians were on the social scrap heap of unemployment. Sure, having a skills shortage is not a good thing for this country but those who delivered this country a skills surplus are hardly in a position to condemn us for having created so many job opportunities in this country that we now suffer a skills shortage. Sure it is something we are working to overcome. We need to overcome it. But take the tip: if you were to take a poll and ask, âWould you prefer the Labor Partyâs one million unemployed and a skills surplus or would you prefer a low unemployment rate with a skills shortage?â I reckon they might go for the lower unemployment rate and the skills shortage.</para>

<para>âThank you, Senator Nashâbusiness. What a novel idea. So if businesses create jobs and we help businesses, guess whatâwe might create a bigger employment environment. As a result, more Australians come off unemployment and into employment, which we know is the best social security system that any government can ever deliver. An individualâs own job allows them to maintain and sustain themselves and their family unit. It allows them to engage in the mainstream of society, and that is what we want, that is what we are pursuing.</para>

<para>Once again, our record, the pay packets of Australian workers, speaks so much louder than the propaganda of those from the other side who, for the past 10 years, have been making these allegations against the Howard government, all of which have been proven to be false. They repeat the same mantra, exactly the same words, in relation to these reforms as they did with our past reforms on waterfront, on tax and on industrial relations. All those prophecies of doom have been shown to be false prophecies, so I have every trust and belief that their prophecies of doom on this occasion, in all the same language, will also be shown to be false prophecies.</para>

<para>âI will remind my fellow senators what this vote is going to be on. It is about whether you actually want to see every Australian still having overtime and penalty rates guaranteed as basically a minimum. The Family First amendment is about making sure that that is there. If people want to trade that away, there have to be some comparable terms. This is very important. This vote is about ensuring that those people who are relying on overtime do not have to try and bargain for it back because their employer can legally take it away.</para>

<para>âI will very briefly respond to Senator Hurley in relation to migrant workers. I finally found the proposed section, 83BB(2). It says that the Office of the Employment Advocate will explain the contents of agreements to employees, taking into account the circumstances of particular employees, including persons from non-English speaking backgrounds and young persons. It says:</para>

<para>âI move Family First Party amendment (16) on sheet 4744 revised:</para>

<amendments>
<amendment>
<para class="ParlAmend">(16)Â  Schedule 1, item 72, page 341 (line 17), at the end of paragraph 170AB(c), add â, provided that any provision in an award, workplace agreement or industrial agreement is at least comparable to the entitlement provided for in section 170AAâ.</para>
</amendment>
</amendments>
<para class="block">The amendment is in regard to guaranteeing meal breaks. It is an important issue but, due to time, I want to keep my remarks fairly simple and straightforward. The bill that we are considering currently has, at 170AA:</para>
<quote>
<para>An employer must not require an employee to work for more than 5 hours continuously without an unpaid interval of at least 30 minutes for a meal.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">But at 170AB, âDisplacement of entitlement to meal breaksâ, it says quite clearly, at paragraph (b), that this does not apply where âa workplace agreementâ operates. This means that, all of a sudden, meal breaks are not guaranteed for all Australian workers. The Family First amendment is quite clear. It adds another line that says that the meal break provision does not apply:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">â¦ provided that any provision in an award, workplace agreement or industrial agreement is at least comparable to the entitlement provided for ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words, if someone is going to try to take away the meal break, it has to be comparable in some terms. This is very important from a health and safety point of view. People should not have to work without a meal break, and in Australia we should be guaranteeing that for all workers, not just for some who will eventually be able to bargain for them.</para>

But I want to take the opportunity at this point to ask the minister the question that I asked him at estimates which he indicated he would take on board or refer to the department. That was the one about where there is a dispute between an employer and employeeâa difference over hours of work or over having a meal break. What provisions are there in the bill to enable that issue to be resolved?</para>

<para>âI would have to check the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record as to whether that matter was taken up during Senate estimates. The officials do not recall that. But, either way, the question of course stands in its own right. As I understand the situation, the hours of work, meal breaks and whatever will be dealt with under the regime of dispute resolution that is set out in the legislation. I think we canvassed aspects of that during the estimates and also yesterday, I think it may have been. So, unless there is a specific question as a follow-up from that, it would be under the dispute resolution mechanisms of the legislation.</para>

<para>âIt was, I can assure you, raised at estimates; Mr Cully was the officer who specifically addressed the issue. The information I was given at estimates was that it would take two weeks to go through the model dispute-settling procedure in order to have the issue resolved. That seemed to be an issue of some conflict, given that you may well have a worker told on a Friday to change their shifts for the following week, yet they cannot resolve any difference they might have with the employer for at least a fortnight. Similarly, with the issue raised by Senator Fielding, if it is a dispute over whether or not a person should have a meal break, it seems incongruous that you would have to wait a fortnight to go through a model dispute-settling procedure in order to have that matter resolved.</para>

<para>âIn relation to the 14-day time period, I understand that was indicated to you in the event that the employee and employer cannot agree on somebody to arbitrate, determine or resolve under the model dispute resolution proceedings. If they cannot agree on a person to undertake that task for them then you move to the next system, and that would possibly take 14 days. In fairness, I am not sure that these matters are necessarily resolved under the current system any more expeditiously. If these sorts of disputes do ariseâand one would hope they would notâit would involve the dispute resolution system that is under the act. I do not think there is any evidence or suggestion that the current regime of resolving disputes about meal breaks et cetera would necessarily be any quicker than that which is being proposed. The other thing is that potentially, should somebody be so interested, if somebody were to refuse to work or were required to work, injunctions could be obtained.</para>

<para>âYou go to the Federal Court for injunctions under the dispute resolution mechanism, which on my advice is just as timely as it currently is under the present regime. So, whilst there might be some mirth in the gallery, that is the way it is and not much will change in relation to that.

<para>âIf it were to escalate to that level, a workplace inspector could take that matter on for you. That position is taxpayer funded. One would hope these matters would be resolved without the need for dispute resolution in that sort of forum but, if it does escalate to that situation, it begs the question: what happens now if there is a dispute about hours et cetera and the employer and employee cannot work it out? Where does it go? How long does it take? Whilst we will be having different regimes, nobody has asserted that this method that we are suggesting will take longer than the current system does. I know why they do not make that assertionâthat is, because it will not be.</para>

<para>âMinister, I enlighten you to the fact that you will find that most awards provide for a time period within which a person might have to change shifts. In other words, there is a period of notice before people have to engage in shift changes. I have one final question with respect to this matter. If I have a dispute with my employer today about whether or not I should change shifts on Monday and I refuse to change that shift pending the settlement of the dispute, can I be terminated for refusing to change that shift?

<para>âWhilst we have a break, I wonder if I could seek leave to have a procedural matter resolved. I can see that we are going to come up hard against the 4.30 pm guillotine time. The government amendments, along with everybody elseâs amendments, will then be put sequentially at that time. I understand that process. The government amendments are accompanied by a supplementary explanatory memorandum. I have notes to my amendments and my request to the chamber is that I be allowed to incorporate those notes for those amendments which are dealt with at the 4.30 pm cut-off time.</para>

<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Hours workedâItems 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 57A</inline>
</para>
<para>Because the Government have chosen to undermine the award system and only mandate 5 minimum standards as and conditions, the issue of working hours has become a contentious one. Awards have in them protections that prevent unreasonable hours being made of an employee i.e. when workers can be rostered, number of hours you can work in a single day or shift, if there are split shifts certain amount of break, and casuals canât come in for only 1 hours. This Bill will sweep away protections and will only leave a bear figure for number of hours worked.</para>
<para>Â I note that the Government in their 98 pages of amendments have attempted to address this situation, but I note that there will still be a capacity to make agreements which average hours over a period of time which will permit considerable flexibility for employers.</para>
<para>There remains no general protection against being asked to work to unreasonable hoursâ¦. Protection only cut in under the Bill when we move into additional hours. It doesnât address reality of employees being asked to work too many hours in a day to few or being called in for multiple shifts.</para>
<para>Democrats items 21, 22, 24, 25, 26 will prevent workers being asked to work unreasonable hours.</para>
<para>The critical provision is at item 26 which attempts to amend subdivision B 91C by outlining what is meant by unreasonable hours</para>

</para>
<para>Most awards provide for some leave to be taken in a block, they vary but some preserve the weeks, some 2 weeks, and some say leave can be taken in a maximum of 3 periods.Â  Until this year the maximum number of days that could be taken as single days in the overwhelming majority of awards was 5.Â </para>
<para>In the Family Provisions Test Case the AIRC rejected an application by ACCI to allow all annual leave to be taken in single days, saying that some leave should be preserved for rest and recreation. The Commission increased the number for single days from 5 days to 10 days.Â </para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Discriminationâ28, 30, 49</inline>
</para>
<para>Items 28 and 30âdeals with discrimination in the Bill of same sex couples with respect to personal leave and parental leave. This issue was raised by a number of submissions to the inquiry into this Bill including the Human Rights and equal Opportunity Commission. They noted that some state regimes had such provisions. The Government continues to refuse to recognise same sex couples in law, except I note in the anti-terrorism legislation. The Democrat amendments simply delete the words opposite sex from the definition of defector spouse.</para>
<para>Item 49âdeals with prohibited matters in agreements. This has been a contentious issueâwhat should be in an agreement between and employee and an employerâTo date the courts have generally determined this issue. Division 7 Subdivision B of the Bill, among other things, gives the minister the power through regulation to intervene in the content of agreements. I note that the power to intervene in agreement making goes against the governments stated objective, and all principles of contract law, that the parties should be free to reach agreements that meet their need, subject only to proper minimum standards.</para>
<para>The Democrats amendment deletes this Subdivision and replaces it with minimum standards that relate to discrimination.</para>

<para>The Democrats believe that women and employees trying to balance work and family will be hardest hit by the Governments proposed industrial relations changes.</para>
<para>Workers with family responsibilities need job security; predictable common family time; protection from excessive hours; and, flexibility.

<inline font-weight="bold">43, 44, 45, 46, 47 (no disadvantage test), 51, 52,</inline>
</para>
<para>In the Democrats opinion the most offensive aspect of this Bill is the Governmentâs deliberate attack on the safety net that has been built up over more than 100 years of industrial law.</para>
<para>The Democrats believe that as a result of the dismantling of the safety net the Bill will have a detrimental impact on vulnerable or disadvantaged employees and jobseekers and that rather than fair, this Bill is profoundly unfair.</para>
<para>I will start will Item 47. This amendment will re-insert the no disadvantage test as the safety net for bargaining. The Democrats believe that one of the worst proposed changes in the Bill is the abolition of the no disadvantage test, which the Democrats insisted be put in when negotiating the 1996 Workplace Relations Act.</para>
<para>The Work Choices Bill reduces the safety net in three major waysâby severing the connection between agreements and awards over time, by reducing the conditions that agreements reference to from at least 20 (more in the state systems) to 5, and by removing the no disadvantage test. The Bill replaces the no disadvantage test based on the award system which has 20 allowable matters, with five minimum conditions.</para>
<para>The abolition of the no disadvantage test undermines the Democrats support for AWAs. As all in the Chamber know the Democrats supported the introduction of AWAs in 1996, but we only did so at the insistence that a no disadvantage test based on awards would underpin and would serve to protect workers.</para>

</list>
<para>Item 51 is an important amendment because it amends the Bill to enable the award to be the default if an employer terminates an agreement. This Item is particularly important given that this Bill will enable employers, if they choose, to easily revert to the 5 minimum standards and conditions.</para>
<para>Items 42 and 43 will oblige the OEA to scrutinise agreements to ensure genuine consent (i.e. that the employees have agreed) and ensure the agreement meets the minimum standards, including the no disadvantage test inserted in item 47. The amendment doesnât prevent the agreement coming in to operation even if it breaches the no disadvantage test, but does provide that any shortfall must be made up. It is not dissimilar to the existing arrangement for new starters on AWAs.</para>
<para>Item 40 aims to place all workers representatives on an equal footing. The Bill provides that a bargaining agent representing an employee in an AWA must be recognised by the employer, whereas a bargaining agent representing employees in an employee collective agreement must be given the opportunity to meet and confer.Â </para>
<para>There is no obligation in relation to unions seeking to represent members. This proposed amendment would provide that any properly authorised representative must be recognised.Â </para>
<para>To ensure a union is authorised the amendment provides for two avenues. The employer can voluntarily recognise the union (that has 1 member and coverage) or the employer can give the employees the opportunity to decide.Â </para>
<para>The amendment borrows from the Bill in that the threshold for triggering a test of the representative nature of the union is the same threshold proposed to trigger a test is the threshold that triggers a pre strike ballot The amendment also borrows from the Bill in that the method of testing whether the union has the support of the majority of employees is the same as is used to test whether a collective agreement is supported by the employees to be covered by it.</para>
<para>The amendment is similar to the regime in the UK, and not dissimilar to the USA and Canada. It doesnât compel and employer to reach a collective agreement, but does prohibit an employer form refusing to recognised a union once the union is authorised by a majority of employees.</para>
<para>Item 44 and 45 also aim to put all agreements on an equal footing. Under ILO C 98 there is an obligation to promote collective bargaining. However this Bill promotes AWAs, by permitting these to override collective agreements at any time. This amendment would place all agreements on an equal footing, and therefore reaffirms the governments stated view that it is neutral on the type of agreement.</para>
<para>Item 46 simply re-inserts the current requirement that all workplace agreements include anti-discrimination provisions, as part of dispute settlement procedures.</para>
<para>Item 41 will ensure the information provided to employees takes into account their literacy etc.Â  Employers are currently obliged to do this and this amendment will simply retain an existing obligation. In light of the ability of employees top waive ready access, this is simple equity measure.</para>
<para>Given that it is unlikely that the Government will support our amendment to reinstate the no-disadvantage test, Democrat amendment 52 aims to protect vulnerable and disadvantage workers and jobseekers who have no or little bargaining power, by legislating that if an employer requires the employee to make an AWA with the employer as a condition of employment, this is considered duress!</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreement making/genuine bargainingâ39, 48, 50, 53, 54, 70, 71</inline>
</para>
<para>This group of amendments attempt to again take the edge off this Bill, to omit some of the more offensive provisions with respect to agreement making, and ensure that bargaining is actually done in good faith.</para>
<para>Item 48âThis amendment simply allows employees and employers to incorporate award or agreement terms into a new agreement. This is consistent with current practice. It will promote less formal bargaining between the parties at the workplace, which otherwise, because agreements oust the operation of the awards, will be more legalistic and formal, as parties need to make comprehensive agreements</para>
<para>Item 39 deletes the Governmentâs 96C that allows employers to make an agreement with themselves. Obviously the word is a tautology because it is hardly an agreement if it is made with yourself. This is absolute nonsense. Evidence to the inquiry into this Bill suggested that this provision could also be used by employers who want to escape their current agreement arrangements. They could do this by restructuring or starting a new business, and establishing a new employer Greenfield agreement.Â </para>
<para>Item 50 opposes section 103L of the Bill that permits unilateral termination of agreements after 90 days. Upon termination employeesâ conditions will revert to the 5 minimum conditions and standards. Our item 51 previously moved would have at least meant that the default would have been the award. This provision hands the employer significant bargaining power. I note that the Government are amending this provision to make it clear that the notice of termination of an agreement can only be given after the nominal expiry date for unilateral termination on 90 days notice. This is a slight improvement, but does not ameliorate in anyway that this provision gives the employer significant bargaining power.</para>
<para>Item 53 simply inserts in 150D of the Bill 2 clauses that provide civil penalties for failure to recognise authorised union.</para>
<para>Item 54 amends slightly the Governmentâs provisions to exclude pattern bargaining. I just want to say briefly that we do not believe that enterprise bargaining is necessarily at odds with industry-wide or sector-wide negotiations. Awards specifically require a federal or statewide view to be taken. In our view, public sector wages and conditions for professions like nursing generally benefit from commonality. Sector-wide collective agreements and enterprise collective agreements are not mutually exclusive, and nor are multi-employer site or sector agreements necessarily at odds with efficient and effective industrial outcomes. In some cases, both employers and employees see benefits in having an industry or sectoral standard in mind as they approach bargaining at an enterprise level. Indeed, the federal government itself bargains in a whole-of-government manner in the context of their âPolicy Parametersâ that shape bargaining in the public sector and give it a comparable character across different government agencies.</para>
<para>The amendment does 2 things, it importantly inserts exemption into pattern bargaining if workers are seeking equal pay for work of equal value and it reverses the burden of proof that pattern bargaining is occurring.</para>
<para>Items 70-71 aim to insert a provision that requires employers and employees to bargain in good faith. We have moved these amendments several times before but to no avail.</para>
<para>What do we mean by bargaining in good faith? It means that there is a requirement employer and employees or negotiating parties genuinely try to reach an agreement.</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">Secret Ballotsâ55</inline>
</para>
<para>The Secret Ballot provision in this bill requires the conduct of a secret ballot by employees as a prerequisite for authorisation from the Industrial Relations Commission to take protected industrial action during enterprise bargaining negotiations. This has been a long-term policy objective of the coalition and I think it is the fourth attempt to implement this or similar provisions. If introduced in this form, it will actually make the system more rigid and less effective than the system that we currently have. Although I suspect this is the Governmentâs aim, to prevent protected action from being taken. The only precedent for this sort of law was in Western Australia. It caused immense union and political heat, it shed very little light and no beneficial outcome ever occurred. In fact, the act ended up being a dinosaur and its demise was welcomed by employers and employees alike.</para>
<para>The Democratsâ policy recognises the legitimate role of unions in protecting the interests of workers who wish to be represented by them and in moving to improve the internal democracy and accountability of unions. We believe that the Industrial Relations Commission should have sufficient powers to end industrial action and to resolve underlying issues by arbitration. We have always supported the democratic protections afforded by secret balloting processes but there is no empirical or credible evidence that an industry-wide set of somewhat complex rules such as those that are being proposed is justified.</para>
<para>When similar secret ballot provisions were before us in September 2002 I said that at the committee hearing I discovered to my great surprise that most unions do not have in their own rules secret ballot provisions for industrial action. I think that is a great omission; it is a great shame. Missing from the IR scene, therefore, is a means for union members to ask for a secret ballot to be conducted by the union at their membersâ request. The unions that were selected to appear at the hearing, which included the AMWU, said that they had absolutely no objection to secret ballot processes by a union for their union members, so axiomatically that would mean that any legislation introducing a requirement that unions should have in their rules secret ballot provisions which they would voluntarily use at what they regarded as the appropriate time would be a step forward in the proper functioning of unions in these areas.</para>
<para>The Democrat amendment seeks to delete the Governmenâs secret ballot provision and replace it with a secret ballot rule provision for unions.</para>
<para>This secret ballots proposal represents a new approach that would achieve internal union democracy and decision making rather than impose additional external hurdles to accessing protected industrial action. Under this proposal, union rules would be able to provide for a secret ballot of eligible members as part of the process for authorising protected industrial action when required, and when required by members. The members would only activate the secret ballot on request; it would not be mandated. By the way, it is not as if we have put up a great hurdle for this to happen; we have suggested that two members may be sufficient to activate the union rules approach.</para>
<para>Aside from the very minimal requirements necessary to ensure fairness and accountability in the ballot, unions would be free to determine the form of secret ballot that best suited their circumstances. There would be no prescription in relation to the method of secret ballotâattendance or postalâor calling for the ballot or the ballot question. In other words, it is up to the unions to devise what best suits them. The result is a simple requirement that will strengthen internal union decision making without mandating, limiting or delaying access to protected industrial action. On request, protected industrial action could be endorsed by secret ballot of members eligible to participate in the industrial action conducted in accordance with the rules of the union. The minimum procedural requirements for a secret ballot to authorise protective action would be that the union must advise members before the ballot as to the matters that are proposed to be dealt with, and the general nature of the proposed industrial actionâfor example, whether there are to be strikes, bans or bothâand notify members and the employer that a ballot has been conducted, along with the result of the ballot.</para>
<para>These simple procedural requirements are intended to ensure that members have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the vote, to understand the industrial action they are being asked to endorse and to be informed of the result of the ballot. These requirements should be able to be easily integrated into unionsâ existing practices for approving industrial action. For example, I understand that most unions currently provide some notice to members of any meeting that may consider industrial action. There would be no prescribed quorum, although unions could choose to set a quorum through their rules. Each secret ballot should be able to authorise protected industrial action for a reasonable period. To ensure certainty in relation to access to protected action, a ballot would be valid in spite of any technical breaches in processes that were done in good faith. This measure implements the policy achieved by privative clausesâa clause which prevents review in the current billâwhich limit challenges in the courts to the ballot process and ballot result on technical grounds. Members would, of course, have the right to challenge any material breach of the rules, but provided the breach was technical and was done in good faith it would not jeopardise the protected status of the industrial action.</para>
<para>Unions would be required to modify their rules to provide for secret ballots to authorise industrial action within nine months of the bill being passed. To assist in this regard model rules would be developed. That is an important point: model rules would be developed in the absence of rules by the unionsâin other words, by an industrial relations commission but with submissions that unions in whole or in part could adopt. Any union that failed to introduce the required rules in the prescribed period would be obliged to adopt the industrial relations commission model rules.</para>

<para>The exemption of employers with less than 100 employees from unfair dismissal laws, coupled with the loss of the no disadvantage test and push towards individual agreements will further exacerbate the situation for disadvantaged employees and jobseekers.</para>
<para>The Government has on 12 occasions attempted to amend the 1996 Act or related regulations to exempt all employees in workplaces of less than 20 employees from unfair dismissal rights. Now they have arbitrarily increased the number to 100.</para>
<para>The Democrats have, on human right grounds, opposed unfair dismissal provisions so many times in this chamber I am losing count. There is absolutely no evidence that exempting unfair dismissal laws will increase employment.</para>
<para>We have over 10 million employed, 1.7 million jobs have been created this decade, and there are only 15 000 unfair dismissal applications under the state and federal unfair dismissal regimes. Those 15 000 would reduce by a third if lax state systems were replaced by the tight federal system.</para>
<para>The most comprehensive research undertaken to date by Senior Lecturer Paul Oslington and PhD student Benoit Freyens at the University of NSW School of Business found that ending unfair dismissal laws for employers with fewer than 100 employees would create only 6,000 jobs, not the 77,000 claimed by the Howard Government.</para>
<para>The experiment under Queensland State laws, when the then Coalition government introduced an exemption for small business, had no effect on job creation.</para>
<para>In the 2001 Hamzy case the expert witness for the Federal Government, Professor Mark Wooden, agreed with the statement that âthe existence or non-existence of unfair dismissal legislation has very little to do with the growth of employment and that it is dictated by economic factors.â</para>
<para>We acknowledge that there have been concerns that employers, especially small business employers pay âgo awayâ money for cases that are frivolous and vexatious, because the cost (time and money) of going to the commission is potentially greater then the âgo awayâ money. The Democrats are not opposed to the Commission therefore having vexatious and frivolous claims dealt with on paper. This is far superior than taking away employees rights to challenge their dismissal.</para>
<para>The Democrats amendments therefore oppose the unfair dismissal provisions and insert vexatious and frivolous provisions in its place.</para>

<para>There has been concern that large businesses may benefit from the exemption simply by dividing their workforces between related entities who each engage less than 100 employees.</para>
<para>Democrats amendments 61 and 62 address this issue by treating multiple employer sites as one site.</para>
<para>The amendment does this by stating that employers are taken to be related if:</para>
<list type="lowerroman">

</item>
</list>
<para>I note the Government have a similar amendment at item 164 on sheet PN271, however this amendment fails for 2 reasons. Firstly because it refers only to the corporations Act it will not cover un-incorporated companies in Victoria and the Territories that are covered by this act and secondly it will not cover companies that restructure through partnerships, joint ventures, projects, or as labor supply.</para>
<para>Our amendment captures all those groups.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Group 3 items 59, 64, 68âtermination for operation reasons restoring current Act</inline>
</para>
<para>There has been a lot of concern raised about the Bills new provisions relating to termination for operational reasons. The concern being that these provisions will enable firms of 100 employees or more use the new operational provisions to dismiss employees. We have heard several times professor Petz now famous chewing gum analogy, but I will repeat it here again to make the point</para>
<para>If you are a firm with fewer than 100 employees, then you can be sacked for any reason whatsoever unless it is an unlawful termination. Unlawful termination relates to discrimination. Chewing gum is not a discriminatory reason covered by the unlawful termination provisions. Therefore, if you are in a firm with fewer than 100 employees, you could be sacked for chewing gum. I am not saying that an employer would sack you for chewing gum; I am saying what is possible. In firms with more than 100 employeesâwhere operational reasons applyâif you are precluded from making a claim because of what the bill defines as operational reasons, then it does not matter what other aspects of your dismissal were relevant to your dismissal. You cannot make a claim. So if the employer is able to create a situation in which you are covered by economic, structural, technical or similar reasons for dismissal as part of the reason for dismissal, then you can be dismissed.</para>
<para>The Australian Federation of Disability organisations also raised concerns about the effect of the provisions on people with disabilities, who could be more easily dismissed on the basis of âoperational requirementsâ. AFDO expressed concerned at that employersâ ability to use âoperational requirementsâ as a cover-all for dismissal may lead to a sharp increase in the dismissal of people with disability, particularly those who acquire their impairment while in the workforce.</para>
<para>The Democrat amendments 59, 64, and 68 deleted the offence provisions and would restore the status quo.Â </para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Group 4 items 60, 65, 66âtermination for operation reasonsâ(take out âincludesâ)</inline>
</para>
<para>Given that the Government did not support Democrat amendments 59, 64, and 68, I will now move items 60, 65, and 66 leaves the provisions in the Bill, but attempt to knock off the most offending bit.</para>
<para>These amendments in three places omit âemployeeâs employment was terminated for genuine operational reasons or for reasons that include genuine operational reasonsâ, substitute âemployee was made redundant for genuine operational reasonsâ.</para>
<para>The term âredundancyâ has a well-understood connotation, most famously captured by Chief Justice Bray of the SA Supreme Court. He said that redundancy occurs âbecause the employer no longer wishes the job the employee has been doing to be done by anyoneâ. This is distinguished from a dismissal for reasons which are entirely personal to the worker, and where the worker is replaced by someone else in the same job.</para>
<para>The insertion of the term âredundantâ then is meant to confirm what I believe to have been the original intent behind the phrase âgenuine operational reasonsâ and its associated definition, that is, to cover situations where an employer decides to get rid of a position, and as a consequences dismisses (âmakes redundantâ) the employee in that position.</para>
<para>What this would eliminate is the possibility of an employer seeking to rely on a broad interpretation of the âoperational reasonsâ exemption to cover any type of dismissal, including one which is nothing to do with redundancy but entirely personal to the worker. An employer might, for instance, have dismissed a worker for allegedly poor performance and then replaced them. They could argue that one reason for the dismissal was that the worker was not as productive as they might have been, that this was impacting on the performance of the business, and hence constituted an âeconomicâ reason.Â If the âoperational reasonsâ exemption were interpreted that broadly, every dismissal could be brought within it.</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">Dispute resolution procedureâ69</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">As outlined in the ACTU submission to the inquiry into this Bill the proposed Part VII provides for how disputes are handled. It provides that disputes about the application of the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard; the application of awards; the application of agreements where the agreement doesnât otherwise provide; workplace determinations; and some of the minimum entitlements in Part VIA (meal breaks and parental leave) cannot be referred to arbitration. The AIRC cannot compel a person to do anything; arbitrate; determine rights or obligations; make awards or orders; or appoint a board of reference. It cannot do these things even if the parties agree. The AIRC can only make a recommendation at the partiesâ request.</para>
<para>The Part also removes any effective role for the AIRC in facilitating the making of agreements. It cannot make orders, or compel a person to do anything. It may only make a recommendation if the parties request that it do so. It is at best a process for attempting to resolve disputes.</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">Right of entryâ72, 73</inline>
</para>
<para>The Governmentâs right of entry provisions implement almost identical amendments Workplace Relations Amendment (Right of Entry) Bill 2004.</para>
<para>It is fair to say that this Bill is most of all a reaction to the actual and perceived abuse of right of entry by a minority of union officials.Â In negotiating the passage of the WRA, the Democrats rejected the proposal of the Coalition government that right of entry, among other things, should be restricted to a written invitation. It was just not practical in all circumstances.</para>
<para>Instead the Democrats negotiated a scheme that in our view provided a sensible balance of union, employer and employee rights.</para>
<para>Professor McCallum in evidence to the 2004 Senate committee hearing into the Building and Construction Industry raised concerns about watering down the system that the Democrats negotiated:</para>
<list type="unadorned">
<item label="">
<para>What I would say about right of entry is that, under our system, it is for the arbitration inspectors and the registered trade unions to have the capacity to police awards and certified agreements. I do not think that that ought to be destroyed or watered down.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>Obviously improper use of right of entry is another thing.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para>Union right of entry to workplaces for the purposes of consulting with members and those eligible to become members has been seen as fundamental to the core purpose of trade union organisation, as lawyers Shaw and Walton have observed:</para>
<para>It is plain that effective trade union organisation of employees cannot occur without access on the part of the union and its authorised representatives to workplaces in order to recruit non-unionists, to communicate with union members and take up their concerns, and to police award prescriptions and occupational health and safety requirements by inspecting the workplace</para>
<para>This bill before the Committee is another attempt to further restrict the rights of all unions with respect to right of entry, for what appears to be the purpose of preventing a relative few officials from a few unions from continuing to abuse the system.</para>
<para>These provisions will affect all unions, yet there is little evidence that a widespread problem with respect to right of entry exists. A few court cases identifying particular problems are not evidence that the system is broken, and that the whole union movement should face drastic change.</para>
<para>The provisions before us in this Bill do deviate from the Workplace Relations Amendment (Right of Entry) Bill 2004 in two important ways.</para>
<para>The 2004 Bill exempted health and safety inspectors from the requirement of a permit. The provisions in this Bill will require a permit holder who is on site for a health and safety inspection to give 24 hours notice of inspection of documents. As the ACTU pointed out this would provide an opportunity for documents to be tampered with, which is of concern if they had been a OH&amp;S breech.</para>
<para>In their submission to the inquiry into this Bill, the ACTU noted another significant effect of the Bills right of entry provisions:</para>
<para>The previous Workplace Relations Amendment (Right of Entry) Bill 2004 preserved a permit holderâs right to enter a premise where work was being carried on under an award to which the union was bound. The government introduced an amendment to exclude workplaces where all employees are on AWS on grounds that the award no longer operates.</para>
<para>The changes to the operation of awards under this Bill, whereby agreements are no longer underpinned by awards but instead oust their operation, has an impact on the scope of a right of entry. The effect is to remove the right of entry in respect of workplaces covered entirely by AWAs, employee collective agreements or the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. This would effectively exclude unions from workplaces where they are not already organised.</para>
<para>It will inhibit workers, especially those in workplaces where there are few members of the union, from accessing the information and support.</para>
<para>This provision not does not just place hurdles and barriers to entry; it excludes potentially thousands of workplaces from right of access.</para>
<para>The proposal needs to be read in conjunction with the provisions for unilateral termination of workplace agreements, that allow the employer to terminate the agreement to which the union is bound, and thus oust the operation of the award. This gives the employer the ability to not only reduce pay and conditions, but also prevent the organiser from entering the workplace during negotiations discus possible claims, and to report back on negotiations.</para>
<para>The Democrat amendment items 71 and 72 assures that employees have access to advice and information at the workplace, which is consistent with ILO C 87, when they are negotiating an agreement, by deleting the words, that restrict right of entry to premises covered only by awards or collective agreements.</para>
<para>Specifically item 71 deletes the phrase at 208(1)(c) âbeing an award, collective agreement or order that is binding on the permit holders organisationâ and 208 (2) restricting the right to investigate an AWA breech.</para>
<para>Similarly item 72 deletes 221(a) the phrase âbeing an award, collective agreement or order that is binding on the permit holders organisationâ.</para>

There will be no scrutiny of AWAs by the Employment Advocate, and no capacity for scrutiny by anyone else, and heavy penalties for any other person disclosing the content of an AWA. Given the particularly vulnerable position of these workers, they would be unlikely to ever individually disclose these conditions.</para>

<para>The Democrats have always been concerned to ensure that wherever appointments are made to the governing organ of public authorities, whether they be institutions set up by legislation, âindependentâ statutory authorities or quasi-government agencies, that the process by which these appointments are made is, and is seen to be, transparent, accountable, open and honest.</para>
<para>Amendments 10, 11, 12, 13, 17 and 18 are Democrats standard appointment on merit amendments that we are applying here to the appointment of senior members of the AFPC and the Employment Advocate.</para>
<para>These amendments are particularly critical for the Australian Fair Pay Commission because the creation of the AFPC at the expense of the AIRC has been a political one, and motivated by a desire to dampen wage increases. As has been said earlier in this debate the Government have opposed every wage increase granted by the AIRC in the last decade, the desire to interfere in minimum wage decisions is strong, and this can easily be done by the type of people appointed to the AFPC. It is therefore critical that the appointment process is transparent and that based on merit.</para>

<para>In WA the Australian Medical Association (WA) is recognized under the State Industrial Relations Act for the purpose of representing all Salaried Medical Practitioners. Currently the AMA (WA) covers all Salaried Doctors and is respondent to 2 awards and 11 agreements. Our industrial representation is very extensive and includes such areas as Country Health ServicesâNorth West Salaried Doctors, Clinical Academics, RFDS, Aboriginal Medical Services and Private Emergency Depts just to name a few. All of our State Teaching HospitalsâRPH, PMH, SCGH, KEMH and Fremantle are also covered by these agreements for both junior and senior consultant staff.</para>
<para>However as presently drafted this Bill does not cover the WA AMA. According to the AMA, unless this mater can be addressed next week the AMA (WA) will need to cease representing Salaried Doctors. The impact this will have on medical services throughout WA will be significant. WA has the worst doctor patient ratio of any state and for good measure has more overseas trained doctors per head of population than any other State. On a monthly basis our position worsens. Our state already struggles to attract and retain doctors in salaried service as the eastern seaboard offers higher wages, specialized training and greater opportunities.

Although why Senator Joyce was so concerned that a potential for few hundred or thousand employees could find themselves not protected by unfair dismissal laws because their employer restructured, when he is quite willing to support something like $4million employees working for companies with less than 100 employees, is a mystery.</para>

<para>The Democrats amendment (2) on sheet 4776 introduces a new definition of one entity, which you will find in para (b), which says that bodies are taken to be one entity if they carry on a business, project or undertaking as a joint venture or common enterprise.</para>
<para>This amendment, while still not 100% fool proof, goes someway to closing the major loophole in the governments amendment.</para>

<para>âBefore we put the question, I have a reflection to share with fellow senators. It is not a question, so I do not expect an answer to it. It saddens me that we have got down to thisâthat is, that we have to get down to a vote in the Senate on guaranteeing a meal break for all Australians because the bill does not cater for it. It does sadden me. I just ask each fellow senator to really think about it and reflect upon why we would not do that for fellow Australians.</para>

<para class="block">These amendments relate to unfair dismissal. Amendment (R12) is to remove the provision which deals with unfair dismissal for premises with fewer than 100 employees. I think the amendment is fairly obvious. It removes the protection of workers. I am sorry to use the word âfairâ again, but I think it is grossly unfair to imply that a business is small when it has fewer than 100 employees. Quite obviously this is designed to allow employers and bosses to sack anybody at will. I think it is grossly unfair to put employees in this position. It takes away employeesâ protections. I do not believe it is acceptable in this community.</para>

<para>âWe could debate that. What we are dealing with now are the sections of the bill which effectively remove the rights to unfair dismissal remedies for four million Australians. We are supportive of the Greensâ amendments to essentially take these out of the legislation. I do not recall hearing before the last election the Prime Minister telling the Australian people that he was going to deny four million Australians the right to dispute an unfair dismissal. I do not recall the government or its members coming forward and saying, âWeâre going to take existing rights, rights which have been in place for many years, from four million Australian workers.â They did talk about 20, I will agree with that, but the provisions which Senator Siewert is seeking to amend exclude anyone who works for an employer with fewer than 100 employees. There is also an exception of operational requirements which you could drive a truck through.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>This means that, for 98 per cent of Australian workplaces and 99 per cent of private employers, if you are dismissed unfairly, you do not have a remedy. I ask: how can we say in a modern Australia that if you are the 101st person on the job you have to be treated fairly but if you are the 99th person you have to be treated differently and unfairly? If you are the 101st person on the job, you can turn up to work each day knowing you have some remedy, security or recourse if you are treated unfairly, but if you are the 99th person on the job you can be treated unfairly, arbitrarily and capriciously, with no remedy.</para>
<para>The government talks about its supposed unlawful dismissal provisions which exist in the act. These are provisions which allow employees in certain circumstances to challenge their dismissal. They are highly technical and are proceedings which have to be taken to a court not a commission. Since 1996 only 147 of these claims has been referred to the Federal Court, yet we have over 50,000 unfair dismissal applications. They are expensive. We are talking tens of thousands of dollars to run one of these cases. The majority of unfair dismissal claims are conciliated by agreement between the parties.</para>
<para>It is bizarre that the government has not come clean on the limited grounds on which an employee can claim an unlawful discrimination case. Senator Marshall asked questions about this in the Senate committee and it is quite clear that you will be able to be sacked for chewing gum. For some reason, that is a reasonable reason. The unlawful provisions do not extend, for example, to protecting a person who makes an internal complaint of sexual harassment. They do cover you if you make a complaint of sexual harassment to an external body but not to an employer. I would have thought most Australians would think people in that situation should be protected. A woman who suffers sexual harassment and complains to a boss has no remedy of unlawful dismissal under this legislation.</para>
<para>Let us be clear what we have before this chamber. We have provisions which mean that four million Australians will not have the right to dispute their dismissal if they are dismissed unfairly. I did not hear any word about that before the election and I do not think anyone else did. The government have yet to explain why they think stripping these rights from Australian workers is a good thing. They say it is about job creation. The evidence for that is flimsy in the extreme. To my way of thinking, and to that of others on this side, if you are seriously saying to Australian workers that they should not have the right to challenge their dismissal if it is unfair, you need a little bit more than flimsy evidence. But that is what the government are still proceeding with.</para>
<para>They have not explained what makes someone who is the 101st employee different to the 99th. They have not explained why they are saying to workers, âYour only avenue is expensive and complex litigation.â They have not justified to the Australian people why they think these rights should be stripped away. This is one of the starkest examples of the bad faith this government have shown to the electorate. They claim they have a mandate for this bill before the parliament. We say they do not, because the extent of the drastic reduction in rights and entitlements in this bill was not made clear to the Australian people before the election. There is no starker example of this than the unfair dismissal provisions.</para>
<para>We were never told about this. Why? I think it is because most Australians agree that this is fundamental to a fair go. If you are dismissed unfairly, you ought to be able to do something about it. If this legislation is passed, I fear for those workers who have very few rights, very little power and very few financial resources. What will they do if they are dismissed unfairly? Do the government really think that some of these workers will have the resources to go to a lawyer and launch an unlawful determination action? We are saying to those people, âYou have no remedy; you have no redress.â Labor oppose this section of the bill. We oppose the bill in totalâwe think it is a bad packageâbut we think this is a particularly pernicious section of the legislation.</para>

<para>âAll right. Let us just have a general debate about unfair dismissal laws. I am happy to engage on that basis and thank you for that guidance, Madam Temporary Chairman. The unfair dismissal laws in this country are a failed social experiment. It was not always thus in Australia. They were introduced in 1993 by the then Keating government. So bad are those laws that when the former Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr, sought to get out of the opposition and into the premiership, he made a solemn promise to the people of New South Wales. So bad are those laws that Mr Carr found it necessary to say publicly that if he were elected Premier of New South Wales he would not introduce unfair dismissal laws to mirror those which had been passed in Canberra. It was on that basis that he was able to allay fears.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Let us make no mistake: these laws are a failed social experiment. Indeed, during the last election campaign, I went to a particular work site, a small business. I had campaigned there about 10 years previously. As always in Tasmania, they were very polite and very kind, but I was toldâ</para>

<para>âNo, it was on the east coast of Tasmania, not the west coast, Senator McEwen. As always, they were polite, courteous and kindâall those sorts of thingsâbut, 10 years ago, from the owner-operator of the business right through to all the workers, they were very strong, traditional Labor supporters and they indicated that they would not be providing support. That is the way it is in politics. You just smile and leave with a handshake. I do not know why, but I thought I would test my luck again and called in during the 2004 election campaign. The reception was completely and utterly different.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The owner-operator and workers came around and said, âEric, weâre going to vote for you and your mob this time.â I said, âThatâs nice, compared to last time.â Do you know what the motivation was for this? It was to get rid of the unfair dismissal laws. In that workplace, the employees had seen the corrosive and destructive effect of these unfair dismissal laws on their employer, themselves and their workmates. There was a rotten egg in the group at that workplace. When that occurs, it can sink the business. As a resultâand I will not go into the details; suffice to say that dishonesty and other matters were involvedâthe work force were disgusted when, finally but surely, the employer had to pay thousands of dollars of go-away money to somebody who had behaved dishonestly. Every single one of those workers asked: âHow come that can be the law? It is wrong.â And they were dead right.</para>
<para>Mr Beazley himself was forced to acknowledge exactly that point on South Australian radio. He had to admit that, with the unfair dismissal laws, the con artist can rip the system off and that people get paid go-away money on a very regular basis. So we have experienced Mr Keatingâs introduction of the unfair dismissal laws, Bob Carrâs running away from them and Mr Beazleyâs acknowledgment of all the problems associated with them. But, of course, as is Mr Beazleyâs wont, there was the capacity to talk the talk but an inability to walk the walk. It is a huge disincentive to small business to have these unfair dismissal laws. That business on the east coast of Tasmania told me that they would not be re-employing somebody to fill that position until such time as the unfair dismissal laws were changed in this country. So there is already one vacancy available for one of our fellow Australians to get a job as soon as these laws are changed.</para>
<para>I indicate to those opposite that this is not the only example in the Australian work force. In fact, many studies have been undertaken, and we can argue whether it is the one that said 6,000 or the one that said 77,000 jobs would be created if unfair dismissal laws were to be repealed. We can argue that for as long as we like. Sure, we are in the area of speculation, but everybody agrees on one thing: the unfair dismissal laws are a disincentive to employment creation. The only argument is: how many jobs would be created?</para>
<para>For the purpose of this debate, I am willing to settle for the very lowest figure that anybody has suggested: the 6,000 figure. If we can deliver another 6,000 jobs for the unemployed of this country by moving a piece of legislation in this place then I think we have every moral obligation to do so. Of course, what we as a government want to see is the removal of this failed social experiment from the statute book to allow employers and employees to get on with the business of running successful enterprises.</para>
<para>I also indicate to those opposite that I am not aware of any employer who gets up in the morning and says, âRight, who can I sack today?â I know of not one employer who gets up with that intention in the morning. Indeed, the investment made in their employees is such that they are the most valuable asset to their business. Having to replace workers is expensive and disruptive, and everything militates against an employer behaving in an inappropriate way. However, we accept that there may be some, and in those circumstances we have the regime that deals with unlawful termination. Once again, we have a very balanced package. For those who exceed what would be the normal and considered standard, you have the unlawful termination provisions. I commend the governmentâs amendments to the Senate. I trust that very shortly the small business community of Australia will be able to fill the positions that they have been too scared to fill because of these laws.</para>

<para>âI moved a package of amendments and spoke to the issue of having fewer than 100 employees. I would like to speak to the other set of amendments. When we are talking about unfair dismissal, we are actually talking about three processes. We are talking about workplaces that have up to or fewer than 100 employees and we are also talking about the circumstance where businesses restructure to split up their organisation to enable them to have fewer than 100 employees. I note that the government has amendments to which I would like to address a couple of comments in a minute. Then there is the issue of employees being dismissed for operational reasons. Through our amendments, we have sought to address each of these three situations.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I very quickly spoke to the issue of businesses restructuring to have fewer than 100 employees, as did Senator Wong, but looking at the amendments the government will be moving shortly to address the issue, I note that their amendments are very similar to those of the Australian Greens. However, there is a major difference. The government have included in their amendments the situation where a body is related to a body corporate, whereas our amendments go more specifically to related entities and associated entities. When the minister moves his amendments, I would appreciate it if he could take the opportunity to explain why the governmentâs amendments have not mentioned or do not relate to those two kinds of entities as well.</para>
<para>Also of deep concern to us is subsection 170CE(5B), the general provision in the bill which allows employers to terminate employees for genuine operational reasons or for reasons that include genuine operational reasons. We have a deep concern about this because, to my reading of that, it means that you can actually sack employees when you have over 100 staff if it happens to include reasons for genuine operational purposes. We are seeking to make amendments to ensure that does not happen, with general provisions similar to those in the tax act. There are general provisions in the tax act which mean that you cannot do things to avoid tax. We are seeking to include provisions in this act that mean you cannot do things to get around the unfair dismissal laws. We believe those provisions are essential.</para>
<para>Obviously, we believe the provision that removes the unfair dismissal laws should be deleted. You cannot amend that; it should just be deleted to maintain existing protections for workers. Then there is a set of amendments that deals with restructuring, and I have already asked the minister to explain why the governmentâs provisions are not as broad as the provisions of the Australian Greens. There is also the section that deals with trying to prevent unscrupulous bossesâbecause in this case it will be only the unscrupulous bosses who are caught by thisâfrom seeking to use this legislation to unfairly dismiss employees. I simply do not know why that provision has been put in there. What else could that be there for if it were not to enable employees to be unfairly dismissed?</para>

<para>âThis would have to be one of the most reprehensible pieces of legislation in the history of workplace relations in Australia. I would like to point out to Minister Abetz that, when he said that the introduction of unfair dismissal laws was something that the Keating government did, it may have been the case federally, but he will find that we have had unfair dismissal laws in the states for a considerably longer timeâsince 1972 in South Australia, where I come from. Oddly enough, despite the fact that we have had unfair dismissal laws in that state, South Australia seems to survive and there still seem to be plenty of small businesses in South Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am going to give an example of how one of those small businesses treated a woman very unfairly. If she had not had access to unfair dismissal laws, she would have been completely dudded, like you expect 3.7 million Australians to be because they will not have any access to unfair dismissal laws. It will probably be quite a lot more than 3.7 million because, as Senator Siewert rightly pointed out, the so-called operational reasons can be virtually anything. Any employer with half a brain will be able to construct some reason for unfair dismissal that they can construe as an operational reason.</para>
<para>By changing the unfair dismissal laws to deny 3Â½ million or more Australians the opportunity to seek redress from employers, you are fundamentally changing the way the system in Australia has operated in which employees have had a fair go. We have this legislation to protect vulnerable workers. It is not there to prevent employers running their businesses; it is to prevent vulnerable workers from being exploited or otherwise treated unfairly by those few employers who, either because they are not very nice people or because they are just stupid, deny people the right to continue in their employment.</para>
<para>I would like to give you an example from my background as, yes, one of those much reviled trade union officials that you keep referring to. This is the first unfair dismissal case I ever undertook. This woman was approximately 45 years old. She had worked for eight years as a receptionist. During that eight-year period she became a single parent. She had two children. She was probably lucky to earn, I think, about $30,000 a year. She worked for eight years as a receptionist in a small club, which would be a constitutional corporation. She turned up every day, she went to work, there was no problem with her work performance and she was given accolades by her employer all the time, but one day he came to her and said: âJan, we donât need you anymore. I am giving you your two weeks notice under the award. We donât need you anymore. We would like to thank you for the great work youâve done. You have been an exemplary employee but we donât need you anymore, so here is your two weeks notice. Off you go.â</para>
<para>She found out shortly afterwards that she was terminated because that employer had a daughter who had reached an age when she was looking for a job, and he decided that this would be an ideal job for that young woman. So the 45-year-old woman with two kids was sacked. Fortunately, the union took her case to the Industrial Relations Commission. It did not go to trial, but she went to conciliation and the commissioner pointed out to this employer that he might be in a little bit of trouble if the case proceeded further.</para>
<para>She was awarded adequate compensation. It did not compensate her for being treated that way by her employer, but at least she had some money to live on while she looked for another job. Under your legislation, that woman would walk out of that workplace with nothing and have absolutely no redress. I can give you plenty more examples, and I am sure every union official on this side of the chamber can give you examples of that kind of situation. That employer was not necessarily nasty; he was just stupidâand they exist out there. If there had not been these legislative provisions to enable that woman to get redress, she would have had to walk away with nothing.</para>
<para>In conclusion I have to say, having sat through all this argument, having watched you rip away penalty rates from people, having watched you force down the minimum wage of vulnerable Australiansâand particularly working women in this country, who mostly work in unorganised workplaces and who mostly work under common rule award conditions, under which they do not have the opportunity to collectively or individually bargain with their employerâit is absolutely galling to hear you say as you stand there that you are the party looking after families. How can you say you are looking after families when you are taking away the right of vulnerable workers to pursue their employer for compensation for being unfairly terminated? How can you say that you are the party that is looking after families when you are going to drive down their wages, take away their job security and make life for them worse than it has ever been?</para>

<para>âI have a specific question that I would like the minister to respond to. It is an important issue. I understand that the government is aware of the matter I am about to raise. It came to light last weekâcertainly it was reported in the mediaâthat the effect of the changes to unfair dismissal laws under this legislation would be that cases that are partly heard or for which decisions are pending, including in state jurisdictions, would effectively be terminated. The proceedings would be null and void and that would be the end of it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I understand that the government has indicated that it accepts that this is the position and it would take some steps to correct the problem, because it clearly would involve a retrospective application. I want to ask the minister about some specific issues. Firstly, what action is the government intending to take to prevent cases that are currently on foot from being, in effect, abandoned? Secondlyâand I ask this particularly on behalf of my colleague, Senator Hutchinsâwill owner drivers in the transport industry in New South Wales, for instance, whose contracts with employers are terminated have access to the same unfair dismissal procedures? I want to know whether or not the governmentâs intention is to ensure that those sorts of claimsâand any other claims that are within that scope of unfair dismissal, including those of owner driversâwill be able to be carried forward to conclusion?</para>

<para>âTo quickly deal with the issue Senator Wong raised in relation to sexual harassment, the employee in that circumstance would be able to complain on the discrimination grounds in section 170CK(2)(f), which include sex discrimination. The employee would also have a right of recourse to HREOC and from there, if need be, to the Federal Court.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In relation to Senator McEwenâs point, âgenuine operational requirementsâ has an accepted meaning in industrial relations law and that will continue.</para>
<para>On the matters Senator Forshaw raised, I will first respond in relation to the part heard matters. We will be dealing with that situation by regulation, but we need to be very careful to ascertain which matters may be stopped and those which should not be stopped. The example that I think I used this morning was the state wage cases. That is our intention, and that is why we did not support Senator Murrayâs amendment earlier in the day. We will be dealing with this by way of regulation. Those regulations will be a disallowable instrument and so the parliament will have some ownership of that. We do not want a cover-all phrase in relation to this. We want to examine each area independently to ascertain what would be fair and reasonable in the circumstances. The matter of owner-drivers will be considered in the totality of the consideration of the regulations.</para>

<para>âI want to take a short time to make a couple of comments about this particular issue of unfair dismissal. In the debate we have heard in the chamber over the last couple of days a number of senators from the government side have decided that they would laud the unfair dismissal provisions in their new Work Choices program. One of the more offensive things that I have heard in the debate we have had is those senators from the other side reading from the legislationâtaking up time by listing the terms under which people may be able to make claims under the new Work Choices legislation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>They read through it and listed a series of very clear discrimination clauses. They were not unfair dismissal clauses but clearly issues under discrimination law. They talked about the fact that we will be blessed under the new legislation to retain our rights to claim unfair dismissal on the grounds of age, gender, religious affiliation and trade union affiliationâwhich always tends to slip towards the bottom. The senators over there have been so keen in their speeches to say how proud they are that these provisions will be retained in the new legislation.</para>
<para>Before this debate ends I am keen to say that I am offended by that. Those provisions have been hard won. They have been won through industrial and social action by generations of Australian workers. The minister talks about inferred action in the legislation and things that should be obvious in the process. It is so wrong that the suggestion from the government is that we should be grateful and that it is a positive that these provisions will be retained. For the record, these provisions are a right. They have been hard fought for and we have been proud to achieve them. We talked earlier about the kinds of debates that have gone on in this place. There were outraged cries from members of the then opposition, who are now on the government side, when these issues were brought forward as legislation in the past.</para>
<para>We have heard the horrific scare campaigns about how these various protections would bring down industry and cause the loss of jobs. But we should be talking about how an effective relationshipââan harmonious relationshipâ, to quote the ministerâwould be best enhanced if people felt that they were being protected in their workplace. We should be looking at the clear protection of rights and a sense of security and respect. There should be no sense of being grateful. There should be acceptance that these are rights which all workers must feel free to claim. There should be no sense of them being given as some kind of gift from someone in an unequal power relationship.</para>
<para>In terms of the unfair dismissal process we can certainly talk about the horrific way that employers have been scared by hearing stories that are wrong. The figures to which they have been given access are wrong. There were all kinds of claims about how many jobs were going to be created by getting rid of unfair dismissal from the record that have not been proved. We should have genuine acceptance that there is one set of values which look to the overwhelming power of bosses being able to hire and fire at will, and another set of values, on this side of the house, including the crossbench, which look to the rights of workers. When you are talking about unfair dismissal more and more what we are hearing is that it is the view of the government that all dismissal is fair, that dismissal is a right owned by the employerâthat the work choice is owned by the employer and not the employee. But do not expect that we should be grateful for hard-won rights. Issues of true discrimination in the workplace are our right, not something for which we should be grateful.</para>

<para>âOn the third reading of this bill, I rise to put the view of the Labor Party in this place as we proceed to a final vote. It seems quite clear, from what has occurred over the last day and a half, that we will be losing this vote, and it will be Australian workers and their families who pay the price. Since midday yesterday, when we were confronted with this legislation and the 100 pages of amendments from the government which we got a half an hour before, we have seen this government consistently vote against those amendments which have been put by the crossbenches to this chamber to try and insert a modicum of fairness into this legislation. We have seen the foot soldiers on the other sideâthe foot soldiers in this trampling down of workersâ rights and the rights of Australian familiesâ</para>

<para>âSome of us in this place think that this legislation deserves serious scrutiny. Clearly those on the other side do not. They have voted for a guillotine. They have voted to put through, as people have seen, hundreds of amendments very quickly. But, worse, in the last day we have seen this government voting against things like putting fairness into this legislationâsomething that is currently in the act that governs Australian workersâ entitlements. This government has voted on a number of occasions, in the last day and a bit, against the principle of a fair wage. I look forward to them explaining between now and the next election what is wrong with that great Australian value of a fair dayâs pay. What was so bad about inserting âfairnessâ into this legislation?</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>We have seen this government vote again and again against penalty rates. They do not want any guarantee of penalty rates, perhaps because they do not understand what that means for Australians and their familiesâworking families who rely on penalty rates, on shift allowances and on overtime to augment their wages so they can put food on the table and so they can meet their mortgages. We have seen this government vote against meal breaks, against allowing Australians to have a bit of time off for a meal. And we have seen this government vote against pay equity. Can you believe it? In 2005 the government votes against the principle that women should be entitled to equal pay for work of equal value. We have seen this government vote that down and then have the gall to come into this chamber and tell the chamber and the Australian people that this legislation will be good for women. It is not good for women. Women are, as we have said, disproportionately reliant on the minimum wage. Sixty per cent of Australian working women are reliant on the minimum wage, and they will bear the brunt of this governmentâs refusal to ensure that there will be fair wages and fair conditions in this country.</para>
<para>We have seen this government support legislation which cannot be described as anything other than antifamily. This is legislation which removes the brakes on working long, irregular or unsocial hours. This is a government that believes that there should be no penalty on antisocial hours, a government that believes there should be no overtime rates for additional hours worked. It is a government that is removing through this legislation the certainty of hours that workers derive from rostering provisions in awardsâsimple things like getting some notice of when you have to be at work and when you do not have to be there so that you can organise your life, your child care and your family responsibilities.</para>
<para>This is what this government does not want. These are the protections and rights that Australians currently have that are being taken away by this legislation. This government is removing through this legislation the advances made in the work and family test case in August this year and removing the advances that the trade union movement, workers and particularly women have fought for for so many years. That case gained some advance in August this year and this government, with its numbers in the Senate, is trampling over those small advances which have been made. We have even heard Pru Goward, who is not known as somebody who takes Laborâs line, say to the Senate committee in relation to this issue that we are seeing the end of paid maternity leave. That is what is going to happen to women in this country, and those on the other side need to seriously think about how they can justify a position which removes so many provisions which protect family life, which removes so many provisions which were about ensuring fairness for Australian women and Australian workers more generally.</para>
<para>This is legislation which entrenches a race to the bottom. This is legislation which means good employers will have to compete with bad employers, because bad employers will use all the aspects of this legislation which enable existing entitlements and existing rights to be stripped away. Good employers will have to compete with employers who do that. We know what will happen. We know we will see a race to the bottom. What we will see through this legislation is the sort of social model we see in America, and we in Australia have always stood against that. We have a proud tradition in this country of saying, âAustralia believes in a fair dayâs pay for a dayâs workâ. We have always believed that there is such a thing as a fair wage floor, a fair minimum wage. We have always said we in Australia do not want working poor. But this legislation will allow that, and this government will have to explain to the Australian people why they think it is a good thing. They remove fairness, they remove protections and they remove rights with this legislation.</para>
<para>We all know that the rhetoric, the spin and the words from the government are meaningless. They say, for example, that award conditions are protected. We know what sort of protection it is. New employees can be handed an AWA with a clause that says, âThis AWA removes all rights to overtime, penalty rates, shift allowances, annual leave loading and a range of other matters.â We know the AWA does not have to include things like redundancy pay, which I think has been in this country since 1984. Some of us were still at school then, but that right has been removed now.</para>
<para>This government is intent on creating the sort of situation that the Prime Minister has had in mind for many years. We know that what we are voting on now is a dream of an old man, a tired old dream which will turn into a nightmare for Australian families. That is what we are voting on now. It is not about creating a more productive Australia; it is not about creating an Australia where people can enhance their skills and build a real career and real security for themselves and for their families. It is about an Australia where there will be a race to the bottom, where we will have working poor and where peopleâs rights can be stripped away. The new minimum in this country is not the award system which has served Australian society well; the new minimum is the ordinary hourly rate and four minimum conditions. That is it. Everything that working people and their representatives have fought for for so many years, other than those four things plus the ordinary rate, can be stripped away.</para>
<para>We know what the real agenda is. John Howard made it very clear when he was shadow minister for industrial relations in 1992. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">â¦ if somebody makes a capital investment in this country, they ought to be able to run that capital investment 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year without penalty as to the time of the day or night that they run that investment.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">You know what? He is going to deliver it now because he has the numbers in this place. He will deliver it, and that is what Australian workers will have to live with.</para>
<para>This legislation has never been about the technical aspects of workplace relations. This legislation has never been about some legal argument over whether X or Y applies. This legislation has always been about what sort of country we are. It has always been about what sort of Australia we are. This is not the Australia we want. We do not want an Australia where working people are given no choice. We do not want an Australia where there is a race to the bottom and we do not want an Australia in this century where so many rights and so many entitlements can simply be stripped away.</para>
<para>I do not want to take up the fullness of my timeâI know there are other senators who want to speak. Because of the short time this government has imposed, we have very little time to debate this bill. But I do want to finish on this issue: we may lose this vote. I think it is quite likely, given what we have seen over the last day and a half, that we will lose this vote. But we will not be beaten. We are not beaten. The lights may have just gone out in the Senate chamber, but they do not go out on the labour movement!</para>
<para>What this government have never understood as they abuse and revile trade union officials and those in the labour movement is what created the labour movement, what binds the labour movement and what has guaranteed such widespread support in the campaign against this bill by unionists and non-unionists alike. What binds us is a belief in our self-worth and also the worth of the person next to us. We have always understood that not only do we fight for our worth and our dignity, we also fight for the worth and the dignity of the person working alongside us. We fight for the principle of a fair go for all. We fight for a fair wage for a dayâs work. We have always done this as a labour movement, and we will continue to do this as a labour movement. This fight is not over. We will fight this until the next election and beyond. This fight will continue, because we are here for the long haul. We have always been here for the long haul and, fundamentally, we fight for a fairer Australia.</para>

<para>âIt is with great interest that I note the clapping from the gallery today. It is indicative of the fact that it is a very small group of people who are here today clapping the Australian Labor Party and the ACTU in relation to their views on Australian working men and women. But what they fail to acknowledge is that the great majority of Australian working men and women over the last four elections have been clapping the re-election of the Liberal-National Party government. There is a very good reason for that. There is a very good reason why working men and women around Australia have been applauding the re-election of this government. They know full well that, unlike the ACTU, it is this government that have protected working men and women in this country. They are acutely aware that, since 1996, we have created 1.7 million jobs, 900,000 of which were full time. They are acutely aware that, since 1996, their real wagesâthe real wages of working men and women in this countryâhave increased by 14.6 per cent, and they know full well that, under the 13 years of the Australian Labor Party government, it was 1.2 per cent.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Labor Party are not the representatives of the working men and women in this country any longer. The Australian working men and women have made it quite clear at four elections that they trust this government to look after them. They trust this government to support them, and no amount of guffaws from those who have been trundled in here today to stand up the back will change the fact that we have been re-elected four times by Australian working men and women. Australians are acutely aware that the Australian Labor Party are now so intrinsically bound up with the ACTU that they can no longer represent working men and women. If we wanted a clearer example of the relationship between the Australian Labor Party and the ACTU, it has been over the last of 72 hours, where the shadow minister has been within two metres of an industrial representative of the ACTU, who is not on her staff. That is a clear enough indication. You will get no clearer indication of the relationship. I think the really sad part about the last three days is that we have finally had confirmation that the Australian Labor Party is quite simply incapable of cutting itself loose from the ACTU to genuinely represent Australian men and women. If you look across the chamber to the other side, there are 18 men and women who owe their existence solely to the union movement.</para>

<para>âI accept that they may well be proud of that, but it does not change the fact that you owe your jobs to the trade union movement and, when you owe your job to one individual or one organisation, you cannot pretend to represent the wider Australian community. You can bleat as much as you like and you can put on your âproud to be unionâ badges, but history will show that you forfeited the right to claim ownership of working men and women of this country in 1996, because you have single-handedly failed to accept any of the reform programs of this governmentânot one single reform program have you accepted. Not once in the interests of this country have you tried to have a bipartisan approach to any policy at all.</para>

And, when you abrogated your responsibilities to those men and women, you lost the right to represent them, and they made it quite clear to you that you had lost that right.</para>

<para>âGet your facts right. If you want to start the personal stuff, we will talk about the 100,000 jobs around your neck, my friend. The other matter that we should be talking about todayâand it has been proven over the last 72 hoursâis the absolute obsessive hatred of the Australian Labor Party for employers in this country, their hatred of the small business community, which time and time again has come out in their speeches. As I said this morning, everyone in this place knows that under the present IR system there are bad employers. And, as I also said this morning, although they are capable of being bad employers, the great bulk of employers are good employers. You will never accept that, but it is a fact. The people who used to vote for you know that it is right, because they refuse to acknowledge the lies and innuendo in relation to industrial relations. So the great majority of Australian employers in this country, who could be bad employers if they wanted to, are not bad employers.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>What is the reason for that? What is the reason for them not being bad employers when they have the opportunity to be, particularly in relation to the small business sector? As Senator Joyce said this morning, there are now more small business people in this country than there are trade union members. He articulated very clearly that there are more small business people in this country than there are members of the trade union movement. It is now quite clear that not only have you forgotten your own traditional base; you have now sent out a very clear message to the small business community that you will be dropping them off as well. You will stand condemned for that. The Australian working men and women will again show you, in about two years time, that you are incapable of representing them.</para>

<para>âIn 1996 I walked into the Australian Democrats party room to be told that I had been given the poisoned chalice of industrial relations portfolio holder. There were some smiles and grimaces because they knew what I was in for. What I was in for was this passionate clash of the titans on this issue. In 1996 the coalition had won power with a huge swing in votes and a huge mandate, but that mandate was not specific. If you recall, at the time of the election there was a small-target strategy and it was not clear exactly where the coalition would be going in terms of industrial relations. We saw their bill and the Democrats resolved to oppose the bill unless it was amended, and savagely amended.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The bill at that time did not go as far as the <inline ref="R2465">Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005</inline> has. It did not go anywhere near as far. No-one should misunderstand how extremely different this bill is to the 1996 bill, even as unamended. As you know, Mr President, the Australian Democrats said that the government had a right to have the passage of that 1996 bill if they could agree to the amendments. We made 176 amendments to that bill, and the result was that the heat came out of that debate, the act was made economically effective and was found to be socially acceptable. We have claimed since that we played a part in the good times to which that act has contributed, along with other issues.</para>
<para>So, when the government look at our situation, where we are adamantly and vigorously opposed to this bill, they should be asking why. It is because there is no continuity with the past. This breaks with the past. The Australian Democrats value the past. We say that this bill breaks with the broad consensus that we have enjoyed. I will repeat what I have said before about the broad consensus, which existed despite the clash of the titans. That broad consensus was that our workplace law should reflect the social contract that growing national and individual wealth should be accompanied by rising living standards and a comprehensive safety net for the disadvantaged and powerless in our society, and low or inadequate wages should be supported by a sufficiently comprehensive welfare system to ensure family stability and sustainability.</para>
<para>That broad consensus was that wages and conditions of work should bear in mind the family more than the individual; that governments and parliaments should determine law and regulation but that enterprises, unions and tribunals should determine the detailed content and decision of workplace relations; that independent specialist tribunals were preferred for conciliation, arbitration and determination rather than the courts; that collective labour and collective capital had primacy over individual arrangements; that statute was the dominant determinant of collective arrangements at work and common law the dominant determinant of individual arrangements; that industrial relations should be a multiple federal system, not a single national system; that it was justifiable to subordinate the economic to the social in the workplace by ensuring the living standards of the worst-off were consciously and deliberately raised; that health and safety and compensation for accidents or negligence should be a primary feature of workplace law.</para>
<para>This bill assaults the cultural, economic, social, institutional, legal, political and constitutional underpinnings of work arrangements in Australia. It aims to radically alter our work systems and values. Our problem with this is that we do not stand beholden to the unions or business. Our problem is that the case still, to this moment, has not been made that the economic and the social situation in this country desires or needs this radical change.</para>
<para>This change would not have happened if the Australian Democrats still held the balance of power in this chamber. When Queensland voted in a coalition foursome this is what they voted for. We cannot change the decision of the Australian people but we can say to the government of the day: âWe think this is unwise. We think this is un-Australian. We think you are making not just an economic mistake, not just a social mistake, but a political mistake. We think this is faith based legislation. We think there is no evidence put down which verifies what you are doing on an economic case. We think there is plenty of evidence put down which verifies that the social situation of the poor, the disadvantaged, the people at the bottom of the rung in our society, can be made worse.â</para>
<para>I hope that I and my party are proven wrong. I hope with all my heart that those with faith on that side are proven right. I do not care if the result of this is the destruction of a government; what I care about is that for the next few years, and maybe forever, the workplace arrangements which have served this country so well and so effectively, which make us such a progressive and successful liberal democracy, have been cut away. As a migrant to this country, I resent the idea that what I came to is being cut away for a conservative, value-driven, faith based ideal which puts at risk those things which both sides of the house formerly had a broad consensus on.</para>
<para>Over the last nine years, our party have at times stood firm with the coalition to pass workplace law and we have been beaten up by the Labor Party for doing so. At other times, we have stood firm with the Labor Party in opposing legislative proposals by the coalition and we have been beaten up by them. We have been unafraid, we have been lonely and we have been small. But here today I tell you yet again, with the courage that this party have shown in these matters over many years, we do not support this legislation, we do not believe in it and we think it will be economically harmful and socially damaging. We oppose it.</para>

<para>âFamily First proposed commonsense amendments to the <inline ref="R2465">Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005</inline> that would have guaranteed fair and decent wages and conditions for all Australian workersâamendments such as ensuring workers who work on public holidays are compensated in time and receive at least a day off in lieu, which is important so that families can have time together. We proposed amendments such as guaranteeing meal breaks, overtime and penalty rates, so that working at 2 am is not the same as working at 2 pm, and working on a Sunday is not the same as working on a weekday. Family First regret that, despite our best efforts in our discussions with the government, we were unable to persuade the government as to the merits of Family Firstâs amendments, which showed commonsense and were fair and reasonable. That is a tremendous shame.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Family First has been left with no choice but to oppose the bill because it fails to put Australian families first. Family First understands the importance of the economy and the need for a strong economy. Family First also understands the need to improve Australiaâs industrial relations system. Family First recognises that there is room for legitimate debate about how the minimum wage is set as well as the argument that, at some point, a minimum wage must affect job creation. Family First therefore does not object to the establishment of the Fair Pay Commission, nor does Family First oppose setting up a national industrial relations system; however, Family First believes there are elements of this legislation that will impact directly on workers and families in negative ways, especially workers and their families on low incomes.</para>
<para>The assumption which underpins this bill is that there is a level playing field between all employers and all employees. But Family First does not believe this accords with realityâfar from it, in fact. If that were the real world, there would be no such thing as low-paid workers. Family First believes society has an obligation to ensure that everybody, all Australians, earns a decent wage and has decent conditions, regardless of their bargaining position. I strongly believe that whatever good this bill may do will be undone by the negative effects on Australian workers and their families. Work is important and our economy is important. But we work to live; we do not live to work.</para>
<para>Overtime and penalty rates were introduced as the first family friendly measures to ensure there was a balance between paid work and family life. Family First believes it is vital to maintain that balance. While Family First acknowledges that overtime and penalty rates are not as effective as their originators would have hopedâin part because the concept has been corrupted by the marketâthese measures should remain until an alternative is proposed. In Family Firstâs view, this bill is not about work and family; this bill is about work or family. This is a choice that no Australian family should have to make.</para>

<para>âIn my view, this is as bad as any piece of legislation we have seen in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is unfair, it is divisive, it is extreme. It just stinks. We have heard throughout this debate an attack, yes, on trade unions, yes, on trade union officials, but also, of course, on working Australians. That has characterised this debate. I have to say that I have had an absolute gutful of it. I am proud to stand up in this third reading debate and, with my Labor colleagues and others from the crossbenches, say that we will be opposing this bill in the parliament and we will fight it beyond the decision in the Senate this evening.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am also proud to say, of colleagues in the trade union movement and trade unionists who have defended and worked in the interests of working Australians, that we ought to thank those individuals for what they have done. I unashamedly associate myself with the trade union movement and thank them for their great achievements in over a century of struggle. I thank them for the eight-hour day, for eight hours work, eight hours sleep and eight hours for what we will, as it was described. I thank them for winning weekends for Australian workers, for winning, firstly, a 44-hour week and, secondly, a 40-hour week, and then the ACTUâs great efforts to win a 38-hour week. We have had the minimum basic wage since 1907 thanks to the efforts of the Australian trade union movement.</para>
<para>I thank them and appreciate the fact that we have equal pay and equal work because of that wonderful test case that was mounted by the ACTU in 1969, which meant that women could receive the same pay as men if they were proved to be doing work of equal value. I thank them also for equal pay for equal work for Indigenous Australians. I thank them for what they have done in relation to sick leave. I thank them for what they have done in relation to maternity leave. I thank them for what they have done in relation to workplace safety. I thank them for what they have done in relation to paid holidays. And I thank them for what they have done in relation to superannuation.</para>
<para>I acknowledge the efforts of those trade union officials who have worked tirelessly in support of the working conditions of their members. It is often a thankless task, and you can see the level of criticism in this chamber that those decent Australians have received for working in the interests of others in the community, for wanting to improve the lives of working men and women in Australia and for wanting to ensure that Australian families are better off. I thank the trade union officials and the trade union movement for what they have been able to achieve, and I thank them for fighting this unfair legislation as hard as they have done.</para>
<para>This legislation is best characterised as un-Australian. It is un-Australian and it is unfair. It will rip away the working conditions of working men and women in this country, and it will affect all their families. These are conditions that have been hard fought and hard won. Most often, they have been matters decided in courts and tribunals. There have been incremental changes over decades and decades, fights that have gone on for year after year, conditions won which are now to be ripped away in legislation by this contemptible government. The point is that it is not trade unions that will be worse off; it is Australian workers and their families who will be worse off as a result of this legislation being passed in the parliament this afternoon. That is what will happen.</para>
<para>I heard in this debateâand it made me sick to hear the new terminologyâthat the government say they are not interested in workplace fairness; they are interested in a new term: âworkplace harmonyâ. They are not interested in fairness; they are interested in harmony. I say to those who are experts in spelling and who have a dictionary with them: take out the âo-n-yâ, because what you will have is workplace harm. You will have workplaces in this country which are much less satisfactory, less happy, less reasonable and less fulfilling places to be present in as a result of this legislation going through.</para>
<para>Of course, the government could not carry the argument themselves. They did not have the capacity to carry the argument in the chamber or elsewhere. They had to spend $50 million of Australian taxpayersâ money to support this corrupt change to the workplace relations legislation and laws in this country. They had to bludge on the taxpayers to mount their campaign. They did not have the capacity to argue it out themselves. They did not have the skill. They did not have it in them to mount the case.</para>
<para>As far as the debate in the parliament is concerned, there was a committee stage debate that was grotesquely truncated by the government. They could not afford a proper committee examination of this legislationânot at all. They had to truncate the committee debate. And this for a bill the size and weight of a house brick, 687 pages. This for an explanatory memorandum, again, the size and weight of a house brick, 565 pages. Then when we actually got to the debate itself, we had the government sleazily introducing 98 pages of government amendments, 337 government amendments, half an hour before the committee stage even began. If you did not like that, there were 133 pages of explanatory memorandum in relation to the new government amendments. That could not be provided until hours and hours after the debate began. What a grotesque manipulation of proper procedures. What an absolute disgrace. Talk about thumbing your nose at the parliament. Talk about thumbing your nose at the people of Australia.</para>
<para>I want to say this in conclusion. The Australian Labor Party was formed in 1891. We were formed in the interests of ensuring that working men and women had their interests protected. We have always looked after those Australians. That has always been priority for our party and it always will be. We have been around an awful lot longer than the Liberal Party and we will be around a lot longer to come, I can assure you, to fight in the interests of those Australian workers and to fight in the interests of those people who defend and protect their interestsâthe people who actually defend decency in our society and decency in our communityâand in this parliament, of course, we defend integrity of process. That is what the Labor Party has always done. That is what we have done in this debate and that is what we will do into the future, regardless of the scandalous, despicable and contemptible decisions that this Senate is going to make courtesy of the Howard government this evening.</para>

<para>âMr President, let them go. They are very upset at the moment. I can understandâthey should be upset. But let me say, there is another point of view and it is the point of view of the 1.8 million small business people who have been kicked in the guts time and time again, when they could not get up when something went wrong and they could not dismiss someone and then they had to go and spend $15,000 in a court or you had to pay $15,000 in go-away money. What comes around goes around. I tell you this, as an employer who employed 10 people, whether they were reps, storemen packers or secretaries in the office: no employer goes out there to dismiss or take rights away from people. If they do, they do not have any workers.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>At the moment, the most precious commodity in Australia is labour. The most precious commodity out there in business today is having someone to work for you. It is even worse in rural Australia, where people have gone into the mines to earn themselves 160,000 bucks or 100,000 bucks; a truck driver can get $90,000. That is what is out there at the moment. When this legislation was put through, when these awards were structured, it was in 1907 and it was the Harvester case. Times have moved on. We have to compete overseas.</para>
<para>You were the people who removed the tariffs and rightly so. I did not think it would work. I must say, I was wrong and you were right. I thought removing the tariffs was going to crush Australia, but I was wrong. Now that the barriers have been removed we have to be competitive with other manufacturing countries. If we are not, it will not be the union reps who will be destroyed, it will be the small business people; it will be the workers. That is the way the structure works at the moment.</para>

You took the tariff walls down. You broke the tariff walls. You took the tariff walls down, you set this up and we have to be able to compete. If we cannot compete on imports of vegetables, citrus, meat or anything else, we are going to lose our way, and it is the workers who will be destroyed.</para>

<para>Unfair dismissals law was the straw that broke the camelâs back. That is what has driven small business to encourage them to support this legislation. Small business have been waiting for years for this legislation to come through. You made it vicious out there, where no-one could employ anyone with any confidence because, if it did not work out, there was a $15,000 penaltyâgo-away money. The coalition was elected, the people spoke and the people will speak again in three years. We have supported the Liberal Party on these issues, on Telstra and on IR because we believe it is right. In three years time, if we are wrong, we will be punished. If we are rightâand I believe we will be rightâ</para>

<para>âThis is bad legislation. I said so in my speech on the second reading; I have said it repeatedly in committee. It is bad legislation. I tell you: employment is going to rise. Employment for lawyers is going to rise because there are so many problems with this legislation. People will have to have many lawyers. Workers will have to have lawyers to try to protect the rights that are being taken away. That is one area in which we know employment is going to improve. You just need to look at the lack of time we have had to debate and get advice on this legislation. Just today the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> for this bill popped up on my laptop. We have been debating this legislation, which is 700-odd pages, plus the memorandum, plus 100 pages of amendments. That is how flawed it is: there are 100 pages of government amendments plus a 50-page additional memorandum that we got as we walked into the chamber. On top of that the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> comes out today, when we are at the end of looking at the bill. How is that for being fair? How is that for just process?</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Look at some of the things that this is going to take away and what it is going to do. There will be no minimum or maximum working hours, no entitlement to a stable weekly income, no meaningful entitlement to overtime pay, no entitlement to higher rates of pay for unsociable hours, no legal entitlement to certainty of scheduling of your roster, no legal entitlement to a written statement of employment status, no legal entitlement to a record of pay or hours worked and no real job security for anybody. Not only are you exempt from unfair dismissal if you have a business with 100 workers, but also, because of the way the rest of the amendments are written, you can put people off for operational reasons. No-oneâs job is secure. There is no access to a career structure and no voice in the wage setting process of the Fair Pay Commission.</para>
<para>Let me talk about the Fair Pay Commission again. I moved an amendment to try to get the word âfairâ taken out of this legislation because it is not fair, no matter how the government tries to put it. It is not fair; let us have the Australian harmony pay commission. What a load of nonsense! The government will legislate for protection of the bosses but it will not legislate to protect peopleâs wages and make sure it is fair. If it is fair, put it in the legislation. The government legislates to put in the requirement to look after the economic side of things but it will not legislate to look after the workers of this country. Why? If it is implicit, make it explicit. It will not, so what it wants to do is obvious. It wants to be able to lower the minimum wage, which is what its bosses want. The bosses want to be able to lower their minimum wages, so that is what the government has legislated.</para>
<para>They keep saying they have legislated for the first time to protect peopleâs rights. They are actually legislating to take away peopleâs rights. Do not make any mistake about it; the award system in this country is going. This is what this legislation does. In fact, what they are doing is legislating to take away peopleâs rights, not restore them. That is absolutely clear. They are taking away peopleâs rights. They are taking away peopleâs access to awards; they are lowering the minimum wage. It will lead to the development in this country of a class of working poor, particularly when you combine this with the legislation that we will probably be considering through the gag-and-guillotine process next week: the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>. Combine the two and they equal working poor in this country.</para>
<para>No, the sky will not fall in when we walk out of this chamber at six oâclock tonight; I do not think I have heard anybody on this side of the chamber say it will. These changes will be insidious. As peopleâs collective agreements come up, they will be put on the minimum standards. The sky will not fall in; the changes will be insidious. I am hoping that what this legislation does will become evident by the next election, because some of it will actually take effect after then, unfortunately. But hopefully some of what this legislation does will be evident before then.</para>
<para>I am sad that people in this country will be going onto lesser pay and poorer working conditions. The fact is that that should become evident sooner rather than later. The sky will not fall in, I agree. We did not say it would, Senator Joyce. We did not say the sky would fall in tonight, but conditions will get worse and worse. It will get worse as the minimum wage goes down, because the minimum wage will not drop tomorrow. It will take a little while for it to drop, in the same way that it took a little while to drop in Western Australia.</para>
<para>You keep going on about lack of union membership in this country. I know why you have made it harder for unions to represent workers in this legislation. You have done that not only because you are ideologically opposed to the concept of workers joining together to collectively bargain, but also because you know that this legislation is going to have the most devastating impacts on workers that we have seen in a century and you do not want unions around to represent them. No matter what you do to stop workers joining unions and to stop unions being involved, people will start recognising that they need protection because this legislation takes their protection away. The union movement has stood by workers in this country for 100 years, and I for one hope that they keep doing it because workers are going to need all the protection they can get.</para>

<para>âWe have heard this evening from Senator Faulkner a remarkable and historic speech. As Senator Faulkner paid his tribute to the Australian trade union movement and the role of the Australian Labor Party, I could not help thinking that his speech took on a valedictory air. The problem for you, Senator Faulkner, is this: it may be that the Australian Labor Party has always identified itself with the interests of working people, but in this day and age fewer and fewer working people identify themselves with the Australian Labor Party. That is your problem. Fewer and fewer Australian working people choose to join trade unions. Fewer and fewer Australian working people find their aspirations captured by the Australian Labor Party. And if you ever had any doubt about that, Senator Faulkner, do nothing more than consult the reflections of your protege, Mr Mark Latham; or, if you are not satisfied with Mr Mark Latham, consult the reflections of your predecessor as the Labor leader in this place, former senator John Button; or consult the reflections of the former president of your own party, the Australian Labor Party, Mr Barry Jones, because all of them say the same thing.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is not our side politics which is out of touch with the aspirations of Australian working people and Australian working families. Australian working people have voted with their feet by dropping out of Australian trade unions at a record rate so that today, as Mr Button pointed out, only some 15 per cent of Australian workers are unionised. Never before has the Australian Labor Party at a federal election fought from a narrower base. Never before has there been a non-Labor government in Australia to which Australian working people have entrusted more confidence. And why? Because in the last 10 years they have seen their wages rise steadily. Over the last 10 years, the net household wealth of all Australian households, but in particular the households of Australian working people, has grown. This has been a time of industrial peace and economic prosperity, and it is a time during the course of which the affairs of this nation have been superintended by a non-Labor government while the Labor opposition has drifted away from its historical antecedents.</para>

<para class="block">Your words, Senator Faulkner, but they were not said this evening. They were said by you in this place nine years ago on 8 October 1996, when we debated the last workplace relations act amendment bill. And in the nine years since, your prophecy has been falsified by reality. Because, in the nine years since you made that prophecy, in the nine years since you uttered those words, in the nine years during the course of which your side of politics went on to lose three consecutive elections as it drifted further and further away from the aspirations of working Australians and Australian families, what have we seen? Steady growth in real wages for working Australians, but in particular for the poorest working Australians, unexampled in Australian history. Growth in household wealth, but in particular the household wealth of the poorest Australians, unexampled in Australian history. A time of peace, prosperity and industrial harmonyâthe opposite of your dire prediction of nine years ago.</para>
<para>Senator Faulkner, you know how much respect I have for you. You know how much respect I have for your deep sense of history. But I say to you from the bottom of my heart that you and the side of politics that you represent are on the wrong side of history because the movement of history, for at least the last half-century and indeed before, has been away from collectivisation, has been away from collective solutions, and has been towards the liberalisation of our economy and our society. It has been my side of politicsânot all the time, but most of the timeâwhich has led that movement. It is we who denationalised the nationalised industries in the 1950s. It is my side of politics that ended the culture of dependency in the 1990s. And it is this side of politics this evening, on this historic occasion, which is striking a mortal blow against the culture that says only collective solutions can work in the workplace. You were wrong about history in the 1950s, you have been wrong about history in the last decade and you are on the wrong side of history tonight.</para>

<para>âI rise to, I suspect, conclude the debate. I note that none of the government senators have attempted to defend the <inline ref="R2465">Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005</inline>. They have attacked the people in the gallery, they have attacked trade unionists and they have attacked members of the Labor Party, but they cannot defend the bill because it is indefensible. You cannot win the argument. You will win the vote, but you will not win the argument. We will fight you all the way to the next election, because you are wrong, you are unfair and your bill is un-Australian. We are proud of our relationship with the trade union movement; we are proud of defending workers and we will keep on doing it. You may think history is with you but mark down 2Â December 2005, because it is the beginning of the end of this government. All you have spoken about tonight is ideology. You cannot defend the bill; all you can do is advocate your ideology.</para>
