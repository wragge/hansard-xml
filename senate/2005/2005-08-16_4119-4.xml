<para>—This is a customs bill which relates to the cargo management re-engineering program. As a result of ongoing discussions with industry, it was thought appropriate to extend the period of time for the implementation for imports—it is a new program that is being put in place—to 12 October. The reason for urgency is that we need to put this legislation through the parliament so that it will change the cut-over date for the new program, which was previously in August. It will extend the program by about six weeks. If we do not do it this week then we will not be able to give industry that extra time that it needs. It is a matter of six weeks extension, but it is important and that is the reason for the urgency.</para>

<para>—In continuing my remarks about this legislation, can I say that I am very concerned about just what this legislation represents. As someone who has been involved in vocational education and training for a long time, I see the <inline ref="R2340">Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2332">Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005</inline> as another grab for power by a government that wants to tighten its grip on the education sector until it actually has it in a stranglehold. It is an attempt to further its agenda of trying to legislate the states out of existence as well as forcing—and forcing is what it is—its radical take on industrial relations into every facet of society. Let us look first of all at the government’s industrial relations tirade within these so-called skilling Australia’s work force bills. Here is the cause of the greatest unease and what has been alluded to a number of times by my colleagues: clause 12(1)(b), which forces TAFE colleges to offer Australian workplace agreements. The bill at clause 12(1) states:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">The State must implement workplace reforms in the vocational education and training sector, including the following:</para>
</quote>
<para class="centre">                  …         …         …</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">(b)   ensuring that TAFE institutions introduce more flexible employment arrangements by offering Australian workplace agreements to staff, except where making such agreements under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 is not possible because of the corporate status of the TAFE institution, in which case other individual agreements should be offered;</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There it is: the government’s radical industrial relations agenda slotted in, as it has been in so many bills before, audaciously as can be. Surely the vocational education and training system is no place for the Howard government to be driving home its ideological industrial relations agenda. We have seen it with universities. We have seen it with the Australian technical colleges. Now we are seeing it with TAFEs.</para>
<para>It is interesting to note that, despite active promotion by the Howard government since it took office in 1996, AWAs have only achieved coverage of about 2.4 per cent of the work force up to 2005, and not all of them were taken up willingly. Perhaps this is why the government is mandating it through legislation, compelling industries that have existed happily without AWAs to effectively force them on their employees.</para>
<para>If you want to see just how well the mandating of AWAs has been received within the community, you need to look no further than the workplace relations minister’s very own department. A large number of employees from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations have previously walked off the job due to this government’s AWA-centrism. All new employees must sign an AWA as a condition of employment and as one employee stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If you want a pay rise, the only mechanism to get it is to go on to an AWA ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I quote from a letter from DEWR employees written to their minister:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Dear Sirs</para>
<para>I am writing to express my concern at the failure of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) to finalise certified agreement negotiations with staff and our union.</para>
<para>Despite twelve months of talks your Department remains unable—or unwilling—to deliver an agreement that provides fair employment conditions. This unfinished business reflects badly on your Department and on the entire Public Service.</para>
<para>I urge you to:</para>
<para>-       immediately finalise negotiations</para>
<para>-       respect people’s bargaining choices</para>
<para>-    ensure the new agreement gives DEWR staff the right to access the AIRC to resolve disputes</para>
<para>-    ensure current redundancy entitlements are not cut.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Is it any wonder that the very people charged with implementing the government’s irrational agenda are protesting against it? AWAs are specifically designed to make it easier for employers to undercut award and collective agreement conditions. AWAs allow employers to single out employees, to force new working conditions on to them and to do that to them one at a time. They give employers more control over working hours, reducing overtime pay and making more people casual employees. The government’s new laws will allow employers to put workers on to individual contracts that cut take-home pay and reduce employment conditions to only five minimum standards: the minimum hourly rate of pay—which is currently only $12.75 an hour—eight days sick leave, four weeks annual leave, unpaid parental leave and weekly working hours. Are these the sorts of working conditions we want our educators, those who are raising the leaders of tomorrow, to be forced under?</para>
<para>Let us think about this government’s record on vocational education. The Liberal government is determined to abrogate the Commonwealth’s funding role in education and training at a time when businesses around the country are demanding a greater, not lesser, role from government when it comes to the planning, funding and delivery of education and training programs. Yesterday, the Australian Industry Group was highly critical of the lack of investment in traditional apprenticeship training. The government cut funding for TAFE during its first two budgets and failed to provide any growth funding in six of the last nine budgets. It has also cut university funding, and upfront fees have been increased at most universities by 25 per cent to try to correct the shortfall. This is not a government that is concerned with promoting education and training.</para>
<para>Let us also take into account that adults wishing to retrain who also have families have the added concern of high child-care fees—something which the government, again, has done nothing constructive about—and their universities are not going to be able to offer them any services to assist, as a result of the voluntary student union proposals. Recently I received a submission from a group of constituents who are very worried about this legislation. It highlights the genuine concerns and, more importantly, the real effects of the Howard government’s radical assault on the vocational education sector. These constituents feel that these bills look like a cost cutting exercise which will significantly reduce education opportunities for Indigenous people, especially those in isolated communities. These constituents attend Tranby Aboriginal College, which is the oldest independent adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education centre in Australia. Anne and Bill, two students, wrote in regard to the effect of these bills combined with the <inline ref="R2356">Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2005</inline>:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Tranby, and three similar Educational Institutions around Australia, will lose $3.7 million over two years in direct funding. A further $10.9 million, which has been quarantined for allocation to independent community-controlled institutions (like Tranby) will now be available for open competition between all organisations involved in “skilling” the Australian workforce. This will be a common pool with no preference for Indigenous people.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Tranby Aboriginal College is an alternative and independent learning environment for adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Part of the Co-operative for Aborigines Ltd, the college is located in the inner Sydney suburb of Glebe and has been teaching students since 1958. It has helped to skill a number of important Indigenous community leaders since that time. An average of 150 students every year attend the college from all over Australia, developing the knowledge to empower both themselves and their communities. Evening courses are also available to non-Indigenous students. Tranby also provides staff development training to Indigenous and non-Indigenous organisations and government departments. So it is particularly concerning to me that Tranby, in New South Wales, and the three similar institutions in other states will be losing more than $3.7 million over two years in direct funding.</para>
<para>The government claims to be promoting ‘practical reconciliation’. What could be more practical than the work of Tranby in its programs to skill Indigenous people to work in their own communities? One can only hope that pleas such as Anne and Bill’s, and the many others received by my colleagues in this place, highlight to this government how damaging a blind ideological pursuit of an agenda considerably out of step with the Australian public opinion can be: damaging not just to the majority but also to the minorities—those who most need the government’s support and assistance.</para>
<para>I come now to Australia’s national skills crisis and the extent to which this bill purports to address the crisis. The Reserve Bank of Australia drew attention to the skills crisis in March of this year, when it raised interest rates by 0.25 per cent. There are two factors which the RBA emphasised. The first was pressure on wages and, as a consequence, inflation and interest rates as a result of the skills crisis. The second was capacity restraints as a result of a neglect of infrastructure. This is a national crisis, a crisis that has seen the government attempt to import a solution, a quick fix, and which is very much an admission of guilt. The quick fix has seen the Howard government import around 178,000 extra skilled migrants since 1997, at the same time turning away more than 270,000 Australians from TAFE since 1998.</para>
<para>How do these bills actually respond to the national skills crisis so clearly articulated by the Reserve Bank of Australia, the OECD and various Australian peak industry bodies? The government’s response was simple: to vacate the space, because it has never had a nation-building perspective in the areas of skills development, training and lifelong learning. It was to treat Australian educational institutions, learners and training providers with contempt, in that the Prime Minister unilaterally announced the abolition of ANTA and the national system of vocational training by press release. There was no consultation with anyone, and certainly not with the state governments and other stakeholders in the vocational education and training sector that are vitally affected by this legislation. This was because the Prime Minister, in his haste to vacate the space, wanted to abolish ANTA by 1 July this year. This was a purely political decision. There is not a shred of evidence that any educational or economic motive prompted this action.</para>
<para>To date, there have been paltry efforts to explain the abolition of ANTA by this government. This is simply because, as those who have an involvement in the vocational education sector know, ANTA was a thorn in the side of the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, who wants to run the show. He has done it in schools and universities. It was surely only a matter of time before he would attempt to impose an ideological agenda on this area. He has already sought to impose it on schools and universities. That includes draining $500 million from the sector and rebadging and reannouncing, with great fanfare, the funding already announced during the election campaign last year.</para>
<para>The Howard government’s policies demonstrate the contempt in which this government holds public education, and this contempt has sown the seeds of the skills crisis now confronting Australia in the 21st century. We on this side of the chamber are truly appalled at this. Labor believe that our national training system should be supported by a strong, independent tripartite body which is able to provide broad based advice to the entire sector.</para>
<para>Training our current and future work force should be a partnership between all involved: government, industry and, of course, workers. These bills do not honour those principles. They abolish ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority, by repealing the Australian National Training Authority Act and the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act, which were both put in place by a Labor government in 1992. In their place, the bills establish a new system for the provision of Commonwealth funding to vocational education and training in Australia—a system of agreements with states and territories that in essence represents an increasing grab for power by an extreme, arrogant and out-of-touch government that is bent on imposing its radical ideology on every facet of Australian society.</para>
<para>When the current system was set up by Labor in 1992, there was extensive consultation. The current Leader of the Opposition, who was then the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, introduced the package to establish ANTA and noted in his second reading speech that ‘the agreement was reached after a sustained period of negotiations’.</para>
<para>It is clear that the government is using this legislation as another vehicle for imposing its ideological agenda in industrial relations. The abolition of ANTA means that Commonwealth funding to the states and territories for vocational education and for educational facilities such as TAFE colleges will now come directly from the Department of Education, Science and Training and will therefore be under the direct supervision of the minister. The legislation provides that grants cannot be made to a state unless there is a Commonwealth-state agreement in place, and it stipulates that such agreements must be concluded during 2005. Given that it is now the middle of August 2005, the Commonwealth is putting the squeeze on the states by saying, ‘Sign this agreement now or you get no funding.’</para>
<para>The government’s insistence on Australian workplace agreements as part of the funding agreement demonstrates quite clearly that this legislation is being used as a vehicle to introduce their industrial relations changes into the system, just as they have sought to do through the university sector. This legislation does nothing more than play TAFE teachers off against each other and, through them, Australian students—students that are the only solution to our government-created skills crisis. It treats the invaluable contribution our vocational education and training teachers have made to skilling Australia with contempt and derision.</para>
<para>How will these bills assist teachers to address the skills shortage created by and left to fester by this government? As I have said, the government cut funding for TAFE during their first two budgets. In fact, they failed to provide any growth funding in six of the last nine budgets and now, after emasculating a once proud institution, they want to use it as a political football in their assault against the unions in their now fever-pitch industrial relations tirade.</para>
<para>Education unions across the country are being punished for fighting the government’s assault, for fighting for the right to skill Australians as opposed to simply importing a quick fix that does nothing but try to hide the damage this government has inflicted. The New South Wales Teachers Federation indicates on their web site:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Since 1997 Federal TAFE funding has been cut by 26% in real terms and now the Federal Government is threatening to cut nearly 25% of TAFE’s total funding. For NSW this means $1.4 billion over the next three years. This is equivalent to about 450,000 student places across Australia just when we face a massive skills shortage crisis.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Labor is standing stand side by side with them in their fight. We stand for a strong Australian trained work force; we stand for a vocational education sector that is not totalitarian in its operation but rather is a partnership between all those involved. We stand for a work force that is not forced into an ideologically driven agreement that will slash working rights and put added pressure on Australian families. We stand for a fair go, for opportunity for all, and for a well-resourced public vocational education sector which will train and equip for Australia’s future. We certainly do not stand for blind ideology. We believe in a fair go, we believe in offering everyone an opportunity, and we believe in public education. Labor will not be supporting this legislation.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak on what might be described as an overly-prescriptive bill, the <inline ref="R2340">Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005</inline>, and the associated bill, the <inline ref="R2332">Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005</inline>, that deals with the abolition of the Australian National Training Authority, or ANTA. The Democrats do not support these bills, nor did we support the unilateral abolition of ANTA. The abolition of ANTA was announced by the government after the election. It was not taken to the public as an election issue, and it was done without consultation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>While we support many of the bills’ objectives and note that the new training arrangements appear to have inherited many of the cooperative elements of the ANTA framework, we are opposed to the overly prescriptive nature of the arrangement and the direct role of the department in the administration of these arrangements. In our view, these arrangements are unnecessary, restrictive and likely to lead to less flexibility. In fact, we believe that the motivation for the abolition of ANTA and this new arrangement is to deflect criticism that the government underspent in this area. As a result we now have a skills crisis, which I note the government continues to deny because that would be an admission of failure. The only way to save face has obviously been to blame the states, and the only way for the government to look as if it is saving the system is to take it on itself.</para>
<para>I believe that history shows that it was this government that challenged the fundamental underpinnings of the ANTA agreement, specifically with the abolition of growth funding in 1996, and also with reduction in expenditure through so-called efficiency dividends and requirements for the states to achieve growth through efficiencies.</para>
<para>The coalition cut funding in 1996 and 1997 and then froze it from 1998 to 2000. In those five years student numbers increased by over 16 per cent, and there has been annual growth in the delivery of courses of around six per cent per annum for the past 10 years. The funding for training fell in real terms by 19 per cent between 1997 and 2002. In 2004, 40,000 young people missed out on a TAFE place. As noted in the joint ALP and Democrat minority report on this bill, Commonwealth funding for VET has fallen by 6.5 per cent since 1997, when adjusted for CPI movements, while state and territory funding has increased. The Democrats have been arguing for years now for an absolute minimum of five per cent annual growth funding in real terms to be put in place if we are to address the training and education needs of Australia’s young people and combat the growing skills crisis. This legislation does not do that.</para>
<para>As I mentioned earlier, the Democrats are very concerned about the highly prescriptive nature of the legislation. Like they have done with higher education, the government have taken a strongarm approach to industrial relations by tying the funding to implementation of their IR agenda. I think it is ironic that the government have sought changes to the industrial relations act to curb what they call third-party interference by unions yet this is exactly what they are doing here by imposing their ideology in exchange for funding. In 1996 the Democrats supported the introduction of Australian workplace agreements to the industrial relations system, but at the time and now we believe that it is up to the employer and employee to decide what sort of agreement making mechanisms they use. The government should not be doing this by force, as they are in this legislation.</para>
<para>The legislation also prescribes that funding be increased to facilitate an increase by five per cent a year in the proportion of apprentices and trainees eligible for user-choice funds under the New Apprenticeships scheme. A number of submissions to the inquiry on the legislation raised concerns about the success of the user-choice scheme, with an independent report arguing that the scheme has risks. The Democrats have been arguing for more than 12 months now that the user-choice scheme should be put on hold until there is a proper review and evaluation of this policy, and we again urge the government to do this.</para>
<para>We are also concerned that the payments received under the act are not to be used for providing vocational education and training to overseas students or for private recreational pursuits or hobbies. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> on the bill points out:</para>
<quote>
<para>In 2003 one in three VET students were not studying for a qualification.<inline font-variant="superscript">(11)</inline> While many of these would be self funded, they would be users of infrastructure and other services supported by government funding.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Democrats believe that provision of education and training is in the national interest and therefore should be a public good. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> points out that this policy—and I quote:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... also appears incompatible with developing lifelong learning pathways particularly in an ageing society, matters which are the subject of the government’s own discussion paper on adult learning.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">On a final note, we believe the government has overlooked the importance of acknowledging the critical role training providers play in the overall delivery of vocational education and training by excluding them from 4(b) of the objectives clause. In their submission to the inquiry on the bills, TAFE Directors Australia stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">TDA continues to emphasise that much of the inflexibility and non-responsiveness for which the ANTA arrangements were often criticised was due in no small part to the absence of training providers from relevant consultation and decision-making arrangements. TDA emphasise that while the needs of industry and workforce development must drive the outcomes of the national vocational and education training system, neither industry clients nor Commonwealth/State administrations are best positioned to design the means for achieving these outcomes. The training design and delivery expertise which reside in the TAFE system can materially enhance the outcomes of training for both employers and individuals and it is important that this is now recognised and incorporated in national decision-making processes.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Democrats strongly support this sentiment, and I will be moving an amendment to the bill to include training providers in the objects clause.</para>
<para>The Democrats believe that the government would have been better off genuinely renegotiating the ANTA agreement. We suggest that they should have negotiated a five per cent minimum in annual growth funding; a requirement for at least 70 per cent of content to be delivered by permanent, professional, accredited teachers by 2007; professional development for TAFE teachers so that they would have up-to-date industry experience, teaching competencies and qualifications; improved data gathering on skill needs; better sharing of infrastructure, especially in the regions, by public institutions and business; improved training and retraining strategies for older workers, people with disabilities and the welfare dependent; commitments from state and territory governments to nationally consistent and significantly reduced fees and charges for TAFE courses; reform of funding models for VET in schools; and establishment of a further education commission to conduct a review of Australia’s current and future vocational education and training needs. I wish we were debating these matters, which have been on the agenda for reform in the TAFE sector certainly for as long as this government have been in power, yet we are not.</para>
<para>We believe that the problems that the government appear to have had with the TAFE system could have been better addressed through providing appropriate funding and continuing to work with the states, training providers, industry and unions to further build on the achievements of the ANTA arrangements to meet Australia’s skills crisis and the social and economic needs of all Australians.</para>

<para>—This legislation is a matter of profound sadness for me. I think that the <inline ref="R2340">Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2332">Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005</inline> are a further example of bills so inaptly named that it would suggest a case of misleading the Senate. This legislation actually abolishes the Australian National Training Authority. For honesty’s sake, I think it would be more appropriate to speak of these bills as the ANTA abolition bills. The opposition will be moving amendments in the second reading debate, but if those amendments are not carried the opposition will be opposing this legislation. It is a matter of some regret that this legislation is before the chamber. It is a matter that the nation as a whole should regret. This legislation continues a series of bills through which this government is essentially seeking to turn back the work that Australians have performed to produce great results in many aspects over the last decade and a half.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>ANTA, and the national training agenda that it embodied, was one of the great achievements of the Keating government. I have participated in every relevant debate in this chamber since the establishment of ANTA. I recall that the very first bill we debated went to the question of the appointment of the CEO. It is a matter of deep concern that ANTA, which has been known as a world leader in vocational education and training, has now reached the point where the government has this abolition legislation before us. Under the leadership of ANTA, the Australian national vocational education training regime has played an essential role in nation building over the last 12 years or so.</para>
<para>ANTA has played a leading role on the international stage, and Australia has, as I say, been seen as a world leader with regard to national policy development and endeavour in vocational education and training. The work of ANTA has been seen overseas to be as significant as the work that has been undertaken with regard to vocational education and training in some of the great centres of world opinion and practice. For instance, I have had various discussions with German officials, and in Germany ANTA was understood to be an institution of considerable significance. I am profoundly thankful for ANTA’s achievements and I trust that those achievements will outlast the existence of ANTA itself. I trust that the collective aspirations of the vocational education industry in this country will see that those achievements are maintained.</para>
<para>I take the view that the abolition of ANTA is wrong. It is appalling. I take the view that this is further evidence of this government’s short-sightedness and of just how out of touch it is. It is a government that is essentially extremist in its nature. It is a government that is pursuing an ideological agenda, an ideologically motivated vandalism, for which the country as a whole will pay a very high price. ANTA and its officers have given great service to the people of this country. The authority has achieved much over the last 13 years. It has been led by a series of outstanding public servants and policy experts, whose legacy will continue to be understood and acknowledged internationally for many years to come. ANTA was the body that dragged Australia’s eight disparate, separate vocational educational and training systems first into the 20th century and then into the 21st century.</para>
<para>My own association with ANTA and the great expertise of the national training agenda goes back to my days in the Victorian government when I worked with the then state education minister, Joan Kirner. That was during the period in which the initial agreement was signed off with Paul Keating. It was an agreement which could have produced so much more. We came within one vote of developing a truly national institution 13 or so years ago. If it had not been for the leadership change in New South Wales, with Premier Greiner as I recall it, a very different picture might well have emerged from that original agreement. As I say, I have participated in every relevant debate in the 12 years in which I have been in this chamber, and it has been a great disappointment to me that the enormous potential of the National Training Authority, which might well have been reached, has been frittered away by this government.</para>
<para>Australia of course needs to modernise its vocational education and training system. It has to be opened up to new ideas and new levels of skill development. ANTA did that. It also provided the impetus for the streamlining of curriculum development and moved—I make no apologies for this—a considerable distance along the path to ensure that there was a national framework for the creation of a training system that meant that you could get a qualification that meant something anywhere in the country. There were genuine steps made towards the development of a nationally consistent approach to vocational education and training in this country.</para>
<para>Under ANTA we have some of the more advanced systems of training frameworks in the world, based on a competency model rather than on a time-served model. There is a flexibility in the system, where workers and employers alike can find the value of training. It can develop benefits not just for one sector of the economy but for the workers themselves, in terms of enrichment of their lives and their capacity to participate fully in the economy and the society, and for employers, in terms of their businesses.</para>
<para>The Australian training packages developed under ANTA’s auspices were much more accessible and transferable and are a major export service. It is through these processes that Australia has become a world leader in these various aspects of vocational education. It was a unique vision and a unique conjuncture of minds and perspectives that formed and supported that cultural change that arose from the period of the Keating government and the work of the education ministers of the states at that time.</para>
<para>The government has said that ANTA has to go because there is no national consistency. Of course, the government also says that it is run by the unions and that businesses do not get a look in. What a load of nonsense that is. ANTA was always based on the presumption of a tripartite approach to cultural change because that is the only way you get the best out of people—by drawing people in to sit down and talk about problems, ensuring that workers, bosses and government sit together and work through problems. They are plain wrong on those claims. They are particularly wrong, and totally dishonest, in the claim about the failure of national consistency. Those that know something about this matter would recall that, back in 1999, the Australian government instructed the government’s solicitors, Minter Ellison, in the examination of the national consistency program at the time, to exclude from the options paper it prepared for cabinet the proposition that there be a national legislative framework. We all know that is the only way that there can be an effective means of ensuring national consistency.</para>
<para>The instructions from Minter Ellison said that you must go on the basis of common agreements and common clauses in the ANTA agreement. So it was the Commonwealth government itself that excluded from the processes of the intergovernmental agreement the national legislative framework. The fault lies with the Commonwealth government, and it now seeks to use this as a pretext for its abolition of the Australian National Training Authority. We know that you cannot get genuinely national consistency without that legislative underpinning. We know from the railways how difficult it is to get eight separate governments to move together to ensure that there is one single railway gauge throughout the country. We know how difficult it has been in the history of this country to have that sort of standardised approach. A national recognition of vocational qualifications is much harder to achieve than the standardisation of the railway gauges.</para>
<para>ANTA worked tirelessly towards this objective. Under its stewardship, I think that considerable progress was made. But it is totally dishonest to now turn around and say that more progress has not been made because of ANTA when in fact it was the Commonwealth government’s own policy and the instructions that its lawyers and public servants issued that have led to that result. The Commonwealth government, despite the fact it is providing only 35 per cent of the funding, is seeking to impose its will upon the system in such a way as to sweep away the achievements and the structures of vocational education that have produced such great results over the last decade and a half. This government is seeking to use that one-third funding to bully the states in a rather ham-fisted way to accept the ideologically-driven plans of the extremists within this government.</para>
<para>In the industrial relations situation, that has become all too apparent. The government is seeking to impose its antiquated, facile approach to industrial relations through the use of AWAs. It wishes to shut out the voice of working people when it comes to vocational education. It seeks to impose upon the vocational education system a narrow and extremist view of the definition of industry. Take for instance the question of the national industry skills committee that this government is seeking to impose. It says that the committee will have: one employer nominated by the Australian government; one employer representative of ACCI; one employer representative of the AiG; one employer representative from the Business Council; one representative from the National Farmers Federation; three other employers nominated by the Commonwealth; and one single, solitary representative of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. That is its idea of fairness. That is its idea of trying to ensure that people get a fair approach and fair access to information and advice.</para>
<para>So we will have nine members, one of which will be a member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the eight others will be employers. So we have a crucial body with no other representation from the states and territories and no other representation from the various bodies responsible for the actual provision of the training. The states and territories are frozen out of the national decision-making processes. It is not just working people; it is also the states, which provide two-thirds of the money for the operation of the vocational education scheme.</para>
<para>There were 84 staff at ANTA of whom 76 are now leaving. That is an incredible loss of corporate memory. It is an extraordinary waste of expertise. It is a massive loss of corporate and collective knowledge and expertise. Frankly, the vocational education system in this country is notoriously complex, and it is complex by necessity. These are extremely important issues that we are dealing with. We cannot afford to lose 76 out of the 84 staff. We cannot afford to lose that level of understanding. This is a very sad indictment of an extremist government. It shows a lack of vision and a lack of understanding and is a real indictment of the destructive nature of a regime that now thinks that, because it controls the Senate, it can do whatever likes.</para>
<para>The government’s concern is that there has been a failure to have a more simplified and streamlined approach to vocational education and training. Where is the evidence for these complaints? Where is the criticism that the government points to? Where is it coming from? I certainly have not seen much of it. The ANTA board itself has sought to draw to our attention its concerns. In a letter to the minister on 15 April 2005, the ANTA board set out what it considers to be a responsible set of principles to ensure the continuation of an industry led national vocational education system. Among other things, the ANTA board said that there had to be a mutuality of influence between government and industry in decision making. That is quite apparently lacking in these arrangements.</para>
<para>The second thing that the ANTA board said there had to be was a genuinely independent secretariat to serve the advisory bodies. That has yet to be established, because it is assumed that the department of education, who have long been at war with ANTA, will take over those responsibilities. So that second point from the ANTA board has yet to be acknowledged as being important. I suppose Mr David Hind will look with some disappointment on the fact that the government has failed on that point. The third critical issue was that there be continued leadership in improving outcomes for people with disabilities and for Indigenous Australians. I notice that the last on this list has been all but ignored. Three out of three, Dr Nelson; you have failed. The key points that the chair of the ANTA board, David Hind, wrote to you about in terms of the concerns of the ANTA board have not been acknowledged. There has been no genuine independent secretariat for this new advisory structure. There has been no mutuality in the way employers, the government and of course workers can influence decision making about training policy. What we have here is an employer dominated group. We now have a situation where those fundamental principles of tripartite decision making have been rejected.</para>
<para>The national vocational education system in terms of the principles set out by the ANTA board reflects the aspirations and the goals of ANTA itself. They articulate the interests of workers and of trainees. It is a model which has worked exceptionally well in this country and has provided us with an international reputation that we should be proud of.</para>
<para>What we have here is a government whose short-sightedness has fundamentally undermined the national vocational education and training system in this country. The sector will be unable to meet the aspirations that ANTA has set down because this government has undermined the philosophical principles that produced a truly effective national training scheme, which had the fundamental presumption of there being a need for genuine partnership and a unity of purpose. That is what ANTA brought to the national training system and that is what I am afraid the new arrangements brought into play by this government will so heavily discount. We will see a situation where in the future the very best of this country in terms of knowledge and expertise will be removed from the effective administration—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Despite what we have just heard from the senator opposite, the sky is not going to cave in when the <inline ref="R2340">Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2332">Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005</inline> go through the Senate. The provision of leadership in the area of vocational training, particularly leadership from this government, is going to continue and is going to be provided in great abundance. The training outputs of the national system, complemented hopefully by reformed state systems, will continue to be excellent. I want to come back later to the output of the training system as led by the federal government, which has been so heavily criticised by Senator Carr and others on that side of the chamber who have spoken before me.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It has become crystal clear over recent years that the states and the territories are the ones who, in fact, have fallen short in their responsibility to provide an efficient, successful and outcomes focused vocational education and training system. Indeed, I would submit, as a former minister for training in a state system, that much of the blame for the current skills shortages being experienced in the various sectors of the Australian economy can be clearly sheeted home to the failure of the Labor states to have a serious go at fixing their VET systems.</para>
<para>I am not going to focus too much on the Queensland government today because there will be other opportunities for me to talk about the devastation that they have wreaked on the VET system that I left behind. There will be other times, but today I will focus very specifically on the contents of these bills. I see gross failure at a state level as being the main cause of the issues that Senator Carr has raised, which is one of the reasons that, once the pressure was applied by the federal government, the states have very quickly launched inquiries into how they can fix up their system. Quite frankly, unless they heed some of the advice that is coming from my side of politics, they will not fix their VET systems.</para>
<para>What this legislation reflects is the Howard government’s commitment—in light of the states’ inability to act—to tackle the challenges facing the VET system and to help restore quality and excellence. At this point I would like to take the opportunity to commend my colleague and fellow Queenslander, the member for Moreton in the other place, for his dedication as Minister for Vocational and Technical Education. The legislation is before us today due to his personal commitment to build and secure a quality VET system for all Australians. I know that he has been backed up 100 per cent by Minister Nelson in doing so. I also note that, as a result of the minister’s proactive discussions with state ministers over recent months, he has been able to obtain some agreement from them on a number of facets of this legislation. Additionally, the recent concession by the state premiers that they must work towards ensuring the portability of apprenticeship qualifications across state borders stands as another testament to the minister’s ability to achieve outcomes.</para>
<para>I appreciate the minister’s contribution all the more given my time as the Queensland minister responsible for vocational education and training. In my time in that role I grappled with many of the same challenges facing him now. I must say that I think the package that the minister has developed represents a viable, robust and incisive series of reforms—a series of reforms that represent an excellent opportunity to achieve substantial improvements in the VET system. The process of developing this package has attracted much interest from the TAFE sector. To their credit, many people within TAFE have been supportive of change. They too recognise that there are substantial problems facing the sector and they have happily suggested a number of constructive reforms.</para>
<para>What we have here is a bill many provisions of which the Labor states and key components of TAFE have ticked off. This is not the scorched earth bill that members opposite suggest it is. It is a bill which the Labor-run states and TAFE—which, as I am about to say, is very heavily union dominated—have ticked off. Many of these provisions have been ticked off in a bipartisan fashion. There is, however, a core of belligerent individuals hell-bent on preventing any change, no matter how sensible the proposal. Their complaints as represented by their colleagues in the Australian Labor Party, particularly those who have spoken in this debate in the other place and here today, are summed up rather succinctly in an ABC report from April of this year—yes, I do listen to the ABC, very carefully. The report said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the states say they will not agree to the Commonwealth training package because it is unfair to teachers.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Unfair to teachers! There was no mention of students, no mention of retraining unemployed persons so that they can be helped into employment and no mention of apprentices or trainees. All that was mentioned was that it was unfair to the heavily unionised work force of TAFE teachers. That is what is at the hub of this argument. What senators opposite are seeking to do is protect the privileged place, the privileged position, of a heavily unionised work force. They ignore the difficulties facing students, apprentices and trainees and focus solely on demanding absolutely no change to their current archaic industrial arrangements.</para>
<para>This, I suggest, is the sole cause of their opposition. It is not the increased levels of funding offered to the TAFE sector, which in fact are happening. It is not the commitment of the government to remove impediments to competency based qualifications. It is not the proposals to increase the utilisation of TAFE assets. It is none of these things. Opposition to this legislation is based solely on the unions’ hostility towards achieving workplace flexibility. That opposition is completely unfounded. The stated reasons for their so-called concerns have been disproved time and time again.</para>
<para>Workplace flexibility does not mean that you will be forced into a contract. They know this, but as usual they will not face up to the facts. Workplace flexibility does not mean that you will not retain your right to join a union, call a union representative or ask a union representative to help you negotiate a workplace agreement, if indeed you want the assistance of a union representative. Workplace flexibility does not deprive you of your right to collectively bargain. What it does is provide you with an opportunity to negotiate an AWA if you choose to do so. If you do choose to negotiate an AWA, you can do so in the full knowledge that any agreement must under the law be superior to the terms and conditions of your covering award. There is no requirement to accept or even negotiate an AWA. The only requirement is that TAFEs offer employees an opportunity to negotiate one.</para>
<para>What flexibility will do is remove one of the major impediments to addressing our skills shortages. TAFEs deliver the vast majority of apprentice training in skills shortage areas. Flexibility will allow TAFE managers to align their training much more closely with the needs of apprentices and their employers. There are many other good proposals in this bill, particularly in terms of working towards the effective portability of qualifications across state borders, something which, as I have already said, was agreed to and ticked off by the Labor states. There is a lot of good stuff in this bill, and many good provisions have been ticked off by the Labor states. The proposed appropriations and funding mechanisms are also excellent developments in terms of securing a sustainable future for the VET system, including the changes in the administrative arrangements that senators opposite, particularly Senator Carr, have railed against.</para>
<para>I worked very closely with ANTA. I am actually one of the people in this chamber who has had almost three years of working experience in relation to ANTA. The Australian National Training Authority was established in 1992 to coordinate the levels of government in establishing a national vocational education and training system. Closing ANTA down, even by the stretch of the wildest imagination of anyone who sits on the other side, is in no way the detrimental act of vandalism that people opposite are accusing us of perpetrating. Twelve years on, this national system with industry leadership—the national system that ANTA was created to nurture—is in fact in place.</para>
<para>We need to have a look at some of the circumstances that were in place back in 1992 when ANTA was established. Australia then faced an unemployment rate of 10 per cent. Today the unemployment rate stands at 5.1 per cent. We now face quite a different predicament: the need to maximise Australia’s skills base to make sure that we can provide the skilled workers that industry and businesses need, where and when they need them. Twelve years ago, before the establishment of ANTA, Australia had eight separate training systems operating quite independently of each other with the content and delivery of training largely determined by training providers. Today the foundations of a national system are largely in place. However, real progress on a number of key issues has been thwarted by the states and territories, by Labor Party state ministers—not by the people in ANTA, not by the very dedicated group of people that I got to know and who have been very committed to advancing the interests of a genuinely national vocational education and training system, but by Labor state ministers responsible for the development of a national system of vocational education and training.</para>
<para>In the light of this, the Australian government has determined that it will play a genuine leadership role in continuing to promote and put in place a genuine system of vocational education and training. The abolition of ANTA and the transfer of its functions to the department reflects the Australian government’s commitment to a more integrated and proactive approach to the education and training needs of young people.</para>
<para>I heard Senator Carr talk about 74 or 76 people who used to work for ANTA leaving ANTA. What happens when administrative arrangements are changed subsequent to elections and subsequent to government decisions is that some people will have to consider what they do next and where they are going to go under the new arrangements. The advice that I have received is that, if those ANTA people had wanted to integrate themselves back into the machinery of government responsible for the administration and development of a genuine vocational education and training system, they could have gone over to the department and they could have continued to contribute the undoubtedly magnificent skills and corporate memory that they had developed as a result of their diligent application in ANTA.</para>
<para>I take this opportunity to say thank you to all those people who committed themselves to the development of excellence in vocational education and training across our nation. I believe most of them will still continue, in one way or another, to make a contribution to the development of excellence and to the sustainment of excellence in our vocational education and training system, be it at a state level or at a federal level. But the advice that I have is that none of them were asked to go or were not afforded further opportunity to serve in the training system that they helped to create.</para>
<para>I heard Senator Carr talk about the new national industry skills committee. He railed about the lack of adequate union representation on that committee. What that particular statement underlines is the basic misunderstanding that the Labor Party have of training in this country and it also underlines their true motives. The misunderstanding is that they have failed to acknowledge, time after time, that the two most essential components of the training system are the employers and the trained output. If you do not have the employers participating and having a fundamentally dominant and entrenched role in the provision of training, they will not have the confidence that employers need to have in order to employ the trained outputs. You can never move away from that reality. You just cannot move away from that basic reality.</para>
<para>I say to the senators opposite that this government has its priorities right. It is not a matter of ideology; it is a matter of creating competence in the training market that gives the employer the trained output that they need to have in order to have the confidence to employ them. That is the first misunderstanding that is constantly propagated—probably deliberately—by senators opposite and other members of the Labor Party. The employer is the fundamental underpinning of a training system.</para>
<para>The other thing that has happened—and I think Australians are increasingly realising the importance of this point—is that the Labor Party have lost the battle of ideology when it comes to workplace relations. We have heard reflected in the speeches made by Senator Carr and undoubtedly we will hear in the speech that is about to made by Senator Marshall that they are now looking towards perhaps extending the activities of the unions into the area of training. Having lost the battle of ideology when it comes to workplace relations, they are now seeking to increase their influence, their relevance and their recruiting practices within the area of vocational education and training. This has been going on now for approximately 10 years as, progressively, union membership in the more traditional trades and other areas where union membership has been high continues to decline.</para>
<para>They are trying to shift the ground so that they can gain relevance in an area where, with all due respect, they should not be seeking the relevance that they are demanding. I see a sinister motive—a very sinister motive: a cynical and ideological motive—for their determination to get themselves even more involved in the area of training. Nobody is denying anybody the ability to have their input, but I again reiterate a point that I fervently believe—that is, that the two most essential components of a training system are the employers and the people being trained. Without a very good relationship between those two components, you just do not get an output that employers have confidence in employing.</para>
<para>Let us look at what this government has done in terms of funding. This year the Australian government will spend a record $2.5 billion on vocational and technical education, including an additional injection of over $280 million for a suite of new initiatives designed to address skills needs, particularly in the traditional trades. The funding package for 2005-06—and we have not heard this from those opposite—includes: $343.6 million to establish the 24 Australian technical colleges in regional, and I stress regional, and also metropolitan locations suffering skill needs, to provide quality education and trade training for senior secondary students; $4.3 million to establish the institute of trade skills excellence, which will provide industry, as a key client of the national training system, with the capacity to identify, acknowledge, reward and promote excellence in skill development and training; $20.7 million for a tool kit for each new apprentice starting an apprenticeship in specific trades from 1 July 2005; $12.6 million for an additional 5,000 places in the New Apprenticeships Access Program, which assists job seekers who experience barriers to skilled employment to obtain and maintain a new apprenticeship; $5.8 million towards an additional 7,000 school based new apprenticeship opportunities and up to 4,500 pre-vocational training places in the trades over the next four years through group training arrangements; and $15.3 million for a scholarship for new apprentices who successfully complete the first and second year of a new apprenticeship in a trade with skills needs with a small to medium sized business.</para>
<para>That level of funding and these initiatives clearly underline this government’s commitment to the development of vocational education and training for this year. I could go on and talk about the in-training numbers, the record completions, the traditional trades, women in New Apprenticeships, young people and mature-age workers in New Apprenticeships and the satisfaction levels that have been measured in relation to all the participants in the system. The figures for those have been put on the record time after time in this place and in the other place. All of those figures show that, under the system of vocational education and training, for which the federal government has been providing key leadership, there has been a massive increase in all of those key areas. To pick up on the last point made by Senator Carr, we now have record low numbers of long-term unemployed people as they have been placed in employment, mainly the result of the Howard government’s training initiatives. I am very proud to support this bill, and I am very proud to support and recognise the achievement of this government in vocational education and training and, in particular, in the strong national leadership role that it has played since it came to power in 1996.</para>

<para>—I rise today to address yet another piece of flawed legislation that combines all the worst aspects of the government’s hubris and contempt for the welfare and prosperity of the Australian people and I thank the previous speaker, Senator Santoro, for most adequately demonstrating that point on behalf of the government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Howard government continues to wage a contemptible war on the workplace rights of Australia’s men and women whilst disregarding the real needs of our economy and, in particular, the skills shortage. The legislation before ustoday is no different in this regard and it too highlights in a stark sense the hypocrisy of the Howard government over education and training issues. There is gross hypocrisy in this government’s position on training issues. During its first term in office, the Howard government tore millions of dollars out of vocational education and training and then spent the remainder of the past decade ignoring the frantic cries for support of the sector in order for it to meet Australia’s training needs. Those calls were ignored at the time, yet, today—in the midst of a skills crisis—we have some government action. That action, however, outlines a regime of legislative proscription comprising interference in and control over institutions that would have been deemed excessive even in Franco’s Spain let alone in the field of public vocational education and training in Australia in the 21st century.</para>
<para>The objectives of the bills before the Senate are appropriate enough, but the text of the legislation itself completely fails to meet them. We do need to provide a highly skilled work force which will meet the future needs of Australian businesses, industries, communities and individuals, and promote a national approach to the delivery of vocational education and training. We must ensure that this occurs through collaboration and cooperation between the Commonwealth, the states, unions, businesses and educational institutions for us to support a national training system that is responsive to the needs of industry, employers and workers. Undoubtedly, the system should ensure high quality and nationally consistent vocational education and training, but the government alludes to making the system streamlined and simple to access. Since when has the Howard government ever been concerned about simplifying and streamlining?</para>
<para>The Minister for Education, Science and Training in particular has made it more difficult for education providers, participants and aspirants in general with practically every piece of legislation he has introduced into the parliament. Again, this legislation is no different. Simplification of vocational education and training is a noble ambition, but one that has already been lost through the dissolution of the Australian National Training Authority and the attempt to impose shameful workplace relations requirements on educators. On this issue, it is worth noting that the Liberal and National parties are deliberately ambushing our vocational education and training providers—and that has also been the case with the higher education sector. These providers are being placed in an impossible situation in which their funding is tied to circumstances that are unwanted, unnecessary and impossible to implement. It is yet another example of this government placing ideology over commonsense and decency. There is not, to disappoint government senators, an easy or quick answer to addressing the skills shortage, and this legislation will certainly not do the job. There are many aspects of vocational education that cannot simply be sped up or streamlined and, by placing educators on workplace agreements that undermine their job security, nothing will be done to improve the current skills crisis.</para>
<para>Then there is the element of uncertainty introduced with the legislation by making annual payments to the states for the sector reliant upon the federal minister’s discretion. An obvious question is: what happens if and when the government decides to fund a particular training course for only two out of three years? What happens then? Will the trainees then have to somehow find the resources to pay for private finalisation of their qualifications? It is a preposterous situation. So too is the intention of the legislation to give back some funding to the sector—mind you, via private providers—with money that should have otherwise been pouring into the public vocational education sector for years. The fact is that the money promised by this legislation is money that has been withheld from the public system for years. It is not really new money at all. It is worth noting the minister’s previous experience in spending public money to prop up private education facilities and how that became an absolute disaster. We all remember that great white elephant that was Melbourne University Private.</para>
<para>It is of great concern to me that government senators would be so excited at the prospect of opening up our public education facilities for the use of private providers. They seem to forget the crucial point that publicly funded educational infrastructure has always been designed and paid for on the premise that it would facilitate the training of those in the pubic system. If private providers cannot afford to fund the necessary resources they need in order to offer high-quality training alternatives to those offered by the public system, it is not the job of the Australian government to financially prop them up. Whatever your ideology, this situation does not make good economic sense.</para>
<para>The government cannot simply, for the first time in a decade, pull its head out of the sand, glance about, finally hear the cries from individuals in the community, from businesses, unions, the states—from the entire nation—and from the OECD, and react by glossing over a decade of negligence, throwing a paltry and inadequate sum of cash on the table, and then patting itself on the back for a job well done. The government’s inaction has been a job far from well done.</para>
<para>Calling upon the states and territories to increase their funding to the sector is yet another example of the hypocrisy and empty words used with callous abandon by government members in this place. There are aspects of this legislation that would be embarrassing if, in its entirety, the legislation was not such a disgrace. Abolishing the Australian National Training Authority Ministerial Council and replacing it with the vocational education ministerial council, which has the exact same composition and responsibilities as its predecessor, is obviously a pure stroke of genius. Suffice it to say that it is an excellent example of the astonishing semantic foresight of this government. With this breadth of vision and commitment to radical restructuring that is so profound that to the average Australian it might seem pointless and unnecessary, it is not hard to see how the situation got this bad in the first place. What characterised the success of ANTA was its tripartite nature. Established with, and composed of, government, workers and business, it was an effective example of functional federalism through the collaborative approach adopted by state and Commonwealth governments, and of partnership with the community and business. Its success can easily be measured by our country’s current prosperity.</para>
<para>If this government was serious about anything other than union bashing then it would acknowledge that the quality of training provided in public institutions throughout the community is essential to ensure flexibility in our work force. Comprehensive training, combined with a stable and resourced vocational education and training sector that allows for additional and rapid retraining, is what is required but what this legislation will fail to deliver if Labor’s amendments are not adopted. Is it arrogance that is causing the government to knowingly destroy the opportunities of a generation of deserving Australians, or is it ignorance? Or is it a sad combination of both?</para>
<para>Apprentice drop-out rates remain unacceptably high. However, nothing in the legislation before us counters this issue, or seeks to address the poor pay and conditions many apprentices have to endure. In 2003, there were some 46,000 deserving applicants nationally who were denied a place in one of Australia’s TAFE courses. The government must now recognise that meeting this demand is another crucial step towards addressing the skills crisis. This situation has represented an absolute insult to the Australian people and the Australian economy. In particular, it is an insult to the thousands of students who have applied for and deserved entry into our TAFE courses over the past decade but, due to a lack of funding and not their inabilities, have been denied a place. When businesses in the information and communications technology sector, in the electrical and electronics industries, in the food, health, science, building and engineering industries, are all suffering from skills shortfalls, how can this government justify turning away thousands of aspiring Australians with the merits and qualifications to learn? You cannot ignore the fact that the privatisation of public utilities and infrastructure has also played its part in contributing to the decline in apprenticeship training.</para>
<para>User choice in the legislation must also be clarified. Under the plan, it will be all too easy for unscrupulous employers to exploit apprentices in tandem with private providers, by insisting upon their choice of training at a cost disadvantageous to the apprentice. This concerns me greatly, as it would the community generally. How then do we develop a system that delivers high-quality vocational education to the Australian people and leaves trainees skilled and productive, a flexible work force that can adapt to new technologies and work practices that meet Australia’s social needs—in particular those of our ageing population—and is not left behind by the fast pace of technology and innovation, and changing work patterns? We will certainly not do so with this legislation, that is for sure.</para>
<para>We do not have a skills shortage in this country—we have a skills crisis. In March this year, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper in Melbourne reported that there were 1.7 million people in Australia who were unemployed, underemployed or prematurely retired. Many of these people are lacking in the skills and training they need to fill the job vacancies that have been identified for them. We cannot pretend that this has just occurred. We did not all wake up yesterday to find a skills crisis in this country. And it is not an issue that can be solved by offering a poisoned chalice of funding and stripping the entire work force of their basic human rights.</para>
<para>Let us not forget that the promise of financial aid from the Commonwealth to the states under this legislation is tainted by more than the ideological gun the government is holding to their heads; it is also tainted by the wider implications of the aforementioned changes to the infrastructure of Australian workplaces. Even if—and we have to really stretch our imaginations here—this package was capable of providing more skilled workers for Australia, potential workplaces will be suffering tremendous instability from the foul legislation proposed by this government to strip away the rights of working people to fair pay and conditions. The turmoil and crisis this government has provoked, through its neglect of the funding of vocational training, is about to be multiplied a hundredfold throughout the workplaces of Australia.</para>
<para>Our ageing population means that Australia requires more health professionals to care for our elderly and more tax revenue to pay for this care, and the retirement of workers from sensitive industries is going to further exacerbate the skills crisis. This issue requires real and immediate attention, not diversions such as the legislation before us today.</para>
<para>No legislation with industrial relations components can be considered by this chamber without recognising the deliberate attempt by this government to politically persecute union members and violate their rights as stated by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This legislation, with its AWA proposition, is no different.</para>
<para>But let us take a look at AWAs. They have been a real embarrassment for the government. The 2.4 per cent of the workplaces they cover hardly validates the always false mantra that the award and enterprise bargaining system is outdated. The fact is that the system is obviously superior to that of individual contracts, the vast majority of Australians support it and it should not be messed with. So how does a government drunk on power and determined to crush any organisation or individual capable of exposing its unfairness, inadequacy or hypocrisy get more people to sign up to dud AWA deals? It forces them to, of course. If, after 10 years, over 97 per cent of Australians have shown that they are not interested in AWAs then it is clear what the government is trying to do with legislation such as this: it is social engineering of the worst kind.</para>
<para>Why are we spending billions of dollars on a war which is now supposedly about bringing democracy to the Middle East when we are stripping our own citizens of the most basic rights, including the right to freedom of expression? I despair for the National and Liberal parties of the coalition. I have always believed you to be ethically and ideologically inadequate when it came to governing, but I am disgusted by how underhanded and despicable your actions have become. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

<para>—My question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. I refer the minister to Telstra CEO Sol Trujillo’s declaration to the shareholders last week that he was hired by the board ‘to tell the truth’. Can the minister confirm that the truth Mr Trujillo told the Telstra board is that Australia is in the bottom quartile of developed countries in terms of its telecommunications services? Does the minister recall the Prime Minister’s statement during the last election campaign when he said:</para>

<para>—Thank you, Senator Conroy, for the question. The situation with services in Australia is of course that this government has invested over a billion dollars to ensure that, whilst and until competition works more evenly and matures right across Australia, it identifies areas of unmet need where services from time to time have been patchy and makes the investment to ensure that services are adequate for those in rural and regional Australia. It is very interesting to see on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> today a glowing story about how those in rural and regional Australia are certainly much more satisfied with services provided by Telstra. I think it shows quite clearly, and indeed the story featured shows in point, that services that were undreamt of a matter of a couple of years ago are now regularly and quite routinely available right across Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government’s approach to encouraging competition—which means that there is a range of competitive services available in populous areas and a lot of choice for consumers together with regulated safeguards that look after the interests of consumers and targeted investment either where there is market failure or where it is uncommercial for telecommunications providers to go—is in fact a formula that has seen the roll-out of broadband double across this country, just in the course of the year that I have been in this portfolio. We now have I think nearly two million subscribers, and we are actually climbing on the OECD ladder. In fact, we are now in the top 10 countries when measured by the rate of take-up of broadband.</para>
<para>I do not think it could be said that services in rural and regional Australia are anything other than vastly improved by this government’s consistent investment in what is needed by way of broadband and by way of targeted infrastructure. This will ensure that there are backbones that provide up-and-down links and a range of technologies that give rise to services in health, education and distance learning. These are all areas I have seen with my own eyes, having been to some 45 communities that are rolling out broadband.</para>
<para>From my own experience and having regard to the government’s record on the level of investment in this country, it is fair to say that services are well and truly adequate. That is not to say that, as this government looks to future proofing the bush, there is not some need to look at some future arrangements. With technology changing so quickly, you do not know in five years time what is coming down the pipeline. Technology that is adequate now will not necessarily be adequate in five years time. That is the area where some provision needs to be made to ensure that services are not only adequate now but will remain so into the future.</para>

<para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister inform the Senate how much money Telstra has spent on share buybacks to prop up the price of the stock over the last three years? Does the minister agree that, because of these buybacks, Telstra has failed to make essential investments in its network and thereby has reduced the competitiveness of Australian businesses? Don’t Mr Trujillo’s comments show that the Telstra board has been focused on the government’s desire to fatten up Telstra for sale rather than on delivering services for businesses and consumers in this country?</para>

There is some capital expenditure money in the budget, as I understand it, that Telstra will be providing to remediate some of the exchanges. Senator Conroy would know that this government is not going to leave behind the people in rural and regional Australia. This is in contrast to the Labor Party, who have not had a plan to spend a cent in rural and regional Australia. They have not in the past and they certainly do not now. They are a one-trick pony. They are only interested in retaining Telstra and are devoid of any idea for the bush.</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Trood for his first question and congratulate him. He comes with impressive qualifications in international affairs and defence and he will be a great asset to the Senate. I am pleased to announce today that the federal government has chosen Gibbs and Cox as the preferred designer for the $6 billion Air Warfare Destroyer Project—one of Australia’s largest and most complex defence projects. The selection of Gibbs and Cox as the platform designer now completes the team whose responsibility it is to deliver the Air Warfare Destroyer Project. Gibbs and Cox will join alliance partners ASC Shipbuilder Pty Ltd and Raytheon Australia, who will work together over the next phase of the project.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Gibbs and Cox was chosen through a competitive tender evaluation process that also included the German company Blohm and Voss and the Spanish company Navantia. Gibbs and Cox has been chosen to further develop an evolved design. Navantia will remain in the competition as the designer of an Australianised version of the existing F100 design. The two designs will be considered by the government before final project approval in 2007.</para>
<para>This announcement closely follows the government’s approval of the first stage of the $2 billion amphibious ships project, which will provide the Navy with a world-class capability to deploy land forces on operations. Australian shipbuilders will be invited to tender for either or both of two very capable designs. The two designs are a Spanish Navantia ship at approximately 27,000 tonnes and a French Armaris Mistral ship with an additional troop-carrying capability at approximately 22,000 tonnes. A request for tender will be released in the second quarter of 2006. The preferred shipbuilder will be determined once a thorough financial and technical comparison is made between Australian bids and the overseas build options.</para>
<para>These new ships represent a quantum leap in the amphibious lift and air warfare capabilities of the Navy and will enter service from 2012 and 2013 respectively. The air warfare destroyers will deliver an area air warfare capability that will be able to provide air defence for other ADF assets including forces ashore and friendly aircraft against hostile aircraft and missiles over large areas. This control of the sea and air will give Australia, through an amphibious capability that will include embarked troop lift and armed reconnaissance helicopters, the ability to lift, lodge, sustain and withdraw a combined arms battle group consisting of an embarked force of up to 2,000 personnel and their vehicles and equipment wherever the government determines.</para>
<para>Together these capabilities will ensure that the ADF maintains sufficient flexibility to provide military response options to a wide range of contingencies including evacuation of Australian nationals overseas, humanitarian assistance missions, the protection of our vital maritime trading routes and warlike operations. The government is delivering on its $50 billion decade-long plan to provide the ADF of the future with the best possible equipment to do its job. National security will remain of the highest priority to the Howard government. I would like to thank Defence, which is progressing these major projects in a very professional and responsible way.</para>

I refer the minister to the latest OECD figures which rank Australia 21st out of 30 developed countries for broadband use. Is the minister aware that Australian consumers are paying up to three times as much as Korean consumers to access a high-speed broadband connection? Is the minister also aware that entry-level broadband products in Canada are six times faster, allow 30 times the amount of downloads and are 10 per cent cheaper than the equivalent Australian product?

<para>—Thank you, Senator McEwen, for the question. I do not know whether it is the first one, Senator, but thank you for the question anyway. As I said in response to a question asked by Senator Conroy, the OECD figures I have show that Australia has now moved into 10th position on the rate of take-up of broadband, because broadband in this country is growing exponentially. What you will find, if you have a look at the figures, is that we now have about two million subscribers to broadband, whereas about a year ago it was a much smaller figure. This has largely been driven by the fact that consumers have become aware of the great benefits of broadband and how it enables them to live, work and do business in a way that they could not with slower dial-up services.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The figures show that, particularly in populous areas, there is a range of ways in which broadband can be provided over different platforms with different technologies. That is precisely how consumers get choice, competition and lower prices. Then, when you move to areas where it is uncommercial for these services to be provided, and because the government is interested in areas of market failure and in preserving competitive neutrality, all service providers get an opportunity to provide it in these noncommercial areas with a subsidy from the government. What the subsidy means is that people in rural and regional areas can get these valuable services at comparable prices to those in the more populous areas.</para>
<para>What I would say to Senator McEwen is: it is a very sketchy case indeed to say that this country is not able to access broadband pretty much right across the country at reasonable speeds. Senator McEwen is lucky that she was not here when the Labor Party, in a never-to-be-forgotten Senate report, recommended to this government that they spend $5 billion on mandating dial-up internet. If ever there would have been a way to do the taxpayers’ dough, Senator McEwen would have seen that written large in the Senate committee report. In answer to her question: this government, because of its subsidies, has ensured that broadband is available across the country. We will continue to look after services in rural and regional Australia and we will ensure that no Australian is left behind in telecommunications.</para>

<para>—In response to the supplementary question, I assume that Senator McEwen is aware that this government has recently had an inquiry into the state of the competition regime in Australia and that discussions have been going on for some weeks, probably months, as to whether or not there should be a form of operational separation for Telstra because of its vertical integration. That, together with other responses that the government will have under consideration as a result of that inquiry, will ensure that this government continue to have a very sound and very robust competition regime. This of course is in contradistinction to the Labor Party, whose best response to this was to slice and dice Telstra. That was Mr Tanner’s plan, and I noticed that he is at it again. Mr Tanner, the real opposition spokesman on telecommunications, is back to his old tricks.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I thank Senator Brandis for that question. We do hear occasionally from self-interested commentators in the opposition that there is some sort of infrastructure crisis in Australia and that we should be putting a whole lot more federal government money into infrastructure. Against that backdrop, it was interesting to read the June quarter <inline font-style="italic">Investment Monitor</inline> from Access Economics. That report outlined major capital projects in Australia, either planned or under way, totalling no less than $375 billion just in the June quarter this year—up 16 per cent on the same period a year ago. We not only have this large number of projects under way, but there is a very big pipeline of projects coming down the track.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The figures on actual quarterly infrastructure spending tell the same story. The engineering construction figures from the ABS show that engineering expenditure grew by seven per cent in the March quarter and 12 per cent over the year. In the March quarter of 1996, when we came to office, engineering expenditure was $3.6 billion. In the March quarter this year, it is $8.3 billion. That is an increase of 82 per cent under our government in real terms. Similarly, when we came to office, the market cap of listed infrastructure funds on the ASX was less than $1 billion, and today it is $27 billion. All these statistics go to show that this talk of a crisis is nonsense and that, in fact, there are large increases in infrastructure spending going on in this very strong economy.</para>
<para>Against that backdrop, it was interesting to hear Mr Beazley say last June that he was going to campaign on this issue throughout the winter recess. He did not say what his policy was or which projects he thought should be funded either by the public or by the private sector, so we waited in eager anticipation to see this campaign in the winter recess and to hear about his plans and policies for infrastructure in this country. We did not see a lot from Mr Beazley on any issue in the winter recess, but then, on 1 August, right towards the end of the winter recess, the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> reported that Labor’s policy on this very important matter was to form a committee and to have a year-long inquiry into the subject. The chairman of this committee was to be none other than the infamous former Queensland Labor apparatchik, Mike Kaiser—whom we know all about—and the deputy chairman was going to be the National Secretary of the CFMEU. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>, this committee was going to be looking into ‘issuing special government bonds’. What that means is increasing debt, which of course was the way they ran their government last time, when debt rose by $66 billion in their last five years in government.</para>
<para>Labor are also apparently going to consider setting up public interest corporations, presumably like WA Inc., Tricontinental in Victoria and the Victorian Economic Development Corporation. This suggests that Labor simply have not learned anything from their nine years in opposition—absolutely nothing at all. This is clearly the old Left, which Senator Conroy keeps trying to beat, back in charge of Labor’s policy. When they do not have a policy, what they do—as they do on so many subjects—is to set up an inquiry, put a few apparatchiks in charge, go away and come back with all the Socialist Left rhetoric.</para>

<para>—I thank the senator for the question. The advice I have about the people concerned is that the woman was first granted a visa to accompany her husband to Australia in August 2003. She applied for a waiver of the ‘no further stay’ condition in November 2003. The request for waiver of the ‘no further stay’ condition was refused, and two bridging visas were issued. She complied with all the visa requirements and departed Australia in January 2004, before her visa expired.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Subsequently, in January 2004, she applied for a visa to visit her brother, which was granted. I can confirm that Senator Lightfoot provided written assurance that he believed that Ms Amin would not apply for protection as a refugee if she was granted a further stay as a visitor. She complied with all visa requirements and departed Australia in June 2004, before her visa expired. To date, no record of an application for protection by Ms Amin has been located. Members of parliament from all parties regularly make representations to the department, and to the minister, on behalf of individuals seeking a certain migration outcome. That is their right. Many would say it is the obligation of members of parliament who believe in a particular cause.</para>
<para>I hope the suggestion is not that, if someone puts in a protection visa claim, I should not look at it and any representations from members of parliament. If that is the Labor Party view, please tell me. When I get representations from people on the other side in relation to people who have come here as students or whatever and later decided to put a protection visa claim in, if you do not think I should listen to them, I will be happy to take that into account.</para>
<para>If we also want to talk about members making representations, I had a bit of a chance to reflect on history the other day as I was reading the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>. On page 22 there was an article headed, ‘Forty years of favours’. It reminds members with a shorter memory that Mr Grassby—who at one stage was immigration minister—according to the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline>, while in Italy arranged the issue of entry permits to Australia for three members of the Barbaro family, who had previously been denied entry on the grounds of bad character. One of them had previously been deported from Australia. Italian police had arrested one of them when he returned to Plati and charged him with having kidnapped the teenage son of an industrialist four months before. Mr Grassby also, according to the article, made representations to the Treasurer on behalf of Tony Sergi over Sergi’s tax problems. Sergi was named four years later by the Woodward royal commission as a principal of the Griffith ‘honoured society’ and a major marijuana grower.</para>

<para>—The question went to a particular member of parliament, what advice he had offered people in relation to migration matters and whether he had used his office to assist them in any way. That is the nub of the question. I have answered that question. In fact, the department does not have a record of a particular person making a protection claim. This is another furphy, an allegation that has been dragged through the papers. As I understand it, at this point we have not been able to find a protection visa claim. The woman left Australia, unlike a lot of people on whose behalf people on the other side send me representations, who do not leave when they are meant to leave. All I was doing was making the point that senators and members are entitled to make representations and drawing on a little history of former Labor minister Grassby, who did make representations on behalf of a number of people of some particular interest. I have nothing further to add than that.</para>

<para>—If we want to go through the process of asking Immigration to go through every file to see which members have made representations to it and waste all that time and money, I suppose we could look at doing that. I have answered the question. I have indicated that members are entitled to make representations. I have said ‘no’ to representations made by very senior people on my side. I have said ‘yes’ to very new people, not on the front bench, on the other side. In other words, when it comes to ministerial intervention, things are considered on their merits, and I believe exactly the same is done in the department.</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Payne for the question. Senator Payne, like all senators on this side and many on the other side, has a longstanding interest in the benefit of first Australians and what we can all do to improve the life opportunities and choices for them. Our first regional partnership agreement with an Indigenous community was signed in Warburton in Western Australia on Friday. Sadly, I was unable to be there, but Minister Cobb represented me. Three shared responsibility agreements were also signed. With these agreements, the Australian government makes an agreement directly with a community, not by asking for someone with a clipboard to be there speaking on its behalf.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>They were signed by the Western Australian government, the Ngaanyatjarraku shire and the community council. They involve about $8 million from the Australian government, funding from the Western Australian government and contributions in cash and in kind from the communities. The regional partnership agreement is a very important step in the government’s reforms for Indigenous affairs. While the shared responsibility agreements focus on local communities, regional ones provide a much better avenue for strategic partnerships between the governments and the regional representative bodies.</para>
<para>The regional partnership agreement in this case covers 12 communities and over three years will provide support for the council to work with local communities and governments to achieve better outcomes and better ways to improve power and provide municipal services that the rest of us take for granted. I thank Senator Patterson’s department for contributing over $4 million to this. There is also provision for education for young adults and a youth centre. A number of Commonwealth agencies were involved, and I am pleased that the Western Australian government was involved and that Minister Kobelke was able to travel to Warburton and be a part of this very important ceremony.</para>
<para>These are basically well-governed communities. They have their problems, but they are tackling them head on. They are taking responsibility and doing something about them, giving us their view and getting ahead on their own. They have their own word for the concept of shared responsibility and mutual obligation. I am told they describe it as ‘chuck in, chuck in’. I am not sure that everyone understands the translation of that, but it means you put in and others put in, and that is what these agreements are about—everybody putting in. ‘Chuck in, chuck in’ will do.</para>
<para>In petrol sniffing it is interesting to see what has happened in the Warburton area. In the eighties and nineties there was a very big petrol-sniffing problem in this area. The community leaders have worked very hard to do what they can about it. They introduced their own by-laws in this area, I am told, in 1992 to provide penalties for trafficking and sniffing. They ensured that the by-laws were enforced. They introduced diversionary programs. They converted to avgas in 1996. And now the petrol sniffing problem has dramatically improved from what it was. When I was told about this over the weekend—because this information came, obviously, from my staff who were at this function—I asked, ‘How many people? Do they put one or two in jail?’ I was told that one week they put 30 people in jail. They do not back away from it as a community. They say, ‘We’ve got to do something about this.’ Mutujulu, of course, is in a different situation. It needs a lot more help.</para>
<para>So in answer to Senator Payne’s question: yes, there are very significant improvements happening. Communities are taking responsibility and sharing responsibility with the Commonwealth government, with state governments and with regional areas. But they are all very different. In Warburton they are doing a lot to help themselves. In Mutujulu it is going to be up to us and the relevant state government to get in and do some more and help. It is a community in crisis. We are putting more money in. We are putting a community worker in there, hopefully, to get local people together to restore some capacity and restore some hope. Nine women from that community have participated in our women’s leadership program. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—My question is to the Minister for Family and Community Services. Is the minister aware of the South Australian Justice Mullighan commission of inquiry into children in state care? Is the minister aware that so far 780 people have made allegations saying they were victims of sexual assault and abuse while they were in state care in South Australia? Does the minister agree that one universal truth established by the Senate inquiries into children in care is that, if you harm a child, you end up with a harmed adult? Does the minister agree that the long-term social and economic costs consequent to harming children mean that it is far cheaper and better to do the right thing by kids than to try and address later adult problems? Is the government monitoring state inquiries such as the Mullighan inquiry to help it coordinate good child welfare systems with the states?</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Murray for the question. I know he has had a deep and abiding interest in this issue and I know that senators on all sides of the house were moved and shocked by the stories that they heard as people presented to both the reports—<inline font-style="italic">Forgotten Australians</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Protecting vulnerable children</inline>. I know that Senator McLucas and Senator Knowles both talked to me about these issues and Senator Knowles particularly in depth—because she is on my side of the chamber; I am not saying that Senator McLucas would not, but Senator Knowles expressed her concern as people were coming and bringing reports.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As I am sure Senator Murray is aware, child protection is primarily the responsibility of the states and territories, and many of the recommendations in both of those reports need to be responded to either by state and territory jurisdictions or by churches and charitable organisations. Unfortunately, some of the damage that has been done in the past can never be undone. As Senator Murray has said, when a child is damaged, the child, as he or she grows up into an adult, takes with himself or herself the scars and the legacy of that abuse—abuse that should not have occurred when children were in state care or in the care of church or other organisations. It beggars belief that that did happen.</para>
<para>We are aware of the South Australian Children in State Care Commission of Inquiry, headed by Commissioner Mullighan. It is, as Senator Murray has indicated, state based. It is investigating allegations of sexual abuse and criminal misconduct against children who were in institutional care or foster care in South Australia. We consider it appropriate for state and territory governments to pursue these issues and I hope that other states will look at what South Australia is doing and take a lead from that.</para>
<para>We are considering our response to the two Senate reports. As I said, many of the responses to the recommendations really require a state response. We hope to provide a response to those two reports by the end of the year but, as I said, it does require a much more concerted effort on the part of the states and on the part of the charitable and church organisations that were responsible for the institutions in which these children suffered sexual and/or emotional abuse.</para>

Does the minister accept that a reign of terror occurred in too many child-care institutions, resulting in thousands of suicides, many tens of thousands of sexual assaults, hundreds of thousands of physical assaults and consequent trauma for many of the adults those children became? Does the minister therefore recognise there is a need to get on with the job? While I and she recognise that it is a very complex issue, the government needs to respond to the recommendations.

<para>—I thank Senator Murray. As I have said and I will say again, the vast majority of the recommendations require a response from the states. It is an issue that I raised again with the relevant state ministers when I met with them a few weeks ago in Alice Springs, indicating that we need to move on this issue. CLAN, the Care Leavers of Australia Network, one of the organisations that have been involved in leading this issue, came to me last year and indicated that they required some assistance with counselling. I immediately provided $100,000 for them to seek counselling. There was a little delay in that money being used, I might add, and I raised that with CLAN. They have now rectified that and they advised me, as we passed each other in the corridor today—because I could not attend the meeting that they were having, although Sussan Ley attended—that they have now got a counsellor. But, as I said, the bulk of the response to both inquiries really needs to come from the state governments and the charitable and church organisations. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I thank Senator Ferris for her question and acknowledge her longstanding interest in workplace relations reform. I am indeed aware of new evidence which demonstrates the abject failure of the Keating government’s unfair unfair dismissal laws experiment. A new survey of 900 businesses released earlier this week provides further evidence of this failed experiment. The survey found that a massive 65 per cent of businesses had experienced, or known of, speculative unfair dismissal claims by workers. Further, 37 per cent said the practice of paying go-away money occurred regularly and another 30 per cent said it happened occasionally. Given these facts, one wonders if Labor is now willing to accept the problem of go-away money. It would be interesting to hear from them now. They have suddenly gone quiet when they have been given the challenge of saying whether or not they accept the problem of go-away money.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I will not ask Senator Hutchins as to who said, ‘Labor has long acknowledged the issue of go-away money.’ So Labor now acknowledges it. The chances are Senator Marshall might be able to tell us now, with some of the unions wanting him to go away. The person that said, ‘Labor has long acknowledged the issue of go-away money’ was in fact Joel Fitzgibbon, the shadow spokesman for small business. Labor knows of the problem; it admits to it, but it is unwilling to do anything about it. Interestingly enough, Mr Fitzgibbon says the reason it does not want to do anything about the unfair dismissal laws is that it is:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... likely to be worse for small business operators because many of the vexatious claimants will take the ‘unlawful dismissal’ path.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The unlawful dismissal path is in fact the path that those on the other side claim will not protect workers in any shape or form. Now they are claiming that it in fact will protect workers and, what is more, the laws are so loose that the vexatious claimants will simply slip from the unfair dismissal law regime into the unlawful dismissal regime.</para>
<para>This sort of tortured logic I suppose has to be expected from Mark Latham’s best friend. But I say to those opposite with great respect: if you want to suggest yourselves to the Australian people as an alternative government, you have to come up with policies that actually gel—policies that actually make sense. You cannot assert one thing on one hand and then the exact opposite on the other. The Labor Party are scrambling around for justifications not to support our very important reforms for unfair dismissal. Until the Labor Party are ready to do something about the problem that they themselves acknowledge, they are not ready nor are they fit for government of this great country.</para>

<para>—I have some information here on bank fees which I am happy to share with the Senate. The result of the survey of bank fees done by the Reserve Bank for 2004 was released in May. That indicates that growth in banks’ domestic fee income grew by in fact only four per cent in 2004, the lowest in the survey’s eight-year history and one-third the rate from the previous year. That was largely due to a sharp fall in merchant service fees for credit cards resulting from the RBA’s reforms to credit card interchange fees. Other sources of fee income grew in line with the pace of recent years. Recent increases in banks’ fee revenue stem from increases in the use of banking services—which, presumably, we welcome—which is evident in the higher number of customer accounts and associated transactions and is not necessarily due to higher charges per transaction. Of course, consumers also continue to benefit from the decline in banks’ lending margins since the mid-1990s, which has more than offset fee increases.</para>

Can he further explain why $50,000 was subsequently granted to the Cootamundra Shire Council for the Australian Cricket Captains Walk when no funding application had been lodged?

<para>—Thank you for the question. It is a very important question. Firstly, in relation to the listing of Bradman’s birthplace—I think it was the very first part of the question—I did check, because I have had inquiries from a newspaper already today about this, and was told that the advice from the Australian Heritage Council on the listing of Bradman’s birthplace at Cootamundra was not received by me and was not even issued by the AHC until 29 October, which was at least a fortnight after the election. So the reality is that I could not have acted upon that. The advice was not to list it. I have to say, not as a passionate cricket historian or follower as my great Prime Minister is but as someone who does follow it—I did actually try to stay up and watch the test—</para>

<para>—I did in fact try to stay up to watch those great Australians hold up their end. Congratulations to Ricky Ponting for his knock. My good friend and neighbour from Subiaco Adam Gilchrist did not perform quite so well but I am sure he will do better in the next test.</para>

<para>In relation to Bradman’s birthplace, I was a bit shocked by the AHC’s advice not to list it. It seemed on the face of it a very obvious thing to list but, on reading the details and the reasons that it should not be, I thought there was some merit in their arguments. After lobbying from Kay Hull MP and from Alby Schultz MP, I did seek to find a way to commemorate Bradman’s unique place in Australia’s history and Australia’s sporting heritage. I did start working on the concept of a Bradman trail, something that the department strongly supported. We needed to find funding for parts of that Bradman trail, which now is established through Cootamundra, Bowral and Adelaide, which I am sure many South Australians will be pleased to know. I asked the department to find funding for aspects of that trail. As I understand it, the Sharing Australia’s Stories program was identified as an appropriate source of funding.</para>
<para>In relation to Kurnell, that site was up for emergency listing. Bruce Baird MP may have nominated it for listing, but I think all Australians would have shared the member for Cook’s dedication to that fact that the first place, if I understand my history, where Captain Cook set foot on Australian soil is important. It is a place that is important not just to Bruce Baird but to all Australians. I was very pleased to emergency list that.</para>
<para>I find it interesting that the Greens would seek to attack a decision to place an emergency listing, which ultimately led to an Australian Heritage Listing, of Captain Cook’s first place of setting foot on Australian soil, that they should seek to condemn me for funding the commemoration of Don Bradman and that they should then seek to further criticise me in relation to Recherche Bay, which I currently have before me. I think it is a very important decision. I think where D’Entrecasteaux landed in Australia for a few weeks back in 1792 and then again in 1793 are important parts of Australia’s maritime history. I have it before me at the moment. Since they seem intent on criticising decisions to recognise Captain Cook and Don Bradman, I wonder what third great Australian and what decision they might criticise in future, but I am sure a supplementary question will reveal that answer.</para>

<para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. What role did the Prime Minister’s office play in the decision to give $50,000 to the Australian Cricket Captains Walk? Was the Prime Minister’s office consulted or in any way involved in the decision not to emergency list the internationally significant cultural site at Recherche Bay in Tasmania in the face of logging? I asked the minister to explain why he did not emergency list when logging was imminent but was prepared to emergency list another place which quite well deserved protection—but the issue is about why he chose one and not the other. Finally, will the government now transfer responsibility for assessing sites and distributing funds for heritage projects to an independent statutory authority?</para>

<para>—The Australian Heritage Council, which is chaired by Tom Harley and has a number of eminent Australians on it, have given me advice in relation to Recherche Bay. They have said that, yes, there are heritage values at that site. I have visited the site. There is no doubt about it. I have read the history of it. But they also advised me that it was not under threat—that those values were not under threat—and therefore emergency heritage listing would not be required. Just because Senator Brown or Senator Milne want to create a bit of a publicity stunt around something does not mean that it is of any more important heritage value than something else. I will make a decision on Recherche at the right time for the right reasons—not because some Green from Tasmania wants to make a political stunt about it.</para>

<para>—I congratulate the honourable senator on her first question—a searching and demanding question on an important subject. The important subject is the employment of Australian labour in the defence arena. Yes, this government is very committed to building Australian defence industry. The two shipbuilding projects that I have referred to will give enormous opportunities for growth in terms of naval shipbuilding capabilities. That is, of course, across a whole range of trades and specialties.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In relation to the amphibious ship project—building the two large amphibious ships—yes, it is our wish that they be built in Australia. That is why we have extended the schedule for a period of two years to allow Australian industry to bid and to compete with the very competitive bids that have been made by overseas shipyards. I guess the distinction between Labor and this side of the chamber is that we always say: ‘Not at any price.’ On the Labor Party side, they always say: ‘At any price: drive up debt, drive up borrowings, send the country broke, put a million Australians out of work,’ as they did on the last occasion when they were in government. That is the reckless, irresponsible approach of the Labor Party, which was true when they were in government and remains true today.</para>
<para>We on this side of the chamber say: ‘Yes, build in Australia, but we expect Australian industry to be competitive.’ Australian industry tell me they will be competitive. Australian industry assure me that they can construct these ships at a price competitive with any overseas shipyard. That is why we are giving them the opportunity to do so. It is our preference that they be built in this country. It is our preference that they be built here and maintained here, and I am confident that they will meet the charge that is given to them.</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Johnston for a very important question which is vital to all Australians, particularly to the north of our continent. Recently in Broome I had the pleasure of commissioning the first installation of the 7.62-millimetre gun on the Australian Customs vessel the <inline font-style="italic">Corio Bay</inline>. This will be rolled out at a cost of $25 million to all our Customs vessels and will give our Customs vessels that extra resource that they need in carrying out the very good work that they do in looking out for Australia’s borders. We need this sort of armament if they are to guard against incursions into our borders.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In particular, I mention fishing, which is a matter of concern to the north of our country at the moment. I support fully the actions of my colleague Senator Ian Macdonald, the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, in this regard. Of course Customs works in a partnership with Navy, Air Force and Coastwatch in looking out for our borders. I was pleased to see that just the other day the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Bendigo</inline> apprehended three foreign vessels suspected of fishing illegally in Australian waters. That demonstrates yet again the partnership between Navy and Customs. In relation to this initiative, we will see extra Customs crew on our Customs vessels. I remind senators that our Customs vessels, which are doing such a great job, were built in Western Australia.</para>
<para>Recently on a visit to Indonesia I raised the question of border control with my Indonesian counterparts. I must say that the level of cooperation that we are receiving from Indonesian authorities is at an all-time high. Recently in the Operation Clear Water exercise to the north we had Indonesian officials participating for the first time. We have invited them to repeat that in the next exercise that we will be conducting. As well as that, the Customs officer that we now have in Jakarta has participated in operations with Indonesia and also in carrying out border training techniques and other related initiatives. This is vitally important if we are to manage our borders to the north of Australia. Not only do we have to look after our border perimeters but we have to engage with our neighbours in ensuring that we manage those incursions which are occurring, particularly in relation to the question of illegal fishing. That was a subject that I discussed with my counterparts in Indonesia, and it is one that they recognised as an issue for themselves as well.</para>
<para>Our approach to border control is one of providing the resources to the men and women who do such a great job in looking after Australia’s borders and also engaging in the region with our neighbours to ensure that we can approach this in a partnership to look at how, together, we can govern our border in the sense of a regional initiative. I might add that this initiative follows on from the arming of the <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Viking</inline> with a .50-calibre machine gun. That patrols the Southern Ocean, looking out for our sovereign waters and doing such a great job. Again I point to the great work that we are doing in partnership with other countries, such as France, who also patrol those areas.</para>
<para>This has been a whole-of-government approach, from Senator Ian Macdonald with the fishing aspect right through to border control involving Navy, Air Force, Customs, Coastwatch and Fisheries. This is how we approach looking after Australia’s borders: as a whole-of-government initiative. The runs are on the board.</para>

<para>—The question of breach of privacy is dealt with quite separately from any action by the AFP. The Privacy Commissioner has the power to deal with that matter which relates to personal information of Australian people who may be the victims.

I might say that information was provided to the AFP by staff involved in the <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> program. That course of action is one that I endorse fully, rather than simply having a report on TV or in the print media and then leaving it there.

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Coonan) to a question without notice asked by Senator Conroy today relating to Telstra.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">The minister has demonstrated today that she, like this government, is completely and totally out of touch when it comes to the question of telecommunications. We have here a government which is hell-bent on taking action in complete contrast to the wishes of over two-thirds of the people of this country. We have here a government which is unable to stand up to the management of Telstra which is running riot with a public company. We have to ask ourselves: what would the consequences be of a management like we have now, if the company were fully privatised? We have got into a situation where, according to today’s <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>, the management of Telstra is now seeking to blackmail this government—it is set to threaten this government with a capital strike if this government does not do what the management of Telstra wants it to do in regard to the deregulation of telecommunications.</para>
<para>The company is now earning the highest corporate profits this country has ever seen—a figure of some $4½ billion—as a direct result of its price-gouging of domestic consumers. It is a situation in which $125 million has been gouged from the public—for instance, through the massive increases in line rental. Since 2000, we have seen line rentals increase from $11.65 per month to over $30 per month. It is now costing $360 per year just to rent the line and the bit of plastic. That is before you make one single phone call. What would it be like with a fully privatised Telstra?</para>
<para>We now have a situation in which a company is securing profits of $4½ billion. Of that $4½ billion, $2½ billion should come back to the taxpayers. You have to ask yourself: what is the economic logic of a government that seeks to give away those dividends to the public? What is the logic of a government that is seeking to hand money back to the private sector in this way when the needs of this country are so evident and so pressing? How can the government claim that it can buy off part of this parliament and seek to bribe members of this parliament by suggesting that a fund be available for people in regional areas when so many cities in this country are going without services at the moment? You do not have to go to the regional areas to find out just how inadequate Telstra’s services are. You only have to be 90 minutes from the Melbourne CBD, where constituents of mine in the Seymour district—hardly a remote area—say that they cannot get mobile services within one and a half hours of the centre of Melbourne. I am told that you can only get services in parts of the districts around Seymour between 12 pm and 1 pm on a weekday, and you can only do that if you stand on the roof of your ute in a paddock.</para>
<para>I am told that you cannot get mobile services in Canberra, five kilometres from Parliament House, on Hindmarsh Drive and William Hovell Drive. There are blackspots within five minutes of this parliament. We have a similar situation at Bellarine Peninsula just outside Geelong in Victoria where people cannot get mobile services. We have a situation out in Calwell, in Tuggeranong, where, in recently developed areas of this capital city, Telstra cabling will not even support the most rudimentary ADSL services provided. A resident of Calwell has told my office that he had his phone line tested by two internet service providers and both of them said that the line was not up to scratch. We are talking about the capital of Australia, not remote regions. We have the failure of Telstra, despite the enormous profits that it is making, not being able to provide services to this country.</para>
<para>There was a time in this country when Telstra was regarded as one of those fundamental nation-building instruments that the government had at its disposal. We are now being told that, through price gouging and the buying of votes, these fundamental public assets are going to be taken away from the people of this country and given to the private sector for the benefit of the few rather than to build the nation as a whole. We have a situation in which the three amigos in the new Telstra management are now seeking to blackmail this government with a capital strike if this government does not come on board and do what it is told by this new management. We have the Americanisation of telecommunications and we are told that this is good enough for the new-look National Party. How pathetic! <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The contorted, twisted logic we have heard from Senator Carr is simply breathtaking. Senator Carr argues that we ought to not sell Telstra because the services are inadequate and because Australians are not satisfied with the services they receive. He said, ‘Just how inadequate Telstra’s services are is obvious by moving around Australia.’ Senator Carr has quoted from a Newspoll survey which purports to prove that people do not want to sell Telstra, but he neglects to mention that the same poll also canvassed the question of how satisfied Australians were with the services that Telstra provides. What does the poll show? It shows that, in a survey across the whole population, something like 75 per cent of those who were surveyed were either very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with the services provided by Telstra in their local area. Again, a majority of people polled by Newspoll indicated that they found the charges levied by Telstra for their services to be either satisfactory or very satisfactory. Evidence like that demonstrates quite clearly that Australians have noticed that, under this government, there has been a substantive and sustained improvement in the quality of services that Telstra provides. That is not surprising, because this government has assiduously set out to put standards in place that will raise the quality of telecommunications services that Australians can expect to receive.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Of course, Labor did none of that. Labor had no plan, no provision of a platform from which services could be built. The fact is that, in Labor’s time of looking after Telstra, we saw services go backwards in many respects. During the 13 years that Labor was in government, there were no requirements on telephone companies to either install a new service or to fix a service or line that had become dysfunctional within any particular time frame. This government has put those standards in place. Under Labor, the most remote customers in Australia could expect to wait up to 27 months for a new service to be installed. Under this government, with the customer service guarantees that have been put in place, no customer has to wait more than 20 working days for a new phone service. Similarly, we have put in place requirements for the repair of lines and other basic standards for provision of services to the community through the universal service obligations. That is a demonstration of why the regulation of those services is important. It is the regulation of those services and the provision of a basic set of standards below which any provider of telecommunications services should not go that are the important features of this debate, not the question of who actually owns the shares in the company.</para>
<para>If we are serious about providing high-quality services to the Australian community, we should do so by setting standards for all providers in the marketplace, not just one of them. Of course, there are a number of those providers out there. Optus, Vodafone, Hutchison and so on are now providing services to the community. We do not own those companies. We should therefore be prepared to regulate that marketplace without having to be in there as the owner of one of those service providers and have the problem of a conflict of interest with both regulating that marketplace and owning one of the key providers within it. The fact is that Australians are broadly satisfied with the services that have been provided by Telstra. To the extent that people are not satisfied, the argument needs to be addressed as to why you would continue with the present ownership arrangements if people are dissatisfied with the services that they receive from Telstra. If those arrangements are in some way connected to the ownership of Telstra then please explain how you need to own Telstra to be able to regulate it. The fact is that you do not, and the lifting of standards that we have achieved— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—That was a very interesting response because Senator Humphries and no doubt the rest of the Liberal Party are obviously choosing to read only the part they want to read. Senator Humphries makes a great deal of the percentage of people who are satisfied with the service, and completely fails to address the issue that, despite the fact that there has been an increase in satisfaction, there has also been an increase in the number of people who do not want to sell Telstra. This is what the government, for some strange reason, does not seem to get. The Australian public does not want you to sell Telstra.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Senator Helen Coonan adopted the same attitude last week when I asked her a question about polling undertaken by the New South Wales Farmers Association. She dismissed that completely. She also dismissed a nationwide poll to which I referred. This poll was in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> and was remarkably similar to the Newspoll one which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> today. Indeed, the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> poll goes a bit further, and breaks down by state the level of disapproval of the government for selling Telstra. It was very interesting to note that the disapproval was highest in Queensland, where 79 per cent of those polled disapproved of the government selling Telstra. That has got to be as close to unanimous as you would want. That has got to be a very strong, and increasingly strong, message to the government which they appear determined to ignore. This is apparently on ideological grounds, because the government have been thrashing around trying to find a reason to sell Telstra—because they are regulating, because they want more competition, all these kinds of reasons—but basically they just have an ideological position that they want to sell any asset held in public hands, despite what the people of Australia are telling them.</para>
<para>I think the people of Australia are telling the government that they do not want Telstra sold because there is an increasing understanding that telecommunications are vital to families and to businesses in Australia. This is what, with the improvement of services and the accessing of those services, people are beginning to understand—how much better telecommunications make their life and their business, and how important access to telecommunications is for their lives, for their education and for their business. They do not want control of that telecommunications infrastructure taken out of the hands of the government.</para>
<para>This is something that, up until now anyway, the National Party seemed to be aware of, and that Senator Barnaby Joyce seems to have made great play of in the past. But it now looks like he is also willing to sell out for a slush fund being set up for the National Party. That would indeed be a betrayal of the 79 per cent of Queenslanders who do not want Telstra sold, regardless of the services, if he gave the numbers to the government and voted with them to sell Telstra. It would be a great betrayal of the people who elected the National Party and the Liberal Party to government and to a majority in this house.</para>
<para>It is interesting to see how the government has reacted to the new CEO of Telstra, Mr Trujillo. Every day, Senator Coonan must get up and wish that she had Ziggy Switkowski back as CEO of Telstra, because Sol Trujillo has certainly created a great deal of interest here. The government has been busy fattening up Telstra for sale—by not spending enough on infrastructure, by not spending enough on maintenance and by reducing its work force—to improve the profits of Telstra and make it look good. Then Mr Trujillo comes along, takes over the business and states what is to him blindingly obvious: that in fact not enough has been spent on broadband and other infrastructure by Telstra, that it has been neglected in the past few years and also that Telstra’s profits are likely to diminish with increased competition and with worldwide trends. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—A group of schoolchildren has just left the gallery and they will be asking their teacher, ‘Who was that frightening looking man who spoke about Telstra and seemed angry about Telstra?’ I will tell them who it was. It was Senator Carr, who was so concerned about the sale of Telstra that he made his speech and scurried out of here. This is the same fellow who was so concerned about the Commonwealth Bank and Australian Airlines that he was quite happy for them to be sold off. We did not hear a word from him then.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Then he had the gall, in the two minutes he was here, to talk about his regional and rural bona fides. He stopped eating eggs when he found out where they came from, and he has only just discovered where milk comes from. Honestly and truly, how dare Senator Carr come into this chamber and talk about Telstra and telecommunications when he was part of a government which for 13 years did absolutely nothing for telecommunications in this country. Indeed, they left a legacy that I think people have stopped talking about because they do not believe it happened. That legacy was the withdrawal of analog before the 1996 election. With the swipe of a pen they took analog out of the system, without any idea of a replacement. And it was up to this government to do something about it, which we did.</para>
<para>Again, the Labor Party, who did nothing in 13 years of government, have now got the gall to turn around and lecture us. It is a policy-free zone across the other side, and this policy-free zone is lecturing to us about telecommunications in regional and rural Australia. What a gall. You did nothing in 13 years and you have absolutely no idea what you want to do. In fact, I think the only thing you have got going at the moment is—that’s right—$5 billion worth of taxpayers’ money to be spent on now obsolete dial-up internet services. Well, thank you for your contribution to telecommunications in regional and rural Australia, if that is the best you can do after all the time you have had to look at what the deficiencies are!</para>
<para>For the benefit of the Senate and those who are listening, I will just go through what the Allen Consulting Group actually found out about the Howard government’s telecommunications reforms. I will go through those, and you might want to listen. And Senator Carr, instead of coming in here and feigning indignation about Telstra and scurrying off again, should come and listen to this. The Allen Consulting Group found that government reforms have increased the size of the Australian economy by more than $10 billion—$10,000 million; created approximately 26,000 new jobs; and delivered benefits to small businesses of $2.1 billion. As a result, Australian households have been on average $720 better off.</para>
<para>There are now more than 100 telecommunications carriers operating in Australia. What did the Labor Party do? They had this nice cosy little duopoly of Optus and Telstra—or Telecom, as it was—and that is all they did. That was their contribution to telecommunications in this country. There are now more than 16 million mobile phones in operation in Australia, operating on a variety of networks, including Hutchison’s 3G network. The number of broadband subscribers in Australia is now well over one million. In a good sign for competition, almost half of Telstra’s ADSL subscriptions are wholesale services being resold by competitors.</para>
<para>We are happy to have a sensible debate on this, but we are not going to be lectured to by a group of people who simply have no policies to address real issues in regional and rural Australia. This government’s record stands on its own with the money that we have spent, nearly $1 billion, and over 33 new and different programs have gone into regional and rural Australia since 1996—the Liberal and National parties working together to ensure better telecommunications for regional and rural Australia.</para>

<para>—or Senator Carr’s—but I will certainly speak with as much passion about this issue. I have taken great interest in the responses of Senator Coonan, Senator Humphries and Senator Ronaldson on the issue of the full privatisation of Australia’s national telecommunications carrier, Telstra. I have to say that, having listened carefully to the questions and having read other information that the government have put out justifying their proposal to flog off the rest of Telstra, I am still really puzzled. I am sure my puzzlement will earn me some gratuitous comment from the other side about how naive I am on these matters—and maybe, being a newcomer, I am—but I do not understand why the government want to spend billions of taxpayers’ dollars to prop up Telstra to make it more attractive to private investors when, overwhelmingly, the people of Australia do not want it sold.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>As Senator Hurley said, there was a survey reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper today which said 70 per cent of Australians do not want Telstra sold. But I do not need to refer to a newspaper poll to find out that Australians do not want Telstra sold; I can rely on my own experience. Senator Ronaldson made some gratuitous comment about our bona fides on this side of the house with regard to rural and regional Australia. I can tell you I spent the last 11 years as a union official, and that involved travelling extensively in rural and regional Australia. When the people I was visiting in those areas found out that I had been preselected for the Senate, I can tell you one of the first things they said to me was: ‘What is your position going to be on the sale of Telstra? Because out here in the bush our services are not up to standard. Out here in the bush, we have to beg to have anything comparable with what you’ve got in the city, and we are very frightened about the privatisation of Telstra because we know that what’s going to happen to us is the same as what happened to us’—here in South Australia, they were talking about—‘when the state Liberal government privatised the energy industry in South Australia.’ That is the comparison that the people in rural and regional South Australia are drawing. I can tell you what happened when the energy industry got privatised.</para>

<para>—I am telling you what happened when another essential service got privatised. That is, the cost to the consumer went up by 20 per cent. Not only did the cost to the consumer go up by 20 per cent but the services that were delivered in the bush went down. They plummeted down, down, down. People in the bush know what privatisation means; it means that they miss out big time.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I can tell you that travelling in the bush as a union official was a fraught experience, because you did not need to go too far out of Adelaide before you had no mobile phone coverage. It was rare that you could find somewhere to plug in your laptop and get broadband service. But I only had to be out there a few days. The people I talked to worked in local councils mainly, but often their partners were on farms or they also ran businesses in those rural and regional areas, and they complained bitterly about how they were unable to run their businesses successfully because they just did not have access to basic telecommunications services. So those people in the bush said to me, ‘For God’s sake, don’t support the sale of Telstra, and tell those people on the other side that they shouldn’t support the sale of Telstra either.’</para>

The fact is that it seems Senator Joyce, unfortunately, is going soft. Somebody mentioned jelly or something before.

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Ian Campbell) to a question without notice asked by Senator Milne today relating to the natural heritage trust fund.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I am disturbed at the very clear willingness of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to manipulate the heritage assessment funding process for political purposes. I particularly want to talk about Recherche Bay in Tasmania. It is clear that the minister was prepared to give an emergency listing to the Kurnell Peninsula in the context of the election campaign when approached by Bruce Baird MP to do so. However, he has not been prepared to give emergency listing to Recherche Bay. Recherche Bay, the northern peninsula in southern Tasmania, is an extraordinarily beautiful area. In fact, it is where the French first landed in 1792-93. It is a highly significant cultural heritage site and landscape. The vista has not changed markedly since the French first landed there. It has been recognised by Emeritus Professor John Mulvaney as a cultural landscape which merits World Heritage listing. Yet we have the minister obviously positioning himself to give the go ahead to logging of the north-east peninsula of Recherche Bay on the basis of values. We are going to see this distortion under the EPBC Act in terms of the World Heritage assessment of Recherche Bay.</para>
<para>We are seeing positioning to give a pocket handkerchief-sized listing to the French garden, another pocket handkerchief-sized listing to the observatory and the go ahead to log the rest of it, when the value of that peninsula in a cultural sense relates to the whole landscape. The French and the Indigenous people moved right across that magnificent landscape. It is where the first recording was made of a Tasmanian Aboriginal language. It is also the place of the first positive encounter between Europeans and the Tasmanian Indigenous people. It should be listed. I believe we will see quite a duplicitous process with the minister having two bob each way. He was positioning himself for that today: on the one hand, saying that the logging can go ahead and, on the other, trying to mislead people into thinking that the heritage values have been protected if two tiny areas are protected.</para>
<para>It is a cultural landscape and this will be a real test for this new Australian Heritage Council. Today, we heard the minister, firstly, mislead the Senate in relation to the Bradman projects and, secondly, give an example of political manipulation whereby the Cootamundra Shire Council did not even put in a funding application, yet it got $50,000. What about all those people around Australia who have put in funding applications and did not get them? The Prime Minister’s office clearly was involved in that decision. I note the minister ducked that part of the question as to the extent to which the Prime Minister was involved not only in the Bradman cricket walk but also in terms of the Recherche Bay project and its listing as a matter of cultural heritage.</para>
<para>When I was in Paris I met with people in the natural history museum and in several academic institutions and there is huge interest from the French side in protecting this area. There is an enormous amount of willingness to set up cultural collaborative projects with Australia and French institutions, including the academy of science in Paris. They recognise how critical it is. Some of the earliest samples of the <inline font-style="italic">Eucalyptus globulus,</inline> which is Tasmania’s floral emblem, can be found in the natural history museum in Paris. It was taken there by de Labillardiere, the botanist on the expedition.</para>
<para>If the minister is prepared to list the place where Captain Cook landed then this is equally important, if not more important, because of its importance to Tasmania’s Indigenous community and to the whole community in terms of reconciliation. It would acknowledge to the world that we recognise that a positive encounter with Indigenous people is something that should be on the Australian natural heritage list. Recherche Bay should be there. The minister needs to explain why it is not there and, if he just goes with a pocket handkerchief size, why he is prepared to repudiate the advice of Emeritus Professor Mulvaney, one of the most highly respected heritage authorities in this country.</para>

<para>That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</para>
<para>The need for the Australian Government to address the scourge of petrol sniffing in Indigenous communities by implementing the comprehensive roll-out of Opal Fuel through the entire Central Desert Region.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I think that in my 10 years in this place this is only the second such motion I have brought before the Senate. It is a motion of the utmost urgency and importance. As a former doctor, a senator, a citizen and as an Australian, I feel deeply ashamed by the awesomely bad health statistics and other living standard statistics by which we can measure the fact that the rest of the community are having a much better time of it than the original Australians. When it comes to the scourge of petrol sniffing, the shame I feel is greatly compounded by the lack of action by the national government and, indeed, the Northern Territory government in rolling out Opal fuel throughout the entire Central Desert region as one way—but a mightily important way—of dealing with petrol sniffing.</para>
<para>If the statistics I have are correct, there are some 600 young Aboriginal people in that region who are already addicted to petrol sniffing. Last year, three died. Another 100 became or are seriously mentally or physically disabled. With petrol sniffing comes violence, a removal of sexual inhibition, destructive and antisocial behaviour, the destruction of the individual, a zone of incomprehensible distress in the family and the community, and loss to everybody involved. The unusual thing about petrol sniffing is that there is now an obvious option. It is Opal petrol, courtesy of BP, which is vapourless. In other words, it is sniffless. The problem is that it costs a few cents more per litre than conventional unleaded petrol.</para>
<para>In my, albeit brief, recent visit to Alice Springs, there seemed to be enormous community goodwill towards substituting conventional petrol with the sniffless variety. This is courtesy of BP, who have extended the formula to other petrol distributors. The question is: should we not have government action—and urgent government action—to put the $8 million or $10 million required behind a roll-out across Central Australia, given the community goodwill and the pleas for assistance from the Indigenous community and the people who work with them in this unspeakably desperate situation of petrol sniffing that overcomes families, kinships and societies? The answer is: yes, we should.</para>
<para>The government has put enormous amounts of money into trying to stop the supply of destructive and illicit drugs to the wider community. All that can be asked is that it puts a fraction of that money into this ready answer to stopping the supply of this destructive drug to Indigenous communities in Central Australia. Other drugs, not least marijuana and alcohol, are ravaging these communities as well. However, petrol sniffing is rapidly destroying young Aboriginal people in a burgeoning Aboriginal population—one-third of the Territory population and growing rapidly compared with the rest of the population. Half the kids in schools in the Northern Territory are now Indigenous kids. Are we not to move to get rid of this potent destroyer of those kids’ brains? Are we not to move to do much more to assist those who are affected? How can it be that a community has one man walking around today who has tried to kill himself four times in the last year? How can it be that we allow communities where young pregnant women can walk down the street sniffing a brain-destructive drug in full and open view of society? Where is the infrastructure to stop this and to back up those people who are urgently trying to do something to put an end to it within their communities?</para>
<para>At Mutitjulu, which is being talked about so much at the moment, it is not just a plea for ending the supply of petrol. This community is trying to design and implement youth development strategies to protect the kids and to get them back on the right track. It is engaging in governance training and reforming the community constitution to make more informed decisions about its future—such as running a child-care centre to protect the kids, and so on. But the community cannot handle the distress that has come upon them.</para>
<para>When I hear the Minister for Health and Ageing say that Indigenous people caught up in this seem hell-bent on self-destruction, I grieve that we have a minister who does not understand. People do not want to be hell-bent on self-destruction, but addiction cuts across the normal way in which we behave. And the destruction of cultures is a potent form of people looking for alternatives such as addiction. We all have a great responsibility here. Replacing petrol with sniffless petrol in Central Australia is one answer, but it is a ready, potent answer which we can know is going to save lives, is going to reduce disability and is going to have a potent, good impact in Central Australia, and, moreover, it is something we can do now. I appeal to the government, I appeal to the ministers involved, to take this step amongst the many others we must take, because that is what the people involved with this are crying out for the government to do.</para>

<para>—I rise today to speak to a motion that is very close to my heart and to the heart of Territorians. I have to question the timing of this motion, though. It is probably not for me to suggest political opportunism or cynicism in this matter, because of the importance of the matter, but the timing—during a coronial inquiry which is being conducted at this moment—is a surprise to me. That inquiry is looking into the deaths of people at both Mutitjulu and Willowra. I would have thought it would be better to look very carefully, in a considered manner, at the recommendations of Northern Territory Coroner Cavanagh in this matter; then we could perhaps pontificate on the matters with some evidence and some surety that we were talking about the facts.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is very difficult to agree with this motion—not because we do not have a great deal of passion about this issue or because we do not think it is important. It is just that it really does not do justice to the complexity and the sophistication of the issue we are dealing with. There is no doubt that controlling the distribution of substances of this sort—in this context we can consider it a substance—has got to be part of a strategy. There is no one solution to this, and I know that the previous speaker effectively said that that is the case, but the very important work that has been done by the government must be recognised.</para>
<para>This motion says, ‘Let’s call on the government to roll out Opal.’ We have rolled out Opal in 42 communities so far. Comgas was an innovation of this government, and we are very proud of it. It is continuing to be rolled out. We have had an increase of something like 230 per cent in the budget towards the continued roll-out of what is now colloquially known as ‘Opal’ into these communities. From 42 communities to 65 communities is a tremendous outcome and a very practical one.</para>
<para>But we are not working only on those outcomes. We recognise that such a sophisticated challenge deserves a sophisticated answer. We deal not only with the substitution of petrol but also with prevention. We have got education, sport and recreational programs, and we have early intervention programs like Indigenous night patrols to ensure that we pick early those people who are most at risk. We have treatment approaches such as group work and counselling—mostly using some of the elders in the communities to help people understand that there are better ways than this.</para>
<para>We have a number of other innovations. The Department of Health and Ageing provides over $20 million per annum to support 67 Indigenous substance abuse services. Throughout government, we have a very strong approach to this. While the central premise of this motion is okay, I find it difficult to support because, if you drill a little deeper into it, the assertion that perhaps this government is not doing enough is simply unacceptable.</para>
<para>Petrol sniffing in the northern end of Australia has been around since about the early 1950s. One of the legacies of the US servicemen was that they could not get hold of beer so they used to sniff petrol. Unfortunately, it is one of those habits that is now a legacy. Petrol is one of the most incredibly destructive substances. We talked about three deaths last year from petrol sniffing. Between 1981 and 1991, 60 Aboriginal men and three women died from petrol sniffing. I have known some younger people—people I have grown up with over 20 years in Arnhem Land—who are now deceased. They were young people who used to work for me. They were vibrant young people with somewhere to go, and now they are dead. It is a great tragedy. We grope at a community level and a leadership level for some answers. But those answers are not simple; they are complex and sophisticated answers.</para>
<para>As I travel around my electorate people talk about Mutitjulu. Because it is right next to Ayers Rock, it comes into focus. But it is the rule, not the exception. This happens everywhere—Docker River, Papunya, Yuendumu, Mount Liebig, Kintore and Mount Allan. It causes anxiety in families and dysfunctionality within the community. It is like your worst nightmares—living in a community that is like something out of a horror story, where a number of people in the community behave like zombies. They cannot see where they are going, their bottom lips are distended and fall open, saliva falls from their mouths and they are sightless.</para>
<para>The physical damage of the disease is without peer. The range of problems include ammonia, asphyxiation and burns. When you are so out of it—I suppose that is the normal term—you do not recognise that it is not smart to smoke with a can of petrol around your neck. Horrific burns are suffered, always on the front of the face and people normally lose their hair. It is absolutely horrific. There is no community where you cannot point to people who have suffered from that. People go into comas or have seizures, and suffer from malnutrition and permanent brain damage. Young men who have worked for me and young women I have known are now permanently in wheelchairs as a consequence of this.</para>
<para>There are a lot of other problems associated with petrol sniffing. When you are not focusing on what you are doing, you can wander into a buffalo, get bitten by a dog or, particularly in Central Australia, simply get lost. You keep walking, because there are no trees in that area. Often, people do not die from petrol sniffing but from getting lost and dehydrating. We suspect that the numbers in terms of petrol sniffing are a lot higher.</para>
<para>Nobody with a real and informed interest in this matter would think that any solution that has been suggested in this motion is going to be the panacea for petrol sniffing. That would be absolutely wrong. I think anyone in the medical profession would agree that you cannot continue to treat the symptoms and expect somebody to get better. If someone has something wrong with them, you cannot just keep treating the symptoms. There is a greater issue—there is a general malaise in the community. That malaise is not unique to the community. It comes from high unemployment or no employment all. High unemployment causing high substance abuse is nothing new. Places like Kings Cross, St Kilda and everywhere around Australia where there seems to be a high level of substance abuse are also characterised by very high levels of unemployment. It is no different in these communities.</para>
<para>A lot of the communities in the Northern Territory have languished under a commonality—the regulations of the Northern Territory land rights act. There is no effective land tenure and little possibility of benefit, particularly in employment. I will be calling on support from those on the other side for amendments to the Northern Territory land rights act at some time in the future. The people and leaders of the communities say that the reason this is happening is because of sit-down money and a welfare system that does not demand a shared responsibility in regard to welfare payments. It has failed the people. This government is determined to provide a comprehensive suite of policy initiatives not only to combat petrol sniffing but also to take people out of the welfare cycle.</para>
<para>A good friend of mine, who was a policeman in that area for many years and was then a politician in the Northern Territory government, made an odd quote. He said, ‘The tie-dyed economy is trying to compete in the workplace with an Armani economy.’ That was said by John Elfrink. He was alluding to the fact that, unless we change these areas and provide some hope for these people by providing an economic background for them, these issues are not going to change.</para>
<para>Administration is a real issue. The administration is absolutely defunct in some of these communities. One community I was in recently was absolutely covered in rubbish. I was told the CDEP had 50 participants. I drove past their yard and there were 30 wheelie bins in there which had remained there for nearly three months. They had not been moved. They told me that between four and six people turned up for CDEP. We cannot just sit there and let that happen, because that is right at the heart of the malaise.</para>
<para>We have spent millions of dollars on preventing access to drugs. I do not believe this notion of prohibition will necessarily work on its own. Alcohol and cannabis are also a problem in these areas. The prohibition of alcohol has not worked. I can tell Senator Brown that, at $60 for a wine cask, grog runners, as he would be well aware, are alive and well in Central Australia. I do not think it is too hard to do the maths for aromatic fuel—at $30 a litre, without prohibition, 10 jerry cans is sufficient to make a trip from almost anywhere with a profitability of around $2,500. It is quite a lucrative business.</para>
<para>We have to ensure that the processes we put in place in terms of prohibition build upon it. Disappointingly, we need regulation. Disappointingly, the Northern Territory government, when introducing their Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Bill, said: ‘We are going to make it legal. We are not going to make petrol sniffing illegal,’ which failed comprehensively to recognise the successes in Warburton and South Australia. This is an issue that needs clear, strong legislation and leadership. Sadly, this has not been forthcoming from the Northern Territory government. This is a very important issue, and all governments need to work together. As I say, this is not a motion that I am inclined to support, principally because it does not address the complexity and sophistication of the problem.</para>

<para>—I support this motion as being an urgent matter that needs close attention. I only have four minutes to address it, and that will not allow me to do it justice. Even though it is urgent, it is certainly not new. It has gained renewed attention as a result of the current coroner’s inquiry that Senator Scullion referred to. I believe that it is appropriate to look to see what the recommendations of that inquiry are. I also hope that, when it does report, its recommendations are given urgent priority and consideration by federal, territory and state governments. That has been the problem, and it is something the Democrats have spoken about a number of times—the lack of priority given to Indigenous issues and Indigenous health issues.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Perhaps the biggest frustration in the last federal election campaign, and I can assure you there were plenty from my point of view, was the inability to get any interest in what I believed and said then was—and I still believe very passionately to be—perhaps the major issue of priority, particularly in the political and policy areas in Australia. I am talking not just about petrol sniffing specifically, of course, but about the whole gamut of disgraceful and completely unacceptable health statistics and the reality of the health environment that Indigenous Australians live with and die with.</para>
<para>It is simply outrageous that in an election campaign, or at any stage, we can have a situation where a section of our community have a life expectancy 20 years lower than the rest of us and that is not given a priority. Neither the Prime Minister nor the Leader of the Opposition even attended their party’s Indigenous policy launch during the election campaign. There was virtually no media interest in the subject until after the election, when it took someone like Michael Long to put it on the front page for a few days. And now it has taken a tragedy and a coroner’s inquiry to put it back on the front page. It has got to be a priority every day of the week for all of us here, and that is where I think we have all got to bear some responsibility. The petrol-sniffing aspect is something that the Democrats have spoken about many times in this place. I have just discovered speeches by former Senators Powell and Vigor in the 1980s talking about the issue. The Democrats specifically ensured that the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation that we negotiated and that was set up in 2001, with over $100 million, dealt not just with alcohol abuse but with other licit substance abuses, and we specifically ensured that they would include petrol sniffing.</para>
<para>It is a long-term problem, as I am sure that all speakers in the debate will acknowledge. It is a complex problem. It cannot be solved simply by one approach. Senator Brown has said that as well. I think the motion perhaps has an implication that it can be. We do need to take a whole range of approaches here and address the core issue of systemic disadvantage and the inability of communities to handle this themselves. There is a lack of sufficient capability and empowerment to handle the destructive nature of petrol sniffing at the community level.</para>
<para>We should all remind ourselves that this is not just a matter of urgency today; it has in effect been urgent for decades. It is a failure on all our parts that we have not given it the priority it deserves. All of us in this place who are involved in political and policy debate day after day should be continually reminding ourselves, regardless of whether it is on the front page or not, that the plight of Indigenous Australians is the major priority issue and, unless we give it priority day after day and follow through day after day rather than just making one-off announcements, we will still be here in 20 years time with another motion along the same lines. We will all bear responsibility if that is the case.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I wish to speak in support of the motion moved by the Greens. I do not do so because I think it is a perfect motion, but because I think it is important that we have the debate. I think some of the concerns Senator Scullion raised are valid, but I think it is to Senator Brown’s credit that he has brought the issue before the parliament. We should have a debate about the most serious issue of petrol sniffing in Indigenous communities. I indicate on behalf of Labor that we will be supporting the motion, but it is not the vote that matters—no-one pretends the resolution is going to achieve anything—it is about the debate and trying to focus public attention and government attention on what is a serious social problem.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I will start with a personal observation. I must admit that the first time I came across petrol sniffing, in the north-west of Western Australia, it shocked the hell out of me. There was a young bloke, about the same age as my son, walking around with a Coke can in his hand. It took me quite a while to work out what was going on. It was beyond my comprehension that someone would be sniffing petrol out of a Coke can. It certainly rocked me. I cannot do it justice in describing it, but it really did affect me quite deeply that a young person would feel they had so little in life that sniffing petrol was the only way out. It is a growing problem in Australia in Indigenous communities and it is something that we have got to try and focus on.</para>
<para>I do not support the motion because of any desire to point-score with the government—I think they have taken a number of measures in this area—but I do think we need to focus on whether enough has been done and whether we cannot get some more urgency into the required federal-state cooperation that is the key to this. Senator Scullion made a couple of points with which I agree. One was that there does need to be an effort by state and Commonwealth governments. There needs to be a coordinated effort on the issue. The other thing I want to stress is that it does need to be part of a broader strategy. There is no silver bullet for these social problems. Just as I do not think ‘Just say no’ was an answer in some other areas of social problems, I do not think the Opal solution is the sole one that will deal with petrol sniffing in Indigenous communities. But I think it is part of the solution and ought to be supported. I think there is a roll-out occurring. I think this motion seeks to get some urgency to that roll-out and to try and encourage people to redouble their efforts.</para>
<para>The facts are that petrol sniffing results in intoxication for three to six hours, with immediate effects including euphoria, numbness, dizziness and disassociation from surroundings—I think Senator Scullion called it ‘being out of it’. It can later on include hallucinations, loss of motor coordination, impaired judgment, nausea, coughing and sneezing and, of course, much more severe long-term health effects, including damage to the central nervous system, the respiratory system, the liver and the kidneys. There are a lot of people with serious brain damage suffering from seizures, asphyxiation, pneumonia and a whole range of ongoing disabilities. They bring not only personal tragedy but the ongoing health costs to the community of caring for people so badly affected by the effects of petrol sniffing.</para>
<para>People must not underestimate how devastating this practice is to individuals and to communities. As well as the health impacts, there are a whole range of other social impacts such as violence, violent crime, vandalism and the whole breakdown of communities. There are stories of old people leaving their homes because the smell of petrol and the behaviour of young people affected is such that they cannot continue to live in that environment.</para>
<para>As we all know, there is a coroner’s inquiry occurring in the Northern Territory which will help shed some light on these issues. The thing that struck me reading the reports into the deaths of the three males is that one was 14, one was 21 and one was 37. So we are talking about Aboriginal males across the age spectrum, from a very young man to a middle-aged man, who have lost their lives. I think a number of speakers have made the point that there are a lot of other people who have lost their lives in behaviour that may not have been attributed to petrol sniffing but was effectively caused by petrol sniffing. It is a huge problem and it is a problem that we do need to focus on as a parliament and as a community. There has been some progress made attempting to come to terms with the issue. We have had the Comgas Scheme and the petrol-sniffing diversion project, which I understand will be evaluated in the middle of next year. The Northern Territory government has implemented a range of measures to combat the problem and, in my own state, the Western Australian government has been working with communities as well.</para>
<para>Opal fuel does provide part of the solution in that it does not contain lead and has extremely low levels of the aromatic hydrocarbons which create the high that appeals to sniffers. Labor senators spent a great deal of time at the last estimates round questioning the Department of Health and Ageing about these issues and the progress being made with the introduction of Opal fuel. I think Labor senators reflect the concerns that Senator Brown has in regard to the lack of urgency about rolling out this program. I accept the government has taken some steps, but I think there is a general concern that more could be done quickly and more effectively. I do want to make the point that Senator Scullion made, and which I think Senator Brown acknowledged as well, that no motion ever adequately encompasses the complexity of a social problem like this.</para>
<para>Opal on its own is not the solution to the problem; it has to be a broader strategy. There has to be a health and community strategy that is much broader than Opal. But I do think Opal is part of the solution. The results so far with Opal are very encouraging. We urge the government to take a broader strategy but to speed up the roll-out and the evaluation and to make sure that that is part of a broader strategy dealing with these issues. One of my concerns about the government’s approach to Indigenous affairs is their own simplistic notion of getting people off welfare somehow being an answer to the social problems that confront Aboriginal communities. While the government urges us not to accept a simplistic solution in terms of Opal fuel, they say the answer is to build a swimming pool and all the social problems of the community will be fixed. I do not think that is the answer either. ‘No school, no swimming in the pool’ may be part of the solution in certain communities, but there has to be a much more holistic approach. What is not able to be discerned at the moment is what that holistic approach of the government is and what the broad strategy is other than these shared responsibility agreements that seem to be done mainly for media impact rather than as part of any broader strategy for dealing with Aboriginal disadvantage and the problems confronting Indigenous communities.</para>
<para>This is my first contribution to the parliament since taking over the Indigenous affairs portfolio from my colleague Senator Carr, and one thing I am conscious of is that too many white fellas go out into the Indigenous communities and come back claiming that they have the solutions to the problems facing Indigenous communities. I want to make clear that I am not one of those. I know enough about Indigenous communities, having been a Western Australian senator for the last 12 years, to know that there are no simplistic solutions and no easy fixes. We all, as a parliament, have to work as cooperatively as we can to empower Aboriginal communities in tackling the social issues that bedevil them. I think today’s debate helps in that it focuses attention on one of the issues. But, as I said, they are much broader than petrol sniffing and they need much broader responses.</para>
<para>Opal fuel is part of the solution. The government has taken some steps, which I commend it for, but more needs to be done and it needs to be part of a broader strategy. I think it is important that we give some urgency to that strategy, given the horror that is petrol sniffing and the fact that it seems at the moment that some impasse between state and federal governments is not allowing us to get maximum traction in the prevention of petrol sniffing and the contribution that Opal could provide. Senator Crossin will also speak for Labor and she is much more familiar with the issue in the Northern Territory than I. Certainly, Labor thinks it is important that we have the debate today and that we do try and focus. As much as possible we must try and find common ground in assisting Indigenous communities to address these very serious social problems, particularly that of petrol sniffing.</para>

<para>—In the few moments I have to speak on this very important national subject, I would like to commence by commending Senator Evans for the spirit and tone of his speech just delivered in this place. This issue is not one that should ever be about politics. I first came across the problem of solvent and spirit abuse with Indigenous people back in 1979 as a young lawyer in Kalgoorlie. Within a number of days of my arrival in that town, I heard of three Aboriginal men at Cundalee Mission dying as a result of drinking duplicating fluid from a gestetner machine. The problem with spirit based products, be they fuel or solvents, is that they are highly addictive.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Having been to a number of Aboriginal communities throughout Western Australia over the past 30 years, I have seen some absolutely sad, sorry, depressing and quite frightening circumstances where very young children have been exposed to petrol sniffing. These were the days where super petrol contained a large quotient of lead. A child of three or four in an Aboriginal community with a tin can tied around its neck, constantly sniffing these fumes, has absolutely no possibility of reaching the age of 5. The lead, of course, is highly toxic, and will kill the child, not to mention the brain damage caused by the hydrocarbon fumes of this scourge.</para>
<para>Opal and fuel substitutes deal with the petrol side of things but there are also methylated spirits and other spirits, be they hardware industrial cleaning solvents or other types of hydrocarbon, hallucinatory spirit that provide an addictive high to people, particularly Aboriginal people. Let us remember that this is not just an Aboriginal problem. There are a number of people around Perth whom I have observed over many years who abuse solvents. But this problem is endemic in the central reserve regions of the Northern Territory and Western Australia, to the best of my understanding and experience. I have seen young men in court who have been long-term solvent abusers and petrol sniffers. They will never recover from the brain damage that this practice causes.</para>
<para>I want to say to Senator Brown: thank you for raising this issue. We have known about it for a very long period of time. You can never raise this issue too often. It might get you some political points—I do not say that you do it for that reason—but the fact is you have raised it and we are discussing it in this place. It needs to be discussed and people need to understand it. So I thank you for raising it. I hope that you raised it in a legitimate, bona fide way, seeking to draw attention to what has been a very long-term problem that has perplexed state and indeed, may I say, federal governments for a long time. The solutions are not simple.</para>
<para>Opal is one of those solutions, as is the Comgas Scheme, which has been initiated for the last seven years, to my understanding, by the Commonwealth department that deals with Indigenous matters. As I see it, given the experience that I have—which I do not profess is greater than anybody’s in this place but I have been to the communities; I have seen what goes on and I have seen the damage that petrol sniffing does—education is the fundamental starting point, particularly with parents. Where parents are chronically addicted to alcohol, you obviously are starting from a very low base. That is the difficulty. Self-esteem issues and employment issues are at the base of parental capability and capacity to create the right sort of environment in an Aboriginal community for young and adolescent children, who are the most vulnerable and susceptible to this blight. Having parental awareness and having the community at one against substance abuse—by that I mean illicit drugs such as cannabis, alcohol and solvents—is the sort of comprehensive, broad community based program that you need.</para>
<para>These communities are extraordinarily isolated. The community members travel many miles. It is very difficult for government to get high-quality and regular medical and health services into these communities. The places I am talking about—Blackstone, Djurkula, Warburton, Giles, Balgo, Jigalong et cetera—are all literally 400, 500, 600, 700 kilometres from good reasonable services. Indeed, Laverton is the most easterly outpost in Western Australia before you hit the central reserve and all the communities out there. There are a hospital and medical facilities at Laverton, largely surviving by virtue of the mining industry because the town is a very small town.</para>
<para>To get these services into these communities requires a Herculean effort. One has to fly in because there are 600 or 700 kilometres of very bad roads. So this is what we are confronting in seeking to deal with these problems. The people in the communities move from place to place. They take their children with them, so getting a consistent level of medical service and a consistent level of education to the parents is very difficult. It is difficult for us to say, ‘Don’t leave the community.’ This is what the minister is trying to do with SRAs; this is where we can seek to educate the community that solvent abuse and petrol sniffing is fatal to their future. SRAs are a first step, I believe, in getting parents to get their children into schools so that we can give them a leg-up and an education into why they should not participate in sniffing.</para>
<para>In closing, I have seen very young children not just sniff petrol but actually drink it. This is absolutely traumatic to observe. I have for many years been saying to every politician who will listen to me, ‘You’ve got to do something about it.’</para>

<para>—I do not think any of us think that this is the only step that we can take to address this problem, but we should acknowledge that this is an urgent step that we can take to start addressing what is an absolute tragedy for Indigenous communities in this country. I will return to some of the other strategies we think we should be taking a bit later.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The federal government subsidy on Opal fuel is a good first step by the government, and we are pleased to see it is being made. The problem with the current scheme, however, is that its coverage is patchy and it leaves many communities and other regional sources where sniffable petrol can be obtained, which undermines the very concept that we are trying to achieve by replacing existing sniffable fuel. Two of the three sniffing deaths that are the subject of the recent inquiry occurred in communities that are not covered by the scheme. This is a tragedy. It is within our power right now to prevent more of these deaths.</para>
<para>If the pure humanity of the situation does not count, let’s look at the economics of the situation. ANTaR recently reported on figures released by the Department of Health and Ageing that indicate that in the Northern Territory alone the cost of caring for the additional 120 sniffers likely to acquire irreversible brain damage is $24 million per year. Compare this to the additional $8 million to $9 million it will cost to extend the Opal subsidy across the central region and there is a predicted saving of $16 million to $17 million. Not only will this save lives, it will reduce the impact on families who are dealing with the consequences of losing children to sniffing—their morose withdrawal from family life, punctuated by episodes of unpredictable violence and destructive behaviour. This will improve the quality of life of communities and save us money on future health costs.</para>
<para>Taking the next step to solving these problems is within our powers as senators. I believe we have a moral obligation to act in the face of this suffering. Once we have made this first important step, however, we need to begin to address the causes of sniffing as have already been identified in the chamber today. We need to start addressing the underlying disadvantage suffered by Aboriginal Australians. We believe we need to start to implement strategies that address petrol sniffing not just as an isolated substance abuse issue but as one part of the overall issue of substance abuse.</para>
<para>We must also support and continue the current youth link-up program, which we believe is very well placed to address petrol sniffers among young people in the Northern Territory. Funding should also be made available to communities to implement a range of complementary interventions as considered appropriate by each community. We should be encouraging fuel companies to support these initiatives, both financially and in kind. Until we take these steps to stop the sniffing, our efforts to improve the plight of families in remote communities will be hampered by the problems caused by the sniffers. I urge the Senate to support this motion.</para>

<para>—I am pleased to rise in the Senate chamber this afternoon to talk about this issue. I have to say that if it takes the drastic picture on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> for the rest of this country to realise that this is an endemic problem in Aboriginal communities then it is a sorry state that we find ourselves in. But if that is what it is going to take to make the rest of this country realise that something has to happen in Aboriginal communities and if that is what it is going to take to get this federal government to do something about it, well, so be it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In 1981 I arrived at an Aboriginal remote community called Yirrkala. I have actually taught Aboriginal students who sat in front of me with petrol poured onto their T-shirt, which they sniffed through the day in order to cope. In 1984 my husband was responsible for trying to rehabilitate a group of post-primary kids off petrol. I remember a well-known excursion on which he took them to Bali, but we will not go into the story about the missing bimo in the streets of Bali or we might be here all day. The point I am trying to make is that this has been a problem that I have known of and experienced for 25 years. For more than two decades this has been a problem amongst Aboriginal kids in the Northern Territory, and very little has been done about it.</para>
<para>With all due respect to Senator Scullion—and I agree with some of the sentiments of his speech—for him to stand up here and tell me that the Clare Martin government have done very little about this is an atrocious statement given that the Country Liberal Party was in power in the Northern Territory for 27 years and did absolutely nothing about this. At least the Clare Martin government have moved on this in a big way. They have introduced new legislation to parliament that does ban petrol sniffing in the Northern Territory. It might not make petrol sniffing illegal—I am not sure if you can actually make illegal a substance such as petrol that is readily available to everyone—but they have now committed an extra $10 million over five years to implement the recommendations of their parliamentary committee inquiry into substance abuse. At least Clare Martin’s government set up a committee to look at substance abuse. They are implementing the recommendations, they have committed an extra $10 million to put the recommendations in place and they have now put in place legislation that bans petrol sniffing and a program that will rehabilitate many of the sniffers, in consultation with communities and with the assistance of the police. So for Senator Scullion to stand up here and say that the Martin government have done nothing about this is grossly misleading the Senate when his party had 27 years in which to do this.</para>
<para>I also want to draw the Senate’s attention to a committee report, <inline font-style="italic">Reconciliation: off-track</inline>. It was tabled by the Legal and Constitutional References Committee in October 2003. That was about the time of the tragic death in South Australia. This is recommendation 20 of that report from nearly two years ago now:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Committee recommends that during the Spring sittings 2004 the Senate refer to it an inquiry on progress in addressing the problems surrounding petrol sniffing in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Lands, including progress as it relates to the COAG whole of government trial being conducted there.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Let’s not forget this: Tony Abbott’s department, the Department of Health and Ageing, is actually responsible for the COAG trial in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara lands. Let’s ask that minister what is happening about petrol sniffing in that part of this country. This is a recommendation from a Senate committee that is nearly two years old. I have not seen that acted on. I have not even seen the government’s response to this recommendation. When we stand up here and seek to have a debate about supporting BP in their attempt to develop Opal fuel and roll it out in Central Australia, I would have thought that $10 million was a drop in the bucket for the expenditure that this government has before it.</para>
<para>Opal fuel is a major breakthrough in providing a fuel that does not produce the high that petrol sniffers crave. The introduction of Opal and schemes to divert youth in remote communities from the scourge of petrol sniffing are a major investment in their future and in our future as well, because there are some terrific kids out there who get hooked on this stuff for a whole range of reasons. My view is that it is mainly because they are bored and they have nothing else to do. It is a complex problem. It is a bit like putting a jigsaw puzzle together. If this is going to be one element of the jigsaw that we can address by making this petrol not readily available, then let’s do it. We should do it today. It should have been done yesterday, but today would be a good start.</para>
<para>It will cost an estimated $8 million to $10 million a year to roll out Opal fuel throughout Central Australia, including Alice Springs. Let me really emphasise that: it must be rolled out in Alice Springs. Why is that? Commonsense will tell you that Indigenous kids hooked on sniffing who cannot get the fuel in their communities will go to Alice Springs or, alternatively, Alice Springs tourists, visitors, government people or whoever who fill up at Alice Springs and go out bush will take the fuel out there and the petrol-sniffing kids will then be able to get at it. So it has got to be rolled out right across the board, not just in communities but in the major cities. The many billions of dollars that we pay in law enforcement costs to keep a range of illicit drugs off the streets of the capital cities put the cost of the Opal subsidy into perspective.</para>
<para>Can I say, Senator Brown, that I heard your interview on the radio last Friday in the Northern Territory, and your comments were spot-on. This is a government that puts a lot of effort into stopping illegal drugs from coming into this country, and we support that. This is a government that puts a lot of effort into ensuring that ecstasy and heroin are not available for drug users in this country. Why is the same effort not being put into making sure that petrol is not around for petrol sniffers? Senator Brown was right in his comments last Friday when he spoke to Daryl Manzie and people in the Territory. He was correct. I think that $10 million is a small price to pay to ensure that there is some relief for those Indigenous kids—at least in that part of the country.</para>
<para>The current subsidy the Commonwealth is putting out for Opal is about 30c per litre but, with the economies of scale delivered through wider usage of the fuel, this could drop to 15c per litre. Compare this to the subsidy that is paid in the form of the diesel fuel rebate each year, which is worth over $2 billion. We are asking for up to $10 million here—a very small price to pay. It will go a long way to ensuring that we at least start to address this problem. The diesel fuel rebate is a direct subsidy to industry, with economic spin-offs, we are told. The Opal subsidy is a mere fraction of the diesel fuel rebate and the government already enjoys a higher GST take from fuel in Central Australia because it is 10 per cent of the higher cost of fuel in that area.</para>
<para>The costs of doing nothing about petrol sniffing are horrendous in terms of damaged lives, broken families and dysfunctional communities. Petrol sniffers that do not die from the habit can suffer acquired brain damage. I have seen it amongst kids—after they have sniffed petrol for a very long period of time, they are very seriously damaged in terms of how they function. There are already petrol sniffers in full-time care in Central Australia and it is estimated that over 120 young people in that region will suffer serious brain damage over the next few years. The figures for the Anangu Pitjantjatjara lands of South Australia are similar. The cost of caring for these young people as they grow older—and the damage progresses over the years—ranges from $200,000 to $750,000 per person per year for every year of their lives. Let us just cost that. If we have 120 young people in the Central Australia region alone costing us a minimum of $200,000 per year, and that cost is increasing, I would have thought that $8 million to $10 million would have been a good investment in the future of those young kids.</para>
<para>The federal government and the Northern Territory, South Australian and Western Australian governments are already working together and planning special facilities to cater for the influx of brain damaged petrol sniffers needing permanent care. But we cannot afford to wait for the roll-out of Opal fuel and we cannot afford to keep reviewing what the effects of it will be. The effectiveness of the current scheme of using avgas in select remote communities is diminishing as its octane level is being gradually increased to meet the demands of the aviation industry. That is why BP have moved on this and that is why people like Alison Anderson, the newly elected member for Macdonnell, have been backing BP, supporting them and encouraging them to roll out this alternative fuel. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Today Senator Brown has moved as an urgency motion that the Australian government address the scourge of petrol sniffing. I do not think there is a person in this chamber, whether or not they are here sitting in their places today, who would not agree that this is a tragedy, and a priority not only for the federal government but also for state government. I also do not believe that today is the day for political point scoring, particularly on an issue like this. I have seen this tragedy on the AP lands in South Australia and I saw it during a drive to Darwin several years ago, when I went out with the Indigenous night patrols in Katherine, Tennant Creek, Darwin and Coober Pedy to collect substance abusers—whether they were using alcohol or other drugs, or sniffing petrol.</para>

<para>I spent time talking to these people at the ‘spin dry’ centre in Darwin. I know this issue too; I have seen it at first-hand and it is a tragedy wherever it occurs. It is not true to say that the federal government is doing nothing—any more than it is true to say that the state governments are doing nothing. There is a priority for this, and I know that Senator Brown is aware of that. Can I just give a couple of figures. In the current budget, which the federal government brought down just a couple of months ago, $9.6 million was provided to expand the number of communities participating in the Comgas Scheme. The federal government has implemented this and the number of communities participating has grown significantly. This year there will be an expenditure of $3.3 million, which is a 230 per cent increase on previous years, and 65 communities are now participating in the scheme. There are data collection issues and other issues being addressed within that funding. But the problem goes on.</para>
<para>Earlier this year, we had an inquest—and Senator Brown would probably be aware of this—where the South Australia coroner, Wayne Chivell, again highlighted some new priorities that the Rann government in South Australia needs to set to address this issue on the AP lands. It is not fair or true to say that Premier Rann has not also had this as a priority. In fact, he has been to the lands. He has established committees and task forces. He appointed former senator Bob Collins, Mrs Lowitja O’Donoghue and the Reverend Tim Costello to put together strategies to try to deal with this problem on the lands. Whether people got support or not depended on what was recommended. I think Mrs O’Donoghue decided to resign from the committee because she felt that there was not enough activity.</para>
<para>In fact, the coroner found that in retrospect it had been a mistake for responsibilities to have been taken away from the lands and given to the state department of Aboriginal affairs in South Australia. It is fair to say that it is only when the communities are assisted to take on this problem—to provide the leadership and to provide the opportunities for young people—that we truly see the effect of the millions of dollars that are now being set aside and spent.</para>
<para>In relation to the AP lands in South Australia, the federal and state governments are working in quite close partnership with the communities on the lands. This is an issue that goes beyond party politics. It has to. There is no point in trying to point-score in relation to this issue. There are too many young people affected by it. We also have people in care in South Australia—young people; children—who have been tragically affected for life or who are effectively brain dead because of the injuries they have suffered as a result of petrol sniffing over a long period of time.</para>
<para>In South Australia we have established a new regional forum, the TKP. This forum is a significant step forward for both the communities and the governments in working together. We have supported new service coordination arrangements and contributed $1.4 million towards the service costs involved in that work. We also announced three pools. I was interested to hear Senator Crossin say that in her view part of the problem was caused by young people being bored in these small communities. I can understand that. Having spent time on the AP lands over a long period of time, it is very easy to see that young people could find life there lacking in excitement and might seek forms of substance abuse as a result of that. It is very sad but it is probably true. I imagine Senator Crossin has very wide experience of that as well.</para>
<para>As I said, we have announced that there will be three swimming pools built on the lands in South Australia. These pools will be included in the ‘no school, no pool’ program, to try to get young people to see that there is an alternative to substance abuse and that there is an alternative to petrol sniffing—that there is no need to endanger and in fact effectively cut short their lives simply because after school they do not have enough to do. We believe that providing them with the opportunities of learning to swim and visiting the pool with their friends—doing things that children do in all other areas of Australia, with safety and security—is one answer. It is not the only answer to the tragedy of petrol sniffing. This a tragedy that all of us understand and I do not believe any of us have tried to score political points in seeking to find the solution to this problem.</para>

<para class="block">There is no more urgent issue facing the world than climate change. Just this week in the <inline font-style="italic">New Scientist</inline> there is a report showing that the world’s largest frozen peat bog is melting. An area stretching for a million square kilometres across the permafrost of Western Siberia is turning into a mass of shallow lakes as the ground melts. Therefore, it is likely that there will be a release of billions of tonnes of methane into the atmosphere. That comes on top of an announcement just a couple of weeks ago of yet another major break of ice on the ice shelf in Antarctica. An area the size of Tasmania is expected to break off. There are obvious consequences of that much fresh water ending up in the ocean.</para>
<para>For example, there is a major flow-on effect for creatures like whales, as krill will die if large amounts of fresh water end up in a previously saline environment. The result will be fewer krill and therefore more whales dying because of a reduction of food sources. At one level, the Australian government should be congratulated on the efforts they have been making regarding whale protection against the Japanese moves to bring back commercial whaling. But at another level, by failing to act on climate change, they are actually exacerbating the problem for these creatures. Climate change goes across every area in an ecosystem. Every global feedback process is impacted upon by climate change.</para>
<para>The government has come forward with its Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. It is acknowledged in the partnership statement that climate change exists, yet last week in the Senate we were able to demonstrate that, at the same time Minister Campbell was talking about this matter, he was also lodging papers in the Federal Court saying that climate change did not exist and that emissions from coal-fired power stations and the mining of coal and the processing of it did not impact on global warming. He cannot have it both ways. In his statement he announced the partnership on clean development and climate but, so far, essentially it is just a vision statement. Unlike the Kyoto protocol—which has specific requirements, targets and emission levels that must be met—it is simply a statement of intent. It has no targets that the government has to abide by. In fact, James Connaughton, Head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, in a very telling comment in a Bush administration press conference about this particular matter, confirmed that this pact is a repackaging of old ideas. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">What we will be doing is we will be building on an existing platform of bilaterals, on sort of a grab bag of technology initiatives, and bringing it into a more consolidated and more aggressively managed program.</para>
</quote>
<para>I think that is the fact of the matter: we are seeing a grab bag of initiatives, trying to build on technological advancement. There is nothing wrong with that—we should be investing in renewables and investing heavily in Australia and overseas—but the problem we have here is that essentially the government are not looking at renewables. They are talking about clean coal—but what is the government’s definition of ‘clean coal’? They are talking about carbon capture and storage—a completely untested, unproven technology. They are talking about civilian nuclear power. That is code for increased exports of uranium from Australia to China and India and, as I said before, clean coal is nothing but code for increased exports of Australian coal to the global market. While the partnership might form a policy dialogue and while it might provide for nice ministerial meetings, it most certainly does not provide the targets that we want. Dr McNeil, a lecturer and research fellow at the Centre for Environmental Modelling and Prediction at the University of New South Wales, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Far from being “an historic agreement for the cause of reducing greenhouse gas emissions” as the Prime Minister claims, the climate pact … will serve only to undermine international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. … The agreement is merely a weaker version of a mechanism that already exists under the Kyoto Protocol. The clean development mechanism within Kyoto specifically allows developed nations to exchange and invest in clean development technologies within the developing world.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The agreement will disrupt the development of CDM projects under the Kyoto protocol and attempts to draw China and India into the post Kyoto Protocol (2012) negotiations. My major concern here is the government’s so-called effort on climate change. In effect, it will take the focus away from setting limits. We know that we have to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Australia is bragging about the fact that it will meet its Kyoto targets—an eight per cent increase on 1990 levels. The whole country, except the coal industry and the government, was ashamed when Australia negotiated an eight per cent increase on 1990 levels, when the developed world was desperately trying to take some action that would effectively change things for the better.</para>
<para>Another issue here is that, in order to get the investment in clean technologies and proven renewable technologies and move it away from coal and geosequestration, you need policy frameworks that drive that investment. You need to have a program whereby you get the renewables at a scale and cost of production that is equivalent to existing coal technologies. You need full cost accounting in relation to the impacts of coal and nuclear energy if you are going to have market pull on these particular technologies. We need significant policy frameworks, we need tax breaks and support for renewable energy technologies and we need a commitment to those targets, and that is where Kyoto does much better than this framework.</para>
<para>Kyoto actually sets the parameters. It provides limits and it provides incentives for investment in renewable energy technologies. Whilst the government is full of talk about what it might achieve in its so-called vision statement, it is not providing any kind of milestones, targets, incentives—or anything that is based on fact and measurable time lines. There is just an open-ended blah which suggests to me that the government ought to rename this supposed Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. It should just be called the ‘Asia-Pacific Partnership for the Advancement of Coal and Uranium Exports to China and India’, because that is what effectively it does. The government needs to reconsider its position. It needs to look at what the rest of the world is doing, particularly the European Union, in relation to investment in renewables. If you want to create jobs in rural and regional Australia, the best way of doing it is to create policy frameworks that provide incentives for renewable energy. That has occurred in Europe. They have invested in these technologies, they have created jobs in their regional economy and, at the same time, they have given themselves energy security.</para>

<para>—This document on clean development and climate—supposedly an important and crucial initiative of the Australian government in conjunction with the US and some other countries in our region, including China—was so important, so crucial that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage waited until the Senate had adjourned on a Thursday night before it was produced. That is how important the environment minister thinks it was. It was tabled a bit earlier in the House of Reps, where they knew they would not have to worry about debating it and where the minister was not present. Such priority did it get that it was just tossed into the office around the back after we had all risen at 6 or 7 pm on Thursday of last week. That is about the level of attention and significance it deserves because, whilst it has been trumpeted in various ways as a major advancement—indeed, as an alternative, a replacement, an advancement on the Kyoto protocol—it does not even meet what everybody acknowledges are some of the limited and insufficient requirements of that protocol.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Senator Ian Campbell said that the Kyoto protocol will not get the world where it wants to go and we have to find something that works better. Nobody has ever said that the Kyoto protocol is going to be sufficient to get the world to where it needs to go, but it is quite clear that it is an important first step. The Australian government, in conjunction with the US government, has for nigh on eight years continually sought to prevent us even getting to first base with the Kyoto protocol. One of the key problems with this latest partnership on clean development and climate is that it does not even have some of the compulsory benchmarks and compulsory targets that are essential requirements for getting to first base. Whilst it is good to look at working together and promoting different, newer and better technologies in different areas, unless you develop and put in place concrete mechanisms, market based mechanisms, clear-cut targets, a specific regime to deal with different people who do not meet the targets, different mechanisms to advance things on to the next stage, you will inevitably get a bunch of nice-sounding words, maybe one or two occasional good programs but no significant, overall, overarching, concrete advancement to take us to where we desperately need to go.</para>
<para>If you look at some of the differing rhetoric around the place and compare what the Australian government and Senator Ian Campbell said—and I have just noted some of his words—with what the Bush administration said, and they simply talk about this partnership as being complementary to the Kyoto protocol rather than a substitute, you wonder if there even is a shared agreement amongst the participants in this about what its role is, what it is specifically going to achieve, how it is going to work in practice and what sorts of funds are going to be committed to it long term. You wonder whether it is what it really sounds like, which is a great PR exercise to try and take some of the heat off the government—and they are increasingly gaining the spotlight they deserve—and make them look like they are doing something that addresses the real problem.</para>
<para>I take this opportunity to emphasise the significance of the evidence and the ever-growing detail of the need to act very quickly. We have already heard and seen details of reports of significant amounts of western Siberia undergoing an unprecedented thaw. That might be the tipping point, an irreversible action once it starts, where huge amounts of methane, far more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, will start being released into the atmosphere. Once that process starts, it will be irreversible.</para>
<para>The World Wide Fund for Nature released—just this week, I think—a report called <inline font-style="italic">Europe feels the heat</inline>, which highlights significant evidence of temperature rises in European capital cities over the past 35 years. There have been very significant rises in many of those cities in the last few decades, including an average increase of two degrees in London and similar amounts in places like Madrid, Luxembourg, Athens and Lisbon. We have also seen reports of record heat levels in places like Alaska. We have seen reports of extremely rapid and widespread melting of glaciers in the Austrian Alps. There was a report in the <inline font-style="italic">International Herald Tribune</inline> that the glaciers in Austria are shrinking at record rates. This has not only environmental consequences—the glaciers are melting, according to this report, between four to eight metres a year—but very significant economic impacts in terms of tourism for that particular region, not only in Austria but in other countries surrounding those particular colder, mountainous areas. Those are a few examples of the ever-growing amount of evidence about the need to do something.</para>
<para>It once again provides me with the need to remind the Senate and this government of the enormous opportunity they have squandered that was provided through the emphasis the Democrats have always given to this issue for well over a decade. We were able to use our position in the Senate at one stage six years ago to get the government to commit $400 million over four years to seriously start trying to address and put in place long-term initiatives for the future in renewable energy technologies and other aspects that would significantly address the need for greenhouse gas abatement. The failure of the government to properly implement that program and to properly spend that significant amount of money was a massive broken pledge not only to the Democrats but also to the parliament and the Australian people. This was a massive missed opportunity to put in place a significant period of time ago proper programs and long-term initiatives that would start to turn around the poor performance of Australia in reducing greenhouse emissions.</para>
<para>I do not suggest that, to fix this problem, we have to try to close down the coal industry tomorrow. I do not suggest that it is pointless to try to put resources into reducing the emission consequences of coal, because of course we will have coal-fired power stations for a significant time into the future. But I do suggest it is wrong that we put the vast majority of resources into that area, particularly into untested technology, and not into some areas where there are lower or, in some cases, zero emissions. It is simply a failure of duty, and it is a failure of nerve of this government. It is a decision to take the easy option—to take the short-term approach, rather than to show a little bit of vision. We are not even talking about a century down the track or our grandchildren’s generation—the long-term vision that the Democrats have often called for. We are just talking about a vision of perhaps a decade forward, or something like that; anything more than six months, a year or the next election. If we can get that sort of vision put in place by this government, backed up by the funds that were there and not used properly, that were made available and then withdrawn, then we could start to move forward on this.</para>
<para>The fact is that this was an urgent matter six years ago, when the Democrats were able to initiate movement in this area. Some small advances from that time are still in place in renewable areas, particularly in better fuel quality, but the significant, major advances that ought to have been made then, when the chance was there, were not made. It was urgent six years ago; it is super urgent now. Our continuing failure to take the significant, visionary, major action that is required is one of the biggest indictments of this government. Continual initiatives and so-called partnerships, announcements and statements like these are little better than another piece of nice wrapping paper over the previous processes, and they are never going to be anywhere near sufficient. This issue will continue to be a priority of the Democrats. It needs to be a priority for action rather than rhetoric from this government.</para>

<para>—Mr President, last year’s federal election produced a remarkable electoral trinity. For the first time since Menzies’ success in 1955 a Liberal Prime Minister secured a fourth consecutive term of office. Second, it was the first time since 1980 and, more importantly, since the Senate was expanded in 1984 that any government had been able to secure a majority in both houses of the parliament. Third, it was the first time in a half Senate election that the Liberal Party of Queensland was able to secure the return of three senators.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Queenslanders made an impressive contribution to the first and second of these successes and, of course, were wholly responsible for the third. One consequence of this success is that Queenslanders now outnumber Victorians in the Liberal party room. Although I was born in Melbourne, I record this historic development with considerable delight and satisfaction.</para>
<para>Much attention has been given to the apparently dire consequences which will almost certainly follow from the government’s new Senate majority. For some, it seems, democracy has come to an inglorious end. I very much doubt whether the poet John O’Brien had the Senate in mind when he had Hanrahan proclaim, ‘We’ll all be rooned,’ but for many it seems that farmer’s despair has a modern resonance. In truth, the new Senate keeps faith with a profoundly significant constitutional idea: namely, that at the heart of Australia’s parliamentary system there should exist a strong, democratically elected upper house. As Dr John Quick remarked at the 1897 Federal Convention, ‘We are creating a Senate that will feel the sap of popular election in its veins.’ At the time, this was a bold experiment in constitutional design and, for over a century, it has been an enduring source of the Senate’s political legitimacy.</para>
<para>I imagine all of us who sit here today are very conscious of those strong democratic instincts. For my part, I feel a special connection with that tradition. My great grandfather, Sir Arthur Rutledge, was a founding father. He was a strong advocate of Federation and a very proud member of the Queensland delegation to the 1891 Constitutional Convention in Sydney. As a Samuel Griffith Liberal, he would have been delighted with the results of the 2004 election and would have thought the outcome wholly consistent with the founders’ constitutional design.</para>
<para>Several generations on, I feel very privileged to come here as a representative of the people of Queensland. I am conscious they have sent me to our national parliament; from my perspective, I sit here, alongside my Queensland colleagues, entrusted with a national responsibility: to help govern for all Australians, not just those in our state. I aim to do this conscientiously: first, in a way that reflects the political philosophy and principles of my own great party and, second, conscious that the Senate has always been most faithful to its constitutional design when it acts as a house of review, ensuring the accountability of the executive arm of government.</para>
<para>The new Senate assembles with a crowded policy agenda in a changing world. Change, of course, is an enduring part of life. But today its speed can be disorienting. We struggle to define its dimensions. Is ours the age of terrorism or, perhaps, emancipation? Is it, perhaps, the age of American pre-eminence? It is all these things, but, more comprehensively, ours is the era of globalisation: we live in the first truly global age in human history. For many, globalisation is a policy, an enterprise to be encouraged or disparaged, according to preference. For me, it is the phenomenon of our times. We might ease its impact, confront its sometimes troubling consequences and take advantage of its opportunities but, like the Industrial Revolution, we cannot easily change its course. We are bound to deal with its reality.</para>
<para>To invoke Antonio Gramsci, there are ‘morbid symptoms’ of globalisation, but more often than not we are forced to confront its paradoxes: a world where major interstate war may be in decline but new threats and insecurities proliferate; a place where we can create wealth and prosperity but amid terrible poverty. Above all, a globalised world is one of interdependence, where countries and communities are increasingly interconnected. This does not mean the end of the nation state, but it does mean that the distinction between foreign and domestic policy is disappearing. Our borders are more porous—more open to people, goods and ideas but also to crime, pests and disease.</para>
<para>These realities confront us with immense challenges. We could have no better servant in seeking to overcome them than a well- and broadly-educated population. In a globalised world, military power is still important. But a strong education system, a capacity for technological innovation and a strong research culture in our universities are surely the new foundations of wealth. Ideas and education matter, not just for the prosperity they promise but because free and open societies depend on them.</para>
<para>I am fortunate to have received a good and some might even say excessive university education on three continents. Not surprisingly, perhaps, I am deeply committed to Australia’s higher education system having the resources it needs to meet the national and international challenges it now confronts. But I also know that we cannot neglect the technical and vocational sector of post-secondary education. In this context I applaud the Howard government’s substantial commitment of resources to new technical colleges. We now need to encourage their use within those parts of our community and in the high schools where the culture of university preference is so deeply entrenched. We must change this for the sake of those of our children for whom university is neither an ambition nor an option.</para>
<para>If education is our future, open markets are one of the modern realities of globalisation. Some say this is an anathema. I am one who regards them as critical to generating wealth and prosperity. Still, I know that Australia’s embrace of free trade has caused pain to some Australians, many in my own state of Queensland. When coupled with crippling drought, low prices for some commodities such as sugar, farm consolidation, new environmental laws and much else, people in our regions have been suffering. Regional and remote Australia is also feeling the effects of people moving to more populated areas with better infrastructure, services and jobs. Country towns in western Queensland have been seriously affected.</para>
<para>My conviction is that we need to revisit the task of regional and rural development. In recent years the Howard government has done much to ease the burdens of regional Australians. But I believe we should strive to develop a more comprehensive, integrated, longer term approach to the problem of regional development. Our aim should be to build an economically viable, environmentally sustainable and socially secure future for the people in regional and rural Australia. This is a challenge I am very happy to take up.</para>
<para>Australia has never sought to isolate itself from the realities of the international environment. We have always believed—correctly, in my view—that our interests are best served by seeking to play an active and constructive role in world affairs. And, today more than ever, globalisation demands engagement. We should assume this burden with confidence. Certainly, the world beyond is sometimes hostile to our interests and, of course, there are constraints on our capacity to act. But Australia has been remarkably successful in drawing on the character and resilience of its people to confront sometimes enormous challenges. We do not go abroad with missionary zeal. Our way, in that memorable phrase of JDB Miller, one of our most eminent foreign affairs academics, is that of ‘a dogged, low-gear idealism’.</para>
<para>In foreign policy we have always been most successful, our capacity for international leadership most evident and our international standing at its highest when we have drawn on our enduring strengths. These have emerged over a century. The essence of this tradition is clear: strong but not uncritical support for allies, robust bilateralism, a willingness to use military force when strategic necessity demands it, a respect for international law, an instinct for problem solving and a commitment to effective and creative multilateralism. I characterise this tradition as ‘middle-power realism’, and its elements remain relevant today. As the Howard government’s foreign policy demonstrates, adapted to contemporary circumstance it offers a reliable compass by which to navigate the sometimes treacherous waters of global politics.</para>
<para>Traditions are important, but there is a need to renovate. We can always do more. To this end, I would encourage the government’s attention to three possible reforms in the area of foreign and defence policy: the development of a national security strategy, clearly articulated and regularly updated; the creation of a national security council for improved security planning and crisis management; and the allocation of more resources to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I believe these reforms will significantly improve Australia’s ability to make and conduct a strong national security policy.</para>
<para>Today two issues are at the forefront of our international agenda. The first is international terrorism. This constitutes a clear and present threat not only to Australia’s way of life but to freedom everywhere. The fanatics who are determined to use terror cannot be allowed to succeed. In a free society their terror, their horror, can never have legitimacy. It is to be condemned utterly as a means of political action. So should their vision for our future.</para>
<para>Ending terrorism will be a long-term struggle. It demands action both at home and abroad. Internationally, massive military power is likely to be of less value than cooperative diplomacy, collaborative policing and coalitions to secure reliable and timely intelligence. But the challenges in this struggle are not just abroad. It now tests our rights and obligations as citizens. We will need to balance the protection of our civil liberties against the need for greater security. Most Australians will tolerate more restrictions made in the name of security. But in a common-law country such as Australia parliament has a responsibility to guard and protect the people against excesses of power. Whatever we do in the Senate to give the government the power it justly needs to fight terrorism, we would be wise to give it very close scrutiny and be wary of conceding power permanently or without continuing parliamentary oversight.</para>
<para>The second international challenge is that of Iraq. This has been a divisive issue in our society, though in my view our path should be clear. I recall that on the day the conflict began in March 2003 I wrote, in one of our better national dailies, that I believed the task of securing the stability of Iraq would be a problematic endeavour, politically difficult and financially expensive. Any number of threats and dangers, I suggested, could easily sink freedom’s grand enterprise. It gives me little satisfaction to now reflect on the accuracy of my prediction.</para>
<para>But we are now two years on and we are obliged to confront the reality of the present situation, and that to my mind is straightforward. The Iraqi people are confronting a brutal and bloody insurgency. It is orchestrated by a repressive fundamentalist coalition of locals and outsiders and is costing the lives of many innocent people. The majority Iraqi aspiration for a free, peaceful and prosperous future is being denied by a bloody campaign of terror. No country, no people should be subjected to such excruciating pain, least of all Iraq, which has already endured so much under Saddam. It is not in our interests to see this campaign of terror succeed. Once again the Iraqi people would be forced to live in a state of subjugation. Democracy’s prospects in the Middle East would be set back. Terror would be given a valuable victory. America’s will to engage abroad would likely be shaken. None of these things could possibly be of benefit to Australia. I support our continuing commitment to the people of Iraq. We should remain until our mission has been completed or we are asked to leave. Credible security policy demands no less.</para>
<para>Within the context of a rapidly changing world, no region is more important to Australia’s long-term future security and prosperity than East Asia. Queensland’s already well-established ties with the region in areas such as trade, education and professional services testifies to this modern reality. As my academic career testifies, I am a long-time enthusiast for Australia’s closer engagement with the region. I am also very proud of my party’s distinguished record of progress towards this goal. It is a record that reaches back to the very earliest stages of Australia’s foreign policy before the Second World War. It finds a contemporary resonance in the recent decision to sign ASEAN’s Treaty of Amity and Cooperation and thus secure a place at the new East Asian summit meeting in Kuala Lumpur in December 2005.</para>
<para>That summit could well be the most important geostrategic development in East Asia since the end of the Second World War. It is yet another sign that our relations with East Asia are entering a new phase. In the coming decades, China’s rise is likely to overshadow all other events in the region. This will not only facilitate East Asia’s progress to being the dynamic centre of an increasingly interdependent global economy but also reshape the foundations of the region’s political order. My guess is that this will present us with as many challenges as opportunities. My conviction is that we should face them with confidence—not, as sometimes in the past, with the mendicant mentality of a people transplanted from their European roots and desperate to discover an identity but rather as Australians, clear-eyed about our national interests and confident that those interests are inextricably fused with the region’s future.</para>
<para>The tenor and texture of our relations with the region’s great powers will shape much of our regional destiny. None is likely to be more central than China. Here we should aspire to an increasingly constructive relationship across the full range of our political, economic and strategic interests. It should, however, be tempered by the reality that China is a great power on the rise—one whose political ideology we do not share, whose regional aspirations will cause a profound shift in the geopolitical landscape and whose relations with our great ally the United States could well shift between amity and tension. Australia’s relationship with Japan has now moved well beyond trade and is among our closest in the region. We should look to expand on existing areas of cooperation and grasp the opportunity for the closer strategic partnership now being offered.</para>
<para>In South-East Asia no country is more important to Australia than Indonesia. Senators will perhaps not be surprised to learn that, as a former member of the board of the Australia-Indonesia Institute, I regard closer ties between our two countries as being of the utmost importance. Our relations with Indonesia will often be a challenge to manage successfully. Even so, a healthy, expanding, cooperative relationship is strongly in both countries’ interests, and I trust both sides will remain committed to that objective. In South Asia, we have for too long ignored the importance of developing a closer relationship with India. Our broad range of shared interests is self-evidently much greater than just cricket. The rapid growth in India’s market economy, the connection via the Commonwealth and our now common membership of the East Asia summit are just three of many compelling reasons to work harder at deepening our bilateral ties.</para>
<para>Engagement with Asia will be easier if we give it national priority. Shared interests do not absolve us from having continually to make our case to the countries of the region. They do not absolve us of being mindful of the values of Asian societies and their cultures, of being knowledgeable about the burdens of their history or of being able to speak their languages. As the distinguished Asian academic Wang Gungwu remarked in 1992:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There is more work for Australians to do to enable Asians to see them as they should.</para>

<para class="block">It is doubtless also the case that Asians have more work to do as well.</para>
<para>Mr President, it is an enormous privilege to have been elected to the Senate. I am one of only 512 people since Federation and one of only 80 Queenslanders to have been given this signal honour. I would not be here without the strong support of the members, and especially my close friends, within the Queensland Liberals. I thank them most sincerely. But the burden of my candidacy for the Senate has been borne by my family: my wife Dale and my children James and Phoebe, all of whom are here in the gallery tonight. They, more than any, have made the sacrifices that have given me the opportunity to serve. I am enormously grateful.</para>
<para>In closing, I once again thank Queenslanders most sincerely for sending me here. I am looking forward enormously to working for them in the national interest. I thank the Senate for its attention.</para>

</talker>
<para>—Thank you, Mr President. I am truly honoured to stand in this place today on behalf of the Australian Labor Party and the people of Western Australia who have put their trust and faith in me. It is a great privilege that has been bestowed on me and I will honour that trust and faith at all times. I congratulate my parliamentary colleagues who are also here as a result of electoral success last year. In particular, to the 14 colleagues who, like me, are walking the red carpet corridors for the first time this session as a senator: my best wishes are with you as we fulfil our roles on this great democratic stage.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>While there is much that we in this chamber might disagree on, I suspect that those of us who stand here for the first time would be united on at least one point, and that is the appreciation we have for those who have helped us to get here. I certainly did not cross the Nullarbor to this place alone. I have been fortunate enough to have a convoy of hardworking members and officials of the Transport Workers Union, the TWU, at my side. They have steered my path to our nation’s capital and provided me with perhaps life’s greatest lessons along the way. I am particularly proud to stand here alongside other former TWU officials, Senator Hutchins and Senator Conroy.</para>
<para>Mr President, I would like to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of John Allan, Jim McGiveron, Tony Sheldon and Alex Gallegher. Together, these men form the Federal Committee of Management of the Transport Workers Union of Australia—an institution that has for over 100 years fought, at times bitterly, for the advancement of transport workers. That resolve is no weaker today nor will it ever cower in the shadow of an arrogant government, like the one we face in this country today. Like so many of our nation’s other unions and union activists at this juncture in our history, I am sure the Transport Workers Union is poised and ready for battle, because the protection of workers is not an optional extra; it is a right.</para>
<para>That is not simply a hollow sentiment; it is a creed that I have lived by since the first time I heard it from a brash young TWU organiser at a delegates meeting in the 1980s. I heard and saw in that organiser exactly how it should be for workers—always having someone to stand up for those who are unable to stand up for themselves; knowing that there was a collective and unyielding drive for workplace fairness and equity; and having confidence that, while you got on with your job, there was someone behind you at every turn demonstrating a passion above all else to fight on your behalf for what was right. The organiser to whom I refer is Jim McGiveron—a man who has never taken a backward step in his life. He has charged ahead without fear, been a leader and a ground-breaker and, above all else, he has been a mate—and for that I am eternally grateful.</para>
<para>In 1991 I became an organiser for the Transport Workers Union and I was given my chance to do what Jimmy had done for me and so many like me: work to improve the pay and conditions for hardworking men and women of the transport industry. So, to my wife’s great satisfaction, I traded in the long hauls over our rugged and unrelenting terrain as an owner-driver truckie and headed into the even more rugged and unrelenting terrain of a union office. While not every battle was won in the 14 years that I was with the TWU, I can honestly say that they were all hard fought. The people of Western Australia can expect the same of me here. I will continue to stand up for the things that I believe in and the things that matter. Like in times past, irrespective of the challenge, I will always fight hard.</para>
<para>A great deal of our journey here is steered by those people who are waiting for us when we leave our workplaces and walk through the doors of our homes. It is to those people in my life that I would like to pay homage. I feel particularly lucky to have the support and presence in the gallery today of members of my family, both those chosen by nature, my parents, brother and sister, and the ones that came as part of a package when Fiona actually said ‘Yes’ to my badly worded but heartfelt marriage proposal all those years ago. My life is certainly all the richer for having each and every one of them in it.</para>
<para>My best friend for the last 27 years has also been my wife for the last 23 years—Fiona. She has been the most steadying influence in my life. She has always supported me through my years of trucking and my life as a union organiser—which has been no small feat. She is the one who had to play the role of both mother and father to our two children when they were very young as I was nearly always away on the road somewhere between Perth and Darwin. Fiona ran the household and held our family together nearly every day on her own. Working away from home I could not be there at the end of the day, and on many weekends, to share the parenting duties and ease the load. I still cannot imagine how hard it must have been for Fiona when our second child was only three days old and I had to head back to Darwin. While many senators who are parents can appreciate the challenges in taking a newborn baby home, they will also appreciate the lack of excitement a three-year-old can have for a new sibling. But Fiona took it all in her stride. The strength and conviction I have needed to make choices in my life has so often come from Fiona and the journey that has brought me here today is no exception. That is why I know that, whatever the challenges ahead, with Fiona by my side they will never be too great. To our two children, Kirsty and Daniel, you are the reasons why I try to be the best I can. You have made my life far from ordinary and you are a constant reminder that all of us who come before have an obligation to pave an easier way for those who come after us. Thank you both.</para>
<para>Thinking back to my own childhood I can say that life was certainly different when I was growing up with my younger brother and sister in the state housing commission suburb of Langford in Perth’s east. Langford was the typical working-class suburb. It was created in the early 1970s when low-income earners had the chance to live the great Australian dream of owning a home. Simple pleasures like a Mr Whippy ice cream were something we very rarely experienced in Langford, but we never felt disadvantaged because no-one in our street got one. In fact, it must have been a big decision for Mr Whippy to even enter Langford knowing it would probably cost more to run the van than he was going to earn in sales.</para>
<para>My dad was a truck driver and my mum was a nurse. It was often the case that as one of our parents stepped in from work the other stepped out to work a night shift. The importance of working hard was instilled in me by my parents from a very early age and it is an ethos that I have carried all through my adult working life. It was my dad who introduced me to the furniture removal industry when I was very young. He was a truckie who travelled the length and breadth of Western Australia, across the Nullarbor and into the Eastern States. I will never forget the first time I actually got to go with dad down south in his truck to deliver a load of furniture. I was nine years old and the thrill of riding in the cab of a truck was a dream come true. Although I was just a kid, the one thing I knew was that my future as a truckie was only a matter of time.</para>
<para>I officially entered the work force in 1977 as an assistant furniture removalist at Wridgways, working up to a driver and then becoming an owner driver in 1980—hauling road trains into the Pilbara, the Goldfields, Kimberly and the Northern Territory. At that time I only occasionally ventured across the Nullarbor. Funnily enough, one such occasion was to deliver the very seats that our parliamentary colleagues on the other side of this great building sit on. For those who do not know, the seats in both chambers of the federal parliament were made in Western Australia. Even back then in 1987, as I loaded a road train full of the green leather seats, I had a much stronger preference for the red ones that sat alongside them in the furniture factory, located in the Perth suburb of Riverton. It says a lot about the opportunities provided in this great country of ours that a worker who once delivered the seats to this parliament is now working from one of them, representing the people of Western Australia.</para>
<para>As a worker in the transport industry I developed a keen interest in the union movement and before long I became a union delegate. I was particularly drawn to the TWU’s proven ability to achieve success for its members, and it was when I attended a union meeting in my early 20s that I learnt the true meaning of collective responsibility. Workers can achieve anything they desire as long as they, alongside their union representatives, are prepared to make the hard decisions and stand united in their convictions, but also provided that their elected parliamentary representatives do not treat them with contempt. In the same way, Australian voters can achieve anything provided they play an active role in decisions about our country’s future. That means always voicing an opinion about who will lead, how they will lead and whether or not the leaders are doing the job they expect of them.</para>
<para>It seems like an eternity since I first rode on the engine cover of that truck with my dad, and it is a long time since I sat behind the wheel of a road train hauling furniture. But regardless of the time that has passed there is one thing that remains very fresh in my memory and that is when another conservative government saw the need for workplace reform. In the 1990s individual workplace agreements were introduced in Western Australia by the Richard Court led coalition government. This was an era that saw tens of thousands of Western Australian workers protesting in the streets of Perth against an archaic wave of industrial legislation that did nothing other than erode the take home pay and conditions of workers across the board. This was an era that I lived and breathed as a union organiser. I saw first-hand those workers, who did not have the support of collective bargaining and union representation, forced into signing agreements that guaranteed they were worse off. Workers who raised an objection were told quite clearly that they did not have to sign but if they refused then they could always find another job. So, as we learnt hard and fast in Western Australia, so-called ‘industrial reform’ at the hands of an arrogant conservative government can so easily become a scalpel for unscrupulous employers to cut through the skin of their workers without consent, without anything to ease the pain and without regard for what that will do to their lives. It is interesting to note, Mr President, that since the Gallop Labor government repealed the flawed Western Australian workplace agreements, Western Australia has become the engine room of the Australian economy, with growth and export figures the envy of other states.</para>
<para>I know, as a former small business operator, that competition is fierce out in the market place, which means that for many businesses to simply stay afloat they must have an acute understanding of, ‘If you want my business then you have to sharpen the pencil.’ So, employers do sharpen the pencil. But growing a business does not need to be done at the expense of its workers or their safety—in fact, it can and should be the contrary, because the best asset of a business is its people. For a truckie, one way to sharpen the pencil is to lengthen the service interval of the truck. Alternatively, a cheaper brand of tyres can be purchased—even though the kilometre lifespan is reduced—retreads can be used or monthly repayments on capital can be stretched out. But when it is time to retender, the truck is worn out, the driver is burnt out and only if they are very lucky there is still a family waiting at home after each trip.</para>
<para>It is only the scale of economy that is different between a major employer and a small business operator. The cost of goods, services and machinery can only be negotiated down to a certain point. In the transport industry, fuel companies, tyre suppliers, insurers, auto-electricians and repairers do not care how cheaply a trucking firm has negotiated to deliver on a contract; they all have their price for what they provide and as an owner-driver you pay it.</para>
<para>No worker will be better off under the Howard government’s proposed industrial relations changes. And to say that they will be is either a gross misunderstanding of what is being proposed or a gross deception. We are already seeing the winds of revolt. Earlier today 500 truckies gave up a day’s earnings to drive to Canberra and deliver the very clear message to John Howard that they are not prepared to sit back and watch the demolition of their working rights while the government pursues its extreme industrial relations agenda. For that they deserve not only our respect but also our support.</para>
<para>This government’s word is worthless when it comes to looking after workers. In 1997 the Office of the Employment Advocate was set up to scrutinise workplace agreements and ensure that the so-called no disadvantage clause was adhered to. What has happened in practice has been a betrayal of the trust Australians had put in the Prime Minister and his government. The Office of the Employment Advocate has let down thousands of workers, failing to protect their pay and conditions. In short, the Prime Minister has become the organ grinder and the Office of the Employment Advocate his monkey, dancing to the tune of its political master.</para>
<para>I am not prepared to see history repeated, particularly as I have been entrusted by Western Australians to best represent their interests. I appeal to all members of this place to think long and hard about the future for Australian workers and their families. Certainly no Labor senator will live with the guilt of creating a fractured society where the bottom line is given far greater value than workers and their lives. The truth is that no senator needs to feel guilty; the choice is yours. To borrow from Confucius: ‘To know what is right and not to do it is the worst cowardice.’ So, to my fellow senators: when we leave this place, even if you are remembered for little else, do not be remembered as one of Howard’s cowards.</para>
<para>We need only look as far as any corner of this building to be reminded that it was because of the hard work and commitment of around 50,000 workers that we have such a wonderful building for our federal parliament. So look into that corner, contemplate how the concrete was laid, appreciate the massive task of polishing all the floors we walk along each day, notice the faces of the Senate support staff, Comcar drivers, food service workers, cleaners, security guards, Hansard staff, gift shop team and tour guides, to name just a few. Never forget that we owe it to all Australian workers to use the power of this place to protect them for as long as we are here.</para>
<para>As enshrined in the party’s platform, Labor was born out of the trade union movement and its struggle for a secure, decent and dignified life for working people. The partnership between the two great wings of the labour movement has been essential to deal with the consequences of the industrial revolution. And, after nine long years of a conservative government that is out of touch, we find ourselves poised on the verge of a new industrial revolution that will have disastrous consequences for Australian workers and their families. Although many working Australians voted Liberal for the first time at the last election, Labor has not and will not turn its back on them. As a Labor senator, I vow on behalf of 1.9 million Western Australians to take the fight up in the Senate. Thank you, Mr President.</para>

<para>—Thank you, Mr President. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge my parents who brought me into this world, my wife, Natalie, and children Bridgette, Julia, Caroline and Odette who support me in this world, and my God who oversees all and who hopefully I will meet in the next. I read this speech to my wife in the TV room at home and was impressed how diligently she listened until I realised she was asleep.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>To the people of Queensland, I am your senator and your servant. In serving you to my best ability I will be fulfilling the best role for our country and fulfilling the constitutional role laid out for our nation at its inception and after years of deliberation. For all Queenslanders who are here for the first time, you might be surprised to know that the colour scheme was once blue in this chamber but we have since had it changed to maroon and I hope you are happy with the result.</para>
<para>What cannot be changed and is still the dilemma is that politics talks in riddles and packs with verbiage what is absolutely crystal clear at the mothers morning tea or the local hotel. Politics appears to be the art of telling half the story and your followers guess the rest while using the absence of the complete message as a defence against the implication drawn by your deriders.</para>
<para>When things get contentious we blame our faction or the joint party room as a reason that plasters over a personal political ambition. As with human nature, this is not unique to Australia but leaves a political monoculture that can be less than inspiring and does not give credit to the public’s ability to hear all sides of the debate and understand that a decision which favours one side has to be made.</para>
<para>I know it may be truly naive but it would be nice to see the debate unencumbered in this chamber, not in the caucus room or in the joint party room. Neither of these are mentioned in the Constitution and it is a convenient appendix designed by political parties that was specifically not entertained in the Constitution.</para>
<para>Our nation stands at the edge of a new epoch. Together in this house we have all been given the immense honour and responsibility to navigate our Australia in a world tormented or governed by new elements—elements such as new diseases, including the H5M1 virus which could decimate our country’s social and economic fabric; Islamic or other fundamentalism; or, as mentioned here earlier tonight, the emergence of China as a new superpower. Managed well, these issues will drive our nation’s sails to a new destiny or, alternatively, not managed, cast us upon the savage rocks. Eternal vigilance alone will not sustain us. It has to be a partner of considered but resolute action. There will be as much in amendments to the rules of this century as there was between the turmoil of the 20th century and its antecedent.</para>
<para>Compounding this is that the efficacy of previous alliances may wane as new threats to our belief structure rise. There is only one defence to this and that is our internal belief that we must construct a strong and self-sufficient nation on a platform of a society where children live quiet and unaffected prior to the turmoil of adulthood. To achieve this we must encourage a just parliament, vibrant enough to consider all alternatives.</para>
<para>There is a new troika whose reins we hold. The horses are, firstly, the relationship between the new international dynamics of emerging superpowers and our future in reference between that and our current economic and personal freedoms. Next is the survival of the Australian principle to pursue your own potential in business and belief so as to attain your highest potential of personal freedom by being master of the greatest portion of your life. Whilst pursuing this there must be the respect of the totality of the lives of others, irrespective of what stage that human life is at. Finally, to be brave enough in this house that we believe that it is not only good for our nation but intrinsically good for our region and our world that we develop a strong and robust country that inspires the freedoms we hold dear as a common goal of all peoples and, as such, is our legacy to the world in which we live.</para>
<para>My small part in this greater design is to work with and be considerate of all my colleagues here in protecting those wider principles whilst pursuing those issues that the National Party has given a commitment to the people of Queensland that I would pursue on their behalf. My National Party Senate team took to the people of Queensland four issues and these were framed on the greater freedom of the individual in balance with the greater interest of the community in which we live: the overcentralisation of the retail market, mandated ethanol usage, zonal taxation and core family values. As particular as these issues are, they reflected a wider and deeper philosophical commitment by the National Party to the lives of its constituents and reflected the Senate’s role as the house representing not a factional or particular interest but the interests of the state.</para>
<para>The purpose of the economy is not to produce the lowest price product for the end consumer. That may be a consequence of a good economy but it is not the purpose. The purpose of the economy is to create the greater nexus between the wealth of the nation and its people, and it generally does this through small business.</para>
<para>Today we have accepted a situation in Australia that would be unacceptable elsewhere in the world: we allow two retailers to control between 75 and 85 per cent of our retail market. In the USA you need to count the top 12 retailers before you arrive at the market share that our top two have. In the UK it is the top eight. In Australia this disenfranchises the right of our citizens to attain the greatest level of their personal freedom by attaining the highest level of control over their destiny, which comes by being master of your own business.</para>
<para>The freedom I will pursue is the choice to enter and chart your own commercial life and in doing so give a greater breadth to the economy in which we are all benefactors. New and expanded products, new managerial techniques, new holders of wealth investing in new areas of the nation is a vision that is peculiar to any economy or part thereof that stays in front of the vast wave of economic prosperity. Likewise, we must look to those areas of our nation that have been left behind or have never been part of the economic prosperity that is so apparent in Australia today.</para>
<para>This government, the government under whose stewardship we currently prosper, has responsibility to look into the corners where the dust has settled and there is a socioeconomic bind. If a regional area produces little or no return when we compare the tax revenue with the social security cost then little is lost by capping the tax rate. If we cap it for the individual who both works and lives in this area then we have proceeded on the first step to inspire development of new areas of our continent. We have to believe that this house represents a nation that has the bravery to frame a new chapter that utilises the gifts God has bestowed on us in a form that goes beyond minor manipulations of the residential construction based service industries of current major metropolitan coastal centres.</para>
<para>We must bolt on to those sections of the economy that place product on a boat that sustains the standard of living that so many of our citizens take as a birthright. You cannot be a great nation of kitchen renovators. In developing our current industry strengths in new areas by new entrants we also relieve the public infrastructure gridlock that is becoming so apparent in the Sydney basin or the south-east corner of Queensland. There is little wrong with the roads in Sydney or Brisbane—it is just that there are too many cars on them. If we do not decisively move now to give a greater reason to live elsewhere, preferably inland, then what are we to expect, except an exacerbation of the current water, transport, social and environmental problems that are becoming more and more evident in these megacities in the most sparsely populated nation on earth?</para>
<para>The only thing that is stopping us is the fear of trying. It seems peculiar for a nation that prides itself on the stoic heroism of Gallipoli or the Kokoda Track that we are fearful of setting up a concrete new agenda of development of new areas. Further, it is essential to deal with the evermore evident problem—of which water restrictions in Sydney and the Gold Coast are only one of the most minor of the impending manifestations—of an urban coastal development saturation point.</para>
<para>Our nation cannot expect to prevail with its transport needs if it has to import an oil based product that is limited in supply, with an ever escalating demand driven by nations such as India and China. Every 10 years, at the current rate, India and China will alone produce a middle-class the size of the United States. And, as will be the case with many products essential to our day-to-day lives, they are quite happy to pay a price for fuel that makes our economy unviable, as we could not afford to operate with that overhead.</para>
<para>As a nation, we have to prepare for this. We cannot deal with it once it has arrived. It will overwhelm us and cause a dislocation that we may not have experienced before. Mandating ethanol is a path that offers the nation not only a way to deal with our own transport requirements but also the ability to supply others with the fundamentals of theirs. Mandating ethanol assists in alternatives to deal with our ever-escalating trade account deficit that is itself driven by the chase for the expensive oil based fuel of our oil based fuel economy. Ethanol allows us to develop the seed base for Australian producers to be the benefactors of the biorenewable fuel industry of the 21st century, and not the casualties of it.</para>
<para>We are a nation that relies on terms of trade and those items that we put on the boat to pay for the goods that maintain our standard of living. These products generally come from the regional areas of our nation and we must bolt on to these areas and not replace them with imports that greater exacerbate our vulnerability. If I sell you a pizza, or you do my tax return, or a solicitor fulfils his conveyancing for a client, even though all these jobs are inherently valuable and part of our gross domestic product, they do not pay for one drop of our nation’s fuel that is imported, nor the imported car it is in. We have to ask ourselves: what did we put on the boat today to support our nation and what did we consume that came off it? If the equation is unfavourable, make sure you support those who balance the equation for us all.</para>
<para>The future of the National Party has to evolve and is evolving. John Anderson correctly pointed out that there are fewer than 100,000 farmers, and so the vast, vast majority of our voters are not farmers, nor would we survive if they were. We are the party of small business and our heritage is that of the small business of primary production. We are now the party of many, including builders, plumbers, newsagents, hairdressers, pharmacists, fishermen, accountants, real estate agents, graziers, regional townspeople and those who believe that the socially conservative society is a protection against the pains of social experimentation and who prefer not to take the risk. When large and small business clash we will support small business. As such, we should strengthen section 46 of the Trade Practices Act, increase the powers of the ACCC and investigate divestiture powers when market domination is unwarranted, unmanageable and unable to be curtailed in other ways.</para>
<para>In the Senate, I believe that my job is to represent my state, Queensland. Not only do I believe that, but it was the decision in formulating the Commonwealth at Federation that this would be the case. The same Constitution that has given our country the period of unbridled internal freedom should not be manipulated unless absolutely vital and no alternative exists. The Australian people so categorically endorse this when we take into account the vast majority of their decisions on these issues at a referendum. The questions have now to be asked: has the custom and practice created a constitutional change by default that has never been taken to the Australian people? Have we evolved to a point where a new form of voting by secret ballot in the Senate would address this and bring a better representation of the particular issues of states or areas within?</para>
<para>There is more in common between the centres of south-east Queensland than between the south-east of our state and the north. Perceptions on issues such as vegetation management, although predominantly a state issue, are one of many indications of this. A free and unencumbered vote by those from different states or different areas within states may reflect this. It also includes perceptions on issues such as the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, and the feeling that many have that the yoke of environmental conscience has been foisted on them without fair compensation of the loss of income or loss of asset. This is an eternal and justifiable complaint. Brick-and-tile suburbia of the capital cities have to be mindful of the encumbrances they place on the property of others, as it works to the detriment of the value of landed assets—the calibrator of personal wealth so fundamental to our freedom. It also detracts from the capacity of our nation to produce export income, which is the calibrator of our standard of living.</para>
<para>For all those who are wondering why I have not mentioned Telstra, well, it is an issue in motion. If we had not fought for parity of service and parity of price in this house then it would be sold with only the conditions achieved in the lower house. It is difficult to argue against something passed by my colleagues in the lower house but I do not resign from it. I am not convinced as to the reason to sell Telstra. Similarly, I was never convinced as to the reasons to sell the Commonwealth Bank. I am convinced that the ramifications of not participating in the debate would be to the detriment of regional Australia, as the decision made by others may be far worse. There are those who have called for me to be expelled from the coalition because of it, but that just makes me motivated to get it right.</para>
<para>Likewise, the anomaly that we have managed to package the cessation of compulsory student unionism with sporting infrastructure—a long-held, accepted part of university life—is something to behold. That some believe it is abominable that you have to reach into your pocket for $100 for the football, cricket and netball courts, but are apparently at ease with the fact that the nation reaches into its pockets for tens of thousands of dollars per year per student to keep the vast majority of university students in tuition is perplexing to say the least. These are two different issues. It is obvious that they are, and they should be treated as such.</para>
<para>Debate on these and other issues will be the case whilst the coalition has a majority in both houses. It shows the Australian people there is nothing to fear from the coalition having a majority in both houses when the senators fulfil their duty their Constitution gives them to represent their state as the best means of representing their nation.</para>
<para>Away from partisan politics, I would dearly love to have this house open its heart and have the courage to have a broader debate on when we attain our right to be nurtured, protected and supported to our full potential. At what point between conception and when we leave the moorings of our family as an independent adult do we attain the rights of a human with the protection it affords, and what is the philosophical premise of this position? I believe, if we are brave enough to have a respectful, non-politically-aligned debate on this, the most important of all issues, then we will have already grown by reason of this and as such be on the road to being a greater nation.</para>
<para>Abortion is the slavery debate of our time. It is brokered by good people on both sides. Long after the annals of time have forgotten that there ever was a National Party, a Liberal Party or a Labor Party, the immutable argument of the worth of human life will prevail and the acknowledgment of those who stood to defend it. My debate is with the action, not with the qualities or attributes of the person. There are no winners on abortion; all are left scarred and hurt, and there has to be a better way.</para>
<para>The fact that I stand here is a testament to firstly my wife, Natalie, and my children—to my mum and dad and family, who did what so many families do in so quiet and unassuming a way for little or no reward, to teachers such as my grandmother Troy, James Rogers, Mel Morrow, Father Drake and to the National Party and its supporters, such as Bill and Marilyn Taylor, Martin Tenni, Lenore Johnson, Denise Jeitz, John Grabbe, John and Beth Honeycombe, Terry Bolger, the late Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen—who was my mentor and whom I never met—Lady Flo Bjelke Petersen, who is my mentor now, the Weller family, Charlie Brownlow, the marvellous people of St George, Ron Bauhnish and so many, many more who have placed so much faith in me that I only hope to somehow repay them by respecting and working diligently for our state of Queensland, and by doing so making our nation of Australia a continuing legacy of justice and freedom.</para>
<para>I would like to finally acknowledge the work of Len Harris, and it should be some solace that we have replaced one regional based office in Queensland with another. Although there are many issues with which I disagreed, I respect absolutely that those who supported him have an equal right as any to be heard and treated with respect.</para>
<para>In summary to my purpose, I reflect on that of my grandmother Troy Roche, who left me with this piece from Kipling, and I conclude by leaving all here with the same. I hope that it may serve all of us in some fashion in the aspirations it lays out. It says:</para>

<para class="block">
<inline ref="R2382">CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 2005</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005 contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 that have previously been introduced into the Parliament as Customs Tariff Proposals.</para>
<para class="block">The bill amends Additional Note 3(a) to Chapter 22 to the Tariff to insert an upper limit of 22% alcohol content in respect of grape wine. The amendment will ensure that imported wine of fresh grapes, which does not comply with the revised Additional Note, will attract the same rate of customs duty as excise duty on similar locally manufactured product.</para>
<para class="block">The bill inserts references to Additional Note 4 to Chapter 22 in tariff subheadings 2206.00.30 and 2206.00.4. Additional Note 4 defines ‘grape wine product’, which includes certain wine based cream beverages, generically described as ‘Irish Cream’. When imported into Australia, these goods are subject to excise equivalent rates of customs duty, while similar goods manufactured in Australia are subject to the Wine Equalisation Tax. The new references will correct this anomaly.</para>
<para class="block">The bill also removes the three per cent tariff applying to ‘business inputs’ that are the subject of a Tariff Concession Order. A Tariff Concession Order provides concessional tariff rates for imported goods where there are no substitutable domestically produced goods. The removal of the three per cent tariff to a customs duty rate of Free will reduce business input costs, increase the international competitiveness of Australian business, and encourage investment in efficient and sustainable industries.</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">
<inline ref="R2292">BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Government is committed to doing all that is necessary to reform the building and construction industry.</para>
<para class="block">This bill reflects the Government’s commitment to ensuring the law as it applies to other industries is observed equally by all participants in the building and construction industry, regardless of whether they are union officials, employers or workers.</para>
<para class="block">The Government is not, as some have suggested, pursuing reform in this industry driven by some ideological agenda. Instead, the basis for the proposed reforms is well grounded in economic reality.</para>
<para class="block">Construction is a $50 billion a year industry, comprising nearly 7% of GDP and employing over 700,000 Australians.</para>
<para class="block">Despite being a significant contributor to the Australian economy, productivity in the building industry has clearly not kept pace with productivity in other industries, let alone productivity in the domestic housing sector.</para>
<para class="block">A study by Econtech found that if labour productivity in commercial construction matched the home building standard, it would result in a 1% decrease in CPI, a 1% increase in GDP and $2.3 billion in benefits to consumers, workers and taxpayers every year.</para>
<para class="block">The key difference, of course, between the commercial and the domestic construction sectors is the restrictive work practices on CBD construction projects.</para>
<para class="block">It would be bad enough if lawful restrictive work practices were the extent of the problems of the building industry. Unfortunately, the industry’s problems are much, much worse.</para>
<para class="block">The reasons for reform are therefore clear and indeed it would have been highly irresponsible for the government not to tackle the problems which plague the construction industry.</para>
<para class="block">The Royal Commission found that the commercial construction industry was characterised by: illegal and improper payments; chronic failure to honour legally binding agreements; and regular flouting of court and industrial tribunal orders; and a culture of coercion and intimidation:</para>
<para class="block">At the heart of the findings is lawlessness. It is exhibited in many ways. There are breaches of the criminal law. There are breaches of laws of general application to all Australians where the sanction is a penalty rather than possible imprisonment. There are breaches of many provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cwth). [Volume 1, page 6, para 17]</para>
<para class="block">The economy and community cannot bear the costs of such conduct, the laws of this country must apply equally to all citizens whether they be union officials, employers or employees.</para>
<para class="block">The Royal Commission noted that:</para>
<para class="block">These findings demonstrate an industry which departs from the standards of commercial and industrial conduct exhibited in the rest of the Australian economy. They mark the industry as singular. They indicate an urgent need for structural and cultural reform. [volume 1, page 6, para 16]</para>
<para class="block">In response to the Royal Commission’s Report the Government acted quickly to establish the Building Industry Taskforce which commenced operations in October 2002.</para>
<para class="block">This decision was consistent with a recommendation in the First Report of the Cole Royal Commission. Commissioner Cole’s intention was to establish an interim body to secure the law prior to the establishment of a national regulatory agency for the industry.</para>
<para class="block">The Taskforce performance has been a key factor in putting the brakes on the culture of coercion and intimidation that has existed in the industry.</para>
<para class="block">As at 30 June 2005, the Taskforce had received 3,037 enquiries, 2,738 of which had been responded to in one working day and 1,502 of which had been resolved within three working days. In the period to 30 June 2005, the Taskforce has placed 25 matters against unions and employers before the courts.</para>
<para class="block">Despite this testimony to the active role that the Taskforce has played in the industry, the industry remains plagued by a culture of civil disobedience, of coercion, intimidation and threatening behaviour, and of contempt for the very law that governs it.</para>
<para class="block">Another serious concern is the standard of occupational health and safety in the industry, which the Royal Commission found to be unacceptable. All employees, whether in the commercial construction industry or any other, have the right to expect a safe workplace. To improve occupational health and safety performance in the industry, behavioural and cultural change is necessary above all else. The Australian Government, as a major client of the building and construction industry, is well positioned to drive such change.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">KEY ELEMENTS OF THE BILL</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Compliance and Enforcement</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The centrepiece of the bill’s approach to improving compliance with the law in the building and construction industry is the establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner (ABC Commissioner).</para>
<para class="block">The ABC Commissioner will head a statutory agency with power to monitoring, investigating and prosecuting breaches of federal workplace relations laws in the industry. To secure broader compliance with the law across the industry, the ABC Commissioner will refer matters to other relevant State or federal agencies, such as Australian Securities and Investment Commission, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and Australian Taxation Office.</para>
<para class="block">The ABC Commissioner will have the power to appoint Australian Building and Construction Inspectors to monitor compliance with and, when appropriate, institute proceedings under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and the proposed Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005. The ABC Commissioner’s enforcement role will be underpinned by a stronger compliance regime with increased penalties that are more appropriate to the circumstances of the industry.</para>
<para class="block">Importantly, the ABC Commissioner will also be required to provide advice, assistance, information and education to the industry parties on the proposed Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005, the Workplace Relations Act 1996, Building Code, and issues affecting the industry.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">A new regulatory framework for the building and construction industry</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Workplace Relations Act 1996 will continue to provide the basis for workplace relations regulation in the industry. The bill strengthens and in some respects extends its provisions to address the inappropriate practices identified by the Royal Commission.</para>
<para class="block">In line with the Royal Commission’s recommendations the bill will have a wide application. The legislation, however, is designed to apply to the commercial construction sector and therefore largely excludes the domestic housing sector.</para>
<para class="block">It is important the bill have a wide coverage, through a broad definition of building work, so that it can effectively bring about the structural and cultural change the industry requires. Construction unions have demonstrated a willingness to target companies manufacturing products related to the building industry.</para>
<para class="block">The definition is therefore intended to ensure the problems endemic in the industry are not shifted further down the contractual chain and all those involved in the construction industry, whether on site or supplying essential materials, are covered by the enhanced regime to be introduced by the Act.</para>
<para class="block">Importantly, the definition of building work is able to be modified by regulations. This will ensure that minor adjustments can be made, to address any issues that may emerge from the practical operation of the Act. Any non-construction related activity inadvertently captured will be able to be excluded from the operation of the Act. Similarly, it will enable the addition of other categories of building work, should the need arise.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Industrial Action</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">Access to protected industrial action under the Workplace Relations Act will continue to be available for negotiating building certified agreements. This bill imposes some additional requirements to address the particular problems of the industry.</para>
<para class="block">Reflecting the recommendations of the Royal Commission, there will be a clear delineation between lawful and unlawful industrial action—industrial action that is not for the legitimate purpose of advancing claims for a building certified agreement will be expressly unlawful.</para>
<para class="block">A party taking unlawful action will be exposed to penalties and damages. There will be improved access to sanctions in the form of injunctions, pecuniary penalties and compensation for loss suffered as a consequence of unlawful action.</para>
<para class="block">The bill also contains measures to prevent spurious occupational health and safety concerns being used as a ‘front’ for industrial action about other issues. The Royal Commission found that the misuse of occupational health and safety issues as an industrial tactic ‘cheapened’ legitimate occupational health and safety concerns within the industry.</para>
<para class="block">The Government is committed to improving occupational health and safety standards in the industry. This is not advanced by abusing the right to take industrial action to protect employees’ health and safety.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Leading by example</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The bill provides for a Federal Safety Commissioner who will promote improved occupational health and safety standards across the industry generally. The Federal Safety Commissioner will foster occupational health and safety on Australian Government funded building projects by developing and managing the accreditation scheme for Commonwealth building contracts. Under this scheme the Federal Safety Commissioner will test contractors’ occupational health and safety credentials on-the-job, as well as through their management policies and systems, before they enter into contracts with the Commonwealth to carry out building work.</para>
<para class="block">The Government is also developing alternative strategies to foster cooperation with the States and key industry parties to achieve nationally consistent frameworks. The Australian Government will use its position as a key client in the building and construction industry to provide leadership in workplace safety and other workplace relations matters and drive reform across the industry.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">Building and construction is a conspicuous black spot in Australian workplace relations.</para>
<para class="block">This Government is proposing a package of reforms that will overcome this black spot in our national life and which imposes significant additional economic costs on the community. In the past, Governments have turned a blind eye because the problem seemed intractable. Australia does not deserve this sort of industrial behaviour, and frankly we just can’t afford it anymore.</para>
<para class="block">The Government’s building and construction industry reforms will force the required cultural change; encourage fair play and create a far more efficient and decent building and construction industry.</para>
<para class="block">To unlock these benefits for all Australians, substantial and lasting reform is needed. That reform must be structural, cultural and directed at the specific problems of the industry. The Government accepts the Royal Commission’s assessment that this will only be achieved through industry-specific regulation.</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Labour Party has acknowledged the problems of the building and construction industry. Their challenge is whether they are prepared to separate themselves from the lawlessness of this industry, or bow to the thuggery of well-known and vocal elements. It is a choice between acting for the benefit of all Australians, especially workers and their families, or protecting behaviour that is unlawful, harmful and costly to us all.</para>
<para class="block">The Government has made its choice.</para>

<para>—Senator Brown has raised a matter of privilege under standing order 81 relating to the conduct of Senator McGauran on 11 August 2005 and asked that I give precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee. In determining whether to give a matter precedence, I am required to have regard to the following privilege resolution criteria:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">the principle that the Senate’s power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and</para>
<para class="block">the existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The matter raised by Senator Brown does not meet these criteria.</para>
<para>The Parliamentary Privileges Act makes it clear that contempts of the Senate are constituted only by serious acts liable to obstruct the Senate or senators in the free performance of their functions. The conduct of senators in the chamber is regulated under the standing orders as a matter of order, and such conduct would have to cause serious obstruction to the Senate or senators for it to be classified as contempt. The matter therefore does not meet the first of the criteria I am required to consider.</para>
<para>In relation to the second criterion, there is a potential remedy already before the Senate in the form of Senator Allison’s motion for dissent from my ruling that Senator McGauran’s conduct was unseemly but not unparliamentary. This motion appropriately treats the matter as one of order in the chamber under the standing orders. I have therefore determined that a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee should not have precedence.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the ruling of the President (that the conduct of Senator McGauran in making a gesture following a division on 11 August 2005 was unseemly but not unparliamentary) be dissented from.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">In speaking to the motion, which I think is a matter of significance for all senators, it is important to emphasise what this motion is about. It is about dissenting from the ruling of the President regarding whether or not Senator McGauran’s conduct last week was unparliamentary. It is not a motion that tests the authority of the President in any way. If it were to pass, it would not require the President to resign and there would be no affront to him. It is not a motion to try to embarrass Senator McGauran or force him to apologise. He has apologised—not the most fabulous of apologies, at least the one in the chamber, but it was an apology. It is a motion for the Senate to make a judgment about whether or not this constitutes unparliamentary conduct.</para>
<para>Whilst the President makes rulings in the Senate all the time about what is unparliamentary and what is not, it is, at the end of it all, for the Senate as a whole to make those decisions by either agreeing with the President’s ruling or, if we believe it appropriate, disagreeing. The President has ruled that Senator McGauran’s actions—</para>

<para>—I will come to that, Senator Ferris. The President has ruled that Senator McGauran’s physical action—we all know what it was; it was shown on television—was unseemly but not unparliamentary. People could well say: ‘It was a thing that happened last week in the heat of the moment. People have made their comments about it now. Let’s get on with business.’ I can understand that attitude. But the fact is that we can make our comments and get on with it but the ruling does not move on; the ruling stands—and the ruling was that it was not unparliamentary conduct.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In looking at this case, we all need to recognise that this is about the Senate pausing to consider in a sober way what is appropriate in setting a standard of what is unparliamentary conduct and what is not. We are all guilty at various times of actions that would breach standing orders—whether it be excessive interjection, physical actions or offensive comments. I have seen a number of people do exactly what Senator McGauran did the other day. I have heard people make far more offensive comments. You hear a lot of things down at this end of the chamber that you do not always hear in the chair.</para>
<para>We all know that at certain times, for whatever reason, people choose to draw attention to a comment and ask for it to be withdrawn for a whole range of reasons, and at that time a decision is made. At other times, for a whole range of reasons—not least of which is that if we stopped every time somebody interjected we would never get anything done—we decide to just let it ride and keep going. But the fact is that once a matter is drawn to the attention of the Senate then it is appropriate to make a ruling on it, and that is completely separate from whether or not anybody apologises or any other action is taken.</para>
<para>I also think it is appropriate in this context to make the comment that we should not be precious about this—we should not be puffing up our chests and manufacturing mock outrage. Last week Senator Conroy talked about concern for the children in the gallery. Senator Conroy is probably amongst the two or three most ferocious, regular and extremely loud interjectors in question time. Senator Brown is also someone who is not known for being quiet when he wants to make his view known, regardless of when somebody else is speaking. Indeed, he was the last person to have been ejected from the chamber for refusing to withdraw a comment—an ejection I did not vote for, I might say.</para>
<para>In speaking to this motion, I looked back at other times when people had been ejected from the chamber. I have to say that we seem like a much better behaved mob now than we did in the 1980s, but we do not want to go back to that. We had a significant number of ejections from the chamber at the time when the coalition last held a majority in this place, in the late seventies and eighties. We had about seven or eight senators ejected over five or six years, all of whom were opposition senators. We do not want to get that whole mindset active again.</para>
<para>I should note for the record that a Democrat was ejected once—my predecessor from Queensland, former Senator Macklin. So it is not a matter of trying to set anybody up as being holier-than-thou in any way; it is a matter of acknowledging that at various times we, from all sides, in any circumstances, might take an action that somebody takes offence to. I believe that the appropriate thing to then do as an individual is to apologise if you have caused offence, and Senator McGauran did that. I do not think it was the most unconditional apology I have ever heard but he did it, and later I certainly saw him do it far more unequivocally.</para>
<para>From personal experience I can see why some people do not give unconditional apologies. I recall doing something once that somebody took offence to, so I thought the appropriate thing to do was to apologise unconditionally. That was then taken as open season by everybody as being a clear admission of guilt for whatever farcical allegation anybody wanted to make for the next week. I had to enjoy the pleasures of considerable media attention outside my fence for a solid week, and my wife and child also had to cope with that for a week. Of course, the person who leaked that information knew that is what would happen, because they told me that is what would happen before they decided to leak it. But the fact is that if somebody chooses to take offence—</para>

<para>—No, it was not. The fact is that if somebody indicates that they have taken offence to something and that is what occurs—somebody stands up, takes a point of order and says, ‘I object to that’—then I think the appropriate thing to do is to apologise. I do not think it is necessary to go into all the context surrounding it. I did not do that in that case, either. I did not talk about the things that were said to me or the context as to why I might take offence. That did not stop the Prime Minister criticising and saying, ‘The facts speak for themselves,’ even though he did not know what the facts were, or stop the Labor Premier of Queensland calling on me to resign, even though he did not know what the facts were. A whole lot of other people passed comment, including some members of my own party, none of whom ever asked me for my side of the story.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The bottom line is that for the sake of the reputation of this chamber it is important to set aside individual things once attention is drawn to them and to indicate quite unequivocally that such behaviour is inappropriate. That is a longwinded way of coming back to the ruling of the President that this conduct is not unparliamentary. Once that is allowed to stand, it sends a signal that that sort of stuff is okay. That is the bottom line of why I think it is appropriate to pursue and support this motion. I do not think it is a good idea to send a signal that this conduct is okay. That might mean some extra embarrassment for the person involved, but that is not the intent—I am sure he would say he has already had enough in any case. The intent is to reaffirm that signal rather than just say: ‘We all made our outraged speeches at the time, when the television cameras were interested, and now they’ve moved on it doesn’t matter anymore. We’ll just wave that aside.’ If we are genuine in having concern about this sort of thing, then it is appropriate once it is drawn to the Senate’s attention to indicate that it is unparliamentary.</para>
<para>It is a fairly simple thing. It is a matter of opinion. There are all sorts of opinions about what is offensive, what is obscene and what is not. I thought in the context that this conduct was not particularly offensive, but other people did. When this is turned into an incident that reflects badly on the Senate, for whatever reason, it is appropriate to—</para>

<para>—Because there is a big difference, as you would know with your experience, between having arguments about what is obscene, which is a completely different context, and the aspect of the standing order, which is about unparliamentary behaviour. If it is unparliamentary behaviour then it is appropriate to rule that way; otherwise, all of the words of outrage from last week were just a lot of hot air because there was media interest at the time. Once you draw attention to these things, once you start commenting on them then you may as well follow through and indicate that it is the clear view of the Senate that these things are unparliamentary. The contrary is to say that they are acceptable.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I think, despite my personal view one way or the other, that the opinion of the general public would be that this is unacceptable behaviour. That is not trying to set us all up as some sort of impossible bunch of purist saints; it is a recognition that once you spotlight certain behaviour in this place it is appropriate to detail what is parliamentary and what is not. That behaviour is clearly not. I think it would be beneficial for the Senate in the long term if we were to make a clear statement today that it is not, and that would be the effect of voting for and passing this motion. I would not see it as a reflection on the President; I would see it as a desirable precedent to set, particularly at the start of a period of time when the government is in control of the Senate.</para>
<para>By design or coincidence, it happens to be a member of the government that has been pointed out here. In that sense as well it would send a clear signal that rulings are made without fear or favour. This is important as we set out over this next couple of years at a time when the government has control of the Senate—particularly, as I said, when I look back at the last time that happened, when a regular number of opposition senators were expelled from this place for inappropriate behaviour. I do not think we want to suggest moving back down that path. That certainly would not be in the Senate’s interest. I do not think it would be in the interest of the reputation of politics or parliament in general. So, whilst it might seem like a fiddly point, it is a particularly important point for the broader context of how people perceive the Senate. The last thing I want is for this government to get away with being able to devalue the Senate one step at time by starting to give it the sort of reputation for poor standards that the House of Representatives has long had.</para>

<para>—Mr President, you made a wrong ruling last week. You ruled that the obscene gesture by Senator McGauran on the floor of this Senate during the proceedings of the Senate with the galleries full was not a contempt of the Senate. The fact is that it was. If you go to the <inline font-style="italic">Macquarie Dictionary</inline>, you will find that the salient definition of contempt is: an ‘open disrespect’ of the legislature. If you can argue, Mr President, that there was not open disrespect in what Senator McGauran did five metres in front of you in full view of all senators and all people in the galleries last Thursday then you have a very different way of thinking than I do.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The other point I make on this matter is: had it been me or one of my colleagues that had made the gesture would we not have been immediately ruled upon by you and voted out of the chamber? Of course we would have. What we have here is a double standard. I believe that you have let this chamber down. You have ruled against the interest and the dignity of this chamber and in so doing you have let down the office which you should uphold when you occupy that chair. To let this go by is to allow what I believe is a political decision from the chair rather than one that is based on the probity of the Senate itself, which is based without fear or favour on defending this Senate and its dignity.</para>
<para>The dictionary says of the word ‘obscene’, amongst other things: ‘offensive to modesty’, ‘lewd’, ‘disgusting’, ‘repulsive’. Those words describe what Senator McGauran was doing the other day. It was not just the stills we saw in the newspaper but the offensive nature of the whole action that he was engaged in to colleagues across the other side of the chamber.</para>
<para>Mr President, it is your high responsibility to make sure that there are consistent rulings in here. Let me just go back to my expulsion from this place some 12 or 24 months ago for using the word ‘blackmail’. I alleged that the Prime Minister had blackmailed the Prime Minister of East Timor over the sea boundaries affair. That word had been used some 170 times since 1980, but it happened that a Greens senator used it—and I stood by it—in the context of that debate, and I was removed from the chamber, with you as President. Compare the two things.</para>
<para>Some members on the other side have raised the issue of speaking up when a foreigner in the personage of President Bush was speaking to a joint meeting of the chambers. In the chamber I got up, from the position to which I had been elected, and spoke up for my constituents. Let me say that since that day nothing has brought a response more strongly and more positively to me everywhere I go in this nation from Australian citizens who say, ‘Senator Brown, you stood up for me when you stood up and spoke across the chamber to President Bush.’</para>

<para>—What is more, that is why the Greens vote is growing, Senator, and I address that to the senator from the other side who is interjecting against the rules—that is, Senator Abetz. Let me add that we have a duty to speak out, wherever the Senate might be, on behalf of our constituents. So we have two rulings with which I disagreed. In the case of saying ‘blackmail’ in this chamber, we had a vote. And in the case of the matter in the other place, the indiscretion of the Speaker of the day was to not take a division, although it was called for, and he made a ruling which he had no right to make. I believe that in the future, when constitutional historians investigate that, they will find that he, in his decision not to allow Senator Nettle and me to attend the consequent day’s sitting, in fact acted illegally and against the Constitution.</para>

</continue>
<para>That aside, we are dealing here with an obscene gesture. Mr President, you might not think it is obscene, but I do not believe that you are being true to your own heart in this. You have spoken up and made your decision. You might not believe that it is obscene, but I ask you: if that is not, what is? If that is not obscene, where do you draw the line? Of course, you are not going to give an answer to the Senate on that. Your ruling was wrong. It was politically biased. It has the presage—and we must all fear this—of more to come. It was a derogation of your duty in the chair to independently defend this chamber against obscene behaviour, which is a contempt. You did not do that. You should have revised your ruling, but in the lack of a revision of your ruling you are wrong, and I support the motion.</para>

<para>—I know, but we have to get a grip of ourselves and concentrate on the issue at hand, which is: are we dissenting from the President’s ruling? On behalf of the Labor Party I indicate that we will not be supporting the dissent motion. Senator Allison, I indicated on the day that I did not think that it was the way to go. Labor still take that view. Equally, the ruling by the President not to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee is sound. In my view, the matter should have been treated a little more seriously than it was, but we agree with the ruling on the two key points. Firstly, should the President’s ruling be dissented from? Labor will vote no because I do not think the case has been made that a serious issue of dissent should be entertained. And, secondly, the ruling on the reference to the Privileges Committee is also fairly sound.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I do consider this to be a very unsavoury incident. It is a blight on the reputation of the Senate, and I treat it very seriously. We all make mistakes. Senator McGauran clearly made one. His biggest mistake, though, was his failure then to come into the chamber and apologise properly. He showed a lack of courage and a lack of good manners. Again, he is not in here today. There was a rumour that he was going to have the courage to front up today, but he has gone missing in action. I think that is his greatest failure. We all make blues. We have all done things we are not terribly proud of. The hardest but best thing is to front up and apologise straightaway and take responsibility for your actions. Senator McGauran did not do that. He gave a very half-hearted statement which begrudgingly acknowledged that he might have offended some people. He did offend people, and his behaviour did bring shame on him and on the Senate. I think that is true. As I said, the biggest thing that stands against Senator McGauran is his failure to make a proper apology to the Senate.</para>
<para>I think it is a metaphor for the government’s attitude to the Senate that on that day Senator McGauran thought that giving the Senate the finger was the appropriate way for a government senator to behave. It was reinforced, I understand, by Senator Heffernan, who attended the Greens press conference and gave them the finger as a reinforcement of the government’s attitude on these matters. I take that only from what I have read in the papers; I have no personal knowledge of it. If that is not true, I will be happy to correct the record. But that is what has been widely reported in the press by a number of sources. Again, it is a metaphor for the government’s attitude to the Senate, its control in the Senate chamber, its view about its total control, and its arrogance and propensity to abuse that power.</para>
<para>But that is not a reason for us to disagree with the President’s ruling. I regard that as a very serious step. Senator Bartlett alluded to the fact that it did not mean this and it did not mean that. Any President who has a dissent from his ruling carried successfully by the chamber would have to examine his position; that is certainly my view. It would be a statement that we would take very seriously. I am not saying that we would rule out doing that on an occasion. I make it very clear that Labor would do that if they thought there was a fundamental wrong in a ruling by the President or there had been partisan bias shown in such a ruling. It is a step that we would take very seriously. As I said, I do not think that is at all justified on this occasion.</para>
<para>To be honest, I think we ought to move on. A debate in this chamber about whether something is ‘unseemly’ or ‘unparliamentary’ does not excite me. I do not think it excites many others in Australia. I think Australians just want to see better behaviour from their parliamentarians. They want to see us moving on with their interests. Things like climate change, Senator Brown, are important issues that the Senate ought to be dealing with in a respectful way while treating other senators with respect. I do not think that Australian citizens are interested in whether this was ‘unseemly’ or ‘unparliamentary’. I do not think a lot hinges on it. I accept the President’s ruling and judgment on those things.</para>
<para>I think the Australian people have made their judgment about the behaviour. They have seen the footage, the photo and the reaction. The Prime Minister on the weekend made it clear that he had read the wind as well and was not supportive of Senator McGauran’s actions. I think it is a very poor sign that the senator still has not provided a proper apology. But, obviously, Mr Howard and Mr Costello were not prepared to defend his position. I think they know that the Australian people have made their judgment about such behaviour as well.</para>
<para>I also think some of the hyperbole about this matter has gotten a bit carried away. Senator Bartlett’s point on that front was reasonable. But I do not agree with some of those journalists who then used that as an excuse to say that it was all a bit too much that there was a response in the Senate. I do not think that is right either. I think it is appropriate that the Senate deal with it seriously. Whilst some of the contributions might have fallen into hyperbole, the bottom line is that that behaviour towards other senators is not appropriate.</para>
<para>It ought not to have happened. But, having happened, the senator ought to have made an unreserved apology. I think everyone in the Senate would accept that. I do not think that any senator would argue differently. Quite frankly, that would have been the end of the matter on the day. The fact that it was not done is something that Senator McGauran will have to live with. But I do think the government should have treated the issue more seriously. I think the failure of the government to treat the issue more seriously is a reflection on it and on its attitude now to the Senate and accountability.</para>
<para>I am much more concerned, Mr President, as I have expressed to you previously, about your ruling on question time allocation than I am on this particular ruling. That is one ruling I will be pursuing with you and will not be giving up on, because that is a fundamental question about accountability and the role of this chamber in holding the government to account. So I am much more concerned about that. I am much more concerned about whether or not the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee will have a proper ability to examine the industrial relations legislation. Minister Andrews announced an inquiry yesterday and I see that the Prime Minister has repudiated that already. That is an issue of much more concern to me. I am much more concerned about keeping the government accountable and not allowing it to use the Senate in an arrogant fashion.</para>
<para>Mr President, we will not be supporting the motion to dissent from your ruling. I understand why Senator Allison initiated the motion at the time, and I am not critical of that, but on balance we will not support it. I think your ruling on the privileges matter is appropriate. As I said, on balance, the government should have treated the matter more seriously, but I do not think that anything you have done should be disputed in this chamber. I think it is a reasonable conclusion to draw and a reasonable judgment. Labor will be supporting your ruling.</para>

I would argue that the intention behind that gesture was certainly obscene. But people are offended in various degrees by it.</para>
<para>The problem, though, is that in the past you have ruled a lot of things in this chamber, mostly words that are spoken, to be unparliamentary and you have insisted that they be withdrawn. What I cannot see is any reason why a gesture could not also be withdrawn. Instead of that, you agreed to investigate it. We had a grudging apology from Senator McGauran, which I think satisfied nobody in this chamber. Nobody truly felt that this apology being made was heartfelt or truly an apology at all. That is why we are in this difficult situation.</para>
<para>I went to the dictionary as well, Senator Brown. ‘Unseemly’ has two definitions—that is, ‘unbecoming’ and ‘indecent’—according to the <inline font-style="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</inline>. Again, I would say that it cannot be indecent and parliamentary. The judgment needs to be made on the basis of what is reasonable and appropriate behaviour in this place and how it is judged by the general public. As was observed at the time, there were children in the gallery. I am sure that children have seen this gesture before. But the point is how we as leaders in this country wish to be seen by the general public and whether we wish to present an example of appropriate behaviour to both adults and young people who might come to see the work that we do. It is hardly surprising that people hold politicians and parliamentarians in low regard. They observe question time, and now most of the country knows that at least one senator in this place has made a gesture which was, I would argue, intended to be obscene or at least indecent.</para>
<para>It is clear that this motion is not going to get support in the chamber. It is also clear that Senator McGauran does not intend to give an apology which would satisfy us that he meant it. It is a sad reflection on this place that we can perhaps look forward to even more of what I would regard as unparliamentary behaviour on the basis that it is unseemly but somehow not something else. It is disappointing that we are in this situation, but in many ways I think that if that action is not taken at the time the event happened we are dredging over old coals and people become entrenched in positions. I think that is what has happened here. But I would urge, Mr President, that in the future such behaviour is ruled by you to be unparliamentary, because to do otherwise is simply not appropriate or acceptable.</para>

<para>—Mr President, you have ruled that Senator McGauran’s gesture was unseemly but was by no means a terrible act. I have been here for 23 years, and I have seen a lot of indiscretions in this place. I have seen them from all sides of parliament on many occasions, and I have said, ‘Let them go through to the keeper.’ Senator McGauran has apologised. He has certainly apologised in the media, on John Laws’s program, on channel 9 and in this parliament. I know that Senator McGauran regrets what he did. It was on the spur of the moment, when we do a lot of things. As Senator Evans has said, I think all of us do things that we regret. I have seen Labor Party members come in here—and I will not mentioned their names, because they were good people—and I have seen Democrats, Greens and probably National Party members and Liberals come in here and commit indiscretions. But we have to live in this place. We are here for much of the year, and we have to accept that if we put the spotlight on every indiscretion that happens we are only reflecting on what is happening here, and that leaves a bad image out in the general community.</para>

To my way of thinking, he is a populist from the Left—a Pauline Hanson from the Left, not from the Right. Divide and get your lousy five per cent of the vote.</para>

<para>—Yesterday, as everybody in this place and millions and millions of Australians know, was the observation of the 60th anniversary of VP Day. For a number of reasons, I was unfortunately unable to attend VP Day observations, but I do want to make some remarks in the chamber tonight. I think it is appropriate, in reflecting on the nature of this particular commemoration, to quote the words of WS Kent Hughes from the dedication in his work <inline font-style="italic">Slaves of the Samurai</inline>. He wrote: ‘Dedicated to my comrades who <inline font-style="italic">still</inline> live and <inline font-style="italic">will</inline> live even though they are not alive.’ For anyone who has cast an eye over <inline font-style="italic">Slaves of the Samurai</inline>, the creation, but most particularly the preservation, of his verses is fascinating in itself. The pictures in the work by Major-General De Fremery, similarly so, but I find that dedication particularly compelling. Not everybody would choose to reflect on an occasion such as VP Day with poetry but, for many reasons, I have chosen to do so. I grew up in a World War II veteran’s family. I was particularly encouraged to pursue my own interest in the arts by my father—a veteran of World War II. So the 60th anniversary of VP Day particularly resonates for me.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>On 15 August 1945 the war had finally reached its end and, in very simple terms, the then Prime Minister began his announcement with the words: ‘Fellow citizens, the war is over.’ It was a time of elation for all Australians but also a time of sadness for the many lives lost. But, through it all, the Australian spirit shone, and we have been repeatedly reminded of this in recent days, with the iconic images of Australians dancing in the streets and celebrating the freedom that had been defended at such great cost.</para>
<para>Yesterday I shared my mother’s reminiscences of VP Day. She was at school on VP Day—in fact, the same school that I attended. The part of the school which in my day we called ‘the field’ in her day was filled with trenches where they practised for eventualities that hopefully would never come. On this anniversary of VP Day, she reminisced about being allowed out of school late morning, making her way with hundreds of other girls to Strathfield Station in Sydney’s inner west and fighting the crowds at the station. When the trains from the city finally arrived, they were absolutely jam-packed—you could not get on the trains—but somehow, for some reason, the people of Sydney made way for these groups of schoolgirls dressed in the navy blue uniforms so that they could go home to their families to celebrate the end of World War II.</para>
<para>Sixty years later those images still resonate with us. Now, when we understand that freedom is something to be won and to be cherished, those images remind us in many ways of a time when our way of life was not so assured. I think with that comes a great sense of humility and gratitude for the thousands of Australians who perished to defend their nation, our people and our way of life. More than 900,000 Australian men and women enlisted in the armed forces between 1939 and 1945 from a population of barely seven million. Of that figure, 550,000 service men and women served outside Australia in one of the services during the war. That was one in 12 people of the total population—and my father was one of those.</para>
<para>Twenty-seven men from the small New South Wales village of Burrawang enlisted for World War II, but my father had already moved to Sydney so was recorded as enlisted from Undercliff. The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> on the day of his enlistment carried a pictorial story sporting my then—and in fact always—very handsome father moving from civilian to private in the space of one day. It is a news clipping which I of course cherish. The list of surnames of those who enrolled from the village of Burrawang is a history of that small community and, in many ways, the history of my family—names that I remember my father speaking of on many occasions.</para>
<para>My father’s service record has him enlisting on 9 March 1941 and being discharged on 14 March 1946—a very long time in a young life to spend in the service of your nation—with a total effective service period of 1,831 days, which included active service in Australia for 1,292 days and outside Australia for 327 days. He left the Army as a lieutenant. That time in the Second AIF changed my father’s life—as it did for so many Australians. His service and his pride had an extraordinary impact on my life and our upbringing.</para>
<para>Australia had earned the respect of the world for the actions of our troops in various theatres of war, and that was solidly and effectively reinforced by World War II. Australia’s identity of mateship—many would say—of bravery and determination was forged even more strongly by the events of World War II. Victory in the Pacific was extraordinarily hard won.</para>
<para>In discussing Australia’s commemoration of VP Day, I think it would be remiss to not make reference to the horrendous weapons that did indeed bring the world to a standstill and force the surrender of Japan. I am of course referring to the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August 1945. We all listened with interest to the reminiscences and the stories of those experiences in recent weeks as well. I have visited the memorial and the park in Hiroshima. It is an extraordinarily compelling and confronting experience, particularly for one who grew up in an Australian World War II veteran’s family with a very interesting perspective of our engagement against the Japanese. It is one of the most impressive memorials I have ever seen. Its commemoration is, I think, a very important part of the modern world.</para>
<para>Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has used the 60th anniversary of the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima and the commemoration of VP Day to urge all nations to abandon their nuclear weapons program. The nuclear non-proliferation program is really one of the most important projects of the 21st century and one that Australia pursues with great energy and seriousness in tackling what is an enormous challenge for us in this century. This is so particularly in light of the changes in the interaction between nations and the intervention of non-state players in those interactions. This makes for a very different landscape from what was perhaps 60 years ago a more predictable environment in terms of battle and confrontation, upon which to draw a picture for the future of conflict and, in fact, the prevention of conflict.</para>
<para>I hope that I am forgiven by the Senate for personalising my observations about VP Day, but when we come to this place we come with the influence of our families and their histories and we bring the experiences that they visited upon us. I began by making reference to WS Kent Hughes and his extraordinarily evocative writings in <inline font-style="italic">Slaves of the Samurai</inline> and how very compelling it is to read those. But there are many other war poets who have made an extraordinary contribution throughout not just Australia’s history but also internationally in terms of the recording of experience, of horror in many cases, of humour in so many Australian cases and of emotion generally about war.</para>
<para>There is a wonderful anthology of poetry of the Australian Army which contains many interesting reminiscences of the south-west Pacific area, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Bougainville and Borneo from 1942 to 1945. Some of the poets’ work contained therein bring a wry smile, some are positively horrific and terrifying and some are just so emotionally draining that they are hard to read at length. I did want to make another brief reference to a poem called <inline font-style="italic">Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels</inline> which was dedicated to Sapper Victor Cook from the Royal Australian Engineers. The last few lines sum up some of the things that my father often said about fighting in Papua New Guinea. It says:</para>
<quote>
<para>May the Mothers in Australia,</para>
<para>When they offer up a prayer,</para>
<para>Mention those impromptu Angels,</para>
<para>With the Fuzzy Wuzzy hair.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">An amusing observation about the saving of so many of our soldiers by so many dedicated members in Papua New Guinea at the time, and one I think that it is entirely appropriate to conclude upon this evening.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise this evening to address issues affecting recruiting within the Australian defence forces. This matter has risen to some prominence as the result of a government proposal put about in the press late last week. That proposal was to extend the role of women in the Australian Defence Force and it has been accompanied by the release of ASPI’s analysis of the Defence budget for the financial year of 2005-06. That analysis shows that Australia’s defence capacity is severely handicapped by personnel shortages across the board.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This discussion is not just about failed recruiting campaigns of latter years but also about continuing high attrition rates and skills shortages. The single rationale offered is that defence recruiting must compete in the labour market with general industry. That is a statement of the obvious, of course. Moreover, the demand is not just for infantry and general support numbers, the demand is for people who can play a role in a new hi-tech environment and employment area. A number of solutions have been canvassed recently. Some, indeed, are worth considering, but not all, of course. The member for Mackellar last weekend, for example, suggested that the recruitment age should be reduced from the age of 18 to 14. Perhaps she has been watching too much <inline font-style="italic">Hornblower</inline>. It is a wonder she did not suggest the restoration of press gangs. They were a marvellously efficient recruiting technique on British wharves. They swept up all of the idlers in society and got them out of the community eye. It would be an immediate social solution of great appeal to the honourable member, no doubt, and perhaps those on Work for the Dole might be pressed as well. In any event, it is good, immediately actionable, highly appealable and great conservative stuff right out of Mrs Thatcher’s textbook.</para>
<para>A more sensible suggestion has been the extension of the role of women in the Australian Defence Force. I think most agree that there is some scope here for extension, improvement and change. Some women’s groups—most wisely, I think—saw the debate on women in combat as a shield covering labour and skills shortages both in the defence forces and our wider community. The continuing concern is that women may not be particularly suited for frontline fighting roles. It seems—and there was a press report today to that effect—that mixing genders in combat has been problematic wherever attempted. Regardless of the range of views, there does seem to be some consensus emerging in Australia that we are not prepared to see this happen at this stage or in this instance—support roles yes, not the actual combat role, not the hand-to-hand stuff. However, I think the caveat needs to be entered that this development must be analysed over the longer term. It is interesting when you go back and look at the press in the late 30s, early 40s and right through the years of World War II, to note that a similar debate was held when manpower—or person power—was very short. That though was a watershed issue of women in the work force, not for women in warfare. No doubt this evolution will continue but it is not the sole answer.</para>
<para>The causes of ADF recruitment problems are much deeper than that, so we should turn to the ASPI figures. ADF numbers, after falling in the early nineties, have since been relatively static. Since 2000 the total ADF strength has wavered between 50,000 and 52,000. The trend, though, is flat, with a strong likelihood that targets will continue to fail to be reached. Over the last nine years targets have been reached, on average, by only 86 per cent. In fact, over the last nine years they have fallen from 96 per cent. Retention rates are also considered to be problematic. Over the last nine years these have wavered between 10 per cent at best and 14 per cent at worst. This does seem wasteful, but I am advised that it is also a dynamic feature of service, especially in lower, non-commissioned ranks. There, as I understand it, the average length of service is about four to five years. This makes recruitment and training quite expensive. Forty-one per cent of the entire defence budget is spent on personnel—that is, $6.7 billion this year. In the last five years alone, over $500 million has been spent on recruitment and retention measures.</para>
<para>One asks: what is the reason for these recruitment shortfalls? The Defence and ASPI view is that competition in the labour market is at present very tight. But that does not wash, really, because the problem has been with us for almost a decade. Just look at the figures published by ASPI in more recent times. Some also say it is about pay and conditions, but that has always been the case. In fact, the package of pay and conditions, including health care, housing and superannuation, is very attractive for new recruits. The recent attitudes survey does not show this to be an issue. Indeed, I can say that in the past four years my office has not received one complaint in writing or over the phone about the level of pay or allowances within the Australian defence forces. I concluded from that that the issue did not cause disharmony or dispute within the ADF.</para>
<para>I am informed that the trends in those surveys over the last five years are in fact statistically positive on many indicators. But there can be no doubt that life in the services is very different from that of the general population. It is very disruptive. Families tire of frequent shifts around the country. Partners are understandably having greater trouble coping when enlisted members are absent for long periods of duty. Given the increased tempo of overseas deployments, that disruption is getting worse and, one suggests, is likely to continue to get worse.</para>
<para>Old hands would say: ‘So what? What’s new? We managed; why can’t they? Get used to it.’ The answer is of course that partners and families today see other models and other career choices. Naturally, their own career aspirations have become stronger. Community values and expectations are changing, but defence life, unfortunately, as much as people like to talk about it, does not seem to be switching to new models. We know it is a genuine matter for concern, and attempts are being made to minimise disruption, but, by God, it is slow going. We can only hope that the increasing concentration of bases closer to large urban areas will help. The provision of employment choices for partners is very important. Life in the military should not be a disqualification.</para>
<para>Looking more broadly, people’s choices of lifestyle these days are far greater than they have ever been. Think about the 20th century: World War I, the Great Depression, World War II, Korea and, overlaying the last 70 years, the Cold War. In that century, a career in defence loomed as a significant option. Many in the past have seen service as a means of getting some skills and developing career options. That was the case especially when those skills were transferable to the general labour market. Some are speculating publicly now that tertiary education might be offered as recruitment bait more widely than is currently the case. But already traineeships in avionics, electronics, communications and many other areas of skill demand are available in the defence forces. All are transferable to the general labour market. The traditional loss of trained RAAF pilots to civil aviation is a high-profile phenomenon. Perhaps this is more of a symptom of the failure of industry to commit to training. Skills poaching is not a new phenomenon. There is more to be said on this matter, and I will speak on it at another time.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise tonight to raise an issue that I am probably starting to sound like a broken record on, and that is genetic privacy and genetic discrimination in Australia. The reason I raise this issue tonight is twofold: firstly, this is National Science Week, so it is fitting within that context; and, secondly, as some honourable senators would be aware, today some aspects of a report on genetic privacy and discrimination were released. They included a world first survey by the Centre for Genetics Education on Australian attitudes to predictive genetic testing. The results of that study, among others, reveal that a number of Australians are very wary and quite suspicious of the use of genetic tests because they think they may be used for nefarious purposes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I would suggest that, despite the dazzling and wonderful potential of genetics and genetic technology—something that I rave about in this place on many occasions—there are good reasons for Australians to be quite wary of, or at least have some reservations about, the use of genetic tests, simply because we still do not have national legislation in which genetic privacy is specifically protected. Nor do we have legislation on a national level that specifically outlaws genetic discrimination. The reality is that information gleaned from genetic tests has been used in this country to deny people access to employment and insurance.</para>
<para>This is an issue that I talked about many years ago in this place. In fact, I said that, like the United States, Australia would have to confront the issue of genetic discrimination. I introduced a private senator’s bill in 1998, based on some work I had looked at in the United States, where they have confronted these issues, as they have in Europe and other places. The bill went to a committee, which produced one of the most comprehensive reports I have seen in this place. But the legislation was not supported by either major party. There were some good reasons for that. It was partly because the bill was very much focused on an international—and particularly American—model. Nonetheless, major parties in this place did not believe that we needed stand-alone legislation to deal with genetic privacy and nondiscrimination. I still think we could do with it, but at a minimum I would like to see some changes made to law. Amendments could be made to the Privacy Act. In the past I have tried to do that but have failed because at the end of the day the ALP has not supported my amendments, after supporting them on at least one prior occasion. Amendments could also be made to disability discrimination law, as has been recommended to this place by external bodies.</para>
<para>I have been raising this issue for a long time. Since 1998 we have seen recorded cases of genetic discrimination in Australia and it is about time the government acted on this issue. There is no reason for the government not to act when they have seen not only surveys and studies, such as today’s report, but also the overwhelming evidence from researchers and academics on this topic—most importantly, the ALRC report that was produced in March 2003. The ALRC and AHEC report—a two-volume report, one volume of which is on my desk in front of me now—contains the most comprehensive research into genetic privacy and the sort of related issue of genetic discrimination. It is one of the best research tools in the world, so much so that this report is discussed in other parliaments and certainly in other jurisdictions around the world. It has been held up as a world-class body of evidence that is being used to craft and draft laws in other places, such as in the United Kingdom, where they have looked at this report. The ALRC and Australians should be justifiably proud of that work.</para>
<para>I do not understand why the government has had the ALRC 96 report since March 2003 yet has not acted on the report or its recommendations. They are great recommendations; they are not partisan and they are worth acting on. I asked Senator Ellison about this in recent times when we had a debate on one of the family law bills that dealt with the vexed issue of parentage testing—another area covered by the ALRC report. My attempts on that occasion to get an amendment passed, or at least get the report’s recommendations looked at and implemented, once again failed. Nonetheless, I asked Senator Ellison: when will the government respond to this report? His response was:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I can say that the government hope to finalise their response to the report shortly.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That was earlier this year during the Family Law Amendment Bill debate. Tonight, from a nonpartisan perspective, I genuinely urge—because this issue is so important and because people’s lives are at stake—the government to act, even if it is only with minimal changes to law. It is time for Australia to outlaw genetic discrimination and to protect genetic privacy. It is high time it was done.</para>
<para>We know that advances in gene technology and the increasingly widespread use of genetic testing confirm that the kind of legislation that I am talking about is urgently needed. Despite my bill, the ALRC report, a Senate inquiry and a recent Senate inquiry that I initiated into the Privacy Act, laws governing genetics remain a mishmash of legislations, regulations, codes of conduct, industry self-regulations, activities and reports by public sector agencies and regulators. Genetic testing continues unabated with scant regulation and, while it is an exciting area with much potential to improve our lives, it must be regulated to ensure that people’s privacy is protected.</para>
<para>A comprehensive national network of laws, ethical practices and regulation is long overdue. Many reports of genetic discrimination come from the use of tests in the insurance industry. Although the industry cannot request applicants to take genetic tests when applying for insurance, results from prior tests can be disclosed. For example, a man with a history of bowel cancer refused to be genetically tested for this condition because he realised that doing so could jeopardise his insurance coverage. So he actually endangered his life and prevented the chances of early diagnosis—something that is important—in order to maintain his insurance coverage. We know that some Australian women have been discouraged from taking the test for the breast cancer gene because they are worried about the impact on their insurance. Remember that at the heart of all this is the fact that genetic tests are predictive; they are not certain, they are not definite. If you test positive for a particular gene or condition, there is the potential that you could develop a certain disease or condition; it does not mean you are going to. That is one very real reason that people face discrimination and they do so unfairly.</para>
<para>Genetic testing in the insurance industry is self-regulated. The members in that industry follow a policy drafted by the Insurance and Financial Services Association. I have had dealings with them and in the past we have worked very well to come up with something in this area, because the insurance companies realised early that they would be the subject of attack if they did not act in this area. Although the policy seeks to protect applicants’ genetic privacy and ensure test results are provided voluntarily, past surveys and anecdotal evidence do suggest that applicants with unfavourable tests have been denied insurance or have been granted insurance with higher premiums. This agreement lapses on 5 December this year and I urge the industry to extend that agreement until we have effective laws in place.</para>
<para>An earlier survey by one of the leading researchers in this area and one of the authors of the research mentioned today, Dr Kristine Barlow-Stewart of the New South Wales Centre for Genetics Education, found that 30 per cent of people affected by genetic disorders had experienced some form of discrimination—that is, nearly one-third of people with a genetic condition had experienced genetic discrimination. Two brothers, whose father committed suicide after his genetic test revealed Huntington’s disease, encountered discrimination in buying insurance. Both were tested for the Huntington’s genes. One yielded a positive result and he was refused insurance altogether. The other brother, whose result indicated no presence of the genes for the disease, was already paying a higher premium because of the family’s history of the disease. His request that his premiums be reassessed was initially rejected. Of most concern are people who have been screened and showed a probability or certainty of developing a disease in the future but were presently healthy and were either denied insurance or granted it but with higher premiums.</para>
<para>Our genetic privacy is under threat from a number of areas, but primarily it is under threat from ineffectual laws. Genetic information produced as a result of testing is vaguely included in the Privacy Act 1988 but it is considered part of ‘personal information’. That is not good enough. We know that. The act has to specifically recognise ‘genetic information’. As the ALRC recognised in <inline font-style="italic">Essentially yours</inline>, genetic samples used in tests, even if they identify a person, are not covered by the act. And although it may be considered theft, taking samples of other people’s DNA without their consent is not currently a criminal offence. Mr Acting Deputy President, I have run out of time, but you can be assured that I will be raising this issue again in the Senate before too long.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I listened very carefully to Senator Stott Despoja’s speech, the contents of which certainly are most deserving of greater consideration.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As senators know, I take a very close interest in the ABC, not least because it has a vital role to play as our national broadcaster. It is a service that is very heavily relied on in rural and regional Queensland in particular. Most of what the ABC does is of a very high standard, but it lets itself down by continuing displays of bias, most particularly in news and current affairs, much of which, it would seem, is caused by confusing and inconsistent management. It is on this theme that I wish to speak tonight.</para>
<para>The ABC news boss, John Cameron, has recognised the potential for allegations or realities of bias to damage the ABC in a series of memos. ‘We leave ourselves open to reasonable criticism,’ he warned in one such memo. In a memo in March 2003 Mr Cameron said, ‘Do not use anything that could be construed as emotional language or editorialisation.’</para>
<para>The issue is also covered in ABC editorial policies and in its news division style guide, where it states the following: ‘The familiarity bred by the use of first names when addressing or referring to certain people often evokes a sense of ABC sympathy for the cause.’ News and current affairs staff were banned from referring to ‘our troops in Iraq’ because the ABC does not own them and therefore they are not ‘ours’ as far as the ABC is concerned. Staff were warned about the consequences of breaching the rules. ‘The rules are not optional; they are mandatory,’ wrote Mr Cameron. The memo went on to say, ‘Continued transgressions will lead to formal documentation which in turn can have a major impact on career progression and eventually ongoing employment status.’ Mr Cameron issued the memo banning the use of ‘our’ in March 2003. Between then and now I have found more than 400 examples of breaches of this rule, including ‘our Anzacs’, ‘our Vietnam soldiers’, ‘our diggers at Gallipoli’, ‘our forensic police in Bali’ and ‘our Australian Federal Police helping in London’. There were 400 ‘ours’ in two years and the only time Mr Cameron did anything about it was when someone said ‘our troops in Iraq’.</para>
<para>Despite the warnings about disciplinary action, Quentin Dempster from <inline font-style="italic">Stateline New South Wales</inline> breached the rule 65 times and he is still on air. There were no memos from Mr Cameron and no action against staff, because the breaches did not involve the Iraq war. Just as Mr Cameron predicted, the ABC has created an unfavourable impression—that is, that the ABC opposes Australian involvement in the Iraq war. Mr Cameron was quite right to point out to staff that referring to some people by their first name creates an impression that the ABC sympathises with that person or their cause. Since that memo, David Hicks has become ‘David’ on <inline font-style="italic">The World Today</inline> with Nance Haxton, Cornelia Rau has become just ‘Cornelia’ on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline>, and Vivian Alvarez Solon became ‘Vivian’ six times in one report by Margot O’Neill on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline>. In Western Australia, <inline font-style="italic">Stateline</inline> interviewed a Liberal Party candidate and an ALP candidate. The Liberal was ‘Dean Solly’ but the ALP man, Jay Radisich, became simply ‘Jay’. Kim Beazley became ‘Kim’ on <inline font-style="italic">Insiders</inline>. John Howard became ‘Howard’ with Kerry O’Brien on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline>, while Kim Beazley became ‘Kim’. So the ABC has allowed itself to do exactly what Mr Cameron warned against: create a distinct impression that it sides with David Hicks, the Labor Party and the cause celebre of immigration activists.</para>
<para>In a further example of antigovernment and pro-Labor bias, the ABC breached its rule on disclosure on <inline font-style="italic">The World Today</inline> on 27 May this year. In a story about the union campaign against government workplace relations reforms, the reporter, Liz Foschia, introduced one Fran Tierney as a community worker in the not-for-profit sector. Fran Tierney is in fact a trade union official and was a federal Labor Party candidate at the 2001 election. Geraldine Doogue on <inline font-style="italic">Saturday Breakfast</inline> failed to disclose during an interview on the terrorist group Hezbollah with a commentator from a Lebanese TV station that the TV station was owned and operated by the very same Hezbollah.</para>
<para>That brings me to the issue of how the ABC describe terrorism. They do not want to label anyone—labels are not helpful. First the ABC used the old cliche ‘one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter’, as if the Bali bombers, al Qaeda or the London fanatics could ever be regarded as freedom fighters. Then they decided to be guided by the United Nations. If the UN listed a terrorist organisation the ABC would call them ‘terrorists’. But their journalists broke that rule so many times they had to get a new rule. Two dozen terrorist groups not on the UN list became ‘terrorist organisations’ according to no fewer than 20 different ABC journalists. The only times that news management did anything about it were when someone called Hezbollah or Hamas ‘terrorists’. I am still waiting for the ABC to get back to me on the difference between terrorists in southern Russia killing children in a school and terrorists in Jerusalem killing schoolchildren on a bus.</para>
<para>Now the ABC have a brand new rule: ‘Only call them terrorists if a third party is using the term.’ The style guide even gives an example: ‘What the Israeli government calls a “terrorist cell”.’ But guess what—since that latest new policy came in, ABC journalists have broken that rule more than 30 times. Peter Lloyd on the <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> program of 13 June said ‘local terror groups the MILF and Abu Sayyaf’. There was no attribution to any third party. But what happens when the terrorists are Hamas or Hezbollah and the third party is the Israeli government? Mark Willacy on 15 July said, ‘A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is blaming the Palestinian Authority for the rocket attacks, saying its failure to crack down on militant groups is undermining steps towards peace.’ But the Israeli spokesman actually said: ‘The Palestinian Authority is responsible for this fatal rocket attack because it continues to refuse to take the necessary steps to fight terror. Israel has lost six people this past week to terror.’ There was nothing said about militants. And I have a significant number of similar examples in store.</para>
<para>Look at what ABC TV’s <inline font-style="italic">Behind the News</inline> program is telling children about terrorism. I would like to quote from its report on terrorism since September 11: ‘As you know, on September 11 2001 the US was attacked when four planes were hijacked and flown into the World Trade Centre, the Pentagon and a field. Many consider the people behind the attacks terrorists. Terrorists create terror or fear. They do that by using violence or threatening to use violence to persuade governments or people to make changes in society. But many governments including Australia’s think terrorism is wrong.’</para>
<para>I ask the question here tonight: which people in the world do not consider that those who carried out the September 11 attacks were terrorists? Let me give you one example: David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. He thinks it was ‘a Zionist conspiracy’. And which governments in the world think terrorism is all right? There was one: Saddam Hussein’s. Remember him celebrating on the balcony with a gun? But he is gone.</para>
<para>
<inline font-style="italic">Behind the News</inline>, on your ABC, our ABC, is suggesting to children that the people behind September 11 were not necessarily terrorists and that terrorism is not necessarily wrong. I would urge Mr Russell Balding, the Managing Director of the ABC, to get serious about terrorism. He could do worse than take the advice tendered on one of his own shows, <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline>, by the executive director of the United Nations counter-terror agency, Mr Javier Ruperez:</para>
<quote>
<para>There is not one single action that could be construed as being enough in the fight against terrorism. I think that we have to try and put together a number of different actions—political, legal, financial, philosophical ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Refusing to call a terrorist a terrorist and instead using their preferred terms, like ‘militant’, plays straight into the hands of the terrorists. Matt Brown even called al-Qaeda ‘militants’ the other day. And why does the ABC consider that ‘terrorist’ is a label but ‘militant’ is not? Then there is ‘so-called’. We get ‘the so-called war on terrorism’ on the ABC, but you never hear, for instance, ‘the so-called human shield Donna Mulhearn’ on <inline font-style="italic">Australian Story</inline>. Perhaps the next ABC policy will be ‘the so-called war on alleged militancy’.</para>
<para>There is nothing ‘so-called’ about the war being waged against the Howard government by one Lindsay McDougall, a sometime musician and now ‘the doctor’ from Triple J morning show <inline font-style="italic">Jay and the Doctor</inline>. Fresh from his spectacularly unsuccessful election CD <inline font-style="italic">Rock Against Howard</inline>, with such memorable little ditties as ‘John Howard, gun him down’, Mr McDougall moved on to his post-election strategy to get the ‘c***’—again, I will not say the word, but he did—‘and his Treasurer mate’ at the next election.</para>
<para>The delighted management at the ABC rewarded this fellow traveller with a plum full-time job on the youth network. Mr McDougall has had a longstanding and publicly stated opposition to government immigration policies. Rather than play music and keep his angry left-wing political opinions to himself, we now find the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, my colleague here, Senator Vanstone, is nominated on Mr McDougall’s show as the Triple J ‘Friday F**kwit’. On a daily basis we get snide comments about the Howard government, and yet the ABC appointed Mr McDougall knowing he had a clear political agenda to support the Australian Democrats and the ALP—more left-wing bias served up to Australia’s young people by ‘our’ ABC.</para>
<para>Mr Cameron, the news boss, made it very clear to journalists in various memos that injudicious behaviour will create an impression that the ABC is biased. It is much more than an impression. I intend to continue to ask the ABC managing director, Russell Balding, for an explanation about all of this and for some definite action in terms of avoiding continuation of bias within the ABC.</para>

<para>—On Sunday, 3 July, Australia lost one of its greatest Aboriginal ambassadors, spokesmen and champions of reconciliation. Mr W Rubuntja passed away in Alice Springs that night—peacefully, I might add, but after a rather long illness. In his own words:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">When they see us dance we can celebrate that we all belong to the songs that cross the whole of this country.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Tonight I want to pay special tribute to Mr W Rubuntja, a humble and dignified man of many talents. While he is universally known by his first name, with regard to the wishes of his family and the Arrernte cultural practice I will refer to him here as ‘Mr Rubuntja’. His life and achievements were commemorated at the Northern Territory state funeral in Alice Springs on 21 July this year. I want to commend the Northern Territory government for instigating the state funeral on his behalf. It is well worth reading the story of his life in a book called <inline font-style="italic">The Town Grew Up Dancing</inline>, to learn more about the remarkable man and his country.</para>
<para>I was privileged to be present at the launch of this book, which was cowritten by Jenny Green, at the Araleun arts centre in 2002. It is a light-hearted but very insightful story about the efforts and achievements of this man. It is worth reading because it gives you a chance to read in his own words some anecdotes that Mr Rubuntja provided during the writing of this book. It is a great insight into the Aboriginal history and development of Central Australia. He was one of our great inclusive leaders, who did so much to shape the nation. While he was little known outside Central Australia, where he passed away recently—I understand he owned nothing more than the clothes he was in when he died—he certainly had a lot of respect and love from those who knew him.</para>
<para>His humanity, wit, grace, charm and sense of humour dominated the eulogies at the state funeral, which I attended. His deep cultural knowledge as a senior Arrernte lawman and a philosophical inclusiveness meant he was able to bring people together, both black and white, to work for a better future. In his later years he was a dignified, enigmatic presence around Alice Springs, always in his suit jacket and that crumpled, old, little, brown, brimmed hat.</para>
<para>Mr Rubuntja was born in the mid-twenties at Burt Creek, to the north-west of Alice Springs. He grew up as a rascally kid in and around the young frontier town of Alice Springs. His upbringing incorporated an Arrernte world view of country, ceremony and bush knowledge mixed together with doses of Lutheran and Catholic Christianity, and Hollywood cowboy movies at the cinema on Saturdays, he would say. As a young man he worked variously as a drover, stock camp boss, interpreter, house builder, gardener and cook. He took up painting, led by the example of and inspired by his uncle Albert Namatjira. It led to a talent in both the western landscape and the western desert ‘dot’ styles, drawing on his intimate knowledge of the Arrernte stories about the land.</para>
<para>He was a respected and collected artist in his own right, with works hung in the National Gallery of Australia, the Robert Holmes a Court collection and many other collections throughout this land. His work is also on display here in Parliament House in the form of the <inline font-style="italic">Barunga Statement</inline>. He was one of the artists and leaders who painted the culturally and politically charged <inline font-style="italic">Barunga Statement</inline> in 1988. It called for respect for Aboriginal culture and laws to be enshrined in a treaty between Indigenous people and the Australian nation.</para>
<para>He was acclaimed in the recent anniversary celebrations in Alice Springs of two organisations formed in the 1970s to address Aboriginal people’s needs. Those organisations were the Tangentyere Council and the Central Land Council. He was at the forefront of the battle to win basic services, land and housing for Aboriginal people living on the outskirts of Alice Springs in the 1970s. These fringe dwellers lived in appalling conditions, with no rights to services as basic as water, let alone housing and education. Tangentyere Council was formed to fight on behalf of the fringe dwellers and Mr Rubuntja was its first president. A long struggle against prejudice led to the eventual granting of special leases, housing and other services for these ‘town campers’.</para>
<para>Today, Tangentyere Council is the service organisation for the 18 Alice Springs Aboriginal housing associations. It is one of the largest organisations in Alice Springs. It still deals with the endemic poverty and disadvantage of many Aboriginal residents of Alice Springs and their extended families from the bush. However, Tangentyere has had its wins and success stories and Aboriginal people are now directly involved in providing services and deciding their future. Mr Rubuntja was at the forefront of that movement.</para>
<para>He was also involved with setting up the Yeperenye School in Alice Springs, an independent Aboriginal school where students learn in English and in their own language. In fact, my very first memory of meeting Mr Rubuntja in 1999 was in fact at one of the Yeperenye School fetes. He used to always refer to people who he liked as ‘good little boys’ and ‘good little girls’. The first time I met him, I was give the distinguished compliment of being ‘a special good little girl’. I guess that means I got his tick of approval.</para>
<para>Intertwined with the struggle for the rights of fringe dwellers in the 1970s, Mr Rubuntja also led the struggle for land rights, reconciliation and the protection of sacred sites. The Northern Territory enjoys the strongest Aboriginal land rights regime in Australia. This is partly due to Mr Rubuntja’s tireless efforts in bringing together Aboriginal people from across the Territory. Much was made at his funeral of his ability to reconcile differing points of view and to show respect to opponents. All his skills were needed to bring people together in the meetings and lobbying that preceded the Northern Territory Aboriginal Land Rights Act. The legislation was drafted under the Whitlam government but not passed before the sacking of that government. Malcolm Fraser was under huge pressure from within his coalition to back away from it.</para>
<para>The Central Land Council’s lawyer at the time, now Justice Geoff Eames QC, spoke at the funeral. He told of the meeting in Canberra between Mr Rubuntja, with other Aboriginal leaders, and Malcolm Fraser when the Land Rights Act was in the balance. Justice Eames related the dignity and the forcefulness with which Mr Rubuntja put his people’s case, which included the revelation of a sacred object he was authorised to bring to show the rightness of the cause. Justice Eames said it was one of the most profound and significant meetings in the history of Northern Territory land rights. Malcolm Fraser stood by his commitments given at the meeting, despite enormous pressure, and the act was passed with few amendments. It is unfortunate that some of Mr Fraser’s successors in the coalition are now fighting to undo this work.</para>
<para>Mr Rubuntja served as chairman of the Central Land Council between 1976 and 1980 and again from 1985 to 1988, overseeing the process of Aboriginal people winning back rights to some of their traditional lands. His campaigning led him to meet all the Australian prime ministers since Fraser. He even met the Pope and the Queen. In his later years, he would happily boast about the meetings and happily throw these into anecdotes while entertaining his audience.</para>
<para>His detailed cultural knowledge as a senior Arrernte lawman meant he was also at the forefront of the struggle to protect sacred sites in and around Alice Springs. He was chairman of the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority from 1983 to 1985. This often led to frustration and conflict with the Country Liberal Party government of the Northern Territory. Thankfully, many sites were saved and are still part of the rich cultural landscape of the centre. Mr Rubuntja was a natural choice as one of the first members of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation set up in 1991. He served two terms on the council, which aimed so high but which was left largely disowned by the new federal government in 1996.</para>
<para>Mr Rubuntja embodied reconciliation through his words and deeds. Though he was part of some of the most contentious and bitter debates, he was never bitter. He said that all children, black or white, born in Alice Springs were little Yeperenyes, or caterpillars, the local dreaming of Alice. To his wife Cynthia and her family, I extend my condolences. I would like to conclude with Mr Rubuntja’s words from 1988, quoted in the book <inline font-style="italic">The Town Grew Up Dancing</inline> and by the Central Land Council in their statement on his death. They are as meaningful now as they were in the bicentennial year. He said:</para>

<para class="block">Today there are lots of people living in this country, people who have come from all over the world. We don’t call them foreigners. We don’t ask, ‘Where’s your country? Where’s your father from?’ They have been born here. Their mother’s blood is in this country. This is their country too now. So, all of us have to live together. We have to look after each other. We have to share this country. And this means respecting each other’s laws and culture. We have to work out a way of sharing this country. But there has to be an understanding of, and respect of our culture and law.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I would like to speak about a few issues of significance to my electorate and home state of Queensland. This weekend we have a couple of by-elections in and around Brisbane, one on the south side of Brisbane and the other in the electorate of Redcliffe—which is the city of Redcliffe—following the retirement of the former Speaker, Mr Ray Hollis. Incidentally, he was a Democrats Senate candidate back in the 1980s before shifting across to serve the people of Redcliffe for over a decade as a Labor member.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Redcliffe has the distinction of perhaps being associated with the longest, continuing broken political promise in Queensland history concerning the repeated pledge for more than a century—by governments of all colours—to build a rail link from Brisbane to the Redcliffe Peninsula. I believe there are now more than ever very strong economic, traffic management, environmental, health and social reasons why that rail link should be built. A few years ago, the current Queensland state government—the Beattie Labor government—suggested that the time had come and it was finally going to be built. The diversion or the link from the main northern railway and the northern suburbs would now be built across to Deception Bay and Redcliffe. Initial signalling of the proposal was even put in for assessment under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. But nothing happened.</para>
<para>A few years later, the nomination for assessment was quietly withdrawn and the state government, once again, backed away from proposing to build that railway, instead relying on the time-honoured—and I might say regularly failing—approach of further widening what is now an extremely wide and very busy Bruce Highway. It should be emphasised that the suburbs adjoining and leading into the city of Redcliffe—such as a Murrumba Downs, Mango Hill and Deception Bay itself—are some of the fastest growing regions in Queensland and indeed in Australia. In the next 15 years it is expected that another 60,000 people will move into that area and all of them will have to either drive to the main existing railway and park there or drive all the way to Brisbane using that ever busier Bruce Highway.</para>
<para>The benefits of having a rail option for people in those areas is blindingly obvious. We are seeing a huge usage of the rail link that was put in and expanded on the Gold Coast a few years ago. That rail link was torn up many years ago and, lo and behold, a couple of decades later the government and the taxpayers had to pay to rebuild the whole thing. It is proving to be immensely popular. I think the economics of a railway clearly add up on a whole lot of fronts compared to all the other options, and I believe it is time for the railway to go ahead. Clearly, this Saturday provides a good opportunity for the people of Redcliffe to cast a vote in favour of sending a signal to all the political parties that are running that a railway is the way to go. They can still do that. There is a candidate running—who I think is at the top of the ballot paper—specifically on that issue. People can then pass on their preferences, if they wish, to another party.</para>
<para>I also take the opportunity to mention another issue of significance to Redcliffe, which is the historic Hornibrook Bridge. It was built in 1935. It is almost two kilometres long. It is one of the oldest and longest timber girder bridges in Australia. My father—who was a civil engineer—whilst not involved in the construction of this specific bridge, worked for Hornibrook for many years. As a youngster, I recall driving to Redcliffe for holidays and going over the old Hornibrook Bridge and stopping to pay the toll at the booth at the northern end of the bridge. From memory, I think it was 10c at that time. Eventually, the toll was dropped when the bridge was paid for. That bridge was taken out of use for traffic when the Houghton Highway was built some time ago, and there are proposals to build a duplicate bridge next to the Houghton Highway. It is now suggested that, because of the cost of maintaining the historic Hornibrook Bridge, it should be largely dismantled, apart from small parts.</para>
<para>The bridge is still widely used by many fishing people and also by cyclists, joggers and walkers. It is worth preserving. We have had what I think are quite spurious suggestions as to why it should be removed, including the fact that people are fishing off the bridge and, if they have a problem, the bridge is sufficiently old that it is not possible for emergency vehicles to drive along it. That might be a problem but, frankly, people go fishing in boats and in all sorts of remote places and if you are going to require people to always be somewhere where you can drive an ambulance right beside them before they can go fishing then they will not be going fishing in many places.</para>
<para>Arguments like that are really just looking for excuses to remove the bridge. Speaking as someone who has spent their whole life in Brisbane, and as a regular visitor to Redcliffe in my early childhood, that bridge is an iconic part of the south-east corner of Brisbane and Redcliffe and connects those two cities. Redcliffe is the location where people first tried to settle in the region when the penal colony was first proposed around Moreton Bay, before it moved to the area where the city now stands on the Brisbane River. The bridge linking Redcliffe Peninsula and Brisbane is an iconic one. It is a historic one of great heritage value. Whilst I recognise that there will be a cost to maintain it, I think that that relatively small cost is one worth spending to maintain the heritage value of a bridge that will be 70 years old this year.</para>
<para>Those sorts of links with the past are, I believe, worth preserving. Whilst ever such bridges are safe for public usage, it is good if people can make use of them. It would be a sad time if that bridge was removed without extremely good cause. I know many people in the Redcliffe City Council are keen to see whether there are still ways to try to preserve that bridge. As a representative of the state of Queensland, I would like to express support for them. It is important that that link with the past and with Redcliffe be maintained. It would be a good juxtaposition to have that 70-year-old historic bridge maintained into the future alongside the historic century-old promise to build a rail link to Redcliffe.</para>
<para>One piece of heritage I think we could dispense with is that of it being the oldest broken promise in Queensland political history. The time has come for the new railway to be put in to the Redcliffe Peninsula and for the old historic bridge to remind us of how simply building more bridges and more roads is not always the way to go. There are alternatives, such as rail, to promote and that clearly is a more economically viable alternative than continually expanding the size and width of roads or trying other mechanisms such as busways et cetera.</para>
<para>The by-elections this weekend will provide a good opportunity to focus on those particular issues for the people of Redcliffe. Whatever the results of the Redcliffe by-election and the particular needs, I might also say, of the Redcliffe Hospital—yet another local hospital that is a victim of some of the problems with health and hospital mismanagement in Queensland—I will be continuing to push for some of those issues of importance to the people of the Redcliffe area and people in the south-east corner of Queensland.</para>

<para>—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>In 2004, CASA began surveying course participants in order to determine the effectiveness of its safety seminars. Results from the March 2005 quarterly report indicate that 38% of those participants surveyed considered their knowledge of safety responsibilities to be good to extremely good. Upon completion of a CASA safety seminar, this figure had increased to 88%. A copy of these results is attached for information.</para>
<para>        CASA anticipates that by December 2005, all course participants will be routinely surveyed.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Although no formal research has been undertaken to determine the reason for the overall reduction in attendance at safety seminars, I am advised that CASA is currently planning a series of focus groups with pilots and engineers from capital cities and regional locations to identify the motivational factors that affect attendance. CASA will also use the focus groups to discuss such issues as seminar content and location.</para>
<para>        Additionally, in the March/April edition of <inline font-style="italic">Flight Safety Australia</inline>, CASA distributed a safety seminar questionnaire aimed at obtaining information on preferred timing, format and location of seminars in order to improve attendance figures.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>As noted earlier, the Authority has not undertaken any formal research to determine the reason for the overall reduction in attendance at safety seminars. Accordingly, no results are available.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">ASP Program Delivery Seminars Evaluation: 2004/05.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">A total of 149 participants completed evaluation sheets provided at three locations where the seminars were held: Sydney (78), Adelaide (30) and Albury (41). This analysis summarises the participants’ views on the usefulness of the Seminars.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Pre and Post - Seminar Knowledge</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">. 28% rated their pre-course knowledge as ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’ while 38% thought it was ‘good’ to ‘extremely good’ (see Fig 1).</para>
</quote>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">. 3% rated their post seminar knowledge as ‘poor’ while 88% described it as ‘good’ to ‘extremely good’; furthermore, over 54% rated the Seminars as ‘ very good’ (cf Fig 2).</para>
</quote>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">. Comparison of pre - and post- seminar ratings suggest a positive shift in knowledge acquisition.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Relevance and ability to apply knowledge</inline>
</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">. Regarding participants view about relevance of the Seminars, 83% thought they were ‘very relevant’ or ‘extremely relevant’.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">. Of the 83% of the participants who indicated the course was ‘relevant’ to ‘extremely relevant’ the majority (over 90%) felt confident they could apply the knowledge gained to their aviation related jobs. (see Table 2 Appendix 1). This pattern is the same in all three cities.</para>
</quote>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">. Again almost 89% of these participants said they will be more effective in their aviation activities as a result of attending the Seminars (see Table 3 Appendix 1.)</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Relevance and Repeated and Attendance</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">. 74% of respondents has had at least one previous attendance at the Seminars. For the majority of these participants (90%), the relevance of the Seminars to their aviation work ranged from ‘good’ to ‘extremely good’ perhaps explaining their repeated attendance (see Table 1)</para>

<para>                As Christmas Island IRPC is a temporary facility and does not have a dedicated visits area, visits are held in the covered areas (cabanas) of a vacant compound.  At the time of this specific visit, this vacant compound was a construction zone and was not accessible to visitors and detainees.  To allow visits to continue during this period a table was placed in the administration area with some cover. This cover did not, however, allow for adequate protection during storms. This was the second time the visitor had attended for the day; a prior visit had already been completed.  The second visit commenced and was terminated due to wet weather.</para>

<para>Those in the medical compound were removed due to the location of the gardens along the fence line that were found to be destabilising and affecting the footings of the fence.  This compound is a secure area and is not open for general access unless an officer is present.</para>
<para>Those in the general compound were removed as this area is used by detainees to play soccer and other sports and activities.</para>
<para>In addition, I can advise that, for safety and security of all detainees, a portion of a garden bed was removed to allow emergency vehicle access.  Detainees had extended one of the garden beds to the point where the garden was blocking the access of emergency vehicles.  Approximately two metres of garden bed was removed for this reason.</para>
<para>Detainees are also advised that gardens cannot be created up against any infrastructure, including buildings and fences, both for security reasons and to ensure that the care and maintenance of those structures are not obstructed.</para>

</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1) (a)">
<para>Limits have been imposed on the amounts of gifting of garden produce by detainees at the Christmas Island IRPC.  These are:</para>
<para>        - for visits into the IRPC - three bags per visitor/per day;</para>
<para>        - for excursions to Church/ Fellowship/Temple – one bag per each attending detainee, to a maximum of eight bags.  There is also an approved minimum of three bags per attendance if only one or two detainees attend; and</para>
<para>        - to school – one bag per attending child per day.</para>
<para>        The bags are large white bin liners that fit a 36 litre bin.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b) (c)">
<para>and (d) The restrictions on the gifting of produce were imposed in January 2005 by GSL after consultation with DIMIA. Detainees were not consulted.</para>
<para>        Gardening is intended to be a recreational activity.  Fruit and vegetables grown in these gardens provide the detainees who grow them with a sense of satisfaction and achievement, and also supplement the meals that are provided by the Detention Services Provider.  Seeds, fertiliser and gardening equipment are provided at no cost by the department and the Detention Services Provider to detainees.</para>
<para>        The practice developed whereby surplus fruit and vegetables were given to visitors to reduce wastage.  It was never intended nor envisaged that this fruit and these vegetables, produced at no cost to either the detainees or to those to whom they are gifted, would be in competition with the produce of islanders who have to pay for seeds, fertiliser and water.  DIMIA and GSL staff at the IRPC were advised, however, that this was regularly occurring and was creating considerable resentment on the island.  Consequently, GSL in consultation with DIMIA amended the policy of virtually unlimited gifting of produce to visitors, and imposed restrictions to the totals outlined above.</para>

<para>I am advised that the following advice has been provided by the department:</para>
<para>        The Australian Government does not have the constitutional power to comprehensively legislate against the manufacture and sale of tobacco products, including flavoured cigarettes.  There is currently no Australian Government legislation that would prohibit the sale of these products in Australia.</para>
<para>        The Australian Government’s aim is to reduce smoking rates and to prevent young people from taking up smoking.  This is demonstrated by the commitment of $25 million, over four years, on a new anti-smoking campaign targeting young people, announced in the most recent federal Budget.</para>
<para>        Where these products carry the current health warnings, as mandated under the Trade Practices (Consumer Product Information Standards) (Tobacco) Regulations, they comply with all Australian Government requirements in relation to labelling.  From 1 March 2006, all tobacco products will include the new graphic health warnings. The powerful graphics will convey a strong and confronting message to smokers, including young people, about the harmful health consequences of smoking tobacco products.</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>No.  The new Chronic Disease Management (CDM) items were developed in consultation with general practitioner (GP) organisations.  They provide greater flexibility in care planning, while retaining the functionality of existing services.  The GP management plan (GPMP) and team care arrangements (TCA) items are designed to be complementary and integrated, and together equate broadly to an EPC multidisciplinary care plan.  A TCA can be prepared as a simple addition to a patient’s GPMP.</para>
<para>The new items maintain incentives for multidisciplinary care planning, with the total Medicare rebates for a GPMP and a TCA ($215.00) exceeding the rebate for an EPC multidisciplinary care plan ($206.75).  The new items should make care planning and access to allied health services easier, as practice nurses and Aboriginal Health Workers can now play a greater role in assisting in the preparation of a GPMP and coordinating a TCA.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The changes to the EPC care planning items were proposed by the Red Tape Taskforce following its review of the Practice Incentive Program (PIP) and EPC items.  The taskforce consulted widely as part of its review, including public dissemination of discussion papers through its website and direct consultation with interested parties.  The detailed design of the taskforce’s recommended changes has been undertaken in close consultation with GP organisations, as is normal practice for new Medicare items.  Allied health and dental organisations were briefed on the new items at a consultative group meeting on 19 May 2005.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>GP groups have provided comment and input to the design of the items as per normal practice for the development of GP Medicare items.  Allied health and dental groups have discussed and commented on the items through the allied health and dental care initiative’s consultative group.  The Australian Physiotherapy Association has also met with the department to put forward its views.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The uptake of the CDM items and the allied health and dental care items is monitored through Health Insurance Commission (HIC) data on an ongoing basis.  The impact of the introduction of the CDM items on the allied health and dental care services will be assessed after a period of operation (around two years) through uptake data, stakeholder consultation and qualitative research.</para>
