<para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="S466">Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. This is an important piece of legislation that will go some way towards enhancing accountability and oversight of Australia’s intelligence agencies. There cannot be any doubt that the gathering and analysis of intelligence is at the front line in the fight against terrorism. Terrorism, it goes without saying, is an insidious phenomenon and, as Mr Flood reported, remedies are best focused in the first instance on thorough information.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Since the tragic events of 11 September 2001, more than $4 billion has been committed by the Australian government to security and intelligence services through security and intelligence activities. This has been the most rapid expansion of our security and intelligence agencies since the end of World War II. Improving accountability of our intelligence agencies is timely, because of the problems that we have faced in more recent years and that seem to be a permanent feature of our lives.</para>
<para>Our memories are still fresh after the failure of intelligence agencies world wide to identify weapons of mass destruction. We have to say, as well, that the events of 9-11 themselves caught agencies napping or, at best, ill prepared. The embarrassing controversy over the temporary termination of intelligence to our forces in East Timor was a failure much closer to home. We hope, at least, that the lessons of East Timor serve to remind our intelligence services that the needs of our troops in the field must come first. This is particularly the case in Afghanistan and Iraq, where our people are so far away and clearly vulnerable. The tragic repetition of events in Bali last weekend is another salutary reminder of the importance of intelligence. Sadly, it seems there was none, which again clearly shows how difficult terrorism is to deal with.</para>
<para>Turning to the bill itself, this legislation seeks to amend the Intelligence Services Act 2001. The majority of the measures contained in the bill arise from the recommendations of the July 2004 <inline font-style="italic">Report of the inquiry into Australian intelligence agencies</inline>, the Flood report. In March 2004 the Prime Minister announced an independent review of the Australian foreign intelligence community. This included, inter alia, the effectiveness of oversight and accountability mechanisms, the suitability of the current division of labour among the agencies, the contestability of intelligence assessments and the adequacy of current resourcing of intelligence agencies.</para>
<para>The Flood report made several recommendations, including, inter alia, extending the mandate of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. In addition to those organisations currently covered by the committee—ASIO, ASIS and DSD—this would include the Office of National Assessments, ONA; the Defence Intelligence Organisation, the DIO; and the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation, DIGO. Formalisation of the functions and ministerial accountability of DIGO would be consistent with arrangements for other intelligence organisations.</para>
<para>Similarly, the role of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security under the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986, the IGIS Act, would be amended to include scrutiny of DIGO on a comparable basis to that which currently applies to DSD and ASIS. There would also be expansion of the mandate of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, IGIS, to initiate inquiries at his or her own discretion into matters relating to ONA and DIO. In particular, such inquiries could be initiated without ministerial referral. These amendments would bring the powers of IGIS into line with the powers of the office in respect to ASIO, ASIS and DSD. The legislation also provides for IGIS to conduct a periodic review of ONA statutory independence. Finally, the recommendations sought to strengthen ONA’s intelligence community coordination role.</para>
<para>The government subsequently agreed to accept the recommendations of the Flood inquiry. The exception was the proposal to change the name of the Office of National Assessments, the ONA. The Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 largely reflects these recommendations. Importantly, the provision of a legislative basis for the activities of the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation will be a major outcome of this bill. DIGO is an agency of the Department of Defence, established in November 2000. While DIGO is a relatively new organisation, Australia’s involvement in imagery intelligence and topography is not new. These activities have been an integral part of Australia’s defence for many years. DIGO was created within Defence to better realise increasing synergies in the exploitation of imagery and other data to produce intelligence and geospatial information.</para>
<para>Like ASIO and DSD, DIGO has a foreign intelligence focus; however, its role is not limited to that. The bill sets out the functional categories of DIGO’s work, which include collecting and obtaining imagery and geospatial data to produce intelligence relating to people or organisations outside Australia; obtaining imagery and geospatial data to produce intelligence to support ADF exercises, training and operations, wherever they may occur, which includes providing data and material in support of ADF decision making for targeting; and obtaining imagery and geospatial data to produce intelligence to support Commonwealth and state authorities in their national security role.</para>
<para>Another proposal in the bill is to expand the membership of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD from seven to nine via the mechanism of one additional senator and one additional member. It establishes a new position of deputy chair and empowers the committee to establish subcommittees when required. Of note is that the proposed deputy chair would be a government member. This measure is out of step with other joint standing committees, where the opposition member is the deputy chair.</para>
<para>The ministerial authorisation regime will also be changed to allow certain other ministers to authorise intelligence collection activities in circumstances where the responsible minister is not readily contactable or available. The group of ministers will be the Prime Minister, the ministers for defence and foreign affairs and the Attorney-General. This is stated as intending to allow flexibility while ensuring that suitable ministerial control exists. The bill also includes the strengthening of oversight mechanisms. This includes regular reporting obligations on all agency heads in respect of those activities that have been authorised by the minister. There is also an obligation for agency heads to seek a reconsideration of a ministerial authorisation. This will apply when the circumstances which justified the authorised activities cease to exist. However, the activation of this obligation appears to be unreasonably subjective with respect to the financial records of ASIO, ASIS and DSD.</para>
<para>On the whole, the proposed amendments contained in the bill appear appropriate and are consistent with the recommendations of the Flood inquiry. They will considerably strengthen accountability, reporting and investigatory powers of oversight of our major intelligence agencies.</para>
<para>I now turn to some substantive concerns with the bill. The opposition’s primary focus in considering the bill is paragraph 22. Paragraph 22 proposes the removal of the qualifying words currently obtained in section 8(1)(a)(i) of the Intelligence Services Act. This provides for ministerial directions that previously only covered activities for the specific purpose of producing intelligence on an Australian person who is overseas—the key words there being ‘who is overseas’. The outcome of this is that, despite some ambiguity, a minister will be required to authorise the production of intelligence on an Australian person regardless of whether that person is overseas or in Australia.</para>
<para>Currently, the legislation requires authorisation only in respect of an Australian who is overseas. The situation in respect of an Australian within Australia is the subject of a ministerial direction that specifies that such authorisation is necessary. The government argues that this amendment adds an additional safeguard to the operation of the act. That is because the legislation will now mandate the requirement of ministerial authorisation for the collection of intelligence on Australians wherever they are located. This issue arose in late 2001 when allegations were raised that DSD had illegally listened to and reported phone conversations between Australians in Australia and the captain of the Norwegian freighter, the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>. In 2002 the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security conducted an inquiry into the legal issues surrounding DSD’s collection of communications during the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> incident. IGIS reported:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It became apparent for the first time that there could be doubt about the legal basis for an element of DSD’s collection strategy in certain unusual circumstances. Legal advice obtained by DSD was that the legal position was unclear. In the particular circumstances, however, a court would probably favour the argument that there was a breach of the Telecommunications Interception Act, although there were also arguments that there was no breach and that expert engineering advice could be determinative of the issue. Two end product reports, including one of those mentioned above, relied upon such collection.</para>
<para class="block">Situations giving rise to the potential difficulty would be unlikely to occur in the course of normal foreign intelligence collection. In my view, however, the appropriate course was for DSD not to undertake any more collection that had the potential to be in breach of the Act until the issue has been put beyond doubt. The Director, DSD has indicated that DSD is very conscious of the seriousness of this matter and ceased such activity immediately upon becoming aware of the difficulty. The Director will be taking steps, with other Commonwealth agencies, to clarify and resolve the issue, and will report progress to the Inspector General. I hope to be able to report more definitively on this in the 2001 2002 IGIS annual report.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Beyond the amendments proposed in this bill and the appointment to DSD of an in-house special counsel outposted from the Australian Government Solicitor, no statement or clarification of the legality of DSD’s activities generally or in circumstances similar to those of 2001 has been produced. Accordingly, the current legal position is and remains ambiguous. In particular, there is a question as to whether the legislation should be construed as authorising the collection of intelligence on Australians who are within Australia.</para>
<para>As a matter of practical reality, the government’s view of the legislation is that applied by the relevant agencies—‘of course’, it is said. In certain circumstances they obtain intelligence on Australians who are in Australia where they may be communicating or dealing with persons who are outside Australia. Under the present regime, it appears that it is intended that either the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Foreign Affairs would be authorised to approve the collection of intelligence on Australian citizens within Australia. This would be done using highly sophisticated military technologies without the appropriate safeguards that are traditionally required in respect of any equivalent surveillance activity. Significantly, the powers of surveillance would include not only the electronic interception technologies available to the DSD but also the increasingly sophisticated satellite imaging capabilities available to DIGO.</para>
<para>We believe that any surveillance technologies applied with respect to Australians within Australia should be consistent with the warrant regime that currently applies to ASIO. The current ASIO regime contains a number of different surveillance warrant procedures. The closest equivalent is the telecommunications interception power. On that basis it is proposed that Labor move an amendment to the bill to replicate as closely as possible the safeguards that apply to ASIO warrants. This is entirely consistent with the recommendation of the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD into the bill. The committee recommended:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… as the regime moves from Ministerial direction to legislated Ministerial authority as proposed in Item 22, it should generally replicate the provisions of and have identical authorisation provisions to those that apply to ASIO.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This was a unanimous recommendation, supported by members of both the opposition and the government. The government, we believe, should listen to this committee and legislate in accordance with its recommendations. We ask the government to agree to amendments simplifying the warrant process in the case of emergency requests and to provide an alternative authorisation process in the absence of the Attorney-General.</para>
<para>Additional amendments include incorporating a safeguard to minimise the retention of incidentally obtained intelligence about Australians. These amendments require that the Attorney-General be notified when an authorisation is given by either the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Foreign Affairs to obtain intelligence on Australians overseas. The government has indicated that it is not prepared to support these sensible amendments.</para>
<para>The regime proposed by the government is also deficient in that it does not include a formal written warrant procedure. The government is satisfied that the present ministerial authorisation regime is sufficient protection for the privacy of Australians. The opposition are not satisfied that the bill provides adequate protection to Australians in Australia, nor do we believe it satisfactorily clarifies the legal ambit of activity of our intelligence agencies collecting foreign intelligence.</para>
<para>I now turn to other concerns. Although this bill goes some way towards improving accountability and oversight of our intelligence agencies, several outstanding issues remain. The first concerns the parliamentary joint committee, which is required under the Intelligence Services Act 2001 to review the administration and expenditure of Australia’s intelligence agencies. Earlier this year it acknowledged:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… that it is not equipped to conduct a detailed examination of the financial records of ASIO, ASIS and DSD.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So, despite the rapid growth of our intelligence agencies since 2001, effective parliamentary oversight of these agencies still does not exist and the government has failed to remedy this state of affairs.</para>
<para>The bipartisan committee report was quite explicit in its criticism of the government for failing to provide it with the necessary information to examine the expenditure of Australia’s intelligence agencies. The committee reported:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is unfortunate … that at a time effective scrutiny of our intelligence agencies is perhaps most needed, this Committee, which possesses an indisputable need-to-know, is still denied access to key documentation, notably the classified annual reports of the agencies.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Similar concerns were raised by the parliamentary joint committee in 2001-02. The government refused to act then and refuses to act now on recommendations made by the committee to improve accountability. The activities of our intelligence agencies should not be subject to the same level of public scrutiny as other government departments and agencies. Their work is by nature secretive and must be so in order to protect sources of intelligence and continued access by government. However, this does not preclude limited and confidential parliamentary oversight by an appropriately tasked parliamentary committee such as the joint committee. As much was stated in the 2004 Flood report:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Effective oversight and accountability of intelligence agencies is critically important for a healthy democracy.</para>
</quote>
<para class="centre">                  …         …           …</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… greater parliamentary scrutiny is necessary to enhance public confidence in Australia’s intelligence agencies.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The government should now act to allow greater scrutiny of the expenditure of public money by our intelligence agencies. This would enhance accountability of these agencies, but, more importantly, might go some way to protect the agencies themselves. If these agencies are subject to a regular parliamentary review process, a better understanding of the legitimate activities will be gained by the parliament. That will go to reducing ambiguity within the agencies in their day-to-day operations. It may also assist to prevent a repeat of incidents such as <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> in 2001 and the switching-off of intelligence in East Timor in 1999. I will speak further to these matters during the committee stage, when we will move these important amendments.</para>

<para>—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to speak to the <inline ref="S466">Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. As you have heard, the purpose of this bill is to amend the Intelligence Services Act 2001, the Office of National Assessments Act 1977, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986 and related legislation in order to implement proposals recommended by the Flood inquiry as well as the government’s review of the intelligence services agencies coordinated by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet last year.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>When the Flood inquiry was established, as honourable senators may be aware, the Australian Democrats called for it to look at the broader issue of the government’s role in the use of intelligence as well as the activities of the intelligence agencies. The Democrats, along with many Australians, I think, remain quite sceptical about the adequacy of that inquiry because of its narrow terms of reference, the fact that it was not fully independent and, as you have heard from Senator Bishop, the lack of information that at times was made available to it. So the Flood inquiry was nowhere near as comprehensive as it should and could have been.</para>
<para>I find it ironic that, in some cases, this government has no qualms about adopting legislation—and quite draconian legislation at times—from other jurisdictions, particularly overseas, yet it fails to adopt the safeguards that sometimes occur in that legislation or those policies in other jurisdictions. It certainly appears to have ignored the far more comprehensive examinations of intelligence services and the decisions made prior to the war in Iraq that were conducted in the United States and, indeed, in the United Kingdom. We have had no such adequate or comparable investigation here in Australia, and I think that shows a lack of attention to accountability, transparency and, indeed, honesty by this government.</para>
<para>In light of the raft of legislation that is about to be presented to this parliament—legislation that I suspect has great potential to erode the human rights, the civil rights and, certainly, the civil liberties of Australians—surely it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that the Australian people have every confidence in our intelligence agencies. The government to date has failed to do this, given there are a number of credible claims of systematic failure within our intelligence services—in particular, allegations made by Lieutenant Colonel Lance Collins and, of course, the seriously flawed information on which our Prime Minister and the cabinet relied in order to take us to war in Iraq.</para>
<para>The Democrats have long argued for a royal commission—certainly nothing less is good enough—into our intelligence service agencies and their relationship with the government. We cannot hope to meet the threats that have been posed in recent times, particularly by terrorism, without absolute confidence in our intelligence agencies. We need to know that they are functioning properly and without undue interference.</para>
<para>Among other things, this bill will provide new powers to enable ASIS, DIGO and DSD to communicate incidentally obtained intelligence acquired unintentionally in the course of gathering foreign intelligence to state and Commonwealth authorities or to approved authorities from other countries. Currently, these agencies can only communicate intelligence as it is collected in pursuit of their primary function. So this amendment—and I know Senator Bishop has referred to it—will provide a considerable increase in the type of intelligence information that these agencies can communicate. The limitations as to whether or not this information can be passed on are very broad and appear to give substantial scope for justifying the communication of almost any intelligence.</para>
<para>Following the detention and deportation of American peace activist Scott Parkin, a number of Australians—certainly Australian Democrat senators and others in this place—have been left wondering exactly what constitutes a threat to security. I believe this change could—although I hope not—provide a somewhat irresistible temptation for testing the boundaries of what is collected unintentionally. I hope that perhaps in the committee stage the minister can give us some assurances on this issue. It certainly is an even greater concern given that intelligence agencies are not constrained by the Privacy Act. Exactly how will the transmission of incidental intelligence to state authorities work, especially when it comes to an absence of staff who hold national security clearances? I hope the government will address that in their committee stage comments. From what I can see, there appear to be no limits as to what bodies constitute an appropriate state authority. While intelligence sharing has potential benefits, there are significant implications for privacy that must be considered in the context of this bill and that certainly need to be more adequately addressed.</para>
<para>The report of the Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Directorate indicated that the amendments proposed in item 22 of schedule 1 of the bill—that is, to delete the words ‘who is overseas’ from section 8 of the act—will result in the provision of a reasonable safeguard for Australians by ensuring that ASIS, DIGO and DSD will be required to seek a ministerial authorisation to produce intelligence on an Australian person, whether they are overseas or in Australia. However, these amendments have raised concerns. I note that in a <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> article published in June, Professor George Williams from the University of New South Wales contended that the provisions were actually unclear. He expressed concern that they might be interpreted as an extension of the power of the agencies that would enable them ‘to conduct their operations in regards to Australians in Australia in a way they have not been able to do in the past’. I think the government needs to provide some clarification of the reason for this amendment and the intended result—that is, to ensure that there is no misunderstanding or misinterpretation.</para>
<para>The Australian Democrats are also concerned with item 13 of this bill, which seeks to amend the definition of ‘permanent resident’ that is currently defined according to section 4 of the ASIO Act. People in Australia on temporary protection, student or business visas and asylum seekers and other detainees will continue to remain outside the minimum safeguards offered to Australians. The implications of this amendment are that the privacy rules under section 15 do not apply and that the need to obtain a ministerial authorisation under section 8 does not apply. Further, the committee cannot review an activity of the intelligence agencies that does not affect an Australian person under clause 29(3)(e). There is no adequate reason why the government cannot extend the same limited protections to non-Australians as it has to Australians. Indeed, international law appears to require the safeguarding of the basic rights of all people within the borders of our country.</para>
<para>In recent weeks the government has proposed some of the most draconian laws—to use a phrase that I heard Premier Beattie and others utter at the COAG summit—and certainly unprecedented laws in Australia. It apparently plans to implement these laws without consideration as to the consequences they might have for the rights and liberties of the Australian people. I hope that is not the case; I hope there will be adequate scrutiny and review of those laws through this place. I hope that the government will perhaps consider protections and safeguards—maybe a human rights act or a bill of rights. That is something we can talk about in due course. But, given this apparent race—I am not just blaming the Commonwealth—to rob Australians of some of their liberties and privacy, perhaps the most fundamental issue in this bill relates to the accountability and the oversight of intelligence agencies.</para>
<para>This is an issue that was recognised by both the Flood inquiry and, of course, the parliamentary joint committee. The Flood report states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Our liberal democratic society demands that all elements of government are accountable. Australians are entitled to be confident that government institutions are operating according to law, under the authority of ministers, and that they offer value for money, efficiency and effectiveness.</para>
<para class="block">Intelligence agencies are no exception. Indeed, these obligations are, if anything, higher in relation to intelligence agencies than other branches of government. With the capacity to infringe on citizens’ privacy and to undertake acts that without specific legislation might be unlawful, Australians are entitled to expect that intelligence collection agencies are properly scrutinised and held to account.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Hear, hear! The Australian Democrats recognise that, because of the very nature of the agencies, the accountability and oversight system regulating intelligence agencies will differ. It will be different, arguably, from that for other government agencies. However, this does not mean that accountability or oversight cannot be strengthened. In fact, I think there has never been a more important time in Australia’s history to ensure that we have great and proper scrutiny.</para>
<para>The Democrats do recognise the need for parts of the intelligence function to remain secret and recognise that public disclosure of the technical capabilities of the agencies would, in some cases, certainly limit their usefulness. But it is vital that accountability and oversight are strengthened. Items 41 to 51 of the bill extend the mandate of the current Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD to cover DIGO, DIO and ONA, with a name change of the committee to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, the PJCIS, and a membership increase from seven to nine.</para>
<para>The Democrats have said before that we support an increase in the membership of that committee. Certainly, we are willing to support an expansion of the mandate of the committee. I think that is an appropriate and worthy aim. However, because of the importance of this committee, we believe that the membership should include representation by crossbenchers—that is, minor party and/or Independent representatives. Given the outcome of the recent COAG meeting and the apparent willingness of the opposition to allow any intrusive bill through under the coverall of counter-terrorism, I think that further representation is a matter of urgency. I impress upon the government our support for the increased mandate—but we would like to see the crossbenches represented on that committee.</para>
<para>The Democrats have long contended that the bipartisan—certainly not multiparty and arguably unrepresentative—nature of this committee places the entire crossbench in a very difficult position in considering many of the proposals contained in this bill. Our role as legislators is arguably compromised if we do not have sufficient access to information when making decisions in this place, whether it is on legislation, policy or other matters. This need not be the case. It is entirely possible to provide intelligence briefings to non-government members of parliament without compromising national security.</para>
<para>I made it very clear recently that I did not expect—and I knew there was no statutory obligation for—ASIO or the government to brief the Democrats, the Greens or other crossbench members on the issue of Scott Parkin. I understood that there was not an obligation. But, as I maintained in that case, surely he and his lawyers should know the issues. Surely a better way of dealing with this, and it is something the Democrats have discussed, is having a representative on the joint committee. That is one way of ensuring that that party or that person, or indeed the crossbenchers as a whole, has some access to information that would better inform them when commenting on or making decisions about national security. Having said that, please do not think for a moment that I endorse in any way the appalling decision that was made in relation to Scott Parkin and the lack of information that was provided to the people who were at the heart of that case, including him.</para>
<para>This bill also provides for a new deputy chair of the committee on intelligence and security. However, I note that the bill provides for that position to be filled by a government member. I do not know if you, Mr Acting Deputy President Brandis, or anyone else in this place can give me an example of where this has happened before. I think it is quite extraordinary that section 16 stipulates that the chair must be a member of the government. So we will have a situation where both the chair and the deputy chair of a committee are government members. I think it is the first time in parliamentary history that that has occurred. I would like to know the government’s justification for that position, and I look forward to an explanation from the minister in the committee stage of the bill.</para>
<para>I am wondering how that decision supposedly enhances the bipartisan nature of the committee and its deliberations. This is not coming from the interests of the crossbench; this is coming as a member of opposition parties in this place. Surely the opposition will be opposing that particular part of the bill. I wonder: is it a manic drive for complete control of the legislative process? I note, however, that there are some amendments from the government which have just been circulated in relation to 64A. They are repealing the subclause substitute, so it is up to five; it is not changing the first four provisions that are in that bill. I look forward to the government explanation.</para>
<para>The Democrats believe this bill should also reflect the other issues that have been raised by the committee in its annual report of 2004-05, particularly in relation to the classified annual reports of each of the agencies and the removal of the restriction on disclosures to parliament about ‘the conduct of Australia’s foreign relations’ from clause 7. The committee continues to be limited because of its terms of reference. They extend only to the budget and administration of the agencies, not to policy and operational activities.</para>
<para>The Democrats welcome the expanded role of the inspector-general provided for in this bill—specifically the provision for the initiation of own-motion inquiries into the Office of National Assessments and the Defence Intelligence Organisation, and the power to enter any place where a person is being detained under division 3 of part III of the ASIO Act, for the purposes of an inspection or an inquiry. The expanded role and increased powers that this bill would give to the inspector-general appear to provide a step towards greater accountability, with the possible exception of inaction on reports.</para>
<para>The agencies charged with the oversight of our intelligence services need to be independent of government direction, well funded and well resourced. While this bill provides for an expanded role for both the joint committee and the inspector-general, there are still unacceptable limitations on their ability to perform their roles. It is ridiculous to pretend that the office of the inspector-general will be able to adequately maintain the level of oversight that is required with its current staff of five and its current limited budget. I am not sure what proposals the government are putting forward, but if they are seriously committed to improving the accountability of the intelligence services then I am sure they will provide more assistance and more funds and resources for rigorous and comprehensive oversight.</para>
<para>This bill does require further amendment. In line with the recommendations made by the joint committee in its review of the Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005, item 64 of schedule 1 should be amended to remove the requirement that the deputy chair be a government member. The Democrats also believe that joint committee membership should be expanded to include crossbench representatives, and, in order to better fulfil its oversight role, the committee should be allowed access to the classified annual reports of each of the agencies. There also needs to be better protection for non-Australians in line with international human rights obligations and a greater clarification of the meaning and desired outcome of a number of the amendments.</para>
<para>The Democrats also note comments made by Christopher Michaelsen of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre in Canberra, who pointed out that, because Australia does not have a bill of rights or a human rights act, there would be no impediment to the extension of the agencies’ powers. I think the Australian government must ensure that all possible measures are taken to ensure the privacy and security of Australians—that is, making sure that the changes that we are seeing in the name of countering terrorism are balanced appropriately with safeguards and protections. I look forward to a debate in this place at some stage on a bill of rights. I think it is a debate whose time has come. Certainly it is one that I and the Democrats look forward to playing a role in.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="S466">Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> seeks to implement changes to several statutes relating to the administration of Australia’s intelligence agencies. The proposed reforms are the product of three inquiries or reviews. The first was a broad-ranging inquiry into Australia’s intelligence services conducted by Mr Philip Flood in 2004 at the request of the Prime Minister, which was prompted in part by the intelligence shortcomings revealed over the Iraq intervention. The second was a review coordinated by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet as a result of suggestions contained within the recent annual report of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. And the third was a review of the bill conducted by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Together these reviews represent the most comprehensive evaluation of Australia’s intelligence services since the Hope royal commission of the 1970s—and one feels bound to say that they were not before time. I listened with interest to Senator Stott Despoja’s remarks that the Flood inquiry had not been adequate or far ranging. It seems to me to be quite the contrary, and that, in fact, the Australian people were well served by the extent of Mr Flood’s inquiry. He did a very comprehensive job in a relatively short time and he made some important recommendations for change.</para>
<para>The inquiries took place well before the recent terrorist attacks in London and, most recently and tragically, in Bali on Saturday. In both of these attacks Australians were injured and, in the latter, three and perhaps more Australians were killed. These were brutal and cowardly acts that served to remind us that the scourge of terrorism is very close at hand and very close to home and that, more than ever, Australia’s intelligence services play an absolutely critical role in the front line of defending Australia, its citizens and our interests abroad and at home.</para>
<para>I strongly support most of the changes proposed by the bill. I believe they will serve, as the minister said in his second reading speech, to strengthen the contribution of sound intelligence to the development of Australian government policy. I note that we are not talking just about policy in relation to counter-terrorism. The intelligence agencies have a much wider remit, and these changes will affect national security issues much more broadly. They will touch upon matters such as the weapons of mass destruction, border protection, Defence Force operations and transnational crime in all of its numerous and seemingly endless and expanding variants.</para>
<para>The bill touches on the activities of all six of Australia’s intelligence agencies: the Defence Intelligence Organisation, the Office of National Assessments, ASIS, ASIO, DSD and DIGO. Two of these agencies, ONA and DIO, are assessment agencies; the others are collection agencies. Whether one or the other, all demand high analytical and technical skills and a great degree of professionalism for them to serve their cause. The work is often more art than science and, in a dynamic regional and international environment, the challenges of timeliness, useful insight and accuracy are often immense.</para>
<para>Despite these challenges, Mr Flood concludes that for the most part Australia’s intelligence agencies are performing their duties very effectively. He notes that they represent a potent capability for government. He notes that they have adapted well to the new challenges of contemporary international affairs and, particularly importantly I think, he notes that they remain independent of political influence. Nothing is more potentially corrupting of an intelligence service than the danger that it may fall prey to the expectations of its political masters. I think Mr Flood was very reassuring by underlining the point that these agencies remain independent of that political influence.</para>
<para>Nevertheless, he remarks that he believes that they can do better. To that end, he has recommended a range of reforms to enhance their effectiveness. The most significant of these recommendations is that the number of ONA staff be doubled and that there be a substantial increase in its funding. I note that the government has accepted this recommendation fully. Indeed, the government has accepted all of the Flood recommendations, but for one or two of relative unimportance. It has agreed to most of the reforms recommended by the other inquiries.</para>
<para>In the time available, I would like to comment on three broad issues raised by the bill and by the inquiries that gave rise to it. The first of these is in relation to legislative oversight. The Flood inquiry recommended that all Australia’s intelligence agencies be subject to the scrutiny of the parliamentary joint committee and that its name be changed to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to reflect the widened mandate. The effect of this reform would be to bring ONA, DIO and DIGO under the committee’s remit for the first time. This is an important reform and one I greatly welcome. It will increase the workload of the committee, but provision is being made in the bill for an extension of the number of committee members, and I think that will adequately meet the challenges the committee will now face with its expanded workload.</para>
<para>There is a world-wide trend in the parliamentary democracies, evident in places like the United Kingdom and Canada, for agencies to be subject to greater public scrutiny. This process is increasingly important, I think, particularly at a time—as Senator Stott Despoja has remarked—when governments are increasingly keen to increase the powers of some agencies to take steps which may well impinge upon citizens’ privacy and civil rights. The reforms intended by the bill will enhance the committee’s important role and will reinforce Australia’s place, I think, at the forefront of international trends to improve procedures for parliamentary oversight.</para>
<para>One place where oversight is more thorough than it is in Australia is, of course, the United States. But this is a very different jurisdiction, where very different kinds of constitutional arrangements apply, and I think it would be highly unrealistic to consider the possibility that the committee might extend its powers in quite the same way as committees do within the United States Congress.</para>
<para>As strong as it is, however, there are some shortcomings in the oversight process, and mention is made of this in the committee’s 2003-04 annual report. One matter relates to questions of definition and another to the presentation of the Defence Signals Directorate’s budget. There are other mentions in relation to the intelligence agency’s report. The committee is quite frank when it remarks that these limitations affect its capacity to work effectively. I would encourage the government to respond positively to the changes the committee requests.</para>
<para>Overall, however, Australia’s experience of legislative oversight is, I think, very positive. So far, the committee’s history has been one of making a very responsible contribution to improving public policy and, I think most importantly, this contribution has been made on a cooperative, bipartisan basis. The committee deserves encouragement for the continuation of this work from both inside and outside the parliament, and I would encourage members of the committee to seek ways in which this can be done responsibly—consistent with the unique demands that their position places upon them.</para>
<para>The second broad issue that I would like to address is the matter of long-term strategic analysis. The Flood report is replete with references to the serious decline in the resources devoted to this important facet of intelligence. On page 16, for example, the report refers to the loss of diplomatic reporting capability within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and, later, to ONA’s relative neglect of this form of analysis under pressure of other priorities.</para>
<para>The report points out that the Defence Intelligence Organisation has moved into this area of analysis, to the detriment of its primary responsibility—strategic intelligence analysis for the ADF. I share Mr Flood’s concern over this matter. Long-term strategic analysis is a critical element of intelligence, and running it down has, potentially, very serious consequences for the nation. So I share Mr Flood’s concern but, regrettably, I am not entirely confident that he has found the best solution to overcome it. Essentially, he recommends that DIO pare back its strategic reporting and analysis to matters directly related to the military and defence needs of the ADF. Secondly, he suggests that ONA be required to take the matter of long-term strategic analysis more seriously and devote more resources to the task. Thirdly, he rejects the proposal apparently made by one of his interlocutors during the course of his inquiry that DFAT be given greater resources to take on this strategic role.</para>
<para>I have the greatest respect for Mr Flood. He has had a distinguished career in foreign affairs and elsewhere. He has a great deal of professional experience, and I value his judgment—in fact, I respect it greatly. But I believe his view of this matter is perhaps ill advised. As assessment agencies, there is, of course, an obvious need for DIO and ONA to undertake strategic analysis that feeds directly into defence reviews, white papers, strategic policy statements and the like. But there is another need, and that is the national requirement for there to be an agency that will be an independent source of advice, providing a strategic view of longer-term global trends that may have an impact on Australia’s security and foreign policy interests.</para>
<para>The advice should cover fields as broad as strategy, politics, economics, science and technology, the environment and the law. The key question is how developments in these areas are going to intersect with, and perhaps shape, the national strategic goals and ambitions of Australia and how they will impact on our national interests—not today, not tomorrow, but five or 10 years down the track. The analysis must remain policy focused and it has to be contestable among other agencies. It is the type of strategic analysis that requires comprehensive treatment of complex and often distant trends—not in the few succinct paragraphs or pages of the typical ONA briefing, but at a deliberative length. It is the kind of work that, at times, might easily benefit from the sharing of ideas with outsiders in the public domain.</para>
<para>As the Flood report notes, ONA has tended to depreciate the value of this kind of analysis in recent years. Its recent institutional culture has inclined towards the production of short, focused forms of analysis. These are in the form of current intelligence reports, current assessments, watch reports, warning reports and the like. They are assessments which reflect a short-term or a more immediate policy challenge—perhaps in response to a specific ministerial request, or as part of a standard, regular briefing. Secrecy and confidentiality are, rightly, an elemental and organic part of the work.</para>
<para>The qualities of these reports help to underpin the universally high regard in which ONA’s analytical capabilities are held. They are the foundation of the professionalism with which it fulfils its primary mandate. The preparation of periodic longer term strategic assessments that are supposed to be part of ONA’s mandate has been largely overlooked. This suggests, to me at least, a number of things: overwork and other priorities, or perhaps a strong institutional culture of doing one form of analysis over another.</para>
<para>Rather than leave all strategic assessments with ONA, I believe a more satisfactory solution would be to establish a relatively small agency specifically mandated to undertake long-term strategic analysis and situated in a completely separate portfolio, perhaps DFAT. There it would be free of the constraints that have inhibited ONA’s capacity to undertake the work. The new agency would develop its own innovative techniques of analysis, establish a research agenda independent of the tyranny of the short term, have easy access to the richness of DFAT’s global diplomatic reporting, subject its work to the contestability of other agencies and comfortably draw in the expertise of knowledgeable outsiders as circumstances demand. There are numerous models around the world on which to base this kind of agency.</para>
<para>I acknowledge that agencies can adapt to new challenges. ONA could well change in a way that exhibits the confidence that Mr Flood has shown in it. I will certainly watch developments with interest. But I must say I am apprehensive about it being able to make those changes and I think we probably need to rethink that particular element of the proposal.</para>
<para>The third issue I would like to raise quickly relates to the matter of the public and outside experts. There are numerous places in the Flood report where it refers to the potential for value adding to intelligence and national security assessments through greater agency contact with the public and outside experts. This is an observation that I believe should be taken seriously. Most of these agencies have a very poor record of outside contact. They are loath to engage the public and particularly academe, where experts may reside. I realise that going to outsiders is not easy for agencies, whose natural working culture is secrecy and whose workload deadlines make severe demands on time. Of course, public engagement often carries some risks, though governments almost always overstate them. But we have an extraordinary abundance of knowledge and expertise in our universities, in think tanks, in professional associations and elsewhere. Much of this expertise is focused on the Asia-Pacific region, where our national security interests are concentrated. A great deal of the expertise is actually policy oriented.</para>
<para>If these resources were more effectively employed by government, they could be of immense value to the development of national security policy. They would add knowledge and insight and, I think, just as importantly, a further measure of contestability to agency analysis. Given the intelligence shortcomings over Iraq, this is perhaps a critical requirement for the future.</para>
<para>In the context of establishing more sustained and systematic interaction and dialogue between governments and academe, I welcome an initiative recently undertaken by the ANU and Griffith University to establish the Australian Council of Strategic Studies. One of the roles of the council is to engage regularly with government on topics of mutual interest. I understand that several roundtable discussions have already taken place and that all parties, including participants from several government agencies, have regarded them as very valuable encounters and they promise a great deal of contact in the future. This kind of activity highlights the point that, if agency officials and analysts can be stirred from their comfort zones within government, there are considerable rewards to be had. Academics, generally speaking and in my experience, are keen and enthusiastic about making a contribution.</para>
<para>This bill will secure a long overdue renovation of Australia’s intelligence services. As Mr Flood points out, generally the nation is well served by the dedication and professionalism of existing staff. They often work in difficult circumstances and in difficult environments. The changes in the bill will enhance agencies’ effectiveness. We need that because the challenges of securing our national interest in the current international environment will not diminish; if anything, they are likely to intensify in the future.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise to speak to the <inline ref="S466">Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. Can I say at the outset that I am disappointed that Senator Ray is unable to contribute to this debate, but it is not his fault. As a member of the parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD he makes an enormous contribution because of his experience in this field, having been an inaugural or foundation member in the reformation of that committee. As a former defence minister and as someone who is now in opposition he understands much better than many others the role of the committee—and the role that members who have oversight of the intelligence operations in this country are required to play. While this not a reflection on Senator Mark Bishop, who is here as shadow minister, can I say that Senator Ray’s vast experience in this field had a lot to do with the presentation of the report put down by the joint committee after looking into this bill, which we were asked to do by the Senate.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This report follows a long line of unanimous reports from the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. I doubt that there are any other committees in this Senate or in this parliament that can say that, throughout their duration, they have presented to the parliament nothing but unanimous reports. The fact that this committee has done so is a fair indication of the cooperation and bipartisanship of both opposition and government members in looking at this very important issue of the intelligence operations, the intelligence community and the government agencies that are involved in the collection of intelligence throughout Australia. It is also an indication of the fact that, over that long period of time, we have always come to an agreement and presented unanimous reports. It does not mean that every member on the committee is enthusiastic about every recommendation that is made, but we have consensus on every occasion that this is a generally held view amongst the committee and we feel that it is in the interest of the Australian parliament and the Australian people that we as an oversight committee present to this parliament unanimous reports wherever possible—and we have always done that.</para>
<para>Much has been said about the membership of the committee and the role that it plays. It may have been mentioned by Senator Bishop and was certainly mentioned by Senator Stott Despoja. We have contact with a number of intelligence committees around the world. We meet with them whenever they visit Australia or occasionally when there are conferences that are held world wide. They vary in the composition and the nature of the role that they play. The intelligence committee that we have had the most contact with is the British intelligence committee. The difference between the role of that committee and our committee is that every member of the British intelligence committee is security-cleared. They have a top vetting, are security-cleared and have access to raw intelligence which they can then use in determinations at any future stage when they have inquiries into any specific matters, like the Iraq WMD inquiries, for instance.</para>
<para>We do not do that in the Australian parliament. We do not have security clearances, so as members of the committee we do not have access to raw intelligence. I say that it is the view amongst members of the committee that we do not want to have access to raw intelligence, because we believe that that is the role of the assessment agencies. It is the role of somebody independent and outside of the political system to be able to provide advice that they have been able to form from the information supplied to them by intelligence agencies. Unlike ONA, DIO and those organisations which see raw intelligence, we as members of the committee do not. I repeat that it is the view of the committee that we do not want to, because that would not only put an added responsibility onto the committee but would also mean that there would be different and conflicting assessments being made by the analysts within the intelligence community and members of parliament, particularly where there are opposition and government members involved. We think that the oversight that we have at present, which is set down in legislation, is the way that we would like it to be, and we are certain that there is no inclination from any members of the committee to change our system to one like the British intelligence committee where they all have top vetting and security clearances.</para>
<para>The Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD has been very busy in the last six months because, apart from this bill, a review of part III division 3 of the ASIO Act and a number of reviews of terrorist listings that have taken place, it has had a very heavy workload. I have been the acting chair of this committee in the absence of the chair, the Hon. David Jull, who we hope will be back soon. I certainly hope he will be back soon because it would relieve me of one of my responsibilities as chair. The committee has been very active.</para>
<para>I want to say two things about our relationship with the intelligence organisations that we currently have the oversight of, particularly ASIO, ASIS and DSD, and particularly our relationship with these organisations during Dennis Richardson’s period as the head of ASIO. Of course, he has only recently gone, so we have only just commenced work with the new Director-General of ASIO. I think that the information that he and others have supplied to the committee has on many occasions been over and above the requirements under the act. Dennis Richardson, the head of ASIS and others have taken the committee into their confidence and supplied us with information which is probably outside of the area in which they are required to supply us in order for us to make a much better informed determination on some of the issues that we have to report to this parliament on. We appreciate that. I am quite sure that, while the committee continues to have never leaked any information and while the organisations have confidence in the committee, that sort of arrangement will apply. I know that I and all the other members of the committee have appreciated the way in which the heads of those various agencies have taken the committee into their confidence.</para>
<para>I noticed that Senator Stott Despoja talked about a number of things that were added to what is contained in this bill. She talked about the Flood inquiry not being broad enough and then got into the stage of a human rights bill and a whole range of other things. The Flood inquiry was very helpful to us when we were conducting our own inquiry into changes that should be made to the Intelligence Services Act. It is pleasing that practically all of those recommendations have been taken up by the government.</para>
<para>A number of recommendations which are quite important to the running of the committee have been taken up. One is the expansion of the committee to nine people. One of the real problems that we have had with a committee of seven arises when one or two members cannot attend for various reasons, as happens because senators in particular are on a number of committees. Senator Ray was the only opposition senator on the committee. We had no provision to set up subcommittees and there was no provision in the original act for a deputy chair of the committee. I raise that issue in relation to the deputy chair because Senator Stott Despoja was quite critical of the fact that the bill, in its initial form, recommended that a government member be deputy chair as well as having a government member as chair. The committee in its report identified that this is an area in which we thought there should be some change. As happened in Mr Jull’s absence, a government member was then elected as acting chair of the committee until his return.</para>
<para>I can understand the reluctance of the government, in the case of a committee where the numbers are so finely balanced, to have a situation develop where the government does not have the numbers on that committee purely because of the absence through illness or otherwise of the chair. There have always been four government members and three opposition members on that committee up until this stage, and so we thought a way around that, which I am pleased to say the government has taken up and incorporated, is to appoint a deputy chair from the opposition. But if the chair is absent when a vote might be required or for a prolonged period—I think the amendment talks about an absence of more than a month—then the committee shall appoint a member of the government as an acting chair. I think it is an important change because for all other meetings I see absolutely no reason at all why an opposition member should not be a deputy chair of that committee. So that is what the government is proposing and it has taken up the recommendation that was put in our report where we said:</para>
<quote>
<para>If the Chair is not present at a deliberative meeting—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words, one where a vote was taken—and I have never been at a meeting where we have had a vote. We have never got to the stage of ever voting on issues in this committee because, as I said, we have always through consensus come up with unanimous reports. The report says:</para>
<quote>
<para>If the Chair is not present at a deliberative meeting of the Committee or is absent for a prolonged period, the members present are to appoint a Government member to preside and the member so appointed may exercise, in relation to the meeting, any of the powers of the Chair.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The government in its wisdom has seen fit to define that a bit more clearly and they have suggested that instead of a deliberative meeting they have called it ‘a meeting where a vote is being taken’ and instead of saying for a prolonged period they have said ‘for a period of one month’. I think it is a very good compromise and I am very pleased that they took up the unanimous recommendation that we made as a committee.</para>
<para>Senator Stott Despoja also raised the issue of membership of the committee and that there should be a crossbench member on the committee. That is an issue that was actually discussed and, like many committees in this parliament, the view held by all members was that the membership of the intelligence services committee should reflect the numbers in the parliament. As it is a joint committee, which means that there are both members of the House of Representatives and the Senate on this committee, even by increasing it to nine, the numbers of minor parties or Independents were not great enough to warrant proportionately membership of this committee. Of the 226 members I think it is in the parliament, it means that there would be a ratio when there are nine on it of something like one to every 25 or 26 members, and there are not nearly that many crossbench or Independent members combined in both houses.</para>
<para>Senator Bishop raised in his initial contribution the issue that was raised in one of our reports about access to classified annual reports. This is a very difficult issue for the committee and one where there was not as strong a feeling amongst some members as there was amongst others, but it was included in one of our reports as a comment. One of the problems in having access to classified reports comes down to the fact of whether or not we are security cleared. In some cases, comment and issues that are raised that are classified and in the classified annual report means that sometimes it is difficult for intelligence agencies to fully inform those people to whom the classified report has to go of all the information if they know it is going to be more widely read. While I appreciate Senator Bishop’s point of view and what he raised in his opening remarks, I think that there is not a strong feeling about this amongst our committee.</para>
<para>As I said earlier in my contribution, overall the committee is very happy with the cooperation that it receives from those people who are in charge of the various government intelligence agencies. If there was a limitation and we felt that we were not getting information that we should be getting under the statute of the act, then I am quite sure that someone on the committee would say so. Sometimes it takes a bit longer to get information than we would like, but in general terms each of the agencies has always provided information on the sorts of issues that we have raised.</para>
<para>I want to also make specific comment on the ministers involved to whom the agencies are responsible. In relation to the Attorney-General and the defence minister, we have had enormous cooperation when we have asked for the appearance of people who in one case were outside of our bailiwick. They were not covered by the ASIO, ASIS and DSD agencies and we were inquiring into a bill and some other things. When we had the WMD inquiry the minister made available people who under the act were not necessarily required to come and give us evidence. We are very appreciative of the cooperation we have had from both the AG and from the defence minister in particular in relation to people we could talk to to try and gather as much information as possible to be able to make the most well informed decision in reporting to this parliament. It is important that when we do report to the parliament we do so with as much information and knowledge as we possibly can.</para>
<para>The review that we did as a committee on this bill was done mostly on papers that were presented to us. We have been through so many inquiries in recent times over a whole range of issues. We had the agencies concerned come and talk to us because we have increased the oversight of the committee to include DIGO, ONA and—I have to remember the other one; I have to get this right. It now covers those six agencies rather than the five that we have always—</para>

<para>—Thank you, Senator Brown. I thought it was the DIO originally but thank you for the help. I needed it. DIO, DIGO and ONA are now included so that there are six agencies which the committee now has oversight of. I think it is important because it does put all the agencies that are currently involved with our intelligence operations under the one committee oversight. We are very pleased that, having gone through the process of reviewing the act and the recommendations of the Flood report and then reporting to the parliament, the recommendations that we have included in here have, by and large, been accepted in the manner in which they were presented by the committee.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I also thank the committee staff for the enormous amount of work that they have done over the past six months. It is a tremendous load. The staff, as can be expected, are security cleared. A couple of staff left during the period in which we were working on both this bill and some other work, which put an enormous workload on the secretary, Margaret Swieringa, and others who were helping her—some on short-term contracts with security clearance. With the hours that they spent going through papers and preparing the reports, sometimes with two reports going at the same time, I think they have done an outstanding job. Were we to have had a bit of a lull in the number of inquiries, the amount of legislation and the reviewing of listings that we have had in the last six months, I am sure they would appreciate it. But I do want to place on record in the parliament the outstanding commitment that they made to this committee and the enormous amount of reading and the workload that they had to endure to make sure that we could present these reports to the parliament on time.</para>
<para>I commend this bill to the Senate. I think it makes some very important changes to the Intelligence Services Act. I am very pleased that the government has seen fit to support many of the changes that we as a committee recommended.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I will not speak for my full time on the <inline ref="S466">Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> but I do think it is appropriate to take the opportunity to put a few further comments on the record from the point of view of the Democrats. The bill in itself, in as much as it deals with matters relating to the activities and role of the parliamentary committee that oversees intelligence, is understandable and makes some reasonable changes, although I think some of the specifics of those can still do with some further elaboration in the committee stage.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But I do think we need to recognise that, whilst there is a parliamentary committee that oversees the activities of various intelligence agencies, its ability to properly or fully monitor the activities of the intelligence agencies only goes so far. The fact is that it can only go so far. Intelligence is one of those areas where it is clearly not possible to have the same degree of open scrutiny that you have and need in most other areas of the activities of government. That is simply a reality of the nature of intelligence. I believe we can do better at scrutinising it. In as much as the committee can do better with that then that is good. But the fact is that it is impossible to fully scrutinise intelligence matters in the way that can be done for other areas of government activity.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, intelligence is also an area which can provide some of the most wide-ranging powers that government officials can undertake that affect Australians and, indeed, everybody else. This difficult-to-resolve dilemma creates a fundamental situation where, in this area more than anything else, you have to rely on trust. I think the committee members, as far as I know them, are capable people. Whilst my political views are a fairly long way removed from Senator Ferguson’s and Senator Ray’s, I do have a fair degree of respect for their ability and integrity and the way they approach their job. I do not in any way seek to reflect on the abilities or work of the committee. I am not sure who the other Senate member is but certainly I know Senator Ferguson and Senator Ray are on that committee.</para>
<para>But the fact is the committee can only do so much. You do have to rely on trust and Australians have to rely on trust in the area of intelligence. I am afraid to say that the evidence is clear that this government cannot be trusted. Why do we know that this government cannot be trusted not to misuse its powers? Because it already has form. It already has a record of grossly misusing its powers. Part of the genesis of some of the changes that have come through in this bill stems back to what this government did and what intelligence agencies did with regard to the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> over four years ago. It needs to often be put on the record, so that Australians do not forget—because it is easy to forget—that this government used intelligence agencies to monitor activities of Australians and non-Australians, and monitored communications almost certainly with a foreign government and certainly with foreign companies that owned the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>. It quite clearly used that information for political purposes.</para>
<para>It is a matter of public record that lawyers who were seeking to contact refugees on that ship had their communications monitored. It is almost certain that lawyers for the company communicating with the company and with the ship were monitored by intelligence agencies and reports were passed on to government. Clearly, when you have that sort of fundamental breach of legal professional privilege around stuff that could not in any way be seen as a threat to national security, it shows a government that is willing to use its powers and its intelligence agencies for political purposes.</para>
<para>The fact that a report was done by Mr Blick later the next year, in 2002—a report which was not comprehensive in its scope and was also not ever publicly released in its totality—should not be used to negate the fact that intelligence was misused. The bits of Mr Blick’s report that were made public clearly indicated that some Australians were inappropriately monitored by various security agencies. But, frankly, for me, it is not just a matter of whether or not those agencies acted within their legal powers because, particularly given many of the changes since and many of the changes that have now been floated by state as well as federal governments, they probably will have more and more of those powers; it is what the information is used for and whether Australians can be confident or anybody can be confident—Australians and non-Australians—that security agencies will not be used for political purposes. It is quite possible that they can do that within the law as it currently stands. We really have to rely on governments not to abuse the power that they are given through intelligence laws.</para>
<para>It does have to be re-emphasised and restated that the government have shown that they are willing to misuse information from intelligence agencies for political purposes. I will not go into the side issue of the debate around the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> and the way this government treated and still treats refugees, asylum seekers and a whole range of other people who come under the scope of the Migration Act, because that is moving away from the purpose and the focus of this legislation. But if people are concerned about whether this government can be trusted with wide-ranging powers, police and intelligence powers, and to not misuse them for political purposes, the record already shows that they have misused their powers. They are quite willing and prepared to do so for clearly political purposes, even in cases involving people and situations that are not a security threat to Australia at all. That is why there is such a degree of apprehension amongst many in the Australian community about further intelligence laws and further so-called security laws, because we know we are giving them to people who cannot be trusted to not misuse them for political purposes.</para>
<para>I have to take the opportunity as a Queensland senator to express my extreme disappointment in the Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie, and his willingness to go along with further surrendering our freedoms and further weakening our democracy. Mr Beattie, of all people—he grew up as I did in the Bjelke-Petersen era—knows what happens when police agencies and intelligence agencies are misused for political purposes. He knows how innocent lives are damaged and destroyed as a result of the misuse of police powers. He also knows how easy it is for governments, whether state or federal, to make that subtle transition to deeming opponents of the government by definition to be opponents of the country or opponents of the state. We are seeing more and more signs of that old attitude reappearing in regard to intelligence agencies as well. Mr Beattie, who specifically acknowledged that the proposed changes coming up are draconian, to use his own words, somehow thinks that they are nonetheless necessary—powers that Mr Bjelke-Petersen back in the 1980s would have gone to any lengths to give himself.</para>
<para>Broader issues surrounding intelligence have to be raised here; issues that are broader than just the scope of this legislation. The parliamentary committee, as far as I can tell looking from outside the committee, seems to do a fairly good job. The people whom I know on the committee are quite capable, committed and genuine. However, there is a genuine concern that the Democrats have long expressed about the lack of crossbench representation on the committee. I take Senator Ferguson’s point about the composition of the parliament and the maths of it, and he is right if you look at it proportionately. I think there are 12 non-major party MPs in the federal parliament. Proportionately, that would not entitle you to a position, even if you expanded the committee to nine. I can certainly also assure the government that I am not looking for any more committees to go on; I have got more than I can manage as it is. The point about this issue is that it is important for legislators to be confident in an area that relies on trust. It is important that people from as wide a range of viewpoints as possible feel that confidence.</para>
<para>I think the lack of crossbench minor party representation, or whatever you want to call it, on the parliamentary committee is a problem. I know Senator Ray has acknowledged this in the past as well. He also made the same point that Senator Ferguson made. They are valid arguments. But, as I said at the start, this is a unique area. Because of its uniqueness, I think there is an extra argument to be put for a range of views and formal representation from as wide a group of people as possible and, therefore, I would be quite willing to countenance some other compensatory measures to reduce crossbench representation on other committees, if that assisted the situation. I think this is a valid point that should not be brushed aside simply by resorting to mathematics, calculators and percentages. This issue is perhaps more important than most. Having said that, you could have wide and fulsome representation on that committee, but I do not think it is ever going to be in a position to guarantee that the activities of intelligence agencies are not misused for political purposes.</para>
<para>I am particularly concerned about the scope, including within this bill, for protections that apply to permanent residents within Australia not to apply to others within Australia. I say this from a migration perspective. I very strongly support a large migration intake, but we need to acknowledge that for a number of years now the traditional migration intake—that is, permanent residents—which is currently quite large by historical standards is still dwarfed by the much larger number of people who come here as temporary residents. Economically and socially, as a direct consequence of government policy, we have dramatically expanded the number of people who arrive in Australia as temporary residents. Many of them go on to become permanent residents, but the majority do not. They are students and they are business people in particular. Of course, we have the disgrace of refugees who are still stuck on temporary visas. None of those people have the protections that apply in this legislation to permanent residents.</para>
<para>I particularly single out refugees on temporary protection visas because of the point I made earlier—that those people have already been witness to and part of gross misuse of intelligence powers for political purposes. They are people who, in many cases, have fled extremely tyrannical regimes and have already been victims of political persecution. They, more than anyone else, should be entitled to feel they have some degree of protection under Australian law from being subjected, once again, to misuse of the powers of police and intelligence agencies.</para>
<para>For those who want to look at this issue in further detail—who do not just want to take my word for the statements I have made about the government’s willingness to misuse its powers under the law and, I would argue, outside the law—I recommend they read the book <inline font-style="italic">Dark Victory</inline> by Marian Wilkinson and David Marr. I think it is one of the best and most comprehensive outlines detailing what happened through the period of the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> and afterwards. It has a political partisan perspective, but the specific details and facts it contains are very shocking and should continually be put back on the record to remind Australians of the lengths this government is willing to go to in abusing its powers for political purposes and the people it is willing to damage along the way if it thinks there is a political advantage to it. We should not forget those abuses of powers. Otherwise, we are leaving ourselves wide open for it to happen again.</para>

<para>—The Australian Greens support the <inline ref="S466">Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> but feel it should have gone a lot further in guaranteeing that the importance of the intelligence services to our democratic society is in enhancing the security of the country—but not at the expense of our democracy and our liberties.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the committee stage of the bill I will ask questions about the inspector-general’s office, including the ability of the inspector-general to undertake the current watchdog role over security agencies in the country, let alone—on the face of it—the doubling of that job now that three other agencies which work primarily outside the country are to be taken into the inspector-general’s bailiwick. I understand the office has four staff. I will find out whether or not that is the case in the committee stage. We see that this bill is revenue neutral. It does not give any further facility to the inspector-general’s office, and it is patently obvious that it should.</para>
<para>The second point of concern is the independence of the Office of the Inspector-General. The inspector-general is appointed by the Prime Minister, not by the parliament. It is of concern that that is the case. It should be a proper statutory appointment with a review by the parliament. The question that again arises is: who watches over the watchdog? We have a committee, which has been talked about in the speeches in this second reading debate, but it should be a matter for discussion whether, for example, we ought not have an independent review mechanism of the inspector-general’s role by eminent citizens. Jurists, for example, could have matters referred to them.</para>
<para>The very first sentence of the second reading speech of the Minister for Justice and Customs reads:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 will assist in strengthening the contribution of sound intelligence to government decision making and operations.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is well and good, but in that rests the kernel of concern that I have. This is about strengthening the government’s decision making and operations. Senator Bartlett, who spoke before me, raised the concern that the intelligence agencies can become, more and more, operations for the government rather than for the country, for the nation—and that means rather than for the parliament. There is little reference indeed to the ability for parliamentary scrutiny outside of the designated committee.</para>
<para>I note that Senator Stott-Despoja’s proposal that there be a committee person who is not from the two big parties was given short shrift by Senator Ferguson in his contribution. He said that there are not enough members of parliament on the crossbenches or amongst the Independents in the House of Representatives to warrant that. That is a fault of the electoral system. There are certainly enough voters who support alternatives to the coalition or the Labor Party to warrant a representative of those voters being on this committee.</para>
<para>Senator Trood said—or used words to this effect—‘I think it would be quite inappropriate for us to give the committee the same powers as those in the United States and elsewhere.’ Really? I think that, in the absence of a bill of rights in this country and in the absence of a constitutional backup for the rights of citizens, we have an even greater need to be able to scrutinise the intelligence agencies to ensure that they are not cutting across the democratic civil, political, religious and other rights of individuals in our country. The need is even greater.</para>
<para>Since coming into this parliament, I have been consistently concerned that there is a cringe mentality about our intelligence services. I noticed in the contribution from Senator Ferguson we had the view that the committee has been taken into confidence by ASIO. Really? Are we as legislators, as the elected representatives in a democracy, as the absolute power base when it comes to supervising intelligence agencies, not able to inquire into every corner of those intelligence agencies? Of course we must be able to do that. That there are limits under legislation is a concern in itself. Senator Ferguson said that there have not been any leaks from that committee—nor should there be. The trust must be in the elected representatives of parliament to be able to investigate and to know about what is happening in every corner of the intelligence agencies, if our democracy is going to have a capital D and if the parliament is going to be the centre of the watchdog of the electorates and the rights of the people of Australia. We cannot leave that in any area to unelected, and therefore non-responsible, members of the intelligence community. They are there to defend the interests of this country and all of its citizens, but there is a worrying trend—the way the world is not working at the moment—in legislation coming through this parliament and our sister parliaments in similar democracies to hand more powers to people who are not elected against the interests of the electors of our countries.</para>
<para>I am grateful to Senator Milne for a copy of the front page of the United Kingdom’s <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of a week ago, Thursday, 29 September: ‘Heckler, 82, who dared to call Straw a liar is held under terrorist law’. Here we have at the Labour Party conference in Brighton an 82-year-old gentleman, Mr Wolfgang—who left Germany before mid-century to go to Britain—being arrested and issued with a section 44 stop and search form under the Terrorism Act because, in response to the asseveration of Britain’s minister for foreign affairs that Britain was in Iraq ‘for one reason only’, to help the elected Iraqi government, Mr Walter Wolfgang shouted, ‘That’s a lie and you know it.’ He was bundled out and arrested, as was somebody else, who said, ‘Leave that old gentleman alone.’ They were arrested in Britain.</para>
<para>What about Australia? An American citizen came to this country a few weeks ago to talk about peace. He is an activist for peace—very much in the tradition of Martin Luther King and Gandhi. He was summarily arrested and deported for reasons that we were told would not be made public. Then the part of the ASIO assessment that was thought to be inimical to Mr Parkin’s case—that he was a peace activist—was leaked on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper. Anyone who looked carefully at that leak could see that the claims against Mr Parkin were not that he had said anything that was untoward and certainly not that he had done anything that was other than peaceful; it was alleged that he was going to say that people ought to think about putting marbles under police horses at protests or to get people out of an arrest situation. Mr Parkin was going to say in fact nothing of the sort.</para>
<para>Mr Parkin has made it very clear that he hates cruelty to animals and is not in favour of attacking the police going about their duties as required under the laws of a country. But he was given no opportunity to put his case in our country. He was deported from this country on fabricated gossip or deliberate misinformation. Who made the decision to deport him? The Prime Minister of this country did—or at least he endorsed it. It would not have happened without that endorsement and it would not have happened without there being extensive communications between Canberra and Washington. No US citizen would have been deported from this country without the say-so of Washington—that is, the Bush administration.</para>
<para>What needs to be looked at there is that Mr Parkin is a very well-informed and intelligent critic of the Bush administration—not least the Vice President of the United States, Dick Cheney. Why? Amongst other things, Mr Cheney is the former CEO of Halliburton—a mega armaments manufacturer that is making billions of dollars out of armaments and, amongst other things, the invasion and occupation of Iraq. Mr Parkin was a thorn in the side of the Bush-Cheney administration. That is why the Howard government had him arrested and deported. I would be interested to know whether any government member, including the Minister for Defence, who is sitting opposite, can come forward in this parliamentary debate with a cogent other explanation for what happened. What I do know is that the leaking of the trumped-up charges against Mr Parkin which appeared in the newspapers was itself against the law in this country. I stand for the newspaper’s right to print information given to it, but that is very different to the leaking of information for political purposes against a political opponent.</para>
<para>Mr Ben Oquist, who formerly worked for me and now works for Ian Cohen, the Greens member of the upper house in New South Wales, wrote to the inspector-general after these events, calling for an inquiry. He received a letter back yesterday from the inspector-general, as I did, saying that he had referred the matter of that leak to the Australian Federal Police. It is a very serious matter, and one would expect that the Federal Police will have total access to both the Attorney-General’s Department and the Prime Minister’s office and staff to find out exactly who had that information. It is a very serious matter indeed when trumped-up information like that appears in the public arena and it is most likely it came from the office of the chief law maker in this country, the Attorney-General. It is very serious and dangerous, and no stone should be left unturned in bringing to book the people responsible for a process that can only be seen as similar to what happens when trumped-up charges are used to vilify people who stand for democracy and liberty in police states.</para>
<para>Draconian laws are being brought in to defend us from terrorism, and healthy debate takes place in democratic parliaments about the checks and balances involved there. The checks need to be very clear and very adequate, because the erosion of the rights which make our democracy and the liberties which Australians hold dear, and which indeed are incorporated in our Constitution, must not be allowed to proceed lightly. The role of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security is a very important one, but how well is it protecting us from political decisions—or the failure of political decisions—made on the basis of intelligence? Let me draw the Senate’s attention to the case of Chinese diplomat Chen Yonglin, who defected to this democracy of ours a couple of months back but who, in the process, had his whereabouts—or at least the fact that he had defected—implicitly handed across, against the law, to what is a police state: the Chinese government in Beijing.</para>
<para>I have no evidence—and certainly it has not come from the Minister for Foreign Affairs—that the minister did not discuss with the Chinese Ambassador on 2 June, just after Chen Yonglin’s defection, the matter of Chen Yonglin and what would happen to him when he went back to China. In the absence of a denial from Foreign Minister Downer, we must assume that that conversation took place. That is a breach of our nation’s laws, a very serious matter—because it was politically driven, if it happened, because this government did not want to be embarrassed by Mr Chen Yonglin’s defection when it is considering a free trade agreement with China. The ways of a police state are moving in on the ways of an open, free and safe democracy. There are questions there that have been left unanswered and which should be answered by the ministers responsible.</para>
<para>What of the matter of East Timor and that sterling member of our defence forces Lance Collins, who after a lot of travail brought forward what we now know to be the fact that intelligence was denied to the Australian defence forces for a period of time in East Timor because somebody in Canberra decided that it would not go forward? The inspector-general has found that that charge is in fact true. But who was responsible for making that decision in Canberra that our forces in the field would be denied intelligence? If serious charges like that are made, then those responsible for either breaking the law or endangering Australians looking after the interests of this country should be brought to book. But no, they are defended by a secret process and, I must say, by too many parliamentarians who feel it is not our responsibility to go looking into intelligence services. For some reason or other, many parliamentarians feel that this process could not be trusted. It is the essence of a democracy. We have to have the maturity and the responsibility to be able to acquaint ourselves with what is happening in the intelligence services and know that that is information that we have to keep to ourselves. This committee, as Senator Ferguson said, has done that well. There have not been leaks.</para>
<para>I maintain that we have an increasingly political use of intelligence—and I have not got onto the matter of SIEVX, another case where intelligence that we should know about has not been brought to public attention—under a mistaken concept. Intelligence is not the prerogative of government; it is the prerogative of the parliament acting on behalf of and in the best interests of the Australian people.</para>

<para>—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate. The <inline ref="S466">Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> builds on the intelligence services legislation of 2001. It has resulted, firstly, from the advice given by Mr Philip Flood in his 2004 inquiry into Australian intelligence agencies and, secondly, from the government’s review of the operations of that 2001 legislation. Our knowledge has been benefited by the contribution also of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, and we thank them for their contribution to this bill and also for the work that they have done in scrutiny of our intelligence agencies since 2001 under the existing legislation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The bill will enhance and strengthen the existing regime. At a time when good intelligence is possibly as important to Australia as it has ever been, it is an endorsement of the important role that these agencies have in our society. Also, it is an endorsement of the role of parliament in relation to providing an oversight of such organisations. The relationship and the responsibilities of the executive vis-a-vis the parliament in relation to intelligence agencies is not one of absolutes. In some ways this bill reflects a shared responsibility. The government still has the responsibility of governance but the parliament has assumed a right—and we respect that right—to provide a scrutiny of the agencies as well. And that is enhanced and strengthened in this legislation. Beyond the parliament, of course, we have other levels of scrutiny, such as the inspector-general, who is also to be commended for his oversight of the work of these agencies and for the element of public confidence that that adds to this debate. I thank honourable senators for their support for the legislation and I look forward to the committee stage.</para>

Certainly, in my experiences of the office—which includes a number of individuals who have held that office and their accounting to the Senate’s legislation committee in estimates—it seems to me that the inspector-general has been able to fulfil effectively the references that have been referred to him. This certainly gives him increased capability in terms of initiating his own references, but I have no reason to believe that there is any reason of budget or staff that would see him being unable to meet that responsibility.</para>

<para>—I have been advised that he has six staff. I also know that he is supported by others when necessary. Senator Brown made reference to one IGIS inquiry in relation to Mr Collins. I certainly know that other agencies supported the inspector-general in his work on that inquiry. That was a difficult and complex inquiry, and he certainly was able to meet his responsibilities very effectively. So, if that is of any assistance to Senator Brown, I think that illustrates one example where the resources certainly seemed to be adequate for the task.</para>

<para>—On the face of it, when you extend the overview of the inspector-general’s office from three to six agencies, in particular the agencies operating outside of the country, then there should be an increased capacity in the office. It is logical that that should happen. I ask the government to look at that. The minister referred to the Collins outcome whereby the inspector-general did find that intelligence had been denied to the peacekeeping force, the Australians in the field, in East Timor. It is very germane to this. There is not much point in having an inspector-general’s office if findings like that are made and there is no consequent action. I ask the minister: could he tell the committee who was responsible for denying our forces in East Timor the intelligence that they should have had, albeit for a small but critical period of time? What action has been taken not just to ensure that that does not happen again but to ensure that the person or persons responsible have been properly dealt with?</para>

<para>—I do not agree with the minister that the matter has been completed. We have an Australian soldier, an officer, who stood up not just for his country but against an injustice done in an area where it was very difficult to pinpoint who had done it and why it had happened. I ask the minister: has Lance Collins been given the information about how it happened? And what remediation has there been? The minister says that the officials who acted wrongly in terms of that intelligence shutdown on the defence forces in East Timor have been dealt with. I think we ought to have a much clearer explanation of the way in which that dealing-with has been carried out.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>On the other side of the coin, what has the government done to make up for the travail of Lance Collins? Here is a brave and intelligent Australian who went through a lot of pain—one can only imagine it—to insist that a wrong be righted, despite the fact that he was rejected and, as is so often the case with people who make a stand like this, not thought the better of in some quarters. But he was shown to be right. In particular, one has to laud the courage and persistence he showed.</para>
<para>I ask the minister: understanding what Lance Collins has been through, what has the government done to ensure that restitution has been made for his contribution to making sure things are right and effectively his contribution to the safety of Australians in the field, in order to see that this does not happen again—that intelligence is not denied to people who are in the field in the service of this country? What has the government done, if not to reward Mr Collins then at least to make up for all he had to go through to get justice, and not for himself but for the defence forces he has so strongly stood up for? What has the government done there?</para>

<para>—There are several questions from Senator Brown. In relation to the first, I repeat that disciplinary action was taken under the Public Service Act against those who took and implemented the decision to cut off that particular intelligence channel. As Senator Brown would learn if he read the report of Mr Carnell, the intelligence was nevertheless not seen as relevant to the tactical decisions that the force required in East Timor. There were other avenues of intelligence being provided to meet that responsibility. Nevertheless, the circumstances in which the full story was not disclosed to the previous inspector-general, Mr Blick, were particularly disturbing. That is what led to the disciplinary action being taken.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Can I assure the Senate that there will be no further misdemeanours by any public officials? I cannot give that assurance, but I think it is highly unlikely. Our intelligence agencies are very professional. They comprise men and women who are committed to public service. They do a good job for our community. But they know as individuals that, if they make mistakes, there will be consequences associated with those mistakes, and that is what has occurred on this occasion.</para>

<para>—I come back again to the case of officer Lance Collins. We have to take on the minister’s say-so what he says about the unnamed people in the intelligence services who cut off the intelligence. The minister says that on this occasion it fortunately did not make a difference to outcomes in East Timor. One can only imagine circumstances—and they were not in the hands of those who made the wrong decision here—where it would have made a big difference.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Lance Collins had to persist against an earlier finding that the minister has referred to that he did not have a case. Because he was an honourable man and was determined that the truth would not be swept aside, he did persist and he was vindicated. But you do not go through years of fighting against an array of people who effectively say that you are not telling the truth or you are making something up, and you do not persist against an inquiry by an inspector-general which finds that you do not have a case, to the point where there is a reopening of the inquiry and you are found to be right, without very great personal sacrifice being involved. I ask the minister: what has the government done to make up for the personal sacrifices of this honourable and sterling Australian? Is the government not motivated to understand that a man or a woman who makes a stand like that must be not just vindicated but also rewarded to make up for all they have been through? That is very important. What has been done to ensure that officer Collins has had recompense for the honourable stand he took?</para>

<para>—I do not know what sort of recompense Senator Brown is talking about. Certainly officer Collins, as has been referred to, persisted in his belief that the intelligence had been deliberately switched off, and the subsequent inquiry of Mr Carnell found that that was the case. That is not to criticise the previous inquiry. Mr Blick relied on certain statutory declarations and did not believe that he needed to go beyond them. I must say that I do not think that was an unreasonable position to take. But, when the matter was further pursued and the subsequent official, Mr Carnell, did go beyond the statutory declarations and, with the help of Defence, was able to reconstruct the computer records, it was established that this intelligence stream had for a short time been deliberately cut off.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As I said, particularly in relation to the fact that certain officials had not been fully forthcoming in relation to that information—not so much in relation to the decision to terminate that particular intelligence stream, which is a different issue, but in dealing with the inquiry of Mr Blick—disciplinary action was taken under the Public Service Act. Mr Collins certainly was vindicated in that his belief that this intelligence stream was deliberately cut off turned out to be the case. If he had not persisted in that belief, it is true that we may never have found out the truth—we would have simply relied on the statutory declarations that certain officials had given earlier.</para>

<para>—I make a suggestion to the minister through the chair: monetary considerations, recompense, is a matter that the government ought to look at. I am speaking of what I know from the public record, but it would seem to me that there must have been costs involved which ought to be looked at. However, much more important than that—because we are dealing with, again, an honourable person who went through a terrible ordeal—is to insist not just that the truth come out but that Australian service people in the field not be again put in the situation where intelligence operations are cut off for some reason—and there is not a good reason—back here in Canberra. I suggest that the Prime Minister call in officer Collins, shake his hand and thank him for standing up for our country and for the truth. I think the symbolism of that would go a long way towards making us all feel that when people follow through on their honest beliefs in the way he did they will be rewarded.</para>

<para>—That raises the question of how appropriate it is for somebody in the government to release the information about Mr Parkin that was printed in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>. How appropriate is it for selected information—which is on the face of it wrong, vilifying and misrepresentative information—to be given into the public arena by the government? It did not come out of thin air. As I said in the second reading debate, I believe it came from the Attorney-General’s office. Unless we get evidence otherwise—and I should tell the committee that I will be moving for an inquiry by a Senate committee into this affair; and I will put forward a motion on that later in the day—I believe the government does need to give the people of Australia a better explanation of what happened.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Everywhere I have been in the last couple of weeks, people have asked me how, in our democracy, this advocate of peace could be arrested and deported, on nothing more than what we saw leaked from the ASIO assessment—which was inimical to Mr Parkin, which he has denied absolutely, and which is patently false. There may be some other reason there. But if Australians are going to be assured that people in this country who advocate peace, but who might upset either this government or the US government in the process, are not going to be arrested in their beds, the government has got to be more open with the public than this. One thing we do know is this: whatever Mr Scott Parkin may have been alleged to be doing which may have been a threat to the security of this country, publicising it was not going to, of itself, threaten the country.</para>
<para>In the United States there would be a much more open parliamentary process than this. In the United States it is the congress that determines the President’s declaration of war. We do not have that in this country. It is not in our Constitution.</para>

<para>—Senator Stott Despoja does have a private member’s bill on this. I will be supporting that bill, because it is fundamental that, in a democracy, the representatives of the people, not a minority of them in another place—and that means the Prime Minister’s office—declare war and send our Australian fellow citizens into a theatre of war. The parliament should deal with that matter, as is done in the United States.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>We do not have a bill of rights. We are, I think, one of only about two countries—of similar democracies—that do not have a bill of rights. So it is all the more important that, when it appears that a terrible wrong has been done, we do get from government a clear explanation. And this is the place to do it.</para>
<para>As to the arrest and deportation of Scott Parkin, not only is it a terrible wrong but he has got legal costs, and he was flown out of this country ignominiously with a security officer on either side and then sent a bill for that. What a travesty. There are echoes in this of burning witches at the stake. There are certainly echoes of the McCarthy period in the United States. And we must not allow wrongdoing like that—not by Mr Parkin but by those who decided he should be arrested, and that is the Attorney-General, the chief law officer of this country—to go unquestioned. It is not only our right, it is our responsibility to have questions answered on that.</para>
<para>I ask the Minister for Defence, representing the Attorney-General, to give this committee an explanation as to why Mr Parkin was deported from this country. Secondly, I ask him to give an explanation of how that leak of trumped-up information about Mr Parkin went into the public arena—‘from ASIO’, for goodness sake! I do not believe it came from ASIO. I believe it came from the briefing process where ASIO gave the information to the government and the government leaked it. That is very, very dangerous. That has to be questioned and pursued. Who is next if we do not pursue it?</para>
<para>I ask the minister to explain to this committee, here and now, what warranted Mr Parkin being summarily arrested and, without any trial in our country, deported. Yes, he had his visa removed. I ask the minister to explain that to this committee, or explain what is to be done to rectify the travesty, the injustice to Mr Parkin and to the Australian people, in front of our 20 million pairs of eyes, when he made a political decision—not a security decision; it ultimately had to be a political decision by the ministers involved—to have him arrested and deported. Please explain that.</para>

What is the reasoning behind the use of those words, as opposed to adopting the words that were in the committee’s recommendation? My understanding was that, firstly, it was a unanimous recommendation by both government and opposition members and, secondly, the words were worked out in the negotiation process. The government has chosen to accept in substance the recommendation but has a different form of words, and I was wondering if an explanation could be provided to the committee as to the meaning of the words that I identified in the amendment.</para>

<para>—I should say for the benefit of Senator Mark Bishop that, as I understand it, these government amendments have been agreed with Labor members of the committee and came out of discussions subsequent to the joint committee’s recommendations. My recollection is that the original bill provided for the deputy chairman to be a member of the government. It was suggested to the government that that was not in the bipartisan spirit in which this committee operates—and it has operated very effectively in that regard.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As the debate developed, it was then pointed out that on occasions of deliberative meetings leading to votes, and those sorts of situations, it might even be awkward for the opposition to find itself in the deputy chair position and it might well be more appropriate that it be a member of government. Therefore, this compromise set of words was devised which will allow a member of the opposition to be deputy chairman of the committee. But, for a deliberative meeting or where the chair has been away for a significant period of time, a member of government could take that chairing responsibility. I am not sure I am answering the questions that were asked, but I hope this background is useful. I will leave it at that, I think.</para>

<para>—Just briefly, the Democrats support these amendments. You would have heard in my comments in the second reading debate the opposition we had to the notion that the deputy chair be a member of the government—something that I think is unprecedented in relation to a committee of this type but also because the committee structure and its work has relied upon, as Senator Hill pointed out, that bipartisan, happy nature. I get to the point of the spirit of bipartisanship, because I much prefer cross-party committees—and I mean ‘cross’ in a very happy way—that is, allowing for the multiparty democracy that is represented and reflected in this chamber. I think, if we are talking about a significant and appropriate expansion of the mandate and membership of the committee, then those changes should incorporate a member or members of the crossbenches in this place so that we are able to appropriately fulfil our job as legislators, particularly when it comes to matters of national security and/or importance.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am not suggesting that all members and senators obtain classified or national security briefings on occasions—far from it. You would have heard a number of times in the chamber that I have well and truly recognised that we do not always need briefings, nor should we be allowed access to briefings on operational and other security matters. However, I think an important step in the right direction would be to incorporate a crossbench member into this new joint committee. That is a position that the Democrats have held for a long time. I hope the government will consider that. Obviously, that is not going to happen today, but this amendment is certainly a good step as I think it was pretty appalling for the government to scoop up the leadership positions, for lack of a better phrase, on the committee—that is, the positions of deputy chair and chair of the committee.</para>
<para>As for Senator Bishop’s point on leaving out in one case the use of the word ‘deliberative’, I hear Senator Hill’s comments. I do not want to misrepresent you, Minister, but you did suggest that the opposition might be ‘uncomfortable’ in chairing a committee or a meeting of that kind. I think that was your terminology. Just quietly, I am not sure if the opposition would feel that uncomfortable, so I am a bit surprised that Senator Bishop on behalf of his colleagues is not pushing that change of wording a little further. This is certainly a start, because the other proposal was completely outrageous.</para>
<para>Again, I put on record that this committee is a bipartisan committee. That may sound nice and happy, but it is not good enough. It is not good enough when we are talking about important and serious issues to do with this nation’s security and our intelligence services. To exclude from that committee members of minor parties or even Independents and thus the crossbench, is outrageous particularly at a time when Australians are calling for greater accountability and greater scrutiny. If the government is committed to ensuring that there are safeguards and protections in place, particularly with the raft of legislation that it is about to introduce in the name of countering terrorism, then it will include multiparty representation on this committee, otherwise I have no doubt that Australians will continue to be somewhat sceptical about these oversight mechanisms in committees as they currently exist.</para>

<para class="block">I want to place a few remarks on the record with regard to these opposition amendments. As we acknowledged, this bill has been given fairly thorough scrutiny by the joint parliamentary committee, as we would expect, but we do note in passing that the government has chosen to ignore one of the committee’s recommendations on matters arising out of the bill. Accordingly, these amendments seek to implement the committee’s recommendations, particularly with regard to the issue of warrants—hence the amendments that have been circulated in my name.</para>
<para>The first amendment relates to the need to include within the act a definition of the word ‘security’. The opposition believes that the term ‘security’ should have the same meaning as in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. In particular, the definition of security is most relevant in amendment 29 of the bill, which proposes to add a new subsection 11(2AA) in the following terms:</para>
<quote>
<para>After subsection 11(2)</para>
<para>Insert:</para>
<para>(2AA) An agency may communicate incidentally obtained intelligence to appropriate Commonwealth or State authorities or to authorities of other countries approved under paragraph 13(1)(c) if the intelligence relates to the involvement, or likely involvement, by a person in one or more of the following activities:</para>
<para>(a) activities that present a significant risk to a person’s safety;</para>
<para>(b) acting for, or on behalf of, a foreign power;</para>
<para>(c) activities that are a threat to security—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">‘security’ being the keyword there—</para>
<quote>
<para>(d) activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or the movement of goods listed from time to time in the Defence and Strategic Goods List (within the meaning of regulation 13E of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958);</para>
<para>(e) committing a serious crime.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">We believe that leaving that term undefined will potentially give the proposed subsection 11(2AA) unacceptably broad operation. Just as ‘foreign power’ has been defined in terms of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, we think it is similarly appropriate to define the term ‘security’ in terms of that act. This gives the proposed subsection an operation that correlates to the use of equivalent powers by ASIO. Our argument is that it is appropriate in itself, and we note that our reasoning is entirely consistent with the unanimous view of the joint parliamentary committee.</para>
<para>For the benefit of senators interested in this debate, the definition of security in the ASIO Act is as follows:</para>
<quote>
<para>(a) the protection of, and of the people of, the Commonwealth and the several States and Territories from:</para>
<para>(i) espionage;</para>
<para>(ii) sabotage;</para>
<para>(iii) politically motivated violence;</para>
<para>(iv) promotion of communal violence;</para>
<para>(v) attacks on Australia’s defence system; or</para>
<para>(vi) acts of foreign interference;</para>
<para>whether directed from, or committed within, Australia or not; and</para>
<para>(b) the carrying out of Australia’s responsibilities to any foreign country in relation to a matter mentioned in any of the subparagraphs of paragraph (a).</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Incorporating that wording into the intelligence services bill is therefore appropriate.</para>
<para>The second set of amendments concerns the issue of warrants. Our view is that the committee’s views are relevant and ought to be put in the bill to put some limits on the government’s new powers. There was extensive discussion by the committee, and its deliberations are recorded at pages 11 and 12—paragraph 2.27 on page 11 through to para 2.36 at the bottom of page 12. It had been my intent to read those paragraphs into the record, but for the sake of time I would seek leave of the committee to incorporate paras 2.27 up to and including 2.36 on pages 11 and 12 of the parliamentary joint committee report. I seek leave to do that as opposed to reading out the entirety of those two pages.</para>
<para>Leave granted.</para>
<para class="italic">The document read as follows—</para>
<quote>
<list type="decimal-dotted">
<item label="2.">
<para>27    The amendment in Schedule I Item 22, deletes the word “who is overseas” from the current legislation. As a result, ASIS, DIGO and DSD will be required to seek a ministerial authorisation to produce intelligence on an Australian person, whether that person is overseas or in Australia.</para>
</item>
<item label="2.">
<para>28    The ISA defines the functions of ASIS and DSD, and the bill legislates the functions of DIGO (as well as clarifying the roles of ASIS and DSD). For all three agencies, key functions include obtaining ‘intelligence about the capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside Australia’ (paragraphs 6(1)(a) and 7(a) and the proposed 6B(a)). In the case of ASIS, it is also tasked with undertaking ‘such other activities as the responsible Minister directs relating to the capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside Australia.’(paragraph 6(1)(e)).</para>
</item>
<item label="2.">
<para>29    In view of these apparent limitations on the agencies’ legal functions, it was not clear how the responsible Minister could authorise the agencies to undertake activities for the purpose of producing intelligence on Australians irrespective of whether they are inside or outside Australia. Similarly, in the case of ASIS, an issue arose as to ASIS’ power to undertake activities that may have a direct effect on Australians.</para>
</item>
<item label="2.">
<para>30    Schedule I Item 22 suggests that the ISA is already being interpreted to give ASIS and DSD the power to obtain intelligence on Australians inside Australia regarding the capabilities and intentions of persons outside Australia with the consequence that the amendments are needed to give Australians in Australia the same protections as Australians outside Australia.</para>
</item>
<item label="2.">
<para>31    It is relevant to draw attention to an answer given on 21 March 2002 by the Minister for Defence to a question on notice from Senator Chris Evans:</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">To ensure that the privacy of Australians was properly protected irrespective of whether they were overseas or in Australia, my predecessor issued a direction to Director DSD under section 8(1)(b) directing DSD to obtain an authorisation before undertaking any such activities in relation to Australians within Australia. This direction took effect with the date of the introduction of the Act, and had the effect of requiring DSD to afford the same level of protection to all Australian persons regardless of their location.</para>
<list type="decimal-dotted">
<item label="2.">
<para>32    This answer indicates that at present, although protection of Australians inside Australia is not specifically legislated, there is in fact a ministerial direction under section 8(1) (b), which would enable the production of intelligence on Australians in Australia.</para>
</item>
<item label="2.">
<para>33    In the case of Australians outside Australia, the ISA provides that before any of the agencies can conduct an investigation, the Minister responsible must, pursuant to S8(1), require the agency to obtain Ministerial authorisation for the investigation.</para>
</item>
<item label="2.">
<para>34    Before issuing an authorisation the Minister must be satisfied that the Australian to be investigated is, or is likely to be, involved in one of the following categories:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>activities that present a significant risk to a person’s safety;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>acting for, or on behalf of, a foreign power;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>activities that are a threat to security;</para>

<item>
<para>activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or the movement of goods listed from time to time in the Defence and Strategic Goods List; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>committing a serious crime.</para>
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item label="2.">
<para>35    The amendment is intended to have the effect of protecting Australians in Australia in the same way as the current legislation protects Australians who are overseas.</para>
</item>
<item label="2.">
<para>36    The Committee notes it is the case that the foreign intelligence gathering agencies can currently be authorised to obtain intelligence on Australians inside Australia regarding the capabilities and intentions of persons outside Australia. The Committee approves the proposed amendment at Item 22, but requests additional provisions, to ensure consistency in the requirements on all agencies, domestic or foreign intelligence gathering.</para>

<para>—The opposition adopts the material contained in those paras as our reasons in support of the argument for all of the amendments relating to the warrants in amendments (2) through (7) before the chair. I note that the committee recommends that, as the regime moves from ministerial direction to legislated ministerial authority as proposed in item 22, it should generally replicate the provisions of and have identical authorisation provisions to those applied to ASIO.</para>

<para>Finally, we put on the record that we also propose an additional amendment to minimise the prospect of misuse of incidentally obtained intelligence—that is the last amendment on the sheet in the name of the opposition before the chair. The reasons for this are self-explanatory and straightforward. We simply believe that information not relevant and incidental to any investigation should be disposed of.</para>

<para>—I would not want to blame your leader for interrupting my thought process. Instead, I will say that I will assume that Senator Bishop took up the position that is well known on this matter, reflected in his amendments, which is an alternative way of looking at the system of authorisations and approvals. These alternatives were discussed with members of the committee and they have been discussed with members of the opposition. I think I can fairly say that in the development of this bill to date there has been a cooperative approach. I respect the view of the Labor Party that the Attorney-General’s approvals should be required in relation to authorisations of the Defence intelligence agencies.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Whilst I respect that view, the government does not agree with it. There are responsibilities that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has in relation to ASIS. There are responsibilities that the Attorney-General has in relation to ASIO. In relation to Defence Intelligence Organisation, Defence Signals Directorate and DIGO, the imagery organisation of Defence, the governance responsibilities are those of the Minister for Defence. The safeguard is that these intercepts cannot occur and foreign intelligence cannot be sought in the circumstance of Australian citizens without the authority of the minister, and this is made absolutely clear and unambiguous in the bill that is before the Senate.</para>
<para>There has been some criticism which I also respect of the 2001 legislation, which did not leave the matter as clear as some would like, even though by means of a directive the authority of the minister has been required for all such collections. But I do not see any room to argue that this bill could be criticised in the same terms. It makes it absolutely explicit that the authority of the Minister for Defence will be required before any such collection is undertaken. The bill sets out and the legislative background, the 2001 legislation, sets out the circumstances in which such collection is valid and the limited circumstances in which it can be progressed. If you add together the legislative restraints, the professionalism of the Public Service, the responsibility of the executive and the overall scrutiny of the Inspector-General, I think it is a very safe system.</para>

<para>—I have heard the minister describe these amendments put forward by the opposition as an alternative. I do not think they are necessarily an alternative. What I see before us in these amendments are some quite clear specifications in the case of warrants for the issuing and the contents of warrants. I have heard the minister’s comments in response to the amendments and Senator Bishop’s query but I have not heard any specific reason or any specific concern about any of the contents in the amendments before us—that is, if we are using the word ‘safeguard’ or, to use the minister’s terminology, ‘protections’, there is no harm that I see. In fact, I think it is an improvement on the legislation for us to specify under what circumstances the issuing takes place and again to specify the content.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>If it is a completely different perspective—that is, the government does not want to add any more specifications—that is one thing, but what is wrong with the specifications before us? I have not heard any examples from the minister as to why the amendments before us—for example, amendment (4)—would inhibit in any way the responsibilities and the functions of the ministers to whom he referred. I see these as good steps forward in providing some protections and some safeguards. It is not perfect but it is certainly better. I am just wondering why the government is rejecting these amendments.</para>

<para>—My argument is that the safeguards that are provided in the 2001 legislation and enhanced and clarified by these amendments are more than adequate to meet the task. What the opposition is doing, in my view, is adding another layer of safeguards but, in doing so, is blurring the responsibility in relation to defence agencies between that of the defence minister and the Attorney-General. Not only do I think that is confusing but also I think it is unnecessary. There are obligations in relation to warrants that are upon the Attorney-General; there are obligations in relation to authorisations that are upon the defence minister. In relation to their respective agencies, I believe that the systems have worked well and are, as I said, improved and clarified by the bill that is before the chamber at the moment. So, both in terms of adding a further and unnecessary layer of regulatory requirement and also in terms of blurring the responsibility between the two ministers, I would argue against the amendments the Labor Party is proposing.</para>

<para>—I am a bit surprised that the opposition do not want to take up this point and argue the point or at least defend their amendments. I actually think their amendments are reasonably good. I do not want to take the call in advance of anyone from the Labor Party but I have to pick up on the point of layers or constraints. Under these amendments in relation to 9C and the issuing of warrants, the third point states:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">Before the Attorney-General issues a warrant under this section for an activity, or a series of activities, of a kind mentioned in paragraph 9B(a) or (b), the Attorney-General must also:</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Then you have a series, which I do not see as a particular constraint. The amendment continues:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">(a) be satisfied that the Australian person mentioned in either of those paragraphs is, or is likely to be, involved in one or more of the following activities:</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Then there is a list—a smorgasbord:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">(i) activities that present a significant risk to a person’s safety; or</para>
<para class="block">(ii) acting for, or on behalf of, a foreign power; or</para>
<para class="block">(iii) activities that are, or are likely to be, a threat to security; or</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It goes on; it is ‘one or more of the following activities’. You have points like point (iii)—‘activities that are, or are likely to be, a threat to security’. I do not see that these are severely curtailing or constraining the abilities of the Attorney-General in this case. Even when it is read not only in conjunction with the current sections of the act—and let us face it: this updated bill does not really specify in too much more detail what can and cannot be done—but also in conjunction with the first two points in relation to the issuing of warrants under the Labor Party amendments, they are pretty reasonable positions. In fact, some people might argue they are not strong enough. I am just wondering what is wrong with putting in these clarifications in relation to the issuing of warrants. Is there a specific reason that the government can give us, apart from all this namby-pamby that it is duplicating or it is constraining or it is difficult for the ministers? What is difficult about having to satisfy one or more of these criteria before the warrant is issued?</para>

<para>—There is nothing difficult about that. The issue is whether you need to satisfy one minister or satisfy two ministers. The safeguards that were read out by Senator Stott Despoja are in the existing legislation and they are an obligation upon the Minister for Defence. The Minister for Defence, before giving an authorisation, has to be satisfied that the person mentioned is involved in one or more of the following activities: activities that present a significant risk to a person’s safety; acting for, or on behalf of, a foreign power; activities that are likely to be a threat to security, et cetera. It is not that I am arguing that these are the limited circumstances in which an authorisation might be given; quite the contrary. I believe that that is an important safeguard upon the powers that are given in this legislation to the security agencies. I just do not see merit in the argument of requiring not only that the Minister for Defence satisfy himself of all these matters but also that it then be done by the Attorney-General as well.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline>, in my view, is one of the more cynically named bills to come before this chamber in the last three years. We are told that this bill is all about addressing Australia’s existing skills shortage. It is one of the key policies that the Howard government took to the election last year. The thrust of this bill is that the creation of 24 Australian technical colleges, new colleges outside the existing vocational education system, will be one of the key components in addressing the current skills shortage in our economy. We are told that this federal government package will eventually deliver something like 7,000 places per year. Whilst I accept that there is a need for increased skills training and education in Australia, the federal government’s creation of a new system of technical education is not the magic bullet. In fact, it will not be the answer in the short term anyway.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>How long will we have to wait to see a student graduate from an Australian technical college with a trade qualification? Four years at the earliest, and that is based on the proposition that the colleges are up and operating now, and of course they are not—unless the government also seeks to downgrade and shorten trades training. The earliest that we can expect to see a graduate from an Australian technical college would be about 2010. It seems that we have a government that is a bit like a hamster on an exercise wheel: an awful lot of movement but going absolutely nowhere.</para>
<para>I have spoken many times before in this place about the absurdity of our current skills shortage. My point then, and again now, is that the skills shortages in Australia did not come out of nowhere. There are many leading indicators of impending skills shortages. These include factors such as the number of people commencing an apprenticeship, the number of people completing an apprenticeship, the number of people retiring from the work force by occupation, the number of skilled migrants entering the work force and the growth in trade job vacancies. This is just a small sample of those leading indicators.</para>
<para>The government, through its Public Service agencies, including those agencies concerned with immigration, employment, education and the Bureau of Statistics, has resources allocated to collecting all this data. Knowing the professionalism of the Public Service, I am sure that all of this data is available to the ministers concerned. The problem for Australia is that the ministers responsible have simply not been interested. Simply put, the skills shortages that now exist have been coming for years. The lead indicators have been telling us this and the government has failed to act.</para>
<para>Now that we have a skills crisis, the Howard government burst onto the scene with a range of new policies. What have the government delivered after nine long years with their dead-end skills policies? We end up with a toolbox for apprentices and Australian technical colleges. But wait, there is more! When all else fails, we will simply allow more skilled migrants to come here. There you have it: a crisis that they knew was coming that was addressed initially by increasing the number of skilled migrants and is now being addressed through the creation of new technical colleges.</para>
<para>Those opposite should be awarded points like in a diving competition for the degree of difficulty in managing this problem. Every time that this country is confronted with serious issues, those opposite come up with complicated and twisted applications of logic and commonsense to address the problems. Anyone who believes that the most effective and efficient use of taxpayers’ money to address the skills shortage is to duplicate elements of the existing technical education system is really all about wasting money, time and effort.</para>
<para>A technical and further education system already exists in this country. The system, which is administered by the states and receives funding from the Commonwealth, is responsible and has been responsible for skills training for years—even under Liberal governments. Instead, with a degree of difficulty and waste not seen for a long time, this government come up with the idea of starting from scratch. First, they have to go through the process of finding interested organisations to develop and run these technical colleges. Then they have to go through a tendering process. Then the minister gets to run around and hold lots of press conferences. The successful organisation then has to go and find suitable sites and then construct the buildings, I guess. Then, of course, they would have to engage staff, develop a curriculum, advertise for students, start the training, manage the business and then, finally, have a graduation ceremony.</para>
<para>After a period of at least four years and based on all the things that need to happen before the first intake, this policy would finally deliver the Howard government’s response to the skills crisis. Each year that the system is fully operational after that initial development, it will deliver at best 7,200 skilled workers into our economy. When considering this issue we must keep in mind that over the coming five years the estimated skills shortages in the Australian economy will run to some 130,000 places. This is on top of the existing shortages of approximately 20,000 skilled workers. The Australian people need to understand that simply creating a new technical college system will still leave a five-year shortfall of about 120,000 places—an incredible obstacle to our full economic development and growth. You do not address a skills crisis by duplicating existing systems and structures that will deliver only 7,000 places a year when fully operational.</para>
<para>As I said before, it seems to me that those opposite like to complicate things. For nine years they have essentially been reducing their funding of TAFE places. The net effect has been that around 270,000 fewer places are available. Compare that with the anticipated shortfall of 120,000 skilled workers and the existing shortfall of 20,000. It could have been more than adequately covered if funding had been maintained for the TAFE system. Now, when the government need to address their own neglect of Australia’s skilled worker requirements, rather than working cooperatively with the states and territories, they have to go and create their own technical colleges.</para>
<para>The 7,000 places a year that may eventuate from Australian technical colleges could have been delivered at a lower cost and in a more timely manner if the Commonwealth could have seen its way clear to work with the states. Let that be remembered when we discuss this legislation. The skills crisis is not only a policy failure—a failure by successive Liberal employment and education ministers to take heed of the lead indictors that pointed towards a looming skills shortage quite some time ago—but also a failure of the Commonwealth to work cooperatively with the states.</para>
<para>This is obviously of concern to some of the state Liberal members. One Friday night last month, on the <inline font-style="italic">Stateline</inline> program on the ABC in Perth, a former minister of the Court government was openly advocating a discussion about Western Australia seceding from the Commonwealth of Australia. I wonder if the Hon. Norman Moore MLC has adopted that position because of the level of concern he has with the behaviour of the Commonwealth government. Can anyone be surprised that members of the Liberal and National parties in state parliaments are increasingly concerned about the actions of the Commonwealth government?</para>
<para>The conservative parties in Australia have normally been opposed to the centralisation of power in Canberra. Now, they are witnessing a Liberal government that each day seems to come up with new ways to take more power into Canberra and away from the states. The Hon. Norman Moore echoed those concerns on that Friday night. In the area of technical education, the states and the Commonwealth should be working together to ensure that skills development in the Australian work force is delivered in the most cost and time effective manner possible.</para>
<para>During the last federal election campaign, the government were called to task over the skills crisis. Their solution was the provision of a tool box and the creation of the Australian technical colleges framework. Some 12 months down the track, we are only just now getting the legislation—talk about policy development on the run. If this is the Commonwealth’s considered response to the skills crisis, we should not have had to wait this amount of time. Surely the Commonwealth would have been prepared for action immediately after the election, not some 12 months later. Instead, we see the continued erosion of our Federation.</para>
<para>If this is really the sum total of the Commonwealth’s response to the skills crisis then it falls well short of the needs of the Australian economy. It falls short by some 120,000 places over the coming five years. It is beyond belief that the Commonwealth can only come up with 7,000 places in that five-year period for an expenditure of over $340 million. Much of the funding is going to capital expenditure, but how many more skilled workers could be funded if that money was allocated within the existing vocational education system? Surely, a much greater impact on the shortfall of 120,000 places could be made.</para>
<para>In conclusion, it is clear that the Commonwealth government have dropped the ball on this issue. For nine long years they did nothing except reduce the funding available to the public technical education sector. For nine long years they ignored the lead indicators that pointed to the looming skills shortage in our economy. When called to account during the federal election campaign last year, they came up with policy on the run—a policy to create 24 Australian technical colleges in a massive duplication of the existing technical education system, for purely political reasons. This policy will take at least four years—and maybe as many as five or six years, by the time we get there—to deliver a single skilled worker to the Australian economy. This is a government that are clearly not up to the task of managing Australia’s skills development.</para>

<para>—The Democrats welcome the injection of additional funding for vocational education and training. However, we agree with the concerns of many who presented to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee inquiry into the provisions of the <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline> that using the funding to establish 24 Australian technical colleges does not optimise the use of that funding and sets up a system that could, in fact, have detrimental effects on other school based VET systems and the outcome for all students.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Unfortunately, we are now faced with the extraordinary situation where it is not practicable to oppose or even amend the Australian technical colleges bill because, in the government’s arrogance, the majority of the 24 technical colleges proposed have been agreed to and are under way before the bill has even passed through parliament. I think this criticism is particularly valid, given that the decision to establish the technical colleges was a last-minute federal election promise that saw little, if any, consultation with state governments, schools, school principals, parent organisations or TAFE colleges. This is policy on the run, writ large.</para>
<para>The problem with implementing a policy before legislation has passed is very obvious. The parliament does not get the opportunity to properly scrutinise it and offer amendments which could improve outcomes for students, and those people who take the trouble to let us know their views, who often have much experience and expertise, are ignored. The government might argue that there is no need for scrutiny because there is support for the technical colleges and that that was demonstrated by the strong interest and the number of applications for tenders so far. However, interest in the colleges does not necessarily mean that the colleges will be in the best interests of students.</para>
<para>What I find most perplexing about the federal government’s decision is that stand-alone technical colleges used to be a feature of schooling in Australia. They certainly were when I was at secondary school. There were high schools and there were technical schools. Yet, after extensive reviews of education policy, it was judged to be a more efficient use of resources, a more equitable social approach and more educationally desirable to educate all students under a single comprehensive approach, and they were reintegrated into the mainstream.</para>
<para>The Australian Education Union, in their submission to the inquiry into the bill, outlined a number of reasons for the closure of stand-alone technical colleges—for example:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">• Many were resource intensive and to some extent, exclusive. There was little easy movement between academic and technical schools, with neither benefiting from the practices and resources of the other.</para>
<para class="block">• Some technical schools became ‘ghetto’ repositories for working class kids and disengaged students from the high school stream.</para>
<para class="block">• A mis-match occurred over the time between the skills the schools were established to provide, and the emerging skills in the economy. The schools therefore no longer met the demands of the industries they were meant to serve.</para>
<para class="block">• It was acknowledged that all students needed some ‘vocational focus’ in their secondary education. This was especially so in the post-compulsory years (15-19) where with structural changes to the economy and the evolution into a postindustrial society, jobs were no longer available for 15 year olds or for those who were completing the senior school technical curriculum.</para>
<para class="block">• It was also recognised that those students at technical college needed access to a broad general education which they were not able to receive within the limitations of a technical college.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Education Union warned that one of the long-term effects will be an emergence of the same issues that confronted technical colleges in the 1970s and 1980s, challenging social questions about streaming, from an entry level of schooling into a trade, students who were not considered bright enough to complete mainstream schooling. Yet it seems that the federal government is on track to make many of the same mistakes—and without too much input by anybody else.</para>
<para>The Democrats share the concerns of some of the submissions to the Senate inquiry that the language of the bill suggests that technical colleges will be industry led and there will not be an equal partnership between schools, industry and other stakeholders such as employers and representative organisations. Even the word ‘industry’ led to a misnomer, as they are more likely to be employer led. The Education Union in their submission made the observation that the technical colleges:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... are to be situated in regions with skills shortages and high youth unemployment, but where there is a significant industry base. The only conclusion is, that where these three conditions co-exist, local industry has to date taken no responsibility for training the next generation of skilled workers. Yet this very local industry is now to be charged with governing not merely some areas of training, but a school teaching academic subjects.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Democrats share the AEU’s belief that ‘local industry does not have the expertise to carry out such a role’.</para>
<para>The union also raised concerns that the establishment of the technical colleges, coupled with superior funding, could weaken other school based VET initiatives. It has been estimated that, due to the additional funding, the technical colleges will operate at over 175 per cent of the average cost of educating a secondary student, which is a considerable financial advantage. We must remember that this is for quite a small number of students at that level—that is, year 11 and year 12. The union argued that, for want of comparative funding, many school based initiatives may not be able to compete with the offerings of the technical colleges and will have to reduce their programs accordingly.</para>
<para>In particular, schools may have to cut programs where student numbers would be too small to be viable, further limiting student opportunities. This will have a considerable impact on educational outcomes of students who do not attend the technical colleges but who will still wish to pursue a vocational pathway. It is also highly likely that, because the technical colleges will draw students away from existing schools and programs, this will result in alterations to funding of existing schools. The combined loss of students and funding is likely to affect the ability of the school to offer a maximum range of curriculum to all students. This would be particularly true for schools in regional areas which are already struggling for viability.</para>
<para>A number of submissions noted that principles such as equity have not been strongly expressed in the bill. The emphasis on traditional trades, which are mainly male-dominated trades such as metals and engineering, automotive, building and construction and electrotechnologies, will inevitably lead to failures to address gender participation or, more broadly, to offer courses that young women may be interested in pursuing. What happens if the aspirations, aptitudes or interests of a technical college student change? Will the technical college have the capability to offer the student alternatives? Will the technical college provide a level of education to enable students, should they wish, to undertake further education such as at university? I think it has to be remembered that many students enter year 11 with not a great deal of understanding or much idea about what they aspire to after school completion.</para>
<para>What concerns me the most about the government’s actions to date is that they have blindly and, I would argue, arrogantly pursued this flawed model for ideological reasons, including the pursuit of Australian workplace agreements, at the expense of alternative workable models. For example, the Queensland government, in their submission to the inquiry, argued that, while they support the policy intent behind the bill, they urge the government to consider alternative models that would achieve the same objectives and yet be more flexible as well as more consistent with current industry partnerships, especially in the regions.</para>
<para>The Queensland government have proposed a more flexible model, whereby students from feeder schools, both state and non-state, would maintain an enrolment in their respective schools and enrol in and attend the technical colleges to access high-quality, specialised trade training. The Queensland government argued that this dual arrangement would enable a greater number of feeder schools to participate and thereby deliver a broader range of options for a greater number of students. The Queensland government also argued that the dual model is particularly viable in regional areas, where the introduction of the colleges has the potential to create a competitor in what is a relatively small market. The Queensland government expressed concern that failure to accommodate other industry partnership models that are currently delivering significant outcomes for Queensland industry and students not only is regrettable but also could impact negatively on the cooperation that currently underpins successful industry and school partnerships.</para>
<para>It would be useful if the minister, in his contribution to the second reading debate, could indicate whether the federal government is prepared to consider more flexible models, as outlined by the Queensland government, and, if not, why this is the case. Several submitters to the inquiry on the bill rightly pointed out that the technical colleges will not produce a skilled tradesperson to come into the labour market until 2010 and that this will do nothing to assist the industries and the skills shortage now. The solution to skills shortages is not via a model of privatisation and competition for already scarce resources; rather, the solution lies in an integrated, collaborative model that supports existing schools and VET courses. We echo the sentiments of the Australian Education Union that technical colleges are, at best, a solution for a few at the expense of the many.</para>

<para>—I want to quote a ministerial statement from the Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie, on 22 March this year:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">Today I congratulate Griffith University researchers led by Professor Alan Mackay-Sim for having grown adult stem cells harvested from the olfactory mucosa in the nose. They demonstrated the cells can give rise not only to nerve cells but also to heart, liver, kidney and muscle cells. A paper on their work is … published … in peer-reviewed life sciences journal <inline font-style="italic">Development Dynamics</inline>.</para>
<para class="block">Professor Mackay-Sim, deputy director of the university’s Institute for Cell and Molecular Therapies, has spent the past four years developing the research which will have potential clinical application in stem cell transplantation therapies and in understanding the biology of diseases.</para>
<para class="block">Professor Mackay-Sim says the discoveries highlighted significant advantages of these adult stem cells over embryonic stem cells … The research suggests that these adult olfactory stem cells have the same ability as embryonic stem cells in giving rise to many different cell types but have the advantage that they can be obtained from all individuals, even older people who might be most in need of stem cell therapies.</para>
<para class="block">This would mean that stem cells obtained from and transplanted into the same person would not be rejected by the immune system. For the past three years Professor Mackay-Sim’s research team has been investigating the potential of olfactory stem cells in treating Parkinson’s disease and is currently using stem cells from Parkinson’s sufferers to gain insights into the causes of the disease.</para>
<para class="block">Professor Mackay-Sim, who was Queenslander of the Year in 2003, has been researching the sense of smell for 30 years, the past 20 focusing on the regeneration of the sensory nerves of the olfactory mucosa …</para>
<para class="block">I congratulate the university and the professor. They are a perfect example of the Smart State in operation. They are brilliant and they deserve public acclaim.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What I have just read from is a ministerial statement on the truly remarkable research going on in Queensland that has broken new ground in stem cell technology—using adult stem cells.</para>
<para>It is now established fact that adult stem cells are a viable alternative to the ethically problematic embryonic stem cells. They have worked out how to grow them quickly and easily and without the problems associated with embryonic cells of uncontrolled growths and tumours. Most importantly they can be grown from the patient’s own nose, making them good candidates for cell transplantation therapies and tissue reconstruction. You do not have the massive problem of rejection that you get with embryonic cells.</para>
<para>Because they can be grown without animal cells, there is also no risk of the transfer of animal genes or viruses during the growth of the cell. In addition, these adult stem cells are a wonderful source of cells to study diseases. The Griffith University research team is already using their 50 cell line population to investigate Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, motor neurone disease, epilepsy and others. There is no need for therapeutic cloning in order to study diseases, which is the main argument being put forward.</para>
<para>The consultant neurologist to the Mackay-Sim lab, Professor Peter Silburn, has also presented findings to a major international conference showing that stem cells derived from Parkinson’s disease patients, when transplanted into animal models, demonstrated marked improvement. This highlights the effectiveness of the adult stem cell approach. Internationally, trials are already under way using adult stem cells to study other diseases, such as heart disease. No-one is using embryonic stem cells to put back into humans.</para>
<para>I began by quoting the Queensland Premier’s enthusiastic praise for these researchers to show the bipartisan support that is developing for adult stem cell technology. A few years ago, the talk and the investment money was all for embryonic stem cell research. The talk was of cures, cures and more cures, for everything from spinal paralysis to motor neurone disease, Alzheimer’s, cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s and so on. It was the irresistible appeal of cures that pulled many votes over the line in support of the research legislation.</para>
<para>Now we have the Lockhart review to look at how the legislation on embryo research and cloning is working and whether there need to be changes. There has been a push from some to open the doors to cloning for research but not for reproduction purposes. Before we go down that track, there are some key questions that need to be answered. Firstly, where are the cures? Where are the research proposals for cures? Where are the peer-reviewed papers on cures? What disease has been seriously studied? Where are the human trials?</para>
<para>The answers are all coming from the adult stem cell field. Humans are constantly regenerating their own stem cells. They can be taken from a patient in 10 minutes. They can be grown into their thousands within weeks, not months as is the case with embryonic cells. They can be sent by mail to researchers studying disease all over the world. Some of the states’ arguments for cloning are a direct repeat of mantras heard last time: we will not be able to compete internationally unless we have cloning, we will lose our brainy people overseas and so on.</para>
<para>These claims are contradicted by the Commonwealth government’s Invest Australia publication entitled ‘Australian biotechnology—number one in the Asia Pacific for biotechnology investment’. The paper says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Ernst &amp; Young ranks Australia as the number one biotech country in the Asia-Pacific and sixth worldwide in its global biotech census.</para>

<para class="block">So the real Australian biotech market performance is buoyant and healthy, and not one that is pining away because of lack of cloning. The NHMRC Licensing Committee has issued nine licences to use excess ART embryos over the period to March 2008, involving up to 1,740 human embryos. The licence holders are: Sydney IVF, which has four; Melbourne IVF, which has two; Monash IVF, which has one; IVF Australia, which has one; and Monash University, which has one. As Professor Michael Good of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research notes in his submission to the Lockhart review:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I am not aware of any clinical trials being undertaken or being planned using stem cells derived from IVF embryos, which was a major reason put forward in support of the legislation passed in 2002. The scientific hurdle was, and remains, immunological rejection and the scientific community is no closer to solving that dilemma. Until it does, I, as an immunologist, cannot foresee any clinical use for IVF-derived ES cell tissues without the concurrent use of powerful immunosuppressive agents.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Professor Good goes on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... possible ways to avoid an immunological rejection do exist. One approach is to create a very large bank of embryos (several million) that between them would contain one that had the correct immunological match for any given patient.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He says that that seems patently impossible from a practical point of view. He continues:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">A different approach would be to use therapeutic cloning. A major ethical issue, from my perspective, is that at our current level of knowledge, to make such clones requires a source of ova (egg cells). These can be harvested from volunteers, but not in sufficient numbers if this approach is to be made widely available. There is also the significant personal sacrifice that women would need to make in donating ova to develop a therapy for another person.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Due to cloning inefficiencies, enormous amounts of eggs would be required and they would only come from thousands of hyperovulated women during a medically risky procedure. In the UK a cloning team said that IVF eggs may not be sufficient. The <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> online reported that Professor Murdoch said that she could not rule out asking for egg donations for research from women who would not otherwise be having such a procedure. That is the reality of therapeutic cloning. Do we want that situation in Australia? That is the direction in which therapeutic cloning would take us. Professor Good says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... a further source of ova is from animals. Tissues derived from these clones would have a small component of animal genetic material and society would have to weigh the benefits with the potential risks. The issue that will confront most people, however, is what if the clone that was destined to become a tissue through therapeutic cloning, was instead implanted into a woman’s uterus by an unscrupulous doctor and allowed to develop into a child. This scenario would be totally unacceptable to the vast majority and Government would need to develop a method to police such activities.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Embryo researchers are already talking about putting human genetic material into rabbit eggs to produce the clones. This analysis of the pitfalls ahead for the therapeutic application of embryonic stem cell research is quite staggering in its implications. It explains why we have seen no signs of cures, why there are not even developed research proposals for preclinical trials and why embryo research investors are calling for cloning.</para>
<para>It seems that the difficult debate the nation went through a few years ago has, in the end, been about a mere nine licences, nearly all to the benefit of IVF corporate interests. I will leave others to work out who they are. Professor Loane Skene, who is a member of the Lockhart committee, on 1 March 2000 told a House of Representatives inquiry into cloning:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If there is to be legislation, I think it should be limited to preventing cloning for reproductive purposes. With regard to other aspects of cloning research and development, it seems to me that there is great potential. It is an area for research and treatment and it is an area that is very rapidly developing.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So already we know where one member of the Lockhart committee stands on therapeutic cloning.</para>
<para>The last debate was a very difficult one for many of us and led to deep soul searching about the ethical issues involved. My point is that, for all the pain we went through and for all the costs, we are not even close to the promised cures from embryo research. Yet there is true hope out there. Medical research will tackle the most painful and debilitating diseases known to humanity. And it will do it through adult stem cell technology. The only question is: how long before the world wakes up to it? We have before us a sober opportunity to change direction to a zone of scientific research that is free of ethical dilemmas. I have taken several people to visit the leading adult stem cell laboratory at Griffith University to see at first hand the work being done there. I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my speech in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para>

<para>—I continue the theme of Senator Boswell’s speech today on outstanding Australian science. Today I would like to recognise some of our outstanding contributors. Yesterday, as we all know, was a very exciting day for Australian science because Australia added to its already formidable and forever growing list of Nobel prize laureates. Professor Barry Marshall and Dr Robin Warren were awarded the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and became our ninth and 10th Nobel laureates.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Barry Marshall and Robin Warren proved that the bacterium <inline font-style="italic">Helicobacter pylori</inline> was the cause of stomach ulcers and gastritis. Prior to their discovery of this bacterium in the stomach, it was believed that stress and lifestyle were the major causes of peptic ulcer disease. In fact, it was said that the causes of stomach ulcers were due to ‘hurry, worry and curry’. Professor Marshall and Dr Warren permanently changed this prevailing view. The foundation for their breakthrough was laid in 1981 when a young Marshall met Warren, who was a Royal Perth Hospital pathologist with an interest in gastritis. Together they set out to investigate the possible connection between a microbe and ulcers. Dr Warren had observed small curved bacteria colonising the lower part of the stomach in around half of the patients studied. It was here that the crucial observation was made—that the signs of inflammation were always present in the gastric mucosa close to where the bacteria was seen. With that began the study of biopsies from 100 patients and after much effort they successfully managed to cultivate the bacteria and by doing so made it amenable to scientific study.</para>
<para>These two medical pioneers were so confident in their discovery that in 1984 Professor Marshall swallowed a culture of <inline font-style="italic">Helicobacter pylori</inline> to give himself gastritis, which is a precursor to stomach ulcers, and then cured it with antibiotics. Not only did this brazen act convince the most hardened sceptics, but it also gave Professor Marshall a new empathy for those who had been suffering the debilitating pain of stomach ulcers for many years. It was surely a selfless act that has gone down in medical folklore.</para>
<para>Their discovery was very much a sea change in scientific thinking as they were now able to demonstrate not only that bacteria could survive in a highly acidic stomach but that it was the spiral-shaped, Gram-negative bacterium that colonises the stomach in around 50 per cent of all humans and that some 10 to 15 per cent of infected individuals will, at some time, experience peptic ulcer disease. As the Nobel prize press release stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Thanks to the pioneering discovery by Marshall and Warren, peptic ulcer disease is no longer a chronic, frequently disabling condition, but a disease that can be cured by a short regimen of antibiotics and acid secretion inhibitors.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Our congratulations go to Professor Marshall and Dr Warren for their wonderful work.</para>
<para>Last night I attended the Prime Minister’s Awards for Science where I was fortunate enough to listen not only to a speech by Professor Marshall, who flew in from Western Australia specifically for the occasion, but also to addresses from a number of prize recipients who have made an exceptional contribution to Australian science. I was seated next to Professor Graham Farquhar, from the Environmental Biology Group in the Research School of Biological Sciences, who has been working with Dr Josette Masle and together they have discovered the gene called <inline font-style="italic">erecta</inline> that regulates water efficiency in plants. I spoke about that amazing work, which may lead to the development of drought resistant crops, during my speech here in National Science Week.</para>
<para>The ceremony was hosted by Dr Karl Kruszelnicki who taught us interesting scientific facts last night such as why a strapless dress stays up, why the use of a colon in the title of one’s work increases the number of citations, and the existence of a link between academic success and the excuse that one’s grandmother has died. A number of scientists were honoured. The Prime Minister’s Prize for Science was awarded to Professor David Boger. The Science Minister’s Prize for Life Scientist of the Year was awarded to Dr Harvey Millar. The Malcolm McIntosh Prize for the Physical Scientist of the Year went to Associate Professor Cameron Kepert. The Prime Minister’s Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching in Primary Schools went to Mr Mark Merritt, and the Prime Minister’s Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching in Secondary Schools was awarded to Mr Mike Roach.</para>
<para>The role of science teachers can never be overstated. It is their knowledge and experience coupled with limitless enthusiasm, tenacity, passion and patience that are cultivating and developing tomorrow’s scientists and future Nobel laureates. Their job is certainly not an easy one. They have to convert complex scientific concepts and ideas into easily digestible and, most importantly, engaging topics for their students. In fact, research demonstrates that the more positive experience a student has of science in school, the more likely they are to pursue a career in science in later life. For this reason I would like to single out for special mention and commendation the winners of the Prime Minister’s Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching in primary and secondary schools announced last night.</para>
<para>Mr Mark Merritt received the primary school award. He teaches at Marmion Primary School in the northern suburbs of Perth and has been teaching primary school students for 21 years. Mark was inspired to become a science teacher by the positive learning experience given to him by his year 7 teacher. In his words:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">He allowed us to investigate and explore the world around us, and was one of the many teachers to inspire me towards a science teaching career.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mark believes that it is fundamental for science teachers to answer questions not with ‘I don’t know’ but rather with ‘let’s find out’. I think that this comment sums up the ethos of Australian scientists—their inquisitive nature, their drive to find out the nature and cause of things and their reluctance to simply accept things at face value. It surely is that ‘let’s find out’ mentality that has seen us leave our planet and conquer once terminal illnesses.</para>
<para>As testament to Mark Merritt’s teaching ability and passion, his school dominated the Western Australia talent search, with one-third of the 28 children who took part in the competition winning prizes and around 80 per cent of them reaching the state finals. His school also won the overall prize for best primary school in the talent search.</para>
<para>It is also worthwhile to note on the record that Mark is a writer and trial teacher for the new national curriculum resource <inline font-style="italic">Primary connections: linking science with literacy</inline>. He is helping teachers implement new and exciting ways of teaching science and as such his zeal and enthusiasm is not just confined to the students fortunate enough to have him as a teacher but is dispersed Australia wide.</para>
<para>Mr Mike Roach, who won the secondary school award, teaches at Hamilton Secondary School in Adelaide and runs an annual space science school in South Australia. Mike fell into science teaching in 1971 when, while part way through a chemical engineering degree, he heeded the call from the South Australian education minister for anyone who had completed the first year of a university science course to assist in science teaching. That was 34 years ago, and that passion that drew him to teach is also what led him to be selected for this prestigious teaching prize.</para>
<para>Mike has been involved with the introduction of conceptual physics, which uses analogies and real world situations to explain physical principles. He has found that by using space as a base point he can explain practically all basic physics in a way that is exciting and engaging for his students. He believes that a critical shortage of teachers is the greatest threat to science teaching to confront Australia today. As he said last night:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It’s important that we instil the next generation of students with a love of science, and that we give them the knowledge and problem-solving skills they will need to enable them to assess the impact of science and technology on their lives.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">How right you are, Mr Roach. I congratulate him and Mr Merritt on their awards and wish them the best of luck for the future.</para>
<para>We have a lot of other home grown research in science and medicine going on, and I want to reflect on two research topics today. The growing epidemic of diabetes already affects over a million Australians and twice that number are at risk of developing diabetes in the next five to 10 years. Despite the clear and present danger of diabetes, the role of high sugars in causing blindness, kidney failure and heart disease is poorly understood.</para>
<para>Dr Merlin Thomas, working at the Baker Heart Research Institute in Melbourne, has found a novel link between sugar and the complications that it causes. His diabetes research has found a link between protein modified by high sugar levels and organ damage. He has found that high sugar levels change or modify protein, which in turn goes on to cause damage to the organs in the body. He is working on a way to stop high sugar levels in the blood affecting the protein. To use an analogy, he says high blood sugar is like adding petrol to a fire. The high blood sugar fuels the creation of destructive modified protein. His research is looking to contain the fire no matter what is added to it, thus negating the effect of high sugar levels.</para>
<para>As well, he is developing a test that medical practitioners will be able to use on diabetes suffers to see how much of the modified protein is in their system, and thus doctors will be able to easily and quickly ascertain the level or risk of organ damage in their patients. Medical practitioners can also use Dr Thomas’s test on patients who are at risk of contracting diabetes to ensure that their organs do not start to deteriorate as a result of the disease. Dr Thomas has recently received a Victorian award for his research.</para>
<para>I have recently been able to find out a lot more about the work of Professor Michael Morgan, head of neurosurgery at the University of Sydney and the cerebrovascular neurosurgeon at Royal North Shore and Dalcross hospitals in Sydney. Since graduating in medicine from the University of Sydney in 1980, Professor Morgan has pursued his interest in neurosurgery, and was awarded a doctorate in medicine from the University of Sydney in 1991 for his study of human cerebral arteriovenous malformations.</para>
<para>Professor Morgan’s groundbreaking neurosurgery has saved thousands of lives. He specialises in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations, cerebral aneurysms and surgery for stroke—including bypass surgery, carotid endarterectomy and brain haemorrhage. Aneurysms resemble bubbles or focal dilations of arteries that occur at weak points of the artery wall. The likely reason for their formation is an interaction of many factors. Basically, they occur at points where there is the greatest stress on the artery walls, where arteries branch or change direction.</para>
<para>Aneurysms can lead to trouble if they rupture, if they increase in size or if solid material from within breaks off and travels downstream to block an artery to cause a stroke. The most common cause for trouble is haemorrhage caused by aneurysm rupture. It is uncommon to diagnose an aneurysm before it has ruptured and most people with an aneurysm are totally unaware that they have one until it bursts.</para>
<para>Professor Morgan has gained a world wide reputation for performing and teaching endovascular surgery. As the range and complexity of neurosurgical techniques and procedures has grown, it has become increasingly difficult for neurosurgeons to maintain expertise in all areas of neurosurgery, and he is regarded as a pioneer of modern neurosurgical techniques. He is sharing his expertise, teaching both here and overseas.</para>
<para>As you can see, Australian science is alive and well and we are proudly receiving an increased level of international recognition. As Senator Boswell so rightly said, we are really punching above our weight in our contribution to global science. We do very well with the funding we have for medical and science research. Imagine what we could do, however, if the sector was adequately funded. Our success is an indicator that we have enormous untapped human intellectual capacity in this nation. Increased funding in medical research could unleash this potential. I call on the government to increase investment in health and medical research to bring Australia up to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average of 0.2 per cent of gross domestic product.</para>
<para>I am also concerned about the government’s proposal to implement a radical new formula for the distribution of research grants, which includes the abolition of the Australian Research Council Board so that control over research grants will be with the minister. With the ARC abolished, the independent peer review process goes and political favouritism and agendas come in that, unfortunately, I can see will be awash with extreme pursuits. In this proud week of scientific research successes, I sincerely hope that, as well as celebrating the achievements of many hardworking Australians that have had their work recognised locally, nationally and internationally, we ponder our future and the future that we can foster for our scientists. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I want to speak again today on the dangers of giving not just this government but any government open-ended powers without proper scope for independent oversight of how those powers are exercised and proper opportunities for appeal when they are misused. This is relevant, of course, in the current debate around the so-called intelligence and security matters and the proposals by the Labor state and territory premiers and chief ministers and, of course, the federal Liberal Party government, to dramatically increase the powers available to a range of government officers and to the government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The big concern, as I said earlier today in a debate on the intelligence services legislation, is not just what the powers are but whether there is any scope for making sure that they are not misused. It is important to note that there are already significant examples of the government misusing the open-ended powers that they already have. I used the example this morning of the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>. Whatever people might think about the immigration policies surrounding boat people, the simple fact is that, in addressing the political issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>, the federal government used a whole range of information that was gathered by intelligence agencies to inform their political response to that situation.</para>
<para>Communications between Australian citizens, between lawyers and their clients, by foreign companies, the shipping line and, almost certainly, the Norwegian government officials as well, were all intercepted and monitored, and the material was provided to government ministers and officers. Intelligence agencies were used to gather information to assist the government in its political response. A simple thing like not being able to be confident that your communications as an Australian with your legal representative are safe from monitoring—and not only monitoring but from being passed on to government officials—is a serious problem.</para>
<para>I will come back to that specific example later, but I want to emphasise that the Migration Act as a whole provides a range of case studies of what happens when you give open-ended powers to government ministers and officers. You get grotesque injustices, a lack of concern for the human consequences of decisions and an inability to have those injustices addressed or even identified in some cases.</para>
<para>I had a report forwarded to me today by the helpful people from the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. It was a report on the ABC web site that goes into a full Federal Court decision back in July about a man who is a Swedish citizen but who had actually lived in Australia for all but the first four weeks of his life. His parents are actually Australian citizens of Swedish origin and just happened to be in Sweden when he was born. They returned to Australia with him as a newborn baby, a few weeks old, and he had lived in Australia ever since. Despite that fact, he never actually took out Australian citizenship. Of course, we all know that there are many thousands of people in similar circumstances and who have lived here the vast majority of their lives but have never actually taken out Australian citizenship. This person committed some serious criminal offences in his adult life and was tried and jailed for those offences.</para>
<para>What we have in the Migration Act is, in effect, a form of double punishment, because not only do people get the court’s punishment but then, as a consequence completely separate of that process, they can get the government’s or the minister’s punishment. What happened in this case was that the person then had his right to remain in Australia cancelled, and he was required to depart Australia and go back to Sweden. He was basically being forced back to Sweden, despite the fact that the person had never lived there, did not speak Swedish, had no immediate family there and not just his parents but all of his family were in Australia. Obviously, anything that may have influenced him in the crimes that he committed was a result of his life here in Australia.</para>
<para>But the fact is that the minister does have an open-ended power, under the character provisions of the Migration Act, to simply cancel a person’s visa if the minister believes they have failed the so-called character test. The full Federal Court decision in this case has ruled that that was done unlawfully by the department. The government is appealing that decision in the High Court, so we shall see what happens there. But there is a broader principle here, beyond what happens to this individual, and that is that there is an open-ended power—and depending on how this appeal goes, it may continue to remain open-ended—for the minister to cancel the visa of a person under the so-called character provisions of the Migration Act. These are provisions, I might say, that were brought in with the support of the Labor Party, as well as the Liberal Party, as occurs with many of the unjust areas of the Migration Act.</para>
<para>The fact is that this is not a new scenario. Indeed, this case was referred to in the hearings last week before the Senate committee that is looking into the administration of the Migration Act. I would encourage those who are interested in this issue to look at the evidence given by Mr Glenn Nicholls from the Swinburne University of Technology’s Institute for Social Research. He has been looking into a range of similar cases.</para>
<para>I draw the Senate’s attention to a man by the name of Rodrigo Herrera, who, in similar circumstances, had his residency cancelled by the government on character grounds. An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> in April last year by Cynthia Banham detailed his case. He moved here when he was six with his parents and siblings. His family subsequently applied for and received citizenship, but he neglected to do so. Mr Herrera got involved in some illegal activity and was tried and punished for that. His residency was subsequently cancelled and he was going to be deported to Chile. Having not lived there since he was six years old, his ability to speak the language of that country was less than adequate and he knew nobody there at all.</para>
<para>This is not just about the impact on the person; it is also about the impact on the wider family and the grotesque extra injustice, disproportionate punishment and impact that are placed on them. In a political sense, it is obviously hard for politicians to defend the rights of people who have committed crimes, because they are immediately attacked for standing up for criminals and wrongdoers. People ask, ‘Why shouldn’t we have people like that removed from the country?’ Frankly, from my point of view, if Australia has been responsible for bringing up a person, then it should be its system of justice that punishes them if they have committed a crime. Once they have done their time they have the right to get on with their lives in the same way as anybody else who commits a crime. But this group of people are at risk of, and sometimes subjected to, having the vastly greater and extra punishment of being permanently removed from Australia—not only deported but also never allowed to return. They are separated from their family, potentially permanently, unless their family want to move as well. That, I would suggest, is a grossly disproportionate punishment for any wrongdoing. The case of the Chilean man that I mentioned was challenged in the courts and failed. The judge at that time said that there were strong grounds for the government to reconsider the relevant section of the Migration Act and how it applies.</para>
<para>Another case that I am aware of, from 2004, involved a person that came here as a teenager from the UK. Again, the challenge in the Federal Court was unsuccessful, but I will read some comments from the judgment to emphasise the total power, the absolute power, that exists in these cases. It states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the exercise of the Minister’s power under s 501(2) of the Migration Act to cancel a visa can have profound consequences for permanent Australian residents. The exercise of the power can even affect people who have lived in this country since infancy. If the power of cancellation is exercised by the Minister personally under s 501(2), no merits review is available in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or elsewhere ... the failure of the Minister to give reasons for his or her decision to cancel a visa does not ... invalidate the decision. Thus a permanent Australian resident—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">who has lived basically their entire life here and whose family are here and are Australian citizens—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">may be removed from Australia without ever having been told why the Minister has exercised his or her discretion to cancel the visa.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That has happened a number of times and it continues to happen. It is my view that it is not only a gross injustice, disproportionate to anything a person may have done, but also damaging to the overall fabric of the Australian community to have permanent residents able to be removed at the whim of a minister without any scope for oversight of how that power is exercised.</para>
<para>I am aware of another man, originally from Scotland, I think, who came here as a teenager. He is now nearly 50. He was sentenced to jail for breach of an apprehended violence order—obviously an inappropriate act—for which he was tried and punished. Subsequent to that, when he was released and living with his aged parents, who were quite ill, he was rearrested by immigration officers and taken to the Villawood Detention Centre, where he has remained for over 2½ years. Under his initial sentence he was in prison for well less than a year; he was then, or has been, in effect, imprisoned in Sydney for 2½ years. As we all know, unlike for prison, the government does the kind and helpful thing of charging people for every day they are in immigration detention. Although I cannot do the maths off the top of my head, at $180 a day for being detained at the minister’s pleasure in the detention centre, that person would have racked up a pretty large bill whilst trying to prevent himself from being sent back to a country where he has not lived for decades and where he has no family left, and while he has aged parents who are ill here in Australia.</para>
<para>These are gross injustices. The fact that they occur to people who have committed offences in Australia does not in any way reduce the size of them. I think it offends very important principles of public administration and due process of law that people can have such massively harmful and enormous things done to them at the whim of a minister who does not even have to justify their decision, which cannot be challenged. This is one area and one example of what can happen. But I should add to it the very significant fact that recent High Court judgments also suggest that it is quite possible for ministers to also cancel the citizenship of Australians or to have laws passed that will enable them to do so. Even though a person may be a citizen, the High Court’s recent decisions have made it apparent that ministers would be able to give themselves the power under law to deem that person an alien for the purposes of cancelling their citizenship, particularly if they held dual citizenship of another country.</para>
<para>I say all of this not only to point to injustices that occur under the Migration Act but also to sound a warning as to what can happen if we give extra powers to ministers, on so-called national security grounds, that allow people, on the basis of anonymous information, to be deemed a security risk through an intelligence agency that has no requirement to produce details of that anonymous information. We all know about the case of Mr Scott Parkin, the US peace activist, who was deported on grounds about which he was unable to be informed. That can be applied to permanent residents in Australia, who can then similarly have their permanent residence visa cancelled without any grounds being given to them.</para>
<para>That can happen now under the law, and it is quite feasible with future legal changes that it could even apply to Australian citizens who are deemed, according to a completely secret process, to somehow be security risks or to have failed character tests for other reasons. I would argue that that is an extremely dangerous power. We have already seen that it can be used, and has been used, in a way which causes massive injustices for people and for their wider families. That needs to be addressed and that situation needs to be removed from the Migration Act. We do not want to be expanding the scope for people to be removed from Australia, to even have their citizenship cancelled, on the basis of secret decisions that people have no right to appeal against. That is the risk we are facing, and we need to fight against it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>—Today I want to discuss the environment. On the weekend just past, the Liberal Party in Western Australia held a state conference. Indeed, I pause to say that the Liberal Party in Western Australia can hold a state conference, in stark contrast to my Labor colleagues who have some difficulty holding a state conference for fear of actual violence amongst the factions. At that state conference we passed a resolution in support of the mining and exporting of uranium. That is what I want to talk about today. The 300 delegates, if my memory serves me correctly, unanimously supported the proposition that we should get on with the job and start mining and exporting uranium. This is in stark contrast to Labor’s absolutely ridiculous, irrational and illogical three-mines policy, which each state Premier is seeking to maintain to shut out good viable jobs and to prejudice the development of a strong industrial section in this area.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Australia has 30 per cent of the world’s uranium reserves. Australia produces and exports 10,000 tonnes of uranium oxide every year now, as I stand here and talk. Australia’s uranium is used solely for the generation of electricity right around the world. We apply the strictest guidelines and protocols to ensure that none of our exports find their way into countries like North Korea or Iran or, indeed, into weapons or any other misuse of this mineral. In the last five years, we have exported a total of 46,000 tonnes of uranium oxide, and this is in contrast to the Labor premiers saying, ‘No more uranium mining.’ It is already happening, and there is a demand in the world for our uranium. As I said, we have 30 per cent of the world’s reserves.</para>
<para>Our three producing mines were, until relatively recently, Ranger, Nabarlek, which is now closed, and Olympic Dam in South Australia. Our customers over the years have included Japan, Finland, France, South Korea, the United States, Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Belgium. In Western Australia we have two world-class proven deposits: Yeleerie in the north-eastern goldfields of Western Australia and Kintyre in the East Pilbara shire of Western Australia. Western Australian reserves, as proven in those two deposits, are estimated to have an in-ground value of $6 billion, whilst the Northern Territory reserves currently have an in-ground value of about $12 billion. Western Australia has over 250 highly prospective mineralised areas which host uranium and other associated minerals.</para>
<para>The reason why we in Western Australia are so keen to look at this topic is that, as anyone who knows anything about China and, indeed, East Asia as a whole would be aware, there is a massive air quality problem. There is a huge build on in China—some 30 new reactors at a cost of $A64 billion are going to be rolled out in the next 10 years. Western Australia and indeed the whole of Australia need to be a part of what is happening with respect to energy generation, particularly in East Asia.</para>
<para>I now turn to the quite interesting recent events surrounding former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, when he made a call for the storage in Australia of internationally generated radioactive waste. I was watching the former Prime Minister on television, and I must confess to being marginally cynical. I thought that what he was doing was only seeking to distract from the current furore arising from <inline font-style="italic">The Latham Diaries</inline> to give the now leader of his struggling party some breathing space. Of course, he did touch on—and I trust that he is sincere; I want him to be sincere because this is a very important debate—the storage of not just radioactive waste but toxic liquid solid waste generally, which is a major issue for Australia and for Australians.</para>
<para>I pause to say that, in terms of the storage of radioactive waste, Australia has pioneered a vitrification process called synroc, which locks up the dangerous radionuclides in a crystalline structure which, as nearly as possible, replicates the natural state of radioactive minerals prior to mining. A group of minerals that has the capacity to lock up those radionuclides is, for example, the pyrochlore group of minerals. Synroc is on the cutting edge and is world’s best practice in lead technology as to the storage and handling of high-level radioactive waste.</para>
<para>There is an enormous number of issues surrounding this subject, as former Prime Minister Hawke indicated, including transport, storage and all the surrounding protocols, rules and regulations. But this is a debate that Australia should have. And why should we have it? It is because our cities have thousands of tonnes of low-level and high-level toxic and radioactive waste being stored in their suburbs. There are substances such as PCBs, polychlorinated biphenyls, which would be highly dangerous and environmentally very serious if they were not handled properly and carefully. There are very large amounts of mercury in our suburbs, being by-products of our industrial processes. There are acids, including hydrofluoric acid, perchlorethylene and tetrachloroethylene, just to name a few. Were these substances to enter our watertables, there would be a major generational problem and a major environmental hazard long into the future.</para>
<para>In Western Australia, in the last five years we have had two major and serious environmental issues. The Brookdale waste disposal plant was simply an old sewage treatment plant that was converted by the Department of Environment in Western Australia to handle liquid toxic waste. In about 2001-02, lead levels 75 times higher than World Health Organisation limits were found at a local primary school adjacent to this facility. The Department of Environment in Western Australia has no long-term plan for the disposal and handling of liquid toxic waste or solid toxic waste and yet the Labor Party government in Western Australia say, ‘We will not allow uranium mining.’</para>
<para>On 15 February 2001 a small company which was storing toxic waste had a fire. It was found in a subsequent inquiry that that facility was storing large amounts of waste, far in excess of the Department of Environmental Protection licence regime that was in operation. The government had in fact sanctioned the breach of the licence. I pause to say that Labor, in power in Western Australia, have refused to compensate a neighbour to that fire who was wiped out and have refused to accept any responsibility for the ongoing management of these substances, yet they are opposed to the storage of radioactive waste in Australia and sit by and acquiesce on the illegal and improper storage of tonnes of problematic, highly toxic waste and other radioactive waste. The hypocrisy of Labor in Perth is unrivalled, particularly in contrast to the maintenance of their three-mines policy and their refusal to allow further uranium mining in Western Australia.</para>
<para>Indeed, Labor in Western Australia would have us believe that they are very environmentally conscious. Nothing could be further from the truth. In support of my allegation against them, let me recite to you what has been happening in Perth in the last four years, since Labor took over. Let us take our iconic Swan River in Perth, in Western Australia. There have recently been several large sewage spills. In September, just last month, an unknown quantity of raw sewage entered the Swan River at Bassendean through a stormwater drain due to some maladministration, neglect or foul-up in the Water Corporation’s sewerage management. In April this year, 250 kilolitres—that is, 250,000 litres—of raw sewage were pumped into the Swan River at South Perth through a stormwater drain. In October 2004, 2.5 million litres—that is, two Olympic size swimming pools—of raw sewage went into the Swan River. In 2003 there were three spills—in May, July and November—flooding 1.3 million litres of raw sewage into the Swan River. In January of that same year 50,000 litres went into the Swan River when a pump failed. In December 2001 we saw 160,000 litres spilled into the Canning River. In the last four years a total of over 4.2 million litres of raw sewage has entered the Swan River. This is the administration of Labor. This is the environmental awareness of Labor in Perth, in Western Australia.</para>
<para>Labor in WA have delayed the previous Court government’s infill sewerage program, which would have eliminated 111,000 septic tanks in backyards throughout suburban Perth, which would have substantially reduced the nitrogen and phosphorus levels in groundwater and entering the river. Labor have just said, ‘No, we’re going to do other things.’ This is the action of an environmental vandal as a government. It is against the backdrop of February 2000, when we had one of the worst toxic blue-green algae blooms—<inline font-style="italic">Microcystis aeruginosa</inline>—in the Swan River. You cannot swim in it, you cannot water ski on it, you cannot have anything to do with it. I am a sailor in Perth. The yacht club had to be closed because we could not sail on the Swan River because of the blue-green algae blooms. This is the background to Labor’s alleged environmental approach to stop uranium mining. They cannot look after domestic environment issues. They cannot be trusted with domestic environmental issues.</para>
<para>With all this sewage flowing into the Swan River, today the Water Corporation have announced a $420 million profit. What is happening to maintenance programming in their sewerage systems? It is simply outrageous. This is the record of a government that are opposed to uranium mining for stupid, crass, cheap, point-scoring, political motivations—a government in Western Australia that cannot manage their own environment in suburban Perth. It is a disgrace.</para>

</talker>
<para>—In recent sittings I have spoken a number of times about the record of the current government in the area of defence procurement activities. Thanks to the work of the Australian National Audit Office, we have a detailed record of a large number of exercises which really have gone off the rails. Moreover, by looking at each of these exercises individually, we can see a clear pattern of failure that has emerged. This is not a recent phenomenon. Failure to procure materiel on time and within budget is time honoured. Global budgets, single line appropriations and poor documentation make transparency extraordinarily difficult. We in the parliament therefore have limited ability to do much about this problem. That simply suits the government, as it is able to conceal its own bungling. It certainly would not be tolerated in any other portfolio, and any private sector company performing this way would be the subject of an ASX investigation as a matter of priority. Yet we are constantly told that Defence is different—there is no other operation like Defence anywhere; it is big, complex and holds $75 billion of Australian government assets. It is too big.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Frankly, none of this argument—none of this defence—washes at all. It is simple failure at the political level to ensure administrative accountability. There is always an excuse. There is always a light at the end of the tunnel. At present, we are shifting the deckchairs for the newly commercialised, business orientated Defence Materiel Organisation—the DMO. We are told that we have a new two-pass system. We are also told that it is the answer to all of our prayers. Yet we in this place know that all this is rhetoric. We fear it will not make the slightest amount of difference at all. The reason for that assertion is that the culture of the organisation remains unchanged. It is too easy to hide behind the mystique and glory of the defence of our nation and the glory of our flag. There is always an excuse for inactivity.</para>
<para>The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee reported on this subject in March 2003. Can anyone tell us what has happened to the recommendations of that particular report? The answer is: nothing. Senators might recall the recommendation that an annual report of progress on every capital acquisition project be prepared. What happened to that recommendation? That alone would help the parliament understand where tens of billions of dollars are being spent. Unfortunately, the fog still lies thick on that particular report.</para>
<para>At estimates every year we do our best to come to grips with the defence budget, including procurement policy. We are barely able to penetrate those reports. We receive plenty of bland assurances and generalities—and next time around it will be the same. In many cases the information sought is simply not available. The ANAO reports the same phenomenon—Defence simply do not know, nor do their contractors. I refer particularly to the report on the frigate upgrade project. What is presented as information in all the glossy documents and budget papers is incomplete. Sometimes it is contradictory. Often officials are unable to answer questions because they were not there at the time, there is no corporate memory or records do not exist. Regrettably, we do not have the resources we need to scrutinise; nor does the ANAO.</para>
<para>The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is also trying to come to grips with this issue. The result is that, year after year, this performance on procurement staggers on. By the way, this is not just about a few million dollars. In report No. 35 of 2004-05, the ANAO quote the finding of the due diligence inquiry conducted in the lead-up to the inception of the Defence Materiel Organisation. That exercise found that, since 1981, the amount spent on the top 64 procurement projects had been $11.8 billion above the original estimated amount. We can only guess what it might have been for the entire capital works program over that time. No-one has yet asked to look at the minor projects.</para>
<para>It is relevant to note that the minister refused to answer a question from Senator  Evans seeking information on cost blow-outs and delays on major capital projects. This was of course a complete fabrication, because the work had been done in the due diligence exercise for the DMO. This is simple deception. The government does not want anyone to know how bad things really are. More to the point, it is unknown what dilution of defence capacity has resulted. It is not the taxpayer who is being diddled here—it is the entire defence effort.</para>
<para>The glossy nature of the Defence Capability Plan is completely undermined by the repeated failure to deliver what is sought on time and at cost. In many cases, product specified at a price is both late and way over cost. Worse than this, cost cutting, which is the general solution, causes the order to be reduced and specifications to be deleted. The planned budget and capability are constantly compromised. Again, the frigate upgrade project is a classic example. Six frigates were contracted at an estimated cost of $890 million in 1997. The order was then reduced to four frigates at a cost today of almost $1.5 billion. Two-thirds of the budget will be spent by the end of this year, and not one ship has yet been delivered. A betting man would say that more of these ships will be mothballed yet. It goes without saying that this is a very serious issue and would not be tolerated in any public or private corporation outside government areas.</para>
<para>In passing, I should also mention that financial mismanagement is equally rampant. Huge sums of money have been paid in advance and have not been acquitted. Other equally large sums are parked in trust accounts to bypass the Treasury and to disguise low cash flow on slipping projects. However, I should say that we do accept that sometimes there might be mitigating circumstances. The key one which most frequently occurs is where there is advanced and perhaps as yet unknown technology. The very nature of defence activity is to maintain a critical edge. Where new technology is concerned, we know that around the world national defence provides the impetus for the adoption of that new technology. That in turn spins off into broader industry and eventually down the chain to consumer usage. Importantly for defence activity these days, it also significantly reduces the likelihood of casualties in an operational sense, hence the emphasis on remote control, reduced exposure and the use of the most sophisticated technology that is available.</para>
<para>Defence planners frequently ask their technical people to come up with things which are not yet in existence. Procurements such as these are therefore very difficult to cost but nevertheless require a commitment before the actual work can start. Aviation is one such area where new horizons are constantly being sought. The Joint Strike Fighter currently in design is perhaps a useful example in this context. Certainly, digital technology associated with radar, communications and weaponry is and will continue to be leading edge. Sadly, it also has a short life span with respect to obsolescence. Constantly we find that procurement plans are overtaken during development, although, it should be added, only because the delays accepted in the system make that outcome inevitable. So, sometimes, costs may be difficult to pin down early in the procurement cycle. Whether we accept that excuse, though, is debatable; it is up for argument. Certainly, manufacturers in the commercial market do not have that luxury. The lead times for commercial aircraft manufacture are similar, and companies such as Boeing manage in a fully competitive market and, I might add, have no problem tracking their stores and inventories, which are every bit as complex as those of Defence.</para>
<para>For those old enough it is worth remembering the decision to buy the F111. Speculation at that time concentrated on final price, its revolutionary swing wing design and its terrain-following radar capability. Yet that aircraft has become one of the most reliable and better performing aircraft of all time—so good, in fact, there are some who believe its planned service could be extended with a cost benefit over early purchase of the JSF. The debate we have now on the JSF was had then as well, in almost exactly the same terms. It may also be inevitable that, where there are drawn out planning and production schedules, current technology can be quickly superseded. The original systems in the Collins class submarines are a useful example. By the time construction was ready, computer technology had rendered the original obsolete; hence, extra cost down the line.</para>
<para>The longer the planning and construction phase the more likely this is to occur. Again, ANAO assessment is that time delays cause 89 per cent of cost overruns. The remainder is caused by added specification. In some cases, both these basic elements may be justified, but the overwhelming evidence is that they are not. Indeed, the most telling diagnosis of the Kinnaird report is that the most common failure is to get the original specifications correct; hence, the new two-pass system put up as a solution to this problem. Under this system initial approval is given to enable specifications to be accurately developed, followed by a second decision of commitment from government. Whether this will work is yet to be seen. But it does make sense to spend more on development up front prior to production rather than part way through. We simply could not imagine any commercial product manufacturer doing it any other way. There is more to this, though, and I will continue my remarks on this subject later this evening in the debate on the adjournment.</para>

<para>—In closing this debate on matters of public interest I want to commend Senator Johnston on his very thoughtful contribution on uranium mining in Australia. Senator Johnston very clearly articulated the absolute stupidity of the Labor Party’s position, where uranium from three mines in Australia seems to be okay but uranium from any other mine seems to be bad uranium. How anyone in the Labor Party can ever explain that policy is beyond me. I notice that many in the Labor Party never try to explain it, because they understand as well just what a stupid policy it is. I congratulate Senator Johnston on that very thoughtful address.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It did bring to mind how divided the Labor Party is on this. Senator Johnston mentioned Mr Bob Hawke and his support for opening up the debate on more uranium mining. In Queensland, big Bill Ludwig, the head of the ACTU there for many years and the father of Senator Joe Ludwig, has come out very strongly in favour of uranium mining in that state. One would only hope that big Bill Ludwig, the AWU boss and heavyweight, would, at a family gathering, encourage his son Joe to support the same sort of proposal. Senator Joe Ludwig is, of course, part of the Labor Party in this parliament and he is a person who could, I think, very significantly contribute to the Labor Party getting a more sensible policy on uranium mining.</para>
<para>I noticed Mr Ludwig Sr, the AWU heavyweight, was in Mount Isa criticising very severely the Queensland Labor Premier, Mr Peter Beattie, for his closed shop view on uranium mining. Mr Ludwig Sr, the AWU heavyweight, clearly understands that it is ridiculous for Australia to deny itself the export dollars that would come from additional uranium mining. Furthermore, Mr Bill Ludwig, the AWU heavyweight, understands the importance of jobs to Queensland were we able to mine uranium in that state.</para>
<para>Over the years the AWU has had a very strong influence on the Labor Party in Queensland. As a result of that influence it has enabled many current senators from Queensland to be elected to this parliament. I hope that those senators from Queensland elected with the support and imprimatur of the AWU faction in Queensland heed the warning of Mr Ludwig Sr and do something about uranium mining and the ridiculous ALP policy. Mr Bill Ludwig understands that there is absolutely no sense or significance whatsoever in the Labor Party’s closed shop policy towards uranium mining in Australia. Mr Bill Ludwig also understands that jobs for Queenslanders are at risk because of the Labor Party’s policy. Mr Bill Ludwig has been very forthright in supporting uranium mining. I certainly hope that his son, Senator Joe Ludwig, who has now joined us in the chamber, will take up his father’s call and will criticise even harder Mr Beattie and the federal Labor leadership for their closed shop view on uranium mining. I hope that the Labor Party will join the government in a more expansive view on uranium mining for Australia.</para>

<para>—My question is directed to Senator Hill in his capacity as Minister for Defence and as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can the minister indicate what steps the government has taken to encourage the Indonesian government to ban the terrorist organisation Jemaah Islamiah? Wouldn’t the act of banning this organisation send a very clear legal, political and moral message to the community, both in Australia and in Indonesia, that these sorts of organisations will not be tolerated? Wouldn’t it also allow Indonesia to shut down schools and training camps that are run by JI as recruitment centres for their terrorist network? Wouldn’t a comprehensive ban on JI also provide a criminal basis for Indonesian prosecutors to act against the organisation? Will the government now use its influence in the region to encourage the Indonesian government to take this most important step?</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Evans for his question. The Australian government will continue to urge the Indonesian government to strengthen further its counter-terrorism laws, including by outlawing Jemaah Islamiah. That would bolster the legal tools available to Indonesian authorities in pursuing the wider JI network and underline Indonesia’s resolve to fight terrorism. It would not of course in itself reduce the threat from JI as a secretive terrorist organisation increasingly working through loose networks drawing on individuals with no formal links to JI.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government is working closely with Indonesia and other regional countries to counter this evolving threat on a number of fronts. It has committed more than $250 million to this goal since 2004, including more than $50 million for Indonesia to boost counter-terrorism capabilities in areas like law enforcement, border control and transport security. It also includes enhancements of efforts with Indonesia and its neighbours to address terrorist movements between countries of the region for operations, training and refuge. We are also supporting efforts such as a regional interfaith dialogue to empower moderate voices to contest extremist ideologies peddled by JI and its supporters. Ultimately, Indonesians themselves will decide how best to fight this insidious threat, including how to treat JI as a terrorist organisation. In our view, it is important that all states make clear their profound disapproval of such organisations and their activities. Australia remains committed to playing its part in what will clearly be a long-term challenge.</para>

<para>—Australia realistically cannot do more than make representations. We have made them in the past; we will continue to do so. I understand Mr Downer has indicated that he will be travelling to Indonesia to further press this issue. We do understand, and I acknowledged yesterday, the number of measures that Indonesia has taken to address this threat. We also understand the complexity in the issue of banning JI. If it were simple, Indonesia would have already done so. It is very reluctant to drive those who may support this organisation underground, for obvious reasons. It is also very reluctant to lose the support of a more moderate element of the community that may be on the fringe of these organisations. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I thank Senator Troeth for her question and note her longstanding interest in electoral matters and in ensuring that we have a fair and robust electoral system in this country. The government is committed to improving Australia’s democracy and to creating a fairer electoral system for all. Last night at the Sydney Institute I outlined moves to ensure that we have an electoral roll which is both rigorous and fair.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is often said—and it is true—that it is easier to get onto the electoral roll than it is to hire a video. All one need do today to get on the roll is to sign the form and get someone else to witness it—it is not very rigorous at all. Just ask Mike Kaiser, the disgraced Labor roll rorter who is now chief of staff to the New South Wales Labor Premier. Those opposite might recall that Peter Beattie, the Premier of Queensland, said, ‘We will drum roll rorters out of the party.’ All they did was drum him over the state border and straight into the chief of staff position of the New South Wales Premier. Ask the Labor operative in Queensland that went to jail for roll rorting in the year 2000.</para>
<para>The government will move to tighten the requirements for getting on the electoral roll, requiring citizens to produce either a prescribed form of identification or to have someone from a prescribed class of witnesses vouch for their identity in the same vein as a statutory declaration. This is going to remove opportunities such as when in 1990 Curacao Fischer Catt—somebody’s pet—was put onto the electoral roll in the seat of Macquarie.</para>
<para>Another serious issue is the potential for the roll to be used to create false identities to help perpetrate other crimes, including social security fraud. For example, electoral enrolment can be used to count for 25 points in a 100-point identity check. I was also asked about alternative policies. I thought for the benefit of those opposite we would have another ‘Who said it?’ This was said about the Labor changes made in 1984:</para>

I refer the minister to his comments yesterday, and similar comments by the Minister for Justice and Customs and others, that there was no specific intelligence that could have helped prevent the bombing in Bali last weekend. Is the government satisfied that Australia’s intelligence systems worked effectively, despite not being alerted to any real prospect of an imminent terrorist attack? Can the minister indicate whether the government plans to review Australia’s intelligence system to help ensure that the likelihood of advance warnings of further attacks in the future can be improved?</para>

<para>—I reflect back on the recent experience in London. Suicide bombers are very difficult to predict. We have substantially enhanced our intelligence coverage on the issue of terrorism within South-East Asia in recent years. We have significantly improved cooperation and communication with equivalent agencies in other South-East Asian countries. We certainly have a much enhanced picture of Jemaah Islamia than we had a few years ago. We know a lot about its structure, its leadership and its techniques. We have information on believed training establishments, particularly now outside of Indonesia. But, as I said yesterday, specific intelligence on a particular attack is rarely obtained in these circumstances. It was not obtained in Bali 1, it was not obtained in Madrid, it was not obtained in London, it was not obtained in Morocco, it was not obtained in Saudi Arabia, and unfortunately such information was not available in Bali 2.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I have real confidence in Australia’s intelligence agencies. I think they are working exceptionally well in the Australian interest in terms of a better understanding of this terrorist threat in our region. There is obviously a great deal we now know that we did not know a few years ago, but unfortunately there will still be occasions when that critical bit of information simply will not be available, either to us or to, as in this case, Indonesia. In many ways you would expect it would come to the Indonesian authorities before the Australian authorities.</para>

<para>—Perhaps the most difficult issue of all is what to put in travel warnings. Obviously, soundly based intelligence would clearly be taken into account. Something that is less sound creates quite difficult circumstances and difficult judgments to be made. We rely on capable professional advice in this regard—in particular, the advice of the National Threat Assessment Centre, which, as I said, takes into account what threat information is known and sometimes other considerations as well. In the case of the travel advice for Indonesia of 3 October, it is a fact that there were reports of general and specific bomb and terrorist threats following the 1 October bombings and, in bringing some of these to the attention of the Australian public, it was also made clear that the government had nothing to corroborate such reports. I think that that gives Australians the best information that we have and therefore we meet our responsibility in doing so. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

Will the minister update the Senate on recently announced reforms to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act? What is the nature of the proposed reforms and how will they benefit Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory? Is the minister also able to assure the Senate that the rights of traditional owners enshrined in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act will not be eroded as a result of government reforms?</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Scullion, a senator for the Northern Territory with a long-standing interest in these issues, for the question. I will answer the second question first, and the answer is: yes, I can assure the Senate that the rights of traditional owners will in no way be interfered with by this legislation—in fact, quite the opposite. I am sure that Senator Scullion knows that what we are doing is creating opportunities for traditional owners to finally get some income from land in townships.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is understood that Aboriginal land can now be leased, but it is a long and difficult process. It can take two years to renegotiate a 10-year lease and seven years for other leases. This provides a very strong disincentive to people to engage in lease arrangements because they cannot do so with any security. And, of course, when you do not have security in respect of your lease, you do not put as much investment in. These changes will make it simpler and easier for township residents, either in businesses or homes, to get long-term leases.</para>
<para>The scheme is entirely voluntary. Nothing will change unless traditional owners want it to. In fact, it will operate in a way very similar to that operating in the ACT, where the government continues to own the underlying freehold title and people get a 99-year lease over the land—a leasehold interest. This scheme is not exactly the same as that but similar because, under the proposed scheme, the traditional owners will continue to hold the underlying communal title to the land. They will still own the land. Township residents would get a long-term lease over the land—a leasehold interest. The changes will not affect the traditional owners’ right of veto. The government will not compulsorily acquire Aboriginal land. We are simply providing an opportunity. At the moment, if you live in a township on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory and you want to buy your own home, you have to leave your community. Other people do not have to do that, and we want to change that.</para>
<para>The scheme will work like this: traditional owners will decide, voluntarily, if they want to do this. And what they could do is provide a head lease over a township to an organisation that would be set up by the Northern Territory government. That lease would be for 99 years. The traditional owners, in setting up that lease with the Northern Territory government organisation, could set other broad conditions of the lease, including rent of up to five per cent of the value of the land.</para>
<para>If town residents then want a long-term lease over their home or a business they apply to the Northern Territory organisation for a sublease. That will be quicker and more efficient than current arrangements. The traditional owners and the Northern Territory entity will do all the negotiations to set the terms of the head lease, and any subleases will be subject to those terms. In other words, traditional owners have all the control they want and need. There is no need for individuals then to go through protracted negotiations each time with traditional owners and land councils. They will only need to apply to the Northern Territory entity for a sublease.</para>
<para>This is about protecting the rights of traditional owners, and opening up new opportunities for them to get income and new opportunities for other people to have security of tenure over their home or their business where they can put in some investment, have some security and attract more investment. We are doing something here to empower Indigenous people, providing opportunities and choices.</para>
<para>I welcome the cautious support offered by Senator Evans in relation to this. It is a pleasant change from his remarks last night, which indicated there had not been adequate consultation on this issue—in fact, suggesting that these negotiations had been conducted in secret. But, be that as it may, I welcome the turnaround and I, of course, welcome the support of the Northern Territory government for this change. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talk.start>
<para>In direct contrast to a press release put out by the Australian Democrats’ Senator Andrew Bartlett, headed ‘Aboriginal rights next to be attacked by extremist government’, in fact what is happening here is that legislation is being introduced to give further opportunities to first Australians—real opportunities. It will give them the same opportunities that people around Australia—including, for example, our friends from Warrnambool in the gallery—have: to have some security over the place where they live and where they work.</para>
<para>Remoteness and low education and employment levels are, of course, fundamental issues, and these reforms do not address those issues. But we do not resile from those difficult issues. There are other things to be done. But, if we can make this change, we will improve the situation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—My question is directed to Senator Hill, representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Can the minister indicate whether the government has confidence in the effectiveness of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s travel advisory system? Hasn’t the travel advisory for Indonesia, including Bali, recommended the deferral of all non-essential travel to that country for at least the last 12 months? Despite this strong warning, don’t thousands of Australians, including MPs from both sides of this parliament, continue to travel to Bali each year? Is the government now considering a further review of the travel advisory system, given that it appears not to have an impact on the travel plans of Australians?</para>

<para>—We see our responsibility as providing what information we know to the Australian public in order that they can take that into account in their travel plans. As Senator Evans has said, for some years we have been warning of the risks in relation to Bali and Indonesia generally. I think it is fair to say that Australians are generally aware of the general tenor of the travel advisory, and I think travel agents generally do make the travelling public aware. But the decision to travel is ultimately for the individual, and in our democracy we do not see it as the right or responsibility of the government to prohibit individual travel. So individuals will continue to make decisions taking into account the risks, and I do not think that that is in any way an indictment of the travel advisory.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Some might say that that is the public taking undue risks. On the other hand, the public in many ways also has the right not to be intimidated by these threats and, in weighing the threats and determining not to be intimidated—to not allow terrorism to significantly alter their way of life—they are in fact not allowing themselves to be defeated by this threat. It is very difficult for the government to interfere in that thought process as well. So I think the travel advisories do their job. They inform the public, and I think each individual has the right to make their own decision about whether or not to travel after taking into account that information.</para>

<para>—In relation to the last point, I answered that in the previous question. It might have been that Senator Evans was thinking of something else. I do not see this as a criticism of the travel advisory. If there was evidence that people were unaware of the advice then there might be further steps that government could take. If there was evidence that people disbelieved it, perhaps there might be other ways to emphasise its importance—but I have not seen that evidence. I think people witnessed the experience of the first Bali attack, the horrors of the first Bali attack, in which 88 Australians were killed. They have seen a further attack on Australian interests, our own embassy in Jakarta late last year. They know of the attack on the Marriott in Jakarta. They know these threats exist within Indonesia but they were still determined to have their annual holiday, and it is their right to do so if that is their wish. They can take into account the travel advisories but, in the end, people are responsible for the decisions they make. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I thank Senator Mason for the question. Yesterday I advised the Senate that there were some 35 personnel in Bali representing Australian policing. That number has now risen to 41 and by tomorrow will be up to 45. Many of these officers have had experience, through our investigations of the Marriott bombing, the previous Bali bombing in October 2002 and of course the embassy bombing last year. We have now been joined by the British Metropolitan Police and the FBI, but I can say that in relation to foreign policing Australian police are the highest in number, and I think that is a significant aspect of the status we are given and the regard in which we are held in Indonesia. We continue to enjoy very close working relationships with the Indonesian authorities. And I can say that the diversity of expertise that we have there covers a broad range of policing activities, be it investigative, intelligence, forensic or indeed family liaison officers.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I said yesterday that some 5,000 returning passengers have been interviewed. I can now say that 4,000 have completed questionnaires and, of those 4,000, 185 have provided information which is material to the investigation. As I have said, any information that the public can provide would be gladly accepted by the Australian Federal Police. We are leaving no stone unturned in the investigation of this matter and we are totally committed to bringing to justice all those who are responsible for this outrageous act.</para>
<para>There have been of course a number of rumours circulating, and I want to clarify at the outset that there has been no arrest to date in relation to this matter. Some people have been questioned; I understand that they have now been released. But I think that it is wise for people to rely on official statements from either the Indonesian National Police or the Australian Federal Police in this matter. It is quite normal in this environment for there to be rumours circulating but it certainly does not help matters that people act on rumours and regard them as fact when indeed they are not.</para>
<para>Some concern has also been expressed over the question of a remission for Abu Bakar Bashir. As applies in the Indonesian judicial system, on Idul Fitri at the end of Ramadan in November, there is an automatic remission which applies across the board to a variety of prisoners—and also on Indonesian Independence Day. We understand that, in the normal course of events, under the system Abu Bakar Bashir and 19 other convicted terrorists would benefit from these remissions and we have protested as such to the Indonesian government. This does not send a good message in relation to the fight against terrorism, and we are certainly checking our reports in Indonesia that the remissions will be applied.</para>
<para>I understand that the President, when he met with the Prime Minister on 16 September this year, indicated that he would review these remissions, and we continue to make representations in the strongest possible terms to Indonesia that remissions should not apply to anyone convicted of a terrorist offence and that, should it do so, it certainly sends the wrong message. But I can say that we continue to enjoy a very close working relationship with the Indonesian authorities and we have had nothing but the strongest commitment from them in their resolve to find those responsible for this outrageous attack.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I thank Senator Ronaldson for his question and for his interest in these important issues. The answer is that I am aware of the discussions surrounding the effects of regulation on the telecommunications sector and I can inform the Senate that there is some material evidence that was released this week. The Australian Communications and Media Authority released its analysis of how telecommunications carriers performed in 2004-05. I am pleased to say that the figures show that Telstra completed 96 per cent of its connections within the time frames required by the government’s customer service guarantee and that the proportion of repairs completed on time rose one per cent to 92 per cent. Prior to the introduction of the customer service guarantee by the Howard government, people could wait up to 27 months. The time frame is now a maximum of 20 days. Optus connected 99 per cent of its CSG-eligible customers and repaired 98 per cent of faults within the required time frames. AAPT achieved 97 per cent for connections and 98 per cent for faults while Primus achieved 95 per cent for connections and 98 per cent for faults. Under Telstra’s network reliability framework, for each month in 2004-05, an average of 99.06 per cent of services had no faults. These figures are very positive for Australian consumers and demonstrate the success and importance of the tough regulated consumer safeguards that the government has imposed on telecommunications providers.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I was asked about alternative policies. Under Labor, I think it is fair to say that no thought was given as to how to best regulate telecommunications services for consumers. Labor did not have a customer service guarantee, a network reliability framework or any priority assistance. In fact, when Labor privatised the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas, CSL and just about anything else that was not nailed down, it did so by stealth and squandered the proceeds. I am sorry to say that the ALP’s performance on telecommunications is unlikely to improve any time soon. We know from the recent well-publicised book, <inline font-style="italic">The Latham Diaries</inline>, that communications spokesman, Senator Conroy, told Mr Latham that he did not have any strong policy interests. Mr Latham said: ‘Stephen Conroy told me he does not have any strong policy interests and maybe he would like the communications portfolio, which I gave him. It is a frank admission. Machine men are not interested in policy, only factions and patronage.’</para>
<para>I can assure the Australian people that, unlike Senator Conroy and his colleagues, the Howard government are vitally interested in providing consumers with competitive telecommunications services that meet their needs. We have backed our strong policy commitments not only with words but also with a $3.1 billion package to ensure that services around the country are adequate, both now and into the future.</para>

<para>In addition to that, we have set up our Joint Offshore Protection Command, which will bring together all those assets. We saw that the other day when the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Geraldton</inline> was tasked to investigate an incident where the skipper of a WA fishing vessel alleged that two Indonesian fishermen tried to board his vessel. That was a matter which we investigated. They have been charged with offences under the Fisheries Act. We understand that they claimed that it was a risk of life situation and that that was the reason for their attempted boarding. But, nonetheless, we take that very seriously.</para>
<para>The question also raises the spectre of organised crime. We have said repeatedly in relation to the recent incursions that they have been more organised than just the traditional fishing vessels that we have seen in the past. I have asked Customs and the Australian Federal Police to look into the question of the organised syndicates or groups backing these people. We are not convinced that transnational criminal networks are involved; we think that is more applicable to the Southern Ocean. Nonetheless, we are using our resources in the region to investigate this. I opened a Customs office in Jakarta in April this year, and we are using that office and Australian Federal Police in the region working with our overseas posts to gauge the extent of the organised nature of the fishing that we are seeing, which emanates mainly from Indonesia.</para>
<para>When I was in Jakarta two months ago I raised this with my counterparts. They expressed a concern in relation to the increased organised fishing that Indonesia was experiencing, primarily from other countries in South-East Asia. This had, in effect, a flow-on result for us in that the organised illegal fishing coming down to Indonesia was in fact pushing their fishing further south towards Australia. We are very keen to work with the Indonesians in relation to controlling our borders and in relation to incursions. I believe that the Indonesian government is similarly concerned at the growth of organised illegal fishing.</para>
<para>Last week I was in East Timor and I raised it with my ministerial counterparts there. We have a joint petroleum venture area and we can go into that large section of water but not without consent from the East Timorese. We need that sort of cooperation in the region in order to effectively defeat the threat of illegal fishing.</para>
<para>We have said that this is a regional issue. Senator Ian Macdonald and I met with state fishing ministers just recently and we want to bring on board all the states and territories in order to conduct this fight against illegal fishing. But I can tell you that in a recent operation in the gulf we had cooperation from the Northern Territory and Queensland but not so from Western Australia. We had the <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Viking</inline>, which fired shots and was instrumental in arresting four vessels. Yet Western Australia would not participate because they said it was not in their backyard. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The $94 million goes to very good work being done by Senator Ian Macdonald in guarding our fishing stock in this country. It is an essential part of the fight against illegal fishing. It is a matter of record that in previous budgets we increased greatly our aerial surveillance and also our patrol boat hours in relation to guarding our borders. It was essential that we provide the back-up to Fisheries in order to process those illegal fishermen. This does require a whole of government approach and whole of governments approach. All we are asking is for the states and territories to join with us in that exercise, but it is a shame that in Western Australia we do not get the cooperation that we get from Queensland and the Northern Territory.</para>

<para>—My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade, Senator Hill. Can the minister confirm that the federal government has encouraged Australian citrus growers to vacate the domestic market and to concentrate increasingly on exporting their product? Can he also confirm that Australian citrus growers are suffering from unfair competition from imported products such that Brazilian refrigerated tankers unload fresh orange juice at Australian ports while Australian growers are unable to sell low-grade fruit for juice in Australia? Further, will the government now invoke emergency safeguard measures under the World Trade Organisation rules to increase tariffs on imported citrus products, as the United States has already done, and review Australia’s antidumping laws to address the disadvantage Australian producers face?</para>

<para>—The Australian government would like to see citrus growers thrive on the domestic and overseas markets. The Australian government is committed to supporting Australian rural industry to grow and to prosper. A great deal of effort has been put in by this government in opening up bilateral trade opportunities that were totally overlooked by previous governments. At the same time, this government is also endeavouring, through the multilateral round, to provide a more level playing field. So, in terms of the government’s aspiration, yes, we want citrus growers to be able to succeed domestically and on the international market and we will continue to work towards that objective. In relation to specific details concerning the citrus industry, I will refer that back to the Minister for Trade and hopefully I might get some further information in the near future.</para>

If so, isn’t it a breach of the WTO rules to tie market access for one product to market access for another? Doesn’t it also demonstrate the perils of negotiating a free trade agreement with China?

<para>—With great respect, the supplementary question seemed to me to be all over the shop. Food security for Australians is not the issue at point. The issue at point is: how can we get fair access into international markets? This government has worked harder than any government of recent times in providing new and better access through bilateral agreements as well as continuing its efforts in the multilateral round. This is the only way. The honourable senator does not seem to appreciate that the Australian domestic market will always be limited. The great opportunity to expand is the potential beyond the domestic market. That is why this government is so committed to widening the opportunities—not putting up new barriers, as the honourable senator would suggest, which would simply deem that there will always be a limited and restricted opportunity for growers. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—My question is to Senator Ian Macdonald, the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation. Is the minister aware of serious concerns in the Australian fishing industry about the impact of illegal fish poaching on our fish stocks? Hasn’t the growth of illegal fishing also led to incidents of illegal Indonesian fishing crews setting up camp on the Australian coast? Can the minister confirm the number of times this has occurred in the last 12 months? Given that the illegal fishermen also carry animals on their boats, don’t these landings represent a serious quarantine risk? Along with the major threat to our fish stocks, doesn’t the increasing number of illegal fishing boats also have the potential to undermine the security of our borders and, in addition, cause the spread of exotic diseases?</para>

<name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name>
</talker>
<para>—I thank Senator O’Brien for the question, which does raise some issues that are of very great concern to the Australian government. The concern we have, of course, has resulted in substantially increased assets for all of our agencies dealing with the incursion of illegal foreign fishermen, particularly, at this stage of the game, from Indonesia. I do understand—I think it was the first question Senator O’Brien asked—that the commercial fishing industry treats that with some seriousness. I have discussed this with them at length. I consider it to be very serious as well. That is why the Howard government has substantially increased its response to this threat. Back in Labor days, if anyone can remember back to those times, I think their record haul of illegal foreign fishing vessels up in the north was about 40. So far this year, we have apprehended some 135, I think, at last count. The effort that is put into it demonstrates why we are catching so many more.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Senator O’Brien also asked about the setting up of camp on the mainland. There have been reports of that. I have to say that a lot of those reports have not been confirmed. When they are confirmed, either we get the state authorities—and, of course, it is in state areas—to go and look at it or we send Commonwealth authorities to go and look at it. Where there have been incursions, the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service immediately puts into place their plans to ensure the security of any areas that have been landed upon by foreign nationals. In the incident Senator Ellison just spoke about in Western Australia where these Indonesian fishermen boarded an Australian vessel—I think by mistake—but were later apprehended by the Australian authorities, they were not on the land when they were apprehended but there was a suggestion they had been on the land. Immediately, the Australian government authorities went in to secure that particular site and make sure there was nothing left there that could be a problem.</para>
<para>Senator O’Brien further asked me about animals and serious quarantine risk. I have heard about monkeys and fowls and all sorts of things, but I am not sure that those rumours have ever actually been confirmed. If there is any evidence of animals on board vessels and that land, as I say, there is a plan that would be put in place immediately to secure the area and to ensure the quarantine protocol.</para>
<para>Senator O’Brien further asked whether this demonstrates a problem with our border security. Quite the contrary: the amount of effort that the Howard government has put into the north is quite remarkable. Navy, Customs, Coastwatch, Fisheries, Quarantine and Immigration people do a magnificent job. We do rely on support from the fishing industry, who give us some intelligence. We also work very closely with the Indonesian government in the fight against illegal fishing. We continue to talk with Indonesian ministers, not only in the instance that Senator Ellison mentioned but during the Australian-Indonesian Ministerial Forum in Canberra where this issue was long and roundly canvassed. Senator Ian Campbell recently spoke with an Indonesian minister about the same issue. The Indonesian and Timorese ministers are visiting Australia in November to further discuss this matter with me. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

In that context and given the threat posed by both illegal fish poaching and illegal landing from fishing vessels that is current and real, I wonder why the budget did not provide for an increase in the patrol vessel capacity in our northern waters to counter this threat?

<para>—There has been substantial increased capacity and that continues to be reviewed by the government, and we will allocate resources as the risk requires. I might use the opportunity that Senator O’Brien has afforded me to talk about this figure of 8,000 that is bandied around. This was something the state ministers were talking about because they misunderstood the information until they got a briefing. The Queensland and Northern Territory ministers now understand how this figure is calculated. It is not really that number of sightings: there are double countings, triple countings, quadruple countings; there are things right on the border; and there are boats in the MOU box. Unfortunately, the Western Australian minister still waffles in his ignorance. He was to come to two meetings that I had arranged to explain this to him, and on both occasions he did not bother to turn up. No wonder he waffles in his ignorance because he simply does not understand. When we wanted Western Australian fisheries officers to attack this problem, he refused to make them available. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I thank Senator Heffernan for that question on the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and the river basin. It is Australia’s biggest river system and our most productive river basin. Senator Heffernan, my Liberal colleague, lives slap bang in the middle of the basin. Actually, before he was in this place, he earnt his living from the basin, so he understands this matter very well. The government has taken a very strong lead in conservation work in the Murray-Darling Basin through the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. Under the constitutional set-up in Australia, of course, the states have the land management and water management rights, but through the Murray-Darling Basin Commission the Commonwealth government has been able to show a leadership role.</para>

<para>In 2003, in conjunction with the relevant states, we announced the Living Murray initiative whereby we pledged to recover an average of 500 gigalitres of additional flow in the Murray to help conserve outcomes for six very important ecological sites. Mr President, you might recall that, before the last election, the Labor Party got a bit thingy about the Murray-Darling Basin. Mr Latham, their then leader, supported by all of the crowd opposite, promised to put 450 gigalitres in, whereas the government had already agreed to 500 gigalitres with the states to help with ecological sites. This was to help the Barmah-Millewa Forest, the Gunbower and Koondrook-Perricoota forests, the Hattah lakes, the Chowilla floodplain, the River Murray channel and the lower Coorong and Murray mouth system.

<para>—It is infinitely more than has ever been done before, and that is why this government is recognised as the greenest government ever in Australian history. We are looking for the additional 260 gigalitres needed to meet that 500 gigalitre goal. Unfortunately, the states, particularly the New South Wales government—and I have to commend Victoria; they have been much more proactive—have been very slow in identifying the additional infrastructure required to get that additional flow. Senator Brown, if you have a concern, instead of giving the Labor Party preferences in New South Wales, you might really put some pressure on the New South Wales Labor government to address that problem.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>While I am on that, during our Murray-Darling Basin Commission Ministerial Council meetings—and we just had one last Friday in Brisbane—over a period of years ministers have committed to doing certain things in the Murray-Darling Basin which will help to protect it. Ministers have gone out after those meetings and with great gusto announced the work. All the Labor ministers have been there along with the Commonwealth ministers. We get a lot of praise for the work we commit to do. A couple of years later, though, when we then have to fund the work that everyone has roundly shouted from the rooftops about, we find that the Labor state governments will not put up the money. They agree to do the work but they, particularly New South Wales, simply come and say, ‘I know we have agreed to do all of these things, but we are not going to give you the money to do them.’ I have to say that the New South Wales state government is a serial offender in that. It is aided, supported and abetted by the Victorian government, but I think only out of solidarity to the Labor movement. The Victorian government is much better at it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—No, I am certainly not aware of the comments attributed to the Prime Minister by Senator Conroy. The situation is that the government has had a very longstanding policy to implement media ownership reforms, which includes the relaxation of the foreign ownership restrictions and the relaxation of the cross-media reforms whilst maintaining the specific media concentration rules and with a view to protecting diversity. So the current position is that there are under consideration a number of responses to digital reviews that have been mandated in the legislation. Included in those digital reviews are a number of matters which are self-executing in any event, such as some relaxations that will happen quite irrespective of whether or not the government makes another decision, because they are mandated to occur within the legislation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government has committed to reforming media ownership laws because they are outmoded, and even Senator Conroy would appreciate, although he has not a strong interest in communications or in media—he has admitted that; it has been well documented in Mr Latham’s diaries that he has not much interest in communications—that there are a number of other platforms now available and a plethora of ways in which people can now get news and views over a number of other platforms besides the regulated platforms that the government has under consideration as part of the reforms that it has on tap.</para>
<para>What is happening, as is well known, is well documented and was referred to at great length in my address to the Press Club, is that we are currently consulting with all stakeholders—certainly not just those who run media businesses but all stakeholders—including people such as rights owners and all of those who have an interest and a stake in ensuring that the government puts in place a framework that will be responsive to the new and emerging media environment. So I am continuing to consult with stakeholders, obviously with the authority of the government to do so, as a means of achieving these goals to ensure that we can place media companies in a position to take advantage of all of the new platforms and all of the new technologies whilst at the same time protecting diversity, because the end game is that consumers must have the benefit of these reforms together with the industry.</para>
<para>Senator Conroy is quite wrong to imply that any decisions have been made about any of these matters. He is quite wrong to impute to the Prime Minister any particular ruling out of any of these proposals. We will continue to put in place a framework that will be responsive and will deliver, as we do with all of our policy positions, for the benefit of all Australians.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the minister’s failure to provide either an answer or an explanation.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I point out that my office contacted the office of the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing and indicated that I would request an answer from the minister today. So this is disappointing. Maybe it is because of the mix-up and not being recognised at this end of the chamber. I do not know. Maybe that was an opportunity to sneak out, as it were.</para>
<para>I do ask that the Senate note that these questions were asked back in May, so they are now four months overdue. I will just go through them. I asked the minister to confirm that the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee report of the Working Party on the Registration of Drugs for Use in Children was completed way back in 1997 for the Therapeutic Goods Administration and to provide an outline of the recommendations made by that working party, what action had been planned and what action had been taken to implement the recommendations of that working party, whether the working party had been discontinued—as I suspect it has—and, if so, what follow-up studies had been established. We are talking about drugs for children, and I would have thought there would be some urgency in responding to such questions—unless, of course, this is so embarrassing that the government is not able to do so.</para>
<para>I also asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing whether the government had undertaken any investigations into the factors that have contributed to the increase in government rebates for IVF services over the past 10 years and, if so, whether a copy could be provided of any information or report resulting from investigations; what groups, if any, were consulted prior to May 2005 regarding possible restrictions on access to Medicare rebates for IVF procedures; what data the government had on the proportion of Australian women accessing IVF services; changes in the proportion over the past 10 years; and the range and average number of IVF cycles undertaken by a fertile woman. I also asked for information to be provided on the average out-of-pocket costs for women on a single cycle of IVF over the past 10 years. I asked that question at a time when this debate was under way in the community. It was my view that we could not have a proper debate unless that information had been provided. It is four months on and it is still not here and the minister is not in this place to explain why it is that that information has not been provided.</para>
<para>I think it is the case that I have about 11 questions that have not been answered and that are similarly long outstanding. I could probably stand here for the rest of the afternoon going through them but I would expect the same situation to apply—that is, the minister is not here or available to explain why it is that answers have not been provided. I notice that Minister Hill is still in the chamber. On a number of occasions I have made a request with respect to his answer to my question No. 29, which was put on notice on 16 November last year and still remains unanswered by Senator Hill. I think it is appalling that the government shows so little interest and so little regard for questions that are properly put.</para>

Here again we have seen a government very dismissive about requests for the production of documents in this place—returns to order.

There is no rhyme or reason why half of them are even used or constitute reasonable reasons for not allowing the Senate to have those documents. I put this to you in a very well-considered letter and asked you to respond. It is now almost a year and I still do not have any answer from you. Senator Hill, you are as bad as anybody else, as far as I can see, in being so dismissive of the Senate and its right, I would argue, to access information and documents as necessary.</para>

<para>It is a disappointment that the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing is not here. No doubt she will say she did not get notice from my office. I will check again.

<para>—Thank you. I noted an interjection earlier about this being a matter for the MPI today. The reason that we are taking note is the incredible answers provided by Ministers Ellison and Ian Macdonald today. Frankly, the thrust of the questions was to point out the dramatic increase in illegal fishing in Australia’s northern waters and the paucity of the government response as to why additional resources in the form of additional vessels had not been applied to dealing with the problem.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>We had a question from Senator Sterle about organised crime being involved, and Minister Ellison acceded to the proposition that organised crime is believed to be involved. We had Senator Sterle talking about small, inexpensive vessels constructed on the Indonesian island of Roti being used because, if they were captured, they could easily be replaced. I understand that Minister Ellison acceded to that proposition. We had Minister Ian Macdonald acceding—reluctantly nevertheless—to the proposition that illegal fishermen were supposed to be setting up camp on the Australian coastline and that there was intelligence that suggested they were bringing animals onto the coastline that would create a quarantine risk for this country. Minister Macdonald tried to explain that away by saying, ‘After the event, we send some crews in where we know there has been an incursion and we try and deal with the problem.’ The fact of the matter is that there are thousands of incursions, and Minister Macdonald suggesting that 135 interceptions and apprehensions is a good statistic in the light of thousands of incursions is, frankly, an admission that the government is incapable of dealing with this new threat.</para>
<para>Minister Macdonald suggested that, although Coastwatch had observed more than 8,000 vessels, there was double or triple counting and the number was not anywhere near 8,000. He did not say, of course, that Coastwatch do not look at every area every day, so what they observe is not necessarily the actual number of incursions that is taking place. If you reduce the 8,000 by a factor of two or three and then multiply it by the number of days and areas that they are not involved in, you are probably back to a figure of around 8,000, if not more, incursions into Australian waters. That is over 20 incursions a day into Australian waters, with pillaging of Australian fishing stocks.</para>
<para>The intelligence is that the shark fishery in Indonesian waters is such that the stock is in danger and the fishermen are now coming into Australian waters to take shark because shark fin is so valuable in South-East Asian markets. The government have no response to that. The government say that they are building a detention centre in Darwin and they are finding a place to incarcerate fishermen that are captured, but they are only capturing a small number of fishermen, and the modus operandi of the fishermen has changed so that they are in smaller groups and in smaller vessels spread across the fishery, perhaps with mother ships outside Australian waters. The government have no response to this way of predating upon the Australian fishing stocks.</para>
<para>Is it any wonder, as is conceded by Minister Macdonald, that the Australian fishing industry is alarmed that we have no response to illegal fishermen predating upon and endangering the fishing stock in Australian waters, endangering the livelihood of Australian fishermen and at the same time introducing risk to the Australian coastline and threatening to board Australian vessels? The situation shows that the government has failed to protect Australia’s oceans and failed to protect Australia’s borders and it brings the government’s claim of being strong on border protection into stark relief as being, in this area, an abject failure. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I rise with some amazement in this debate on the motion to take note of answers on illegal fishing. I understood when I came to this place that the idea is that the opposition pick on something that the government is weak in. I am absolutely amazed that they have decided to push an attack once again on our wondrous and probably without peer border protection. It is seen that way around the world. The globe continually looks to Australia for leadership in this area. I am miffed that we could not find something else to talk about today.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am very proud to be part of a government that has a record of dealing with some of the most sophisticated threats to our northern fishery. It is not that we are always dealing with 200-metre vessels that have the most sophisticated GPS. The sophistication of the challenge is that we are dealing with every single type of demographic. We have everything from very small canoes to quite large ex-Taiwanese gill netters operating in the area.</para>
<para>It is surprising that those on the other side of the chamber do not have an understanding of this. I understand that being in opposition must be a bit difficult in getting information, but I think the internet and a few calls around the place would help you understand that the basis of this situation is that the income of the average Indonesian fisherman working around some of these places is $480 a year. With the average shark fetching between $200 and $600 a kilo, you can actually make $2,000 for every shark you catch. Obviously this is not an issue that is necessarily going to go away, but still, in facing that sophisticated challenge and that huge economic push that continues to be there, this government, in contrast with those on the other side of the chamber, has sent out a very clear and hard message.</para>
<para>The opposition give me a bit of humour with my fishing mates over a very small glass of wine at night. The opposition talk about their coastguard. The immediate answer to this problem, according to those on the other side, is a can of paint and a cupboard of new uniforms. ‘We have got the coastguard—no worries about that! We are simply going to paint the boats blue, put a red stripe on them and run out a new uniform.’ Let me tell you, Mr Deputy President, that that unsophisticated and clumsy approach to a very sophisticated challenge is not going to be seen by anyone as making any contribution to this debate at all.</para>
<para>It went to the ridiculous when they had people like Bob McClelland going to America—it was pre-election, so they were all pretty much in this Lathamesque moment—people who one moment were attacking the United States foreign policy like some benzedrine puff adder and who the next moment were saying: ‘While you’re over there, Bob, have a bit of a look at their Coastwatch policy. We’ll have a look at that. We might even be able to borrow it.’ Borrow it? They took it holus bolus. It included, of course, the wonderful idea of people hanging out of helicopters shooting at boats with rifles. If that is the level of sophistication, I really think they should have picked on another issue.</para>
<para>We have put a very serious stamp of compliance across this very wide and difficult arena. We already have 15 craft working in that area. Both Customs and the Royal Australian Navy work literally thousands of sea days every year. I take this opportunity to defend their reputation—the huge efforts that these men and women put in in sometimes the most difficult of conditions. They are simply to be commended and not to be criticised. They do an absolutely excellent job. In testament to the effort they make, there have been 1,261 administrative seizures in the last five years, and they burnt and destroyed 555 vessels. The other side talked about the wonderful industry on Roti Island. Let me tell you as a fact that Roti’s capacity in boatbuilding in 1997 was six vessels a year. That information arrived on my desk five minutes ago. That huge industrial capacity is not going to replace 555 boats in anyone’s language and anyone’s time. This cuts at the core of the capacity of those people who wish to come to our waters to steal and do damage.</para>
<para>There have also been some accusations from the other side about sightings. A lot of those sightings come through me. People ring me, and they are disturbed about these sorts of things and about some of these sightings. The stories about bringing animals to the Australian mainland are a complete furphy. The Australian government are very proud of an excellent compliance regime that has slowed down Indonesian fishermen. It continues to send them a clear message that, if they come to Australia with the intent of stealing fish, they will be stopped. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I rise to take note of answers given today by the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation and the Minister for Justice and Customs to questions asked about the repeated incursions by foreign fishermen into Australian waters. What an unconvincing performance it was. The drivel the honourable ministers gave for answers to the serious questions the opposition asked about Australia’s border security is typical of the arrogance of this out-of-touch government. But we should not be surprised by the ministers’ answers to questions on this important issue. The neglect of border security is a whole-of-government approach for the Howard government, from the Prime Minister down.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Jon Ford, the Western Australian Minister for Fisheries, is doing his best to care for the fragile marine ecology of Western Australian waters by creating sanctuary zones in marine parks and adjusting bag limits, only to be undermined by the Howard government’s inability to keep looting foreign fishermen out of Western Australian waters. Minister Ford has been calling on the Howard government to account for its failure to respond to the massive numbers of illegal fishing vessels that are pillaging Western Australian waters. But the Howard government do not like the success he has been having in drawing public attention to their failures.</para>
<para>Senator Macdonald, the Commonwealth minister for fisheries, gave the game away the other day when he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The WA Government needs to take a dose of reality and if there are problems in WA waters then they should be policing them …</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">If the honourable minister knew anything about his portfolio, he would know that ‘WA waters’ are a thin band around the coast of Western Australia. And what are they surrounded by? What surrounds WA waters? Commonwealth waters! What a clown—what an absolute clown. Someone get a stretcher, the minister has shot himself in the foot. How do these boats appear in Western Australian waters? Do they teleport there? Do they get there by osmosis? No. The only reason there would ever be a problem in WA waters would be if the Howard government had failed in its responsibility to police Commonwealth waters.</para>
<para>What is the attitude of the honourable senator to this admission of failure? He wants the Western Australian government to take a dose of reality. The reality is that this government talks big about border protection but, when it is put to the test, it fails. You can imagine the Prime Minister at election time, up on the podium, his bottom lip sticking out as he says, ‘We will decide who fishes in Australian waters and the circumstances in which they fish.’ If you listen to this government at election time they will have you believe that they actually care about border security. But, once the election is over, it is a completely different story—a story of buck passing and neglect.</para>
<para>Just the other day the Prime Minister was asked on talkback radio whether he thought the government was doing its job properly when it came to protecting Australian waters from illegal fishing vessels. What was the Prime Minister’s answer? He said, ‘What you’re seeing at the moment is the system working.’ He then went on to boast that authorities were on track to catch 180 illegal fishing boats throughout Australian waters this year. Bravo! I wonder if the Prime Minister is aware that Coastwatch aircraft spotted more than 8,000 vessels in the last financial year alone—and the Prime Minister hopes to catch 180 of them! Is this the Prime Minister’s idea of a system that is working?</para>
<para>As I said earlier, the neglect of border security is a whole-of-government approach for the Howard government. Minister Ellison put in a shocker of a performance the other day. He said that the government was being proactive in its response to illegal fishers and rejected the Western Australian government’s assertions that more resources were needed to ensure the security of both the Western Australian border and fish stocks. That is because Minister Ellison has a cunning plan. Minister Ellison does not believe more resources are needed; he believes fewer resources are needed. That is why, instead of standing up for Western Australia’s interests, he is standing up to protect the Howard government’s decision to remove, as of March next year, $1.2 million a year in funding for the internal operations unit based in Western Australia.</para>
<para>The internal operations unit’s purpose is to combat illegal fishing incursions by foreign vessels. Apparently, WA does not need it anymore. Is this another example of what the Prime Minister means when he says that the system is working? Minister Ellison likes to boast about what he likes to call ‘the unprecedented resources’ the Howard government is devoting to protecting Australian waters. He loves to tell people about the 33 flights a week between Broome and Darwin. Can you imagine the flights? The pilot is looking out of the window and saying: ‘There’s one. There’s one. Look, there’s another one.’ Eight thousand a year and the Prime Minister hopes to catch 180. The Howard government’s system is allowing droves of Indonesian fishermen who could be exposed to tuberculosis, carrying hens exposed to the avian flu and being kept company by dogs that could be exposed to rabies— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Why are none of us on this side of the chamber surprised that at question time and during the debate to take note the Labor Party would come in here to try to get some political mileage—some cheap political point scoring—out of illegal fishing? It is a very serious issue, and yet we have just heard the last opposition senator make frivolous, humorous remarks.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let me tell you how seriously Labor take this. WA announced just recently that they were going to close a fishing patrol unit because the Commonwealth was not funding them to the tune of $1.2 million. Let us get that in some sort of context. This is how much Labor really cares about it. Guess how much the surplus budget will deliver to this state Labor government this year: $1.3 billion. And for the price of $1.2 million, they allege, they are going to close their fishing patrol unit. That is how much they care. They care not a jot for fishing. All they care about is coming in here and trying to snatch a cheap vote with a very crass, weak, pathetic argument about fishing in an environment where Australia has never had so much surveillance or so much expenditure.</para>
<para>We are replacing 15 Fremantle class patrol boats with 14 Armidale class patrol boats. We have more Customs patrol boats and more AFFA fishing control boats in this region than ever before. Let me tell you: it has taken us 10 years to pick up the pieces from the Hawke-Keating shemozzle. They never spent a cent on protecting Australia’s borders. We had to go out there and handle all of the illegal immigration and all of the illegal fishing; we had to upgrade security; defence had to be upgraded—we have spent billions of dollars repairing the damage of Labor because of their profligate neglect of security and border protection. Do not come in here with your hollow, cheap, point-scoring attack when state Labor in Western Australia is dropping its fishing patrol unit for the want of, allegedly, $1.2 million in the face of its $1.3 billion surplus. What hollow, crocodile tears! When will you learn? The Australian public are never going to be sucked in by such cheap political chicanery.</para>

<para>—Does that mean I get to go for seven minutes? I do not? What a pity! You see, we have Senator Johnston smirking and not even serious about his contribution to this debate. There is no genuine offer, trying to validate the government’s position. He cannot even defend the government for five minutes. The illegal fishing debacle in our northern waters is an absolute sham. It has long been a problem. Senator Johnston would want us to believe that it goes all the way back to the Hawke and Keating days. Well, you have been in government for nine long years now, Senator Johnston, and it is about time the federal government actually did something about the illegal fishing problem in our northern waters and the depletion of fish stocks that is occurring.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is a growing problem and it clearly needs far more attention and resources than this current government is prepared to give it. An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 6 September said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">SIGHTINGS of foreign fishing boats in Australian waters ... have leapt 50 per cent over two years—and most of them are there illegally.</para>
<para>A briefing paper by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, obtained under Freedom of Information laws, shows sightings ... average 22 a day and that a total of 8108 were spotted last financial year.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is the number my colleague mentioned. Of course, most of them cannot be apprehended as either they are too close to the border or there are simply no Australian vessels near enough to catch them. You can have planes fly over as often as you like and blue dots can be placed on a map by a computer as often as you like but, unless you actually have enough boats in the area and enough people in the area to do something about these vessels, the plan will not work. Furthermore, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> said that Customs told them there has been a 60 per cent increase in the number of foreign boats apprehended by Customs and Navy in the past 12 months. No-one is doubting the enormous effort that is put in by Customs officials and by our defence people, but clearly the government has to realise that the effort is not enough, that their plan is not working and that there needs to be much more attention given to this problem.</para>
<para>Not only have the number of boats gone up but the boats are coming closer. For example, in the Northern Territory they come right down into the Gulf of Carpentaria waters, down and around Groote Eylandt, and they have been seen close in and around the Wessel Islands, not far north of Nhulunbuy. Local northern fishery boats regularly see and report on foreign boats. In fact, we have had some up the creek at Maningrida. On 18 April on ABC radio Mr Gary Ward, the chair of the Gulf Fishermen’s Association, said:</para>

<para class="block">And the boats are getting bigger and more sophisticated. They are carrying GPS and navigation equipment. There can be absolutely no doubt that they know just where they are. They have freezer facilities so they can catch and carry far bigger amounts of fish. In an interview on the ABC radio morning program on 17 August, Ian Smith, the CEO of the Northern Territory Seafood Council said, ‘We’ll continue our lobbying, trying to send wake-up calls, saying, “Look, we have a problem and it’s been ongoing.”’ He went on to say: ‘I mean, it’s not getting any better. In fact, it’s probably getting worse.’</para>
<para>We have the amateur fishing association continually ringing my office and complaining, and rightfully so, that this government is not doing enough to stop this problem. The issue that has been raised by my colleagues about quarantine is a fact. Senator Scullion, one of the boats in the harbour that your company looks after was known to have a dog on it in recent months, and an answer to a question on notice that I received from this government signalled that that was a problem.</para>

<para>—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The senator just said that there were boats in Darwin Harbour being looked after by my company. She knows full well that is not the case. I have absolutely no association with Barefoot Marine, and for three years in this place committees of this chamber discussed that and found unequivocally that that was not the case. I think she should withdraw that remark.</para>

<para>—I move:</para>
</talk.start>
<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Ellison) to a question without notice asked by Senator Stott Despoja today relating to the Privacy Act.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">My question related to section 7C of the Privacy Act, which exempts political acts and practices from privacy laws. It is something I have commented on on numerous occasions, and I have moved amendments in this place to prevent politicians—that is, all of us—enjoying this wide ranging exemption under the Privacy Act. The Privacy Act in 2000 was extended to include the private sector, but it did not extend to politicians. I think the time has come for this government to seriously consider, if not immediately amend, the Privacy Act to, as a minimum, remove the exemption for politicians but also perhaps more broadly strengthen the provisions relating to medical and sensitive information—in particular, medical records. I have talked often as well about the need for privacy protection of genetic information, and I will continue to bang on about that issue for as long as it takes for us to get protection of privacy information in this place.</para>
<para>A couple of issues have come to the attention of members of this place and the public in recent times. One of them was through the Democrat initiated Senate inquiry into privacy laws in this country, where we heard evidence from a number of individuals and organisations like the Privacy Foundation, the Australian Medical Association, the privacy commissioner for Victoria and others that demonstrated that the political exemption was wide ranging, out of date and inappropriate and had never been seriously justified. We heard of one case where the jurisdiction of the federal Privacy Commissioner did not extend to phone calls, which some honourable members would recall, made during the last election campaign in the voices of, I believe, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, Peter Costello, to silent numbers held by electors. Those people did not disclose that information, nor did they seek to come home and hear a cutesy election message on their answering machine. The problem is that it cannot be investigated and it is not within the jurisdiction of the Privacy Commissioner. Why? Because of these wide ranging exemptions that we politicians enjoy but other businesses, industry, individuals and public sector organisations et cetera do not enjoy. It is time to change that.</para>
<para>More alarmingly, in the Senate today I referred to a case that is ongoing and has received widespread coverage. That is the allegation that Senator McGauran was responsible for obtaining and disclosing the medical records of a woman who had undergone a late-term abortion. We certainly read about it in a piece written by Meagan Shaw in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper, which reported that the name of the woman was sent to them in the information provided to them by Senator McGauran. I am not saying that; that was written in the piece. Regardless of what you feel about the information being obtained without consent or being disclosed, there has to be a bigger debate in this place about whether or not, when the act refers to political acts and political practices, we are really talking about medical records. Is it really the case that the act intends that they not be under the jurisdiction of the Privacy Commissioner?</para>
<para>There are other issues beyond the allegations against Senator McGauran. There is a dispute that involves the Royal Women’s Hospital and the Medical Practitioners Board. In that case, the Melbourne Magistrate’s Court ordered that the woman’s health and medical information be disclosed to the Medical Practitioners Board despite the patient’s refusal, despite the patient’s lack of consent. I use that case to illustrate one thing and one thing only: that we should get rid of this ridiculous exemption that we have under law that businesses and public sector and other organisations are not subject to. I will be introducing a private member’s bill to make sure this happens if the government does not beat me to it, and I invite them to do so. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para class="block">Dear Minister</para>
<para class="block">I refer to the following maritime transport security regulations made within your portfolio.</para>
<para class="block">Maritime Transport Security Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 1), Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 115</para>
<para class="block">These Regulations amend the principal regulations by inserting new requirements concerning the duties of port operators concerning water-side restricted zones and ship security zones, and other provisions related to persons who are authorised to carry or possess a weapon or prohibited item on a regulated Australian ship, or in a maritime security zone. The Committee raises the following matters concerning these Regulations.</para>
<para class="block">First, Item [1] substitutes a new regulation 6.70 that specifies the duties of a port operator with regard to water-side restricted zones. Subregulation 6.70(3) creates a strict liability offence of monitoring access to any water-side restricted zone in a security regulated port. The purported Explanatory Statement does not explain why this is made a strict liability offence. In light of subregulation 6.70(2) clarification is also needed as to whether the obligation imposed by subregulation 6.70(3) arises even if the zone has not yet come into force. Lastly, subregulation 6.70(5) requires a port operator to ensure that the security measures and procedures “detect and deter unauthorised access” to water-side restricted zones. The consequences of failure to comply with this subregulation are not specified.</para>
<para class="block">Similar questions are raised by item [3] which substitutes a new regulation 6.95 that specifies the duties of a port operator with regard to ship security zones.</para>
<para class="block">Secondly, Item [6] inserts a new regulation 7.40, subregulation (3) of which permits an inspector of the RSPCA of a State or Territory to have a weapon (or prohibited item) in his or her possession while in a maritime security zone when the person is carrying out an inspection related to the welfare of any animals in that zone. Similarly, new subregulation 7.45(3) permits such inspectors to carry a weapon through a screening point, and new subregulation 7.50(3) permits such inspectors to carry a weapon on board a regulated Australian ship. There is no explanation as to why RSPCA inspectors might need to carry a weapon in such circumstances, nor whether such officers receive any training in the use of weapons.</para>
<para class="block">Thirdly, section 17 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 directs a rule-maker to be satisfied that appropriate consultation, as is reasonably practicable, has been undertaken particularly where a proposed instrument is likely to have an effect on business. Section 18 of the Act provides that in some circumstances consultation may be unnecessary or inappropriate. The definition of ‘explanatory statement’ in section 4 of the Act requires an explanatory statement to describe the nature of any consultation that has been carried out or, if there has been no consultation, to explain why none was undertaken. The document that accompanies these Regulations makes no reference to consultation. The Committee therefore seeks your advice on whether consultation was undertaken and, if so, the nature of that consultation. The Committee also seeks an assurance that future explanatory statements will provide information on consultation as required by the Legislative Instruments Act.</para>
<para class="block">Finally, section 26 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 requires an explanatory statement to be lodged for registration when a legislative instrument is lodged for registration. Section 4 of the Act defines ‘explanatory statement’ to mean a statement that ‘explains the purpose and operation of the instrument’. The document that accompanies these Regulations is not described as an Explanatory Statement. It contains an item-by-item description of the Regulations, but it does not explain the purpose of the amendments. The Committee therefore seeks an explanation as to why an explanatory statement that complies with the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 has not been supplied.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 2 September 2005, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Regulations. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.</para>

<para class="block">Dear Senator Watson</para>
<para class="block">Thank you for your letter of 11 August 2005 regarding Maritime Transport Security Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 1) Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 115 …</para>
<para class="block">I appreciate the opportunity to respond to the Committee’s comments.</para>
<para class="block">Maritime Transport Security Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 1), Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 115</para>
<para class="block">The Committee has raised four matters concerning these Regulations.</para>
<para class="block">Firstly, the Committee refers to the duties of a port operator with respect to water-side restricted zones (Regulation 6.70).</para>
<para class="block">The Committee notes that the Explanatory Statement does not explain why subregulation 6.70(3) creates a strict liability offence. In framing the offence provision contained in Regulation 6.70, consideration was given to the principles contained in the Sixth Report of 2002 on the Application of Absolute and Strict Liability Offences in Commonwealth Legislation by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and to matters discussed in Part 4.5 of the Guide to Framing of Commonwealth Offences, Civil Penalties and Enforcement Powers. Extensive consultation was undertaken in developing the offence provision, including with affected stakeholders.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee further queries whether the obligation imposed by subregulation 6.70(3) arises before the zone has come into force. It does not. The obligation in 6.70(3) relates to enforcement of a zone. This is different to the obligation in subregulation 6.70(1) which relates to informing persons that the area is, or is to become, a zone in which unauthorised access is an offence.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee also refers to subregulation 6.70(5) which requires a port operator to ensure that the security measures and procedures to control access to a water-side restricted zone detect and deter unauthorised access to such a zone. The Committee notes that the consequences for failure to comply with this subregulation are not specified.</para>
<para class="block">The measures and procedures to control access to a water-side restricted zone are set out in the port operator’s maritime security plan (see Regulation 3.55). A breach of a maritime security plan is an offence under the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 (the Act) (subsection 44(1)).</para>
<para class="block">Secondly, the Committee refers to persons authorised to possess weapons in maritime security zones (Regulation 7.40).</para>
<para class="block">The Committee queries why RSPCA inspectors might need to carry a weapon in a maritime security zone, and whether they receive training in the use of weapons.</para>
<para class="block">Regulation 7.40 provides officers of organisations associated with the welfare of animals, quarantine officers, departmental officers employed for the purpose of eradication of pests and licensed security guards to be persons authorised to carry or possess a weapon or prohibited item in a maritime security zone.</para>
<para class="block">This is to address an identified need for RSPCA officers to carry weapons to assist in discharging their animal welfare duties—for example to assist in destroying seriously injured animals in the port environment. The Committee will appreciate that many thousands of animals pass through Australian ports each year.</para>
<para class="block">The National Firearms Agreement establishes uniform measures across Australian jurisdictions in relation to firearms ownership, possession and use. These measures include a requirement for licence applicants to show a ‘genuine reason’ for owning, possessing or using a firearm, and uniform accredited training as a prerequisite for licensing. In NSW for example, provision is made for an applicant to be regarded as having a ‘genuine reason’ for having a firearm licence if the applicant is an officer of the RSPCA who is a special constable, or a veterinary surgeon, who may need to destroy animals to avoid animal suffering.</para>
<para class="block">Regulation 7.55 provides that a person is not authorised to carry a weapon or prohibited item, under regulations 7.40, 7.45 and 7.50, where the carriage or possession is prohibited by another law of the Commonwealth or a law of a State or Territory and the person does not have the required licence, permit or authorisation.</para>
<para class="block">Thirdly, the Committee seeks advice on the consultation process undertaken in preparing the Regulations.</para>
<para class="block">A wide range of stakeholders were consulted in developing the Regulations, including maritime industry representatives, unions, State and Territory police, and relevant government agencies. A copy of the draft Amendment Regulations was circulated to these key stakeholders for comment prior to these being finalised and made.</para>

<para>—This is a matter of great public importance. It is important that we note the failure of the Howard government to deter or apprehend many illegal fishers in Australia’s northern waters. This is a government that likes to talk about protecting Australians and Australia’s borders. I suppose we all know that the reason it does this is that it gets the government onto the news. And because getting border protection rhetoric on the news is so important, we have situations where the Howard government illegally locks up and deports Australian citizens and small children are snatched from their schools. Yet whilst this charade goes on the Howard government is failing to stop illegal fishers from pillaging Australia’s fragile fishing grounds. The Howard government is failing to stop illegal fishers from setting up camp on mainland Australia’s shores. In some cases these fishers bring potentially disease carrying animals ashore. The potential ramifications of these quarantine breaches are real and dire, not only for the Australian agricultural industry but also for the health of the Australian people.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I looked at the Liberal Party web site today, in particular at a document called <inline font-style="italic">Our plans for Australia</inline>, which appears to be the Liberal’s manifesto for the 2004 election. The inside cover of the document features a picture of the Prime Minister standing before a banner emblazoned with the words ‘Australian Customs’. Further into the document, on page 14, the manifesto states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Under John Howard’s leadership Australia is no longer a soft touch.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">A little further down the page it says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The coalition government is fully committed to maintaining Australia’s strict quarantine regime to protect our unique pest and disease free status.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Although at the last election the Howard government promised to be tough on border protection, the statistics in this area tell a very different and startling story. After nine long years of the Howard government, Australia is a soft touch and the integrity of our quarantine system is under attack. I recently read in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> that, over the past two years, sightings by Coastwatch of illegal foreign fishing vessels have jumped by a staggering 50 per cent. According to the report, some 8,108 sightings were recorded in the past financial year. That equates to around 156 vessels sighted each and every week or 22 illegal foreign vessels each and every day of the year—and they are only the vessels that are sighted. This means that each week there are at least 156 opportunities for illegal fishers to pillage our fisheries. This means that each day there are 22 opportunities for illegal fishers to potentially deliver, maliciously or accidentally, serious diseases to our coastline. This is what the Howard government promised at the 2004 election as being tough on border security. Of course, that manifesto is worthless—as useless as Minister Abbott’s now infamous, rock solid, ironclad guarantee on the Medicare safety net also contained in the manifesto’s pages.</para>
<para>The 8,000-plus incursions by illegal fishing boats over the past financial year show that, in reality, the Howard government is as committed to border security and quarantine as it was to the Medicare safety net. The commitment extends only as far as the pre-election rhetoric. This government’s broken Medicare promise was highly visible and will cost working families hundreds of dollars each year. It has caused, and will continue to cause, great hardship among Australian people. The Howard government’s equal lack of commitment to border security and quarantine is less visible, but it is a lack of commitment that I fear will cause this nation to pay a terrible price. The fact is that Australia’s northern fisheries are crawling with illegal fishing vessels.</para>
<para>In another recent article, this time in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, a journalist aboard HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Bunbury</inline>, on its way to patrol for illegal vessels out of Darwin, wrote:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is high season for the errant craft, and within minutes of leaving port at the Larrakeyah naval base, the patrol boat ... spots its first target.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Within minutes. One can only hope <inline font-style="italic">Bunbury</inline> had actually left Darwin harbour. Of course, fisheries minister, Senator Macdonald, will claim that increased sightings are a good thing and that more sightings reflect increased activity by Australian authorities. But that is just spin, just as the Howard government used spin in the case of the recent northern waters apprehension by the <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Viking</inline>. The <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Viking</inline> is supposed to be Australia’s cop on the beat in our southern waters, including Heard and Macquarie islands, yet it is also expected to spend time patrolling our northern waters. It is the only customs vessel with the capability of patrolling the treacherous waters to our far south. The fact that the government used the <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Viking</inline> to round up illegal fishers in the tropical north is more an admission of policy failure than of success. It simply demonstrates that this vessel and its very capable crew are stretched too thin. If ever there was a demonstrated need for an Australian coastguard, this event is it.</para>
<para>Another major concern about the number of illegal fishing vessels in the north is the threat they potentially pose to significant assets, such as those on the North West Shelf. Minister Ford of Western Australia hit the nail on the head when he told the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">They could be drug smuggling, weapons smuggling or explosive smuggling. We don’t really know what they are doing.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The question is: why is the Howard government so weak on the protection of our fisheries and therefore our borders?</para>
<para>I think there are three main reasons for this—a lack of good policy, a lack of commitment and a lack of good ministers. The sheer number of illegal fishing incursions poses a real threat to our national security, from weapons and disease, and the facts show that the Howard government has no effective policy response. That is why Labor advocates an Australian coastguard to meet the security environment as it has evolved. That is why, under a Labor government, maritime security will not be split between eight government departments administering 11 separate pieces of legislation. Under Labor you will not have the crazy situation where customs and fisheries vessels have the power to fire upon fleeing suspected illegal vessels in Australian waters but do not have the resources to do it. Importantly, Australia needs one department to properly coordinate our overall security effort.</para>

<para>—They have the resources on one vessel. That is why Labor proposes a department of homeland security to effectively deal with threats.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The second reason for the Howard government’s failure on fisheries is a simple lack of commitment. The fact is that on border security the Howard government talks the talk but does not walk the walk. For the Howard government, border security is nothing more than a media issue used to dog whistle up the vote from the darkest reaches of the electorate, and that is why the Howard government has allowed our northern fisheries to become a superhighway for illegal fishing vessels.</para>
<para>The third reason for the Howard government’s failure to secure our fisheries, and therefore our borders, comes down to personnel. I am not referring to those who are doing their best on vessels such as the <inline font-style="italic">Bunbury</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Viking</inline>, who Labor congratulates on their efforts. I refer to those who occupy the benches opposite and who sit around the cabinet table of the Howard government, because the mismanagement of Australia’s fisheries has the fingerprints of the once-great National Party all over it.</para>
<para>I know that Senator Macdonald is a Liberal minister, but unfortunately he has to go through Mr McGauran to get to the cabinet table. Mr McGauran is his senior minister. So Senator Macdonald has to go through the National Party. It must be galling to have to go through a National Party minister. I know it is galling for many of the Liberals that the National Party are guaranteed the portfolio of agriculture, as part of the coalition agreement. It is not that it must be galling; I know that it is galling. Many of those senators who sit opposite in this place who are members of the Liberal Party and represent the Liberal Party in this place privately express their dismay at the incapacity of National Party ministers who sit around the cabinet table. The fact that Mr McGauran is the latest National Party appointee to the portfolio proves the case that I make. I am certain that there will be a valiant attempt at defence by those opposite who seek to address this debate, but it will not be a credible one and they know it.</para>
<para>It is to the detriment of the agricultural industries of our nation as a whole—and, I suppose, Senator Ian Macdonald’s career in particular—that the coalition agreement ensures that the vital role of the agriculture minister is always held by a member of the sadly declining and once great National Party. It is certainly the case that Black Jack McEwen would be spinning in his grave to know that the National Party had allowed itself and the protection of Australia’s fisheries and borders to get into such a parlous state, but that is the reality that he would face.</para>
<para>In relation to the dismaying situation of the dramatic increase in foreign vessels penetrating our waters and endangering some of the fisheries that they are preying upon, it is very notable that the fishing industries, particularly those based in the state of Western Australia, have expressed great concern about the depletion of fishing stocks caused by these practices. It is no secret that the illegal fishers have changed their modus operandi. They use smaller, more manoeuvrable vessels which are more easily replaced. It is no secret that they are more organised, and—as was conceded by Minister Ellison today—their activities seem to be organised by criminal gangs, in one area in particular, to prey upon the shark populations in our waters because of the value of shark fin in South-East Asia. That has encouraged a great many fishermen to enter our waters. If we were to reduce the number of visitors by a factor of three, as was suggested by Senator Ian Macdonald in his answer to a question today, we would still have an unacceptable level of illegal entry into Australian waters.</para>
<para>One has to question the government’s policy of excising islands from Australia’s migration zone, given that it was conceded today in question time that it appears that these illegal fishermen have, on a number of occasions, landed on the Australian coast. That is an admission that all of the protections that the government says it has put in place to prevent vessels illegally reaching our coast have failed. The admission is made. This is a predation on an industry important to Western Australia and to the Northern Territory. Frankly, it is an issue of grave importance to Australia, and that is the reason that I brought this matter here today.</para>

Senator Ian Macdonald is in the chamber. Under his leadership, we have made a great change to one of the most sophisticated and complicated attacks on our borders.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This issue is not only about fisheries; it is an issue about quarantine, the environment, human health and almost every other aspect of our community. Many recreational fishermen are concerned, commercial fishermen are concerned, and people who are concerned about the environment have also voiced their opinions on this matter.</para>
<para>As I said earlier, the particular driver of this issue is that the people who come to Australian waters come from an area where they earn $480 a year. That is not much. But if you consider that they can get $600 per kilo for the product, it is of little surprise to any of us that there will be continued pressure. We know that the sort of policy that is going to be successful in this area has to be as sophisticated as the challenge that we are now facing. The strength of policy and leadership of this government send a clear and concise signal, and that is very important in this issue. As with people-smuggling, it is the sort of signal that will change the behaviour of people. We have been sending a very clear and concise signal, and it is a simple one: ‘If you come to Australian waters to poach and you make a risk assessment on that, generally, you will be seen, you will be caught, you will be prosecuted and you will lose your boat.’ One hundred per cent of the people who come here through that process lose their boats. That was not always the case, but we have tightened it up because we need to continue to change and tweak that policy. It is a simple policy signal that everyone in Roti, Morotai and Pukaru is familiar with.</para>
<para>We have statistics from the other side about 22 boats per day. Let me give some very sincere statistics. In the last four years, 555 vessels have been destroyed. That destruction is part of a policy that goes to the very heart of the Indonesians’ capacity to break the rules. Without a boat, you are not going to be able to come here and take our fish stock. In four years, 555 vessels have been destroyed, and it goes on, because that is not the only part of our policy. Sometimes the vessels are very small, and sometimes they are only just inside the border. In terms of effectiveness, where there are bigger boats that might be further inside, in multiple sightings, of course we make the decision to do an administrative seizure. So all their capacity to continue to fish is taken from them. All their fishing gear is taken from them. We know they have to make journeys of sometimes more than a month; then they have to go back, sometimes refit their boats and come back again, but in that time we get some relief. There have been more than 1,200 administrative seizures during that time. It has sent a comprehensive but clear signal: ‘If you come here to fish and think you can get away with it, you are wrong. Tell your mates.’</para>
<para>There were 247 people prosecuted in 2003-04, with quite substantial fines, including $1,500 bonds. On $480 a year, that is a pretty substantial sort of fine and a pretty substantial disincentive. In 2004-05, that figure was reduced to some 200 people. From the other side we have heard discussions about some 22 sightings a day. That is probably correct; there have been up to 22 sightings a day. When you have Coastwatch doing well over 1,000 sea days a year, the Royal Australian Navy doing thousands of sea days a year and Coastwatch aeroplanes looking over these things for tens of thousands of days, of course we are going to see these vessels on a number of occasions. In the briefing that I was given—and it has been indicated to me that the same briefing was given to those on the other side—it was very clearly explained that 22 sightings on any day by Coastwatch were likely to be multiple sightings; in other words, there might have been six or seven boats. But six or seven boats are too many for us. In a previous iteration in the Northern Territory, I noted that from time to time there were nights in Darwin Harbour when the Navy brought in 18 to 20 vessels. They are capable of that sort of level of compliance. To say that there are 20 sightings and somehow to omit to say that there were almost that many apprehensions is pretty disingenuous.</para>
<para>It should be said that one of the statistics that people are not talking about is that in 1997 the price of white shark fin was $70. Today it is $600. Between 1997 and now, that factor and the productivity index are not applicable to a population rise or anything else. It is about demand. Demand has gone up. In simple economics, for those people who got through high school, it is because supply has dried up. Why has supply dried up? Because of the tough policy that the government have put in place to stop theft. There is no better statistic to look at. You do not have to wiggle that around. It is a simple statistic that demonstrates that. I can assure you that the price will keep going up because we have put an iron fist on compliance. Those on the other side can say what they like about the sorts of things that have gone on, and you can point to something here that might not be right. But this is a very sophisticated government, and we understand, as we did with people trafficking—and the world looks to us now for answers in that area—that you also need to have a sophisticated and multifaceted approach to dealing with illegal fishing.</para>
<para>In addition to the strong surveillance and enforcement presence in Northern Australia, we are continuing our efforts to engage our Indonesian neighbours on the issue of illegal fishing, as we do on so many fronts. We always take a regional approach because it is the most sensible approach that is going to get the best outcome. The two countries held formal discussions on these issues from 24 to 26 August in Jakarta. It was that recently. These two countries are working in a bilateral sense to ensure that a bilateral fisheries surveillance forum is formed. They are going to work cooperatively to ensure that the fishers are educated. Indonesians understand, but they think it is fair that we tell the Indonesian fishers that, if you are going to do a risk assessment, you have to understand the sorts of things that you are going to get through, and you are not going to get through. Again, it is a simple message of policy that has to continue to get out there.</para>
<para>One of the changes that we have had in terms of Western Australia—I heard a bit of bleating on this from the other side—is that they are all going to Darwin. Hurray, I reckon! That is not because I am a parochial Territorian but because, practically, it is the hub of where it happens. More vessels come into the Northern Territory, because of compliance and the need for compliance, than anywhere else. AQIS are grasping the nettle, going to the Northern Territory and setting up for business, and that business is going to make a great change. Again, it is simply about policy. A good policy sends a clear signal. The very clear signal that we are sending—and it is an unambiguous signal—is that, if you choose to come and steal our fish, we will find you, we will arrest you, we will put you through the process and we will burn your boats. So do not take the risk. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>—This matter of public importance today is on what has been suggested as a failure of the Howard government to deter or apprehend the many illegal fishers in Australia’s northern waters. From the Democrats point of view, I take the opportunity to respond to this by making a few points. Clearly, there are still significant amounts of illegal fishing occurring not just in Australia’s northern waters but particularly in that region, and more needs to be done to address that. I acknowledge the personal expertise and experience that Senator Scullion has in this area and that he does make some valid points. I could say that as a vegetarian I do not eat any fish at all, so perhaps the best way to prevent illegal fishing is to encourage everyone to go vegetarian, and they would all stop fishing completely. But I hasten to add that I do not think that is a terribly practical policy option, so we will deal in the real world, which is that there is a demand for a lot of this product. A lot of people in very poor economic circumstances naturally will be tempted to take the opportunity or to take the risk.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This government has done some things, and I acknowledge that. But I would also say that a few aspects indicate that there are still things that could have been done that have not been done because of the warped priorities of the government. I have said a number of times that—and I spoke on this matter in the adjournment debate a few weeks ago—if there were refugees on any of those fishing vessels, the government would have half the Navy out there trying to grab them. For some reason or other, this government has seen people fleeing persecution and trying to get protection in Australia as a bigger risk to our so-called security than any other issue.</para>
<para>We had the minister announce some extra money in the policing of fishing recently. I cannot remember what the figure was, but I think it was around tens of millions of dollars or close to $20 million, and that is welcome. But, if you look at the amount of resources that have been put into trying to prevent refugees from getting protection in Australia, it literally goes into the billions. We have still, even now, $336 million being proposed to be spent to build another detention centre on Christmas Island. If that sort of money were redirected to where it could be of use and practical value, we would be able to put a much bigger dent in some of the problem areas, whether that be illegal fishing or, frankly, all the other areas in the Australian community that could do with extra resourcing.</para>
<para>In the past, Senator Scullion himself, as the only government member who actually came in here and defended the government’s continued insistence to exclude a whole range of islands from the Australian migration zone, has suggested that we needed to do this as a quarantine measure, that if one of these asylum seeker boats gets through there are quarantine problems. As to the quarantine risk from fishing vessels, we have heard reports—and I do not know how much validity there is in them—of people in these fishing vessels actually landing on some of the islands and on the mainland, perhaps with animals et cetera of their own as well. There is clearly a much larger quarantine risk. Any quarantine risk that might be valid with an asylum seeker boat is magnified many times over with fishing vessels. But we do not see the amounts of resources that are being poured into bottomless pits to address the issue of asylum seekers. It is another example of the criticism that I have about the mistreatment of and willingness to cause immense suffering to innocent people through some of the approaches—not all of the approaches, but some of them—used to deal with asylum seekers.</para>
<para>There is also an opportunity cost. An opportunity is lost through those resources going to an area where there is not actually a threat when they could go into this area, where we all know there is a threat. All sides can talk about the environmental risk and quarantine risk and the social and economic cost et cetera. More needs to be done, as always. But if you are putting your resources—not just money, but navy surveillance and all sorts of other things—into an area where there is not a real risk at all then it means you have less opportunity to direct them towards where they are needed. In terms of the thrust of this matter of public importance, I think there is a point to be made. But I think there are some valid defences that the government could make, as Senator Scullion has done. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I rise to speak on the matter of public importance raised by Senator O’Brien—namely, the failure of the Howard government to deter or apprehend the many illegal fishers in Australian northern waters. The recent increase in sightings and incidents involving illegal fishing in our waters does indicate that there is a problem. There has been an increase from 2004 to 2005. That might reflect an increase in detection, but I think it also indicates that there is a significant and growing problem. It is a question that this government has to deal with.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In this area the government has demonstrated extreme incompetence in protecting the borders, leaving Australia unprepared. Illegal fishing in waters off the coast of the Northern Territory and Western Australia now appears to be out of control. A paper I saw the other day showed a range of dots indicating the amount of sightings of boats and contrasted 2004 with 2005. What it demonstrated was that there was an array of boats—it even took me by surprise how many boats and how many detections there had been. It is not enough to simply detect or sight them. What this government has to do is reduce that red smear across our northern borders and find ways to combat this problem.</para>
<para>We have seen reports that the Howard government has admitted that it has been receiving anecdotal reports about illegal fishing crews reaching our shores—that is, making landfall—for years. That is certainly of concern. What is also worrying is that it not only threatens our legal fishing industry and fishing stocks but also presents a security, public health and quarantine risk. For those reasons it does need to be addressed and taken seriously. This government does have to do something about it. It is not sufficient to say, ‘We’ll look around and find someone else to blame.’ This government has to step up to the plate and take responsibility. It has been in power for 9½ years. It needs to address this serious problem that has been developing.</para>
<para>A recent report even suggested illegal Indonesian fishing crews are setting up camps along the country’s coast and bringing with them dogs, cats and monkeys. That concerns me greatly. It also presents a very serious quarantine implication. It has the potential to bring a range of potentially devastating diseases to our shores. I do not know the level of that threat, but this government should be doing something to identify that threat and find out what mechanisms should be in place.</para>

<para>—Do you say that there is no problem? Does this government say that there is no problem and no illegal fishing going on on our northern shores? Is it not something the government should be dealing with in a proactive and pragmatic way? Is the government saying that it can look to our northern shores and say to the Indonesians: ‘Look, it’s all right—we don’t think there’s a problem. We’ll put our heads back in the sand where they came from.’ That is what the government is now saying, it appears, from the comments of members on the other side of the chamber. I do not think the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation thinks that, quite frankly. The minister has decided to come down and participate in this debate because there is a problem. The minister is trying to grapple with it, I suspect, but he needs the support of a whole-of-government approach to deal with it in a more effective way. He has been failing up to now to deal with it.</para>

<para>Illegal fishing is having a dire effect on our limited fish stocks, with shark fins in particular being a target of the fishers. The Western Australian Minister for Fisheries, Mr Jon Ford, has said that about 40 illegal fishing vessels were being reported in the state’s northern waters every week. Sharks make up just one per cent of all living fish in our waters, yet they are being captured in unbelievable numbers. In reports last week, Minister Ford of Western Australia said that the federal government had admitted to him that anything up to 25,000 tonnes of shark, or about one million sharks, had been taken off the top of Australia.</para>

<para>—It will be on the record. Worst of all, in most instances the majority of the shark is simply thrown away. They are only after the fins. Based on the Australian Institute of Criminology trends and issues report and on a quoted price of $US744 per kilo, on today’s exchange rate shark fins can gain up to $A979 per kilo as a market price, making this a significant million-dollar crime that can occur in our northern waters. This government’s mismanagement of our borders is leaving our northern coastline badly exposed.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>According to an ABC report on 23 September, during one week last month, while three boats and 15 fishers were seized, 25 boats were reported as having been able to escape. The Australian Customs Service is tasked with the role of detecting, apprehending and/or deterring illegal fishers. It is doing a good job, might I say, with the limited resources available. But, with 25 boats able to escape—and those were just the ones that were detected—it would seem that Customs is not coping well enough. Instead, Australia has been left unprepared by a justice minister who is opposed to a coastguard and a fisheries minister who is allowing our environment and our national wealth to be plundered.</para>
<para>The vessel <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Viking</inline> that recently apprehended and fired upon Indonesian fishing boats is not a Customs owned vessel; it is a chartered boat that has been moved from its position of patrolling the Southern Ocean and our Heard Island and McDonald Island territories to deal with the plague of illegal fishing outbreaks on our northern borders. A report in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> on Saturday indicated that, in fact, the <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Viking</inline> was not stationed in the area recently but was instead on its way to Singapore via Darwin for a refit.</para>
<para>It is not good enough that our northern Australian border must rely on a maintenance run for its border security. It is clear that more needs to be done. The government could take a look at Labor’s policy of a well resourced national coastguard working in conjunction with Coastwatch resources, our law enforcement agencies, our defence resources, the Department of the Environment and Heritage and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. It does present a significant problem and a whole-of-government approach is required.</para>
<para>How can the government talk about an effective national security regime when they are leaving our coast and our sea territories exposed in the way they are? The only way to deal effectively with the rapidly escalating problem is to work closely with Indonesian authorities and put in place a properly resourced national coastguard. The superior policy on this issue is now clearly the one that Labor took to the last election. Only a plan with a coastguard is capable of taking the fight up to the criminal illegal fishing syndicates. At the moment, under this government, it appears we have all but vacated the field. Under a federal Labor government with the policy that we took to the last election, we would have strengthened the defence of Australia with a $300 million maritime security strategy. The plan we had included: the establishment of an Australian coastguard, the creation of an armed sea marshals program, the deployment of more Australian Federal Police into the region and the installation of a new vessel-tracking system in Darwin Harbour.</para>
<para>The policy setting was right. An Australian coastguard would have included: three armed 55-metre class deep ocean vessels with helicopter landing platforms and rapid intervention boats, five armed 35-metre class patrol vessels with rapid intervention boats and three new twin-engine helicopters. The Australian coastguard would have combined existing civilian coastal surveillance agencies into a unified chain of command. That is the kind of action that you would need to deal with this concern in our northern waters. Australia has 37,000 kilometres of coastline and thus far only Labor’s plan for a coastguard is capable of meeting the tests imposed on our borders by illegal fishing, gunrunners, drug traffickers, people smugglers and terrorists. Now in 2005 with these types of lucrative illegal fishing opportunities that are presented—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—It saddens me that such an important issue would be brought to this chamber with such crass insincerity and disingenuousness. Look at what has happened in the last four years: in 2002 we apprehended 108 illegal fishing vessels; in 2003, 138; in 2004, 161; and to date in 2005, 147. Where have the Labor Party been while this has been going on? We have been out there patrolling the borders and catching illegal fishermen and suddenly because there is a newspaper article about it Senator Ludwig wants to come in here and say that he has all the answers or that Senator O’Brien has all the answers. Let me tell you how much Labor really care about border protection.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As I said earlier in the debate this afternoon, WA are bleating that the Commonwealth are taking some funding off them. They are going to close their fishing patrol unit because of $1.2 million. This is the wealthiest state government in Australia’s history—per capita. They have a surplus this year of $1.3 billion. They are going to throw our fishermen, by their own admission, to these illegals for the cost of $1.2 million. That is their political spin, their disingenuous ‘let’s see if we can score a vote at any price’ attitude to this very important issue. Minister Ford has had two appointments with our Minister Macdonald. Do you think he has kept those appointments? It is such an important issue, such a vital issue for Western Australian Labor, that the minister for fisheries from WA makes an appointment, not once but twice, but does not front. That is just disgraceful.</para>
<para>We have committed $217.2 million for the <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Viking</inline> to patrol waters in Australia for two years. The coastguard document, the illustrious document that the Labor Party produced at the last election, costs it out at $612 million. When you compare those two figures you have to ask yourself: what sort of mickey mouse canoe and outboard motor are you getting in a coastguard put up by Labor? What a joke. What a disgrace. This is a serious issue and Labor give us a coastguard that has to patrol the whole of Australia’s maritime frontier with $612 million—and Labor senators come in here and sit on the other side of the chamber with a straight face! I cannot believe it.</para>
<para>Senator Macdonald, as minister in this area, has been a tireless worker and probably has achieved more than any other fisheries minister, not just for fishing security but for sustainability. The two things go hand in hand. You cannot have security unless you are prepared to sustain the fishery. Senator Macdonald has led Australia in the reform of that area after 13 years of wanton neglect by Labor. Labor did not give two hoots for fishing in Australia when they were in power.</para>
<para>The latest round of problematic entries is clearly about price. As Senator Scullion quite rightly pointed out, these are people on a subsistence livelihood who suddenly see that there is big money to be made in shark fin. So they take to the waters in their small and precarious boats. We are doing things onshore in Indonesia, of course. We are asking the Indonesian government to get these people to see that they have to stick to their own fishing grounds because of the risks to them and because of the penalties that we are going to apply to them if they fish here.</para>
<para>Currently, we have employed some 17 state officers, allocated on various boats. We are replacing those with 30 Commonwealth officers. The fact is that the states have been making a good deal of money: $100 an hour is what we have been paying state officers on all of our patrol boats. We are going to fix the situation. The fisheries section of our government is operating patrols out of Broome, Gove and Darwin. I have quoted the numbers but, in addition to the existing multimillion dollar fisheries surveillance that I mentioned, and the enforcement work carried out by Defence with their patrol boats, Customs with their customs boats, Coastwatch with their aircraft, and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, an extra $91.4 million has been allocated over five years from 2004-05. As I have said, we have committed $217 million for the fisheries patrol boat, the <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Viking</inline>, over the next five years.</para>
<para>As recently as, I think, last week the <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Viking</inline> apprehended two vessels 800 kilometres north-west of Darwin. We were out there on the frontier picking up boats as recently as last week. The fact is that we are doing great things in respect of protecting the security of our fisheries. To date in 2005, 144 foreign fishing vessels have been apprehended inside the zone. A further 227 have been subjected to legislative forfeiture of fishing gear and catch. This follows the record number of 161 illegal fishing apprehensions in northern Australian waters in 2004, which was preceded by the previous record of 138 in 2003. The most recent apprehension was on 29 September, when a motorised Indonesian vessel was intercepted about 110 nautical miles inside the zone with approximately 20 to 25 kilograms of shark fin. We are on the job; we are doing the job. It does no good people coming in here half-baked saying, ‘I read a media article and I think I can score a few cheap political points.’ We know what we are doing. We are on the job and we are catching people on a daily basis.</para>

<para>—I thank Senator O’Brien for raising this urgent matter for debate. The issue of sustainably managing fisheries in Australian and regional waters and the conservation of our marine environment is of great concern to me. I am concerned at the kind of knee-jerk response that we getting to this issue at the moment. The response of just putting more boats and more guns on the water is going to be increasingly expensive to run and difficult to maintain. It is likely to undermine rather than strengthen our relationships with our near neighbours, and we know from experience that it is likely to prove ineffective given the scale of the problem we face. Whilst I agree that more surveillance is necessary, it is not the only answer to this problem.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing inside Australian waters is huge. There are estimates that in our northern waters illegal fishing takes 10 times the tonnage of our domestic catch, although it is hard to get accurate figures given the nature of the problem. There is evidence of large industrial freezer boats sitting just outside Australian waters and using smaller so-called disposable craft to duck in and out of our waters. While this problem of illegal fishing in Australian waters is huge, the problem outside our waters is even bigger. For example, there are estimates that put the number of vessels working in the Arafura and Timor seas, outside our maritime boundary, beyond what I can believe. I have heard estimates of 1,500 vessels working in those waters.</para>
<para>Unfortunately for Australia, fish do not recognise the boundary of Australian waters. If marine ecosystems and fish stocks outside our waters are being depleted and destroyed then those within our territorial waters are also suffering and will eventually be exhausted. So, even if we had the resources to circumnavigate our continent with boats so that we could walk from gangplank to gangplank around it, we could not solve the problem of protecting our fisheries and conserving the wealth of our marine ecosystems. We need to work outside our boundaries.</para>
<para>The problem of the illegal and, as has already been mentioned, highly lucrative trade in shark fin is a huge driver for IUU fishing in our waters, and it is one that we need to urgently address. Because most shark species have effectively been wiped out in Indonesian waters, there is increasing pressure on Australian shark fisheries. I am at odds with Senator Scullion about what is driving the price of shark fin up; I would suggest it is the scarcity of sharks in our waters and Indonesian waters that is driving prices up. With the huge demand for shark fin, in China and Malaysia in particular, we face the very real prospect of the extinction of many shark species within our lifetimes. That demand is likely to keep increasing if we do not do something about the sheer numbers of vessels intruding into our waters and the technology being brought to bear on avoiding patrols in order to quickly grab larger numbers of fish and, in the case of sharks, fins.</para>
<para>We know that unsustainable industrial fishing has already led to the collapse of numerous fisheries around the world and that, globally, fisheries are in dire peril. We need action beyond boats. The Greens believe that we need to look beyond unilateral responses to find collaborative solutions that recognise that this is a joint problem. We need to work with our near neighbours to develop sustainable solutions. This is an extremely complex issue that needs a range of responses. It is in our national interest to develop collaborative arrangements with our near neighbours. A multilateral approach is required, and we can look to the kinds of regional agreements we have developed elsewhere to manage our fisheries to find suitable models. Australia is recognised internationally for our expertise in fisheries policy and management, and we have previously shown international leadership on fishing and marine related issues. I acknowledge and am aware that Australia is a signatory to a number of international agreements related to fisheries and has a number of implementation plans in place in relation to those agreements.</para>
<para>The Greens believe that the key to illegal fishing is dealing with the problem at its source, which is why we are advocating a model based on regional collaboration, the development of regional agreements and the sharing of expertise and resources. Collaborative approaches are a better environmental solution because they acknowledge the permeable nature of marine boundaries. They are an economic solution because they reduce the amount of resources that Australia alone must devote to patrolling its waters. They provide opportunities for our neighbours to sustain their own fisheries and develop revenue streams. They are also a better political solution because they can transform the current situation, where our indictment of foreign vessels creates political tensions, into one where joint measures bring us closer together and act as a basis for building stable long-term relationships.</para>
<para>Our collaborative approaches might also include the provision of Australian expertise and training in developing the science, policy and regulation needed for sustainable fisheries management—perhaps backed up by the provision of patrol boats and on-the-job training on joint patrols. Australia has an opportunity to show leadership, build neighbourly relations and maintain the sustainability of our marine environments at the same time. We need to take into account the different players involved in illegal fishing and ensure that our response takes into account their differing circumstances.</para>
<para>I believe Australia needs to hold comprehensive talks with Indonesia and our northern neighbours about fishing. We would suggest co-hosting talks with our neighbours to develop multilateral approaches. We should consider the development of a northern fisheries regional management agreement and actively support the formation of a regional fisheries management organisation for the northern region. Australia should provide expertise, training and resources to our northern neighbours and put in place a comprehensive, adequate and representative marine park system in our northern waters.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I thank those who have contributed to this debate, particularly Senators Johnston and Scullion, who have very clearly put the government’s position and have given the lie to the ignorant claims of the Labor Party. I have to say that I am appalled by the ignorance of not only the speakers from the Labor Party today but also their spokesman and particularly the Western Australian Minister for Fisheries, who, only new to the game and trying to score some political points, is getting into very deep water on a topic that he really does not understand.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Australia has a 36,000-kilometre coastline that is well protected by Australian agencies. Our Australian fishing zone is 3.6 million nautical miles. We lead the world in surveillance and enforcement. I want to table in the parliament this international fishing magazine—I think it comes out of either the UK or Norway—that shows the burning of five boats in Darwin. That is a clear example of world recognition of our leadership. I will table that for the benefit of the parliament.</para>
<para>As my colleagues have said, we have a very substantial asset base in the north. We have eight Customs Bay class patrol boats, all of which will soon be fully armed. We have surveillance by a Customs Coastwatch fleet of some 15 fixed-wing aircraft and two helicopters. We have 13 Fremantle class naval patrol boats, which, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, are being replaced, and we have the <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Viking</inline>. That is a very substantial set of assets in the north to protect our fisheries. As my colleagues have said, so far this year there have been 148 apprehensions. Senator Johnston was wrong—they have gone up one since those figures were given to him just yesterday. That demonstrates how we continue to do that. There have been 233 legislative forfeitures as well.</para>
<para>This debate is sad because it typifies the absolute ignorance of the Labor Party. I know it is hard in opposition. I know you do not always have access to all of the information that perhaps you might sometimes like. I tried to help the Labor Party. I invited three state Labor ministers to Canberra to brief them on this on a confidential basis. Two of them, the Northern Territory minister and the Queensland minister, turned up. The Western Australian minister, who has been bleating about this time and again, has made two appointments with me so far to come and be briefed and get the real story. On neither occasion has he bothered to turn up.</para>
<para>The ignorance, I regret to say, has been repeated in the speeches of the opposition speakers here today. I will go through quickly what they said. I have only another five minutes to do that. It is going to be very difficult to point out all the factual errors made by the opposition speakers in this debate today. Senator O’Brien talked about the <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Viking</inline> and said it was our southern patrol vessel. I refer him to two of my media releases, on 17 December 2003 and on 21 August 2004, where I clearly said that the <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Viking</inline> was for work principally in the Southern Ocean but could be used anywhere. So they do not even understand that. They asked what happens in the Southern Ocean when the <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Viking</inline> is up in the north. Do they remember the last but one international vessel we apprehended in the Southern Ocean—the <inline font-style="italic">Maya V</inline>? Who brought it in to Perth? It was not the <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Viking</inline>; it was the Australian Navy. So whilst the <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Vikin</inline>g is doing other things, we are not left unprotected; we still have the very substantial and very capable Australian Navy looking after Australia’s interests. We also have international arrangements with the French whereby our officers go on their boats, they come on ours and we jointly patrol areas in the Southern Ocean.</para>
<para>I never like to go into these things in too much detail because it gives the bad guys all the information that they need to avoid us, but Labor keep asking me to detail where boats are going to be every minute of the day. The Western Australian Minister for Fisheries, Mr Ford, talked about drug smuggling and terrorists. He is so ignorant of the real facts—again, facts that I cannot talk about in a public forum like this. If he had come to the briefings he might have a slightly better understanding of what is really happening.</para>
<para>They talked about the coastguard. Which coastguard policy from Labor are we talking about? The last I heard, they were going to have three boats to patrol the whole 36,000 kilometres of the Australian coastline. They keep changing their policy and their shadow ministers. I have no idea what the policy is. During the debate this afternoon we heard about animals being on boats. Let me tell you the real facts about animals on boats. If there are animals on board, upon coming into port they are immediately secured by veterinarians and are dealt with by the vets. They are either put down or put away in appropriate quarantine. So do not run lies about animals.</para>
<para>With regard to fishing off Western Australia, a new Labor senator said this afternoon that they look after only three nautical miles. Sorry; you are wrong. Do not get involved in debates about which you know nothing, new Labor senator from Western Australia, whose name is—</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">Why isn’t Mr Ford upholding his own legislation? I am not saying he should do it entirely. Certainly the Commonwealth will be there—and we are there with substantial assets. But the Western Australian government appear to me to put no assets whatsoever into the protection of their own fisheries from illegal foreign fishing.</para>
<para>I am going to run out of time; there are so many Labor inaccuracies. Senator Ludwig talked about the increase in sightings. I have explained this time and again. The sightings are multiple sightings of the same boat, they are sightings in the MOU box and they are sightings right on the border. Senator Ludwig quoted Mr Ford as saying that I told him that there were 25,000 tonnes of shark taken. I have never said that. In fact, when a journalist raised it with me I expressed absolute amazement and commented, ‘That is fantasy land stuff.’ I do not know where Mr Ford got that from but he certainly did not get it from me.</para>
<para>Senator Ludwig said that the Australian Customs Service is all we have. Wrong again, Senator Ludwig. We have the Navy, we have Coastwatch, we have Customs, we have the <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Viking</inline> and we should have state police boats as well to enter the fight. Labor’s Coastwatch—and I have dealt with that—works closely with the Indonesians.</para>
<para>Senator Siewert, apart from my colleagues, made the most sensible contribution to this debate. Senator Siewert, what you say should be done we are doing. We are working very closely with the Indonesian government. We are working in villages to try and divert people from illegal fishing into other activities. We are using AusAID. We are working very closely in the international field. You would know that Australia has, if I might say so, a well justified reputation as one of the world leaders in the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. I sit on an international ministerial task force on high seas fishing. We are making a genuine attempt to get around the inertia of the United Nations and many others and to attack the root cause of the problem, and we will continue to do that.</para>
<para>We are great supporters of regional fisheries management organisations, particularly in our sphere of influence. There is the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and the new Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, which was initiated by Australia and of which an Australian—a Mr Glen Hurry from my department—is proudly the chairman. And there is an Australian CEO of that organisation. We are doing all the sorts of things you rightly identified should be done, Senator Siewert. Thank you for your contribution.</para>
<para>I am clearly running out of time but I urge Mr Ford from Western Australia to get real and to have a look at this. If he wants to get serious about it, come and find out what the real situation is. I assure senators in the chamber and indeed all Australians that the Howard government are determined to protect our borders. We are serious about border security. We will continue to divert to the action whatever assets are needed to properly protect our fisheries. It is a complex and difficult situation. It is a situation that does require collaboration and cooperation and very serious work. We are doing that. We intend to continue to do that. We will continue to do that until such time as we win the battle against illegal fishing. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate adopt the finding at paragraph 1.25 of the report, that, in respect of failures by Senator Lightfoot to comply with the Senate’s resolution requiring the registration of interests, no contempt should be found.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">On 16 June 2005, the Senate referred to the Committee of Privileges the question of whether there had been any failures by Senator Lightfoot to comply with the Senate resolution of 17 March 1994 relating to the registration of interests, and, if so, whether any contempt had been committed in that regard.</para>
<para>The 1994 resolution provides that any senator who knowingly fails to provide the Registrar of Senators’ Interests with a statement of their registrable interests by the due date, or to notify any changes to those interests within 28 days or who knowingly provides false or misleading information to the registrar shall be guilty of a serious contempt and shall be dealt with by the Senate accordingly. The question of whether any senator has committed a serious contempt must first be referred to the Privileges Committee. Although the regime for the registration of senators’ interests has been in operation since 1994, this is the first time that the committee has been required to consider a question of this nature.</para>
<para>As senators will recall, Senator Lightfoot was the subject of some publicity earlier in the year regarding a trip he took to Iraq in 2004. The issue of whether he had properly notified the registrar of sponsored travel in relation to this trip was the subject of a proposed reference to the committee in May this year, but the notice of motion was withdrawn after Senator Lightfoot apologised to the Senate. Subsequently, further questions arose as to whether Senator Lightfoot had properly notified the registrar of changes to his shareholdings. A second reference to this committee was proposed by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Evans, and agreed to by the Senate. This second matter is the subject of this 123rd report of the Privileges Committee.</para>
<para>Although it was the first time the committee had dealt with a matter of this nature, the senators’ interests resolution provides very clear direction on what the committee must look for. There must be clear evidence of an intention on the part of the senator concerned to commit any of the offences listed in the resolution. There was no dispute that Senator Lightfoot had failed to notify the registrar of particular changes in his shareholdings and had provided late notifications—and, in one case, a misleading notification—to the registrar. What could not be established was whether Senator Lightfoot had any guilty intention in making or not making these particular disclosures.</para>
<para>In accordance with its usual practices, the committee received submissions from both Senator Lightfoot and Senator Chris Evans, exchanged copies with each party and, in response, received further submissions. These submissions, published in an appendix to the report, provided the committee with a sufficient basis to conclude that Senator Lightfoot did not knowingly fail to provide information, or provide false or misleading information, to the registrar. The committee has concluded that no contempt should be found, and the motion I have moved today seeks the Senate’s endorsement of our finding. In order to give senators an opportunity to consider the report before that motion is determined, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

<para>—by leave—The Australian Defence Force does a truly magnificent job in defending this nation and its interests. This government has shown, and continues to show, its commitment to provide the best equipment and conditions of service necessary to ensure that the ADF is a modern fighting force. And this government recognises that hand in hand with this commitment must be a determination to provide a military justice system that is as effective and fair as possible.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Today, I table the government’s detailed response to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into the effectiveness of Australia’s military justice system which reported on 16 June this year.</para>
<para>The Senate report was a significant and important contribution to the ongoing debate and each recommendation was carefully and thoroughly considered by the government. I take this opportunity to thank honourable senators who are members of the committee for their contribution.</para>
<para>The government response to the report contains detailed responses to each of the committee’s 40 recommendations. The government agrees that 30 of those recommendations be accepted in whole, in part or in principle. The government will implement alternative solutions to meet the outcomes sought by the report’s recommendations concerning the referral of offences to civil authorities, the legislative basis of a permanent military court and the establishment of an ADF administrative review board.</para>
<para>Today, I am announcing significant enhancements to the military justice system. We in the government support a military justice system; however, we believe that it can be improved, and these announcements today will contribute to that goal. These changes will balance the necessity of the maintenance of effective discipline, which is indivisible from the function of command and the preparedness of the ADF for operations, with the protection of individuals and their rights. This improved military justice system will deliver impartial, rigorous and fair outcomes through enhanced oversight, greater transparency and improved timeliness. Importantly, the reforms will complement and further progress work already under way in Defence to improve the administration of the military justice system.</para>
<para>There are several key initiatives that the government will be implementing. These are the establishment of an Australian Military Court, a new commission of inquiry process, a triservice ADF investigation unit and a more streamlined and effective complaints and redress of grievance system.</para>
<para>The Australian Military Court will be a permanent military court which will replace the existing system of individually convened trials by Defence Force magistrates and courts martial. The court will be established under appropriate Defence legislation. Military judge advocates will be appointed by the government, have security of tenure, have independent financial security and be ineligible for promotion throughout their tenure. These new features will ensure that our military judicial officers have as much judicial independence as possible.</para>
<para>The level of independence and rigour of inquiries into ADF incidents resulting in death will be strengthened. It is essential that we demonstrate that ADF inquiries into these incidents are independent of the chain of command and so the government will create a new and mandatory level of inquiry. The Chief of the Defence Force will establish a mandatory commission of inquiry for all such incidents and an independent civilian, with judicial experience, will be its president.</para>
<para>The government will establish a joint ADF investigation unit to investigate more serious offences with a service connection. The unit will be headed by a new ADF provost marshal who will be independent of the service chains of command. The unit will provide a central point of contact for consultation with civilian authorities on more serious offences. The military police will benefit enormously from the improved procedures, expertise and standards when team members from this new unit return to their respective services and it will provide a readily identifiable career path for all service police.</para>
<para>The government will reform and streamline the complaints and redress of grievance system pursuant to the recommendations made by the joint Defence Force Ombudsman and CDF redress of grievance system review of 2004. We have already begun implementing many of the review’s recommendations. Changes to this system will improve the accountability, impartiality and timeliness of processing and monitoring complaints.</para>
<para>I am pleased to inform the Senate that Defence has already identified many of the concerns raised by the Senate committee report and that implementation of many of the recommendations was well under way before the committee tabled its report.</para>
<para>The report recommended establishing a statutory independent Director of Military Prosecutions to undertake the decision-making function in respect of military prosecutions. We have already drafted legislation which achieves this and will progress this through the parliament as soon as possible. The Director of Military Prosecutions will be appointed by the government, with security of tenure, financial security and independence from the chain of command. The DMP will be appointed at a one-star level.</para>
<para>Complementary to this appointment will be that of the Director of Defence Counsel Services which will significantly improve the availability and management of defence counsel services. This will be established as a military staff position within the Defence Legal Division.</para>
<para>The Senate committee report recognised the work that has been undertaken within Defence to address shortcomings in the care, control and rights of minors in the ADF Cadets. This work includes:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>implementation of a behaviour policy, providing training and materials on the expected standards of behaviour, and including guidance and advice on the handling of sexual misconduct;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>development of a wellbeing program, specifically targeted at the mental health wellbeing of ADFC cadets;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>introduction of an ADFC cadet and adult cadet staff training enhancement program;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>a review of child protection policy and processes in line with state and territory legislation;</para>

<item>
<para>a review of screening processes for new staff; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>production of a youth development guide for adult cadet staff.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">However, the committee expressed concerns about the legal relationship defining the rights and responsibilities of Defence and ADF Cadets. As part of the significant work initiated under the government’s Cadet Enhancement Program, we are currently finalising amendments to the cadet regulations which more adequately resolve these concerns.</para>
<para>The report also recommended that the government establish a task force to immediately begin work on clearing the backlog of grievances currently awaiting action. As I have indicated previously, we have begun implementing many of the recommendations contained within the redress of grievance system review, the majority of which mirror the concerns of the Senate committee. Our determination to improve the complaints system is demonstrated by the fact that this particular recommendation was assigned top priority and immediate steps were taken to reduce the number of grievance cases. The backlog is expected to be cleared by the end of this year, with no requirement for additional funding or a task force.</para>
<para>The government support the need for parliamentary oversight and accountability of the military justice system and we will include in the Defence annual report information on the implementation and effectiveness of reforms to the military justice system arising from both this report and previous reviews under implementation and the workload and effectiveness of key bodies within the military justice system. We will further amend the Defence (Inquiry) Regulations to provide for an annual report on their operation, thereby fulfilling a recommendation of the Burchett report.</para>
<para>The Senate report recommended that Defence undertake a range of additional reviews and increased annual reporting on elements of the military justice system, including a recommendation that Defence commission a review into its disciplinary and administrative systems. The government agree with this in principle, but will implement it on a broader basis. In addition to ongoing internal monitoring and review, we will commission regular independent reviews on the health of the military justice system. These reviews will be headed by a qualified eminent Australian, with the first review in two years to assess the effectiveness of the reforms that I am announcing today.</para>
<para>There are three main areas where the government cannot agree with the Senate committee’s recommendations.</para>
<para>The first concerns the automatic referral of the investigation and prosecution of all criminal offences to civilian authorities.</para>
<para>The committee proposes that a military justice system should be one that provides ‘impartial, rigorous and fair outcomes and one that is transparent and accountable for all ADF personnel’. These principles are endorsed wholeheartedly, but they also need to be balanced by the unique requirements of the military command system and the paramount need to maintain an effective standard of discipline. In operations, this requirement literally becomes a matter of life and death.</para>
<para>It is not feasible to maintain an effective defence force during peacetime, or use it effectively during wartime or even in conditions such as peacekeeping, without the members of such a force being subject to a statutory code of military discipline. We cannot use a civil criminal code, not least because such codes lack the disciplinary provisions required to keep order and encourage discipline and cohesive teamwork in armed bodies training for, and engaging in, battle.</para>
<para>Jurisdiction under the Defence Force Discipline Act can only be exercised when proceedings under the DFDA can reasonably be regarded as substantially serving the purpose of maintaining or enforcing service discipline. As is current practice, the military will not investigate or prosecute offences unless that service connection is clearly present.</para>
<para>The military must be in a position to enforce internal discipline effectively and efficiently. The purpose of the military discipline system is the maintenance of discipline. It does not duplicate the civilian criminal system. Criminal activity can only be investigated and prosecuted under the DFDA if essential for maintaining discipline—very different to the purpose of the civilian criminal law.</para>
<para>It is possible that a matter that has a counterpart in the civil criminal environment, like assault, will have a significant disciplinary aspect to it. Take, for example, the case of a minor assault. It has on an objective standard a very limited criminality but it could have a very significant disciplinary component. Removing such offences, and indeed all minor crime, from the military justice system would have a major impact upon the ability of the military to quickly identify and remedy potential breaches of unacceptable behaviour.</para>
<para>The ability to deal with discipline and criminal conduct under the DFDA is particularly necessary during operational deployments outside Australia. It can provide a stand-alone code where a civilian jurisdiction either may not apply or does not exist. It also provides a means to deal with misconduct that might otherwise be subject to the jurisdiction of foreign countries or the International Criminal Court. Members of the ADF do not yield their legal responsibilities and safeguards as citizens under Australian law when deploying to serve their country but they do render themselves accountable under the additional disciplinary code, the DFDA. The ADF applies a far greater level of additional regulation than that encountered in other forms of employment and demands behaviour that is consistent with its role as an armed force. Proscribing behaviour under the DFDA includes not only matters of a criminal nature applicable to the general community but also a range of service disciplinary matters which constitute significant failings in the context of a disciplined armed force.</para>
<para>However, while discipline is clearly fundamental to an effective military force, it must be tempered with a concern for individuals and their rights. Finding the balance between discipline and the rights of individuals is the key to achieving operational effectiveness and success. The ADF has been universally praised, including by the Senate committee, for exemplary performance in operations. The military justice system in providing the balance between discipline and individual rights has underpinned the operational success of the ADF over recent years. An effective military justice system is a means to achieve the goal of maximum operational effectiveness and, as such, a military justice system as a core function of command cannot be administered solely by civilian authorities. The ADF requires a military justice system to support commanding officers and to protect the rights of members at every level. It is vital to the successful conduct of operations and to facilitate its activities in peace time. Commanders and leaders use the military justice system on a daily basis. It is integral to their ability to lead the people for whom they are responsible in order to ensure their welfare and safety. It is a core function that cannot be administered solely by civilian authorities without substantial risk to operational effectiveness.</para>
<para>However, while the government are of the firm belief that the military should be responsible for its justice system, we will work to improve the management and effectiveness of the relationship between the military and civilian authorities on the referral of offences. This will include reviewing and clarifying the guidelines and examining the need for, and implementing as necessary, formal arrangements with the states and territories for referral of offences. Defence also intends to establish a common database for tracking referrals.</para>
<para>The second recommendation the government cannot support is the creation of a permanent military court in accordance with chapter III of the Commonwealth Constitution, that is, the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth. There are significant policy and legal issues raised by the proposal to have a military court as a chapter III court. Chapter III of the Constitution imposes real constraints in this regard. For example, a chapter III court would require security of tenure until retirement and the right to trial by a jury for indictable offences. Importantly, the jury pool could not be limited to Defence Force officers. The government does not support these features for a military court. Also, a chapter III court would require its military judicial officers to be immune from the provisions of the DFDA subjecting them to military discipline. Whilst this is appropriate regarding the performance of their judicial duties, the government does not support making them exempt from military discipline in the performance of their non-judicial duties such as training.</para>
<para>As I have already announced, the government will create a permanent military court to be known as the Australian Military Court. Although this new court will not be in strict accordance with chapter III of the Constitution, it will have many new chapter III attributes. Legal advice to the government indicates that a military court outside chapter III will be valid provided jurisdiction is only exercised under the military system where proceedings can be reasonably regarded as substantially serving the purpose of maintaining or enforcing service discipline. This is the current situation. The new court will satisfy the principles of impartiality and judicial independence through the statutory appointment of military judge advocates with a security of tenure—five-year fixed terms with a possible renewal of five years—and remuneration set by the Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal. During the period of their appointment the judge advocates will not be eligible for promotion, to further strengthen their independence from the chain of command. The Australian Military Court will consist of a chief judge advocate and two permanent judge advocates with a part-time reserve panel. The panel of judge advocates will be selected from any of the available qualified full- or part-time legal officers. The court will be provided with appropriate paralegal support sufficient for it to function independently from the chain of command. In meeting all of the requirements of military justice, the court will include options for judge advocates to sit alone or, in more serious cases, with a military jury.</para>
<para>The ADF will continue to require a summary authority scheme to operate for offences other than those that would be dealt with by the Australian Military Court. The government will go beyond the Senate committee report recommendations and develop summary procedures with simplified rules of evidence and the right of appeal on conviction and sentence to a judge advocate of the Australian Military Court. This will respond to the concerns of the Senate committee that the current summary procedures are legalistic and overly complex. The government agrees with the concept of an automatic right of appeal, on conviction or punishment, from summary authorities to a judge advocate of the Australian Military Court. The current process of review will be discontinued. The right of appeal to the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Tribunal will be retained. Currently, the tribunal may only hear appeals on conviction on points of law, and may quash a conviction or substitute a conviction on an alternative offence. This will be amended to include appeals on punishment, noting that such an appeal might result in an increased punishment.</para>
<para>The third recommendation that the government cannot support is that an ADF administrative review board be established to improve the timeliness and impartiality of the complaints and redress of grievance processes. I again draw the Senate’s attention to the government’s detailed response to this recommendation. As proposed, such an agency would not support the relationship between command and discipline, would introduce enormous duplication, be highly resource intensive, provide no increase in perceived independence and would remove the responsibility and accountability of commanding officers for the wellbeing of ADF personnel.</para>
<para>The government have accepted, however, that there is a need to improve the redress of grievance process, and in giving effect to recommendations from the 2004 redress of grievance system review we have begun to implement a raft of new initiatives and procedures to improve the timeliness and transparency of complaint management, monitoring and review. In particular, we have directed that the Complaint Resolution Agency become the lead agency in the coordination of complaints and redresses of grievances. The Complaint Resolution Agency is an existing body which is established within Defence but outside the ADF chain of command.</para>
<para>In its expanded role, the CRA will have three major functions.</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>The CRA will initially provide advice to commanding officers on the management of every application for redress of grievance and monitor the handling of those redress applications at the unit level. It will have an enhanced advisory and oversight function of every application.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>The CRA will have the authority to advise on appropriately trained and qualified investigating officers at this initial stage and, if necessary, will require an alternative investigating officer to that nominated by the commander.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Where ADF personnel refer their complaint to the Service Chief or the Chief of the Defence Force following the decision of the commanding officer, the Complaint Resolution Agency, as in the present situation, will conduct an independent review of the matter and provide recommendations to the decision maker. All complaints will be registered with the Complaint Resolution Agency within five days of initiation and it will be empowered to take over the management of all cases unresolved by commanders 90 days after lodgment. In all cases, the agency will be the central point for monitoring progress and resolution. A single register for tracking complaints across the ADF will be implemented.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para>However, for those ADF personnel who, for whatever reason, do not wish to use the chain of command, there will remain two alternative avenues of complaint—the Inspector General of the ADF and the Defence Force Ombudsman. The existing Inspector General of the ADF was established as recommended by Mr Burchett QC to deal exclusively with military justice matters. The IGADF was established to provide the Chief of the Defence Force with a mechanism for internal audit and review of the military justice system independent of the ordinary chain of command and as an avenue by which failures and flaws in the military justice system can be exposed and examined so that the cause of any injustice may be remedied. Although it is not a general complaint handling agency like the CRA, it does provide an avenue for those with complaints about military justice who are, for some reason, unable to go through their chain of command to have their complaints investigated and remedied. The government has drafted legislation to establish the Inspector General of the ADF as a statutory appointment in order to further strengthen its independence.</para>
<para>In addition to this review mechanism, and completely external to the ADF, is recourse to the Defence Force Ombudsman. This position will retain legislative authority to receive and review complaints and to initiate on its own motion investigations into ADF administration processes. The Defence Force Ombudsman has statutory power to investigate a matter, make findings and recommend a course of action to the appropriate decision maker, and to table a report in parliament if deemed necessary.</para>
<para>The government is committed to reforming the military justice system to address the concerns of defence personnel, the parliament and the community. The government will ensure that the system is adequately resourced by initially establishing an additional 35 positions, as well as two new permanent military judge advocates in addition to the Chief Judge Advocate for the Australian Military Court, at an approximate cost of $3.5 million per annum. The Chief of the Defence Force, the Secretary of Defence and the Service Chiefs are committed to a fair and equitable workplace and will personally drive the implementation of these reforms. They will meet on a monthly basis to review and monitor progress made in implementing these reforms, as well as the recommendations that Defence is already implementing as a result of previous reviews such as those undertaken by Mr Burchett QC. A military two-star officer has been appointed to lead a dedicated team to oversee the two-year implementation period. As a further measure of the government’s determination to thoroughly and effectively reform the military justice system, Defence will provide six-monthly reports on progress to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee throughout the two-year implementation process.</para>
<para>I said at the beginning of this statement that a modern and professional force deserves a modern and effective system of military justice. With the reforms I have announced today, the government will provide a system that will better ensure impartial and fair outcomes, and strike an effective balance between the need to ensure effective discipline within the Australian Defence Force and to protect individuals and their rights.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the statement.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I thank the minister at the outset for his response to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report into military justice. This is a generally superficial response to a serious report on a serious issue. In short, it is rather disgraceful that such a matter should have been left so long unattended. The pain and suffering suffered by so many under the current system of military justice should never have been tolerated. In fact, it is a sad comment to note that after nine years and six other inquiries so little has been done.</para>
<para>This response, as outlined by the minister, is full of compromises. It is about process and tinkering with the status quo. None of it will change the culture of behaviour which is the root cause behind the problems. However, the committee is to be commended for its commitment and determination to see something substantive done. That said though, we know there is still a long way to go. We know the process of the inquiry has developed considerable expectations. Those who have suffered the injustice of the current system need assurance that the government is serious in its response. They want to know that, in the future, justice will be done. They need to know that, in the future, others shall not have to suffer the way they have. Parents want assurance that their children are safe and that the duty of care means something.</para>
<para>I make a particular point of this, because grieving parents want more consolation than has been provided to date. These reforms will not address their needs. They want to see the principles of transparency and accountability observed in fact. That includes full and proper investigation, bringing offenders to account and no doubt some compensation which addresses their loss. That is perfectly understandable, and we urge the government to seriously consider, free of the current litigious and combative culture, the emotional needs of grieving parents. Their motives and emotions are understandable, and simple apologies are not sufficient. There have to be better ways of satisfying their needs.</para>
<para>The establishment of a new death inquiry process reporting directly to the Chief of the Defence Force may go some way to providing more assurance that past shortcomings will not be tolerated into the future. The problem is, though, that whatever the changes might be to the system, they will only be as good as the government makes them. We do not want to see any more suicides caused by bastardisation and harassment. We want to see that the perpetrators of offences are properly investigated without compromise and, if appropriate, dealt with. We want to see transparent, fair and efficient processes where natural justice is paramount. We want to see a complete end to the current culture.</para>
<para>That is a very difficult demand. Little of the government’s response today gives us confidence that this change will occur. No matter what the changes to institutions and processes might be, unsatisfactory human behaviour is not easily transformed. The military has for too long tolerated, and even encouraged, a culture of persecution and bullying. This is often dressed up as discipline and control, but it is not. That is not to say that the military should not be tough. Military life is tough—it has to be in many situations where control and management are paramount. We in no way resile from the sentiments expressed about the need for firm military discipline as expressed in the minister’s statement, but at the same time we are of the view that there are limits. Those limits are too often exceeded and, beyond that, there has been quite inadequate redress.</para>
<para>However, beyond that the Labor Party has a number of serious concerns about the compromises made by the government to the committee’s recommendations. While there does seem to be some acceptance of the principles enunciated by the committee, the grafting of the response into the current system rather than root and branch reform is regrettable. For example, the establishment of a military court might seem okay, but without full tenure for properly qualified and experienced judges there is an immediate compromise. The system just cannot let go. Similarly, the attitude to defence counsel does not address the need for independence—it is still compromised by the system. Equally, it is disappointing that the recommended changes to the system of administrative review have also been compromised. The grafting of the principles of independence into the current system does not go far enough, and the case for dismissing the committee’s views on cost grounds is superficial. In short, the committee’s recommendations for root and branch reform have been bypassed. We can only hope again that this report and the government’s response will represent a turning point.</para>
<para>However, it must be said that there are a few positives. We welcome the acceptance of the committee’s recommendation of ongoing reporting to the parliament on the progress of the reform of military justice. In that way we can keep a close eye on how the government proceeds down this path of reform and whether there are real changes. While we are disappointed that the government has rejected the recommendations on a clearer separation of Defence and civilian investigations, the commitment to upgrading the military police is well overdue. Whether it works is another thing but, once again, this shows how restricted the government’s response really is. Equally, whether the new forms of appeal and review actually work is something on which we must reserve our judgment. The reason for our scepticism simply is that there is so much compromise in the government’s response that the transparency and accountability the committee sought cannot be guaranteed.</para>
<para>Overall, today’s response does not allay our fears about the government’s intentions on military justice. The compromises are extensive, and so we reserve our judgment until we can examine the final detail and see the necessary legislation. Certainly those who are mourning the loss of loved ones and those whose careers and lives have been destroyed will not take any satisfaction from this. I can assure the government that we will return to this subject frequently. As far as we are concerned, this was the last chance to get the system fixed.</para>
<para>The proof of the pudding is going to be in the eating, and the government is therefore on notice that continuing breaches of military justice will be sheeted home. Nevertheless, I thank the minister for the expeditious way in which he has handled the inquiry report and for his response more or less within the time allowed. This is probably one of the more serious issues the committee has dealt with, certainly in human terms. I also commend the chairman of the committee, Senator Hutchins, and the committee secretariat on the production of the quality report. I should also congratulate Senator Evans, who provided much of the impetus, as well as Senators Johnston and Payne, whom I suspect have been very influential in obtaining such a prompt response.</para>

<para>—by leave—I would like to speak briefly to the government’s response to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report on Australia’s military justice system. Firstly, I want to echo the concluding remarks of Senator Bishop: the minister should be congratulated for responding quite promptly to what was a very substantial report with a wide range of recommendations. I believe the government deserves a lot of condemnation for failing to respond promptly—or at all, in many cases—to Senate committee reports.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is a credit to Senator Hill that on this occasion he has bucked the trend and shown some respect for the Senate committee processes. Equally importantly, he has shown respect for the people who put their necks on the line: the families of those who were affected by injustices who were willing to put their personal circumstances out in the public arena because they believed in the need for improvement in this key area, and they believed in the need to minimise the prospects of other families going through what they had to go through themselves. It is not just a matter of senators feeling pleased that the minister has responded quickly; it is a significant sign of respect for those people in the community who put such faith and effort into this committee process.</para>
<para>I would also like to note that the minister did the traditional practice—probably almost an outdated thing now—of putting forward a major policy pronouncement in the parliament rather than just holding a media conference outside, like Senator Vanstone did on changes to land rights, or even as Senator Abetz did with his speech to the Sydney Institute, which was obviously a very exhausting process for him last night. It is good to see the minister using the parliament for what it is for, and that is putting on the record, in a full way and with the personal action of the responsible minister, the details of the government’s position and the reasoning behind it. We do not see very much of that anymore, sadly. I do not know if Senator Hill is the last of the dying breed that still has a bit of respect for the parliament and when he passes on that will be the end of it; but I would like to take the opportunity to note that and to encourage a few other government ministers to recognise the importance of the parliament for presenting significant responses and ministerial statements such as this.</para>
<para>In terms of the contents of the response, I do not profess to have the same degree of expertise as the speakers to date or the chairman of the inquiry, Senator Hutchins, who will speak next. It is difficult for small parties to be across the full details of these issues with the wide range of committee inquiries that are going on. But having done as much as I could in following the initial inquiry, which was very comprehensive and went on over quite a long period of time, and having read the government’s response, I do think there are components and steps here that people should take satisfaction from. I say that with regard to not just the senators and the secretariat but also the people in the Defence community who were willing to put faith in this process. I think they can take some satisfaction from the response. It is not as full and complete as it should be. There are still some uncertainties. As always we need to see the detail in the legislation that implements the announced changes to see how it will work in practice and whether it matches what the government has said. Clearly there will be need for further monitoring, and I am sure many senators will continue to do that.</para>
<para>Although the response does not go as far as it could have and should have, there are some significant steps forward in an area that will always be fraught. If, after the changes are implemented, the problems are not fully or properly addressed, I have no doubt that momentum for further change will continue. The fact that government has not gone as far as the Democrats would have preferred—or as far as the Senate committee would have preferred, seeing that they put forward a unanimous 40 or so recommendations—should not in any way suggest, ‘That is it. We have done as well as we could and it is all over now.’ It is certainly not all over now, and I am sure many senators will continue to push and pursue this issue to make sure that the intent and the spirit behind the recommendations do get implemented in practice.</para>
<para>I will not go through all of the government responses individually but note that whilst the government have not agreed to some of the recommendations they have at least taken the trouble to outline their rationale. I do not agree fully with all of the rationale, but it does make a case and it does provide a framework for the debate to continue; and that is the most important part. I think everybody recognises the immense value and benefit to the entire community, as well as to the Defence Force and Defence personnel themselves, of having a system of military justice in place that is efficient, effective and fair. That is clearly in our national interest and it is something that all of us from all sides of the chamber desire.</para>
<para>I am sure there are still many elements within the Defence Force that would continue to push for further acceptance of the sorts of principles that were put forward. The opportunity for doing all that in a constructive way is there. I have a lot of faith in the ability of the new Chief of the Defence Force, Angus Houston, and I know that he has a genuine commitment to the wellbeing of all his personnel. Having said that, no one person can deliver utopia on their own. It needs the work of a lot of people, and it is a role that the Senate can continue to play a part in as well.</para>
<para>In summary, it is a reasonable response from the government in many respects, but it still falls short in a few key areas. There are still a few question marks that we will need to follow up on, and obviously there is a need for continuing oversight and assessment to see how things operate into the future. Given the sorts of commitments that the minister has put on the record through this statement here today, the Democrats will certainly continue to offer our support to the process. I am sure many other senators will, likewise, be putting a lot of their time into trying to make sure that this important area of public policy operates as well as it really needs to.</para>

<para>—The response by the Minister for Defence today is welcome. Just as a reminder to senators, the report that was delivered to the Senate on 16 June this year was unanimous. The secretariat and the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee worked a long time and very hard to come up with a report that we felt reflected the observations that we had concluded as a result of our inquiry. Our inquiry commenced public hearings in April 2004. As I said, as a result of those hearings—I think there were eight of them—we came to unanimous conclusions. Senator Bishop is right in mentioning a number of the coalition senators who assisted and, by agreeing to the conclusions that were in the report, made it a unanimous report. In particular, I refer to Senator David Johnston and Senator Marise Payne. Of course, the new Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade, Senator Sandy Macdonald, who, as Senator Hogg has reminded me, does know a bit about defence, was also equally of assistance in coming to the conclusions that we came to in this inquiry.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The fact is that, as Senator Bishop has said, this is in essence the last chance for the military to put its house in order. The substantial parts of the committee report that have not been agreed to by the government essentially are the contexts over whether or not issues dealing with disciplinary or administrative investigations should be dealt with or have some sort of input by civilian rather than totally military inquiries. As a result of those observations and hearings from April 2004 until the report was tabled on 16 June this year, as a committee we could not come to any other conclusion than that the Australian Defence Force could not be trusted to conduct those inquiries or investigations in-house.</para>
<para>My colleagues—and I am sure they can talk for themselves—and I came to the conclusion that, as I said, the military could not be trusted. All the evidence that we received in relation to not just the circumstances surrounding the suicides or accidental deaths but also the stuff-ups that occurred in administrative and disciplinary justice within the system was that we could not come to any other conclusion than this. I can see the handiwork of some of the coalition senators in some of the statements that the minister made today. They are a welcome development in the response that the minister has put before us. I said that this was the ADF’s last chance—as did Senator Bishop, and my colleagues in the coalition may come to the same conclusion—to put its house in order before more radical reforms need to be effected.</para>
<para>In the last decade there have been six inquiries into one aspect or form of military justice, and each one of them has cried out to say that it is not fair, that something is going dreadfully wrong and that the culture is difficult and is not changing. I believe that, as a result of our inquiry, the government has accepted substantial parts of our committee’s report. The commitment to an Australian military court, subject to some constitutional difficulties, will broadly match the recommendations for courts martial, as per our committee recommendations. I think the government is to be applauded for the commitment to an independent commission of inquiry that will investigate serious incidents on mandatory referral, and it will have a civilian as its president.</para>
<para>Best practice is to be encouraged within the service police through a tri-service investigation unit that will manage serious offences. I have serious reservations about the tri-service police forces. I do not think they have been given the resources, the training or the encouragement. I do not think they have the stature that they require to do this, and that is one of the reasons why we came up with the conclusions that we did. The government must be held to its longstanding promise to ensure that the Director of Military Prosecutions is made independent from the chain of command. We have requested this over a few years now, and on each occasion we have been given the undertaking by the government that this will be done, but this has not occurred as yet. Again, this is in the statement by the minister today, and it is welcomed.</para>
<para>However, the government has failed to take up our recommendation about due process for ordinary ADF members, which would enable them to go before an independent administrative review board, in favour of enhancing a complaints resolution agency. This is the last chance, I believe. The opportunity is welcomed by me, and I am sure by the committee, to report every six months over the next two years on the progress of the implementation process.</para>
<para>I spoke to the committee secretary this afternoon and she advised me that only as early as this morning an RAAF officer had contacted the committee office to outline some difficulties he had been experiencing as a result of the military justice system. This is not a one-off situation. From 16 June onward, the committee secretariat has been receiving numerous inquiries from service personnel seeking the redress of grievances or the application of military justice. The service personnel and their families believe that the Senate committee is some sort of permanent standing body that is able to oversight the implementation of military justice in the ADF. That, of course, is not our duty. However, we cannot ignore the inquiries from members of the Australian Defence Force or their families when they make serious allegations about the denial of justice or the denial of access to administrative or disciplinary redress.</para>
<para>We will probably need to consider these matters as a committee—and we will do so over the next week or so—and decide how we will deal with these inquiries. But, as I said, they have not stopped since the inquiry presented its report on 16 June. I doubt very much that they will stop, because there clearly is a group of people who have experienced the harshness of military justice, who believe that they have not been dealt with fairly and who do not believe they have access under the current system for fairness or justice to be delivered to them. So they are going to the only body they believe is independent, and that is the Senate references committee that I am currently the chairman of.</para>
<para>We will do everything we can to assist the government in this oversight or meeting with the implementation officer to make sure that the progress is carried on and is in accordance with the spirit of the inquiry’s report. But, in the end, as I said earlier, this does still look to me like a victory for all of the boffins that are running and have run military justice in this country for some time. There have been six inquiries in nine years. In each one of them the same points have been raised in reports, but they have somehow or other been fobbed off or obfuscated. It was hoped they would go away, but clearly they are not going away. They will not go away until it is demonstrated to the ADF, ADF personnel and their families that they will have access to justice that clearly has been denied them for some period.</para>
<para>The culture does need to change. I think my colleague Senator Hogg will comment on that. I hope that this report sends a signal to those men and women who think we are still back in the 19th century and that that is the appropriate way to conduct business. That is no longer the way. This is the last chance for the ADF. If we as members of parliament receive further complaints that, even as a result of the implementation of these reforms, the people conducting the ADF still proceed in the way they have been for some time, I do not think any government, whether it be us or the coalition, can ignore the fact that there will need to be serious civilian input in peacetime into the military justice system.</para>

<para>—In the very short time that I have to respond to the government’s response to our committee’s report—and I say ‘our’ because it was a unanimous report—I first want to thank the families and witnesses who went to the trouble of making their submissions and who, through great emotional difficulty in some circumstances, attended upon the committee and gave their testimony. They are courageous ADF people, as were their family members. I thank them for that. I want to be on record as saying that the ADF will be much better in the long run for the efforts of those family members and other people who showed their concern about military justice and came to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Having said that, I want to pay a special but brief tribute to General Cosgrove, then Chief of the Defence Force. This was not an easy inquiry for him. He is very close to his troops and his culture. He is a very successful military commander. Military justice is a small but significant aspect of the functioning of the Australian Defence Force. General Cosgrove disclosed patience and a capacity to entertain what was difficult for him to entertain, having been in the Defence Force for more than 30 years, as I understand it. I also say that General Leahy of Army, Admiral Ritchie of Navy and Air Marshal Houston of Air Force entertained the committee’s terms of reference with the sort of dignity, honour and seriousness that I would have expected of them. They met my aspirations in that regard. I thank them for that. Again, this was difficult for them. Case after case attacked the very integrity of the Defence Force that they have given all of their lives to. They confronted these things, I think, as well as could be expected in the circumstances.</para>
<para>I am encouraged by the response of the Minister for Defence. I have heard the opposition spokesperson decry some of the aspects of the response. I am encouraged and I thank the minister and the Chief of the Defence Force for what I perceive to be an earnest and sincere response to what has been a problem. It is difficult and yet in the pages of the very many recommendations that the government has accepted—and these were substantial reforms: new courts, new powers and new jurisdictions—the Australian Defence Force has gone a long way towards meeting the requirements of many members of the committee.</para>
<para>I became concerned when the mother of one of our special forces soldiers came to me with the story of her son. I listened for an hour or more. She is a Western Australian lady, quite an elderly lady and a delightful lady. I was outraged at the level of injustice that her son, who had given so much to his country, had to endure. I set about the task of seeking to rectify that injustice. I, and to some extent Graham Edwards from the lower house, have been successful in that. The SAS soldier received a full written apology for the mismanagement of his case.</para>
<para>In closing, I trust that no-one in future will have to endure what that SAS soldier had to endure. I hope we have learned the lessons. The Australian Defence Force is about learning the lessons. This is a small but very important part of the functioning of the Australian Defence Force. On the whole, there are many things for all of us to be very proud about in the functioning, the performance and the commitment of our Australian Defence Force members. This has been a long and sorry saga in a dark corner of their historic record. If I can read between the lines, I think we have turned the corner. I would always be very proud if my son chose to become a member of the Australian Defence Force.</para>

<para>—I too was a member of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee in the conduct of this particular inquiry. I too welcome the timely response by the Minister for Defence this afternoon. It should be well noted that there are many reports tabled in this parliament that are not responded to in a timely way and this is one that was responded to with reasonable haste by the government and by the minister. That should be clearly acknowledged.</para>

<para>The report itself showed one thing: how important the inquiries conducted by the Senate and, in particular, the committees of the Senate are. It has shown that as a result of this report the government has made a shift in the position that previously existed on military justice. Whilst it does not go the whole way, it does go part of the way to maybe resolving some of the difficulties. It is welcome indeed and it does definitely show the real force that can be delivered by the work of the committees of the Senate.</para>
<para>Having said that I welcome the response of the minister, like some of my colleagues I am also disappointed about some of the responses contained in the statement read by the minister this afternoon. I recall that when the report was tabled in the Senate I did not speak at length. The report was a unanimous report of the committee. The committee had sat through some quite difficult hearings when we took evidence from members of the public as well as from former and serving members of the Defence Force. It was quite stressful for us as individuals—and I recorded that on the occasion—as it was for members of the secretariat and members of Hansard who also listened to the evidence. It was one of those inquiries where there was a fair deal of tension in the inquiry itself, not because of partisan politics but because of the nature of the issue, which led people to feel very deeply for those who were appearing before the committee.</para>
<para>So I welcomed the unanimous report that was tabled and, as I said, I did not speak at length on it. But I did say that it showed in my view that the system was broken and could not be fixed. It was not a system that was going to be plastered over with little pieces of paper and fixed up on an ad hoc sort of basis. I still have no reason to resile from that view. I am still of the view that the system is broken, in spite of the good intentions of the minister here this afternoon and in spite of the good intentions expressed on behalf of senior personnel within the Australian Defence Force. I do not doubt their integrity, their goodwill or their good intent—not at all. But it became very clear to me that the system could not deliver fairness, equity and justice to those who serve in our Defence Force.</para>
<para>In my nine-plus years in this parliament I have on many occasions stood up and said some things that are not necessarily popular, seeking the best outcome for our defence personnel because they deserve it. They are at the hard end of work in this country in the sense that they do not know their fate in some instances from one day to the next and they are called upon to operate in some very difficult circumstances. But the military justice system did not deliver fairness, did not deliver equity and did not deliver justice to our defence personnel. I am not certain that what the minister has put to us today is going to overcome the difficulties that I experienced and I am sure others experienced in the evidence that was presented to the committee.</para>
<para>What is necessary is a system that delivers transparency and accountability throughout the military chain. I do not know that that is going to happen. Whilst there is goodwill on the part of senior defence personnel, it is my view that in some instances senior defence personnel were the problem in the inquiry. They were the people being complained about. I do not know that this necessarily fixes that problem. From what I have heard, I do not think it does.</para>
<para>Nonetheless, the initiatives that have been outlined by the government tend to indicate that there has at least been a significant shift in the attitude of the government toward military justice. But, as my colleague Senator Hutchins said, part of the problem has been the culture of the Defence Force. I do not know how you legislate a change in culture. That is a fundamental problem. You can legislate many things, but legislating a change in culture is difficult indeed. The culture is endemic. It has been there over a long period of time. To change that culture has not been easy. As a matter of fact, it has been almost impossible. As Senator Hutchins quite rightly said, there have been a number of inquiries to try to redress the lack of transparency and accountability in the military justice system, and it has not happened in spite of those inquiries. In the brief speech I made when the report was tabled, I said that the last thing I wanted was to be back here at some time addressing problems with the military justice system because it had once again failed. I do not think that we as a country can stand that happening. Our defence forces are far too important for that.</para>
<para>I note that in his statement the Minister for Defence said that the government are committed to reforming the military justice system to address the concerns of defence personnel, the parliament and the community. Whilst I am pleased that the government are addressing the concerns of the committee, as expressed through the parliament, more important is the need of the community and the defence personnel. It was defence personnel and the community who were most aggrieved, otherwise the inquiry would never have taken place and there would not have been the spirit and emotion that was presented to us at the inquiry. So I trust that the government will follow through on this commitment to the reform process and to addressing the concerns of defence personnel. Clearly, we will be looking forward to evidence of that. On a positive note, I acknowledge that the minister mentioned in his statement that the government are going to adequately resource changes to the system, and he outlined a figure of $3.5 million per annum. I trust again that that is more than adequate. I do not know that it is at this stage, and I will be looking closely in the future to see that that is the case.</para>
<para>My colleague Senator Hutchins also said that this is the last chance for the military to get it right. I do not necessarily agree with that, because, as I said, my view was that the system was broken and could not be fixed. But let us assume that it is the last chance. I would then ask, ‘How many last chances are Defence going to be afforded?’ I have a great deal of respect for the CDF and a great deal of respect for many of the personnel in the senior ranks in Defence. The challenge is clearly laid at their feet to ensure that they deliver. If they do not, it will be fairly and squarely upon their shoulders and they will have, once again, failed the personnel in the Australian defence forces.</para>
<para>As Senator Hutchins said, we on the committee are still hearing of people complaining to the secretariat about grievances that are in the system. Admittedly, based on the minister’s statement, some action is being taken to clear some of the backlog that exists within the system. But clearly, unless some of the vested interests within the military justice system—where, I believe, there is part of an old boys’ system at work—are addressed, the system will fail, regardless of whatever changes the government brings in by way of legislation to try to shore up the system. I hope that at the end of the day the Australian people will be able to say that a committee of the Senate has done something positive, not only for the defence personnel but also for the defence of Australia. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

<para>—I rise speak to the <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline>. This is a very important bill that will help get more young Australians into traditional trades, providing them with choice in years 11 and 12. The Howard-Vaile government is committed to providing opportunities for young people in this country. Unlike the opposition, it has a plan. They have nothing—tipota; nothing. The Howard-Vaile government is determined to ensure that a trade qualification is as valued as any qualification gained at university. That is why the government has committed $343 million over the next four years to support the establishment and operation of the Australian technical colleges.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The 25 colleges, located in 24 regions across Australia, will give students the ability to undertake a school based new apprenticeship in a traditional trade, which will lead to a nationally recognised vocational and technical education qualification. At the same time, students will complete the academic subjects required for their year 12 qualification. Students will graduate from the colleges with a head start in their working life. They will gain trade, entrepreneurial and business skills, resulting in better employment opportunities and the capacity to be self-employed in the future or to go on to further education and training. In spite of what Senator Webber said in this place this morning, that is hardly going nowhere. Senator Webber mentioned that the lack of places was an obstacle to full economic development and growth. I would suggest that the obstacles to full economic development and growth would be those experienced under a Labor government, with 17 per cent interest rates and 10 per cent unemployment.</para>
<para>It is very pleasing that the government is not imposing a particular model of operation on the colleges. This government believes in choice—choice that allows each college to operate in a manner which best suits the needs of industry and students in the regions where the colleges will be established. Many students will benefit from the introduction of the ATCs. Senator Webber also stated this morning that the ATCs will provide places for 7,000 students over a five-year period. I will correct that: the ATCs will provide places for up to 7½ thousand students per year, once fully operational. This bill will give flexibility to each of the Australian technical colleges to tailor arrangements to meet local needs—a measure which will be especially important in the initial years of each college.</para>
<para>It was interesting to note Senator Lundy’s statement in this place on this yesterday. She said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The government has stated right from the word go that the first colleges will be up and running at the start of 2006. It seems a very quick implementation for a whole new concept in secondary education, but I have to say that I have never founded and run a brand-new education institution in under six months—maybe people are doing it all the time!</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I suggest to Senator Lundy that there are people out there who have the skills to get these colleges up and running quickly. The senator might do well to get out and talk to some of the people who are going to establish the ATCs.</para>
<para>Last week I had the opportunity to meet a successful applicant, who will be opening one of the first Australian technical colleges, in Port Macquarie on the New South Wales mid North Coast. Father Leo Donnelly, parish priest of St Agnes Parish, Port Macquarie, has been the driving force behind St Joseph’s Vocational College, or Vocol, which is a model very similar to the government’s proposed Australian technical colleges. Father Donnelly certainly knows what he is talking about. It was 26 years ago that he established the vocational education program in Port Macquarie. He has extensive experience in this field, and I have no doubt that he has the ability to have this college up and running early next year.</para>
<para>Vocol is a unique and innovative model which has evolved to consistently meet the demands of local industry while providing years 11 and 12 students with a New South Wales Higher School Certificate, giving them a significant head start in achieving their career goals. The team at St Joseph’s college, led by Father Donnelly, are recognised nationally as leaders in the field of vocational education and training. Father Donnelly believes the Australian technical college initiative of the federal government is a significant landmark in Australian secondary education. He also believes that adding a new and needed dimension to the education process has removed a straitjacket from senior secondary schooling, which has generally favoured those students who aspire to university. The reality is, and has been for a long time, that many senior secondary students do not have university aspirations. Along with Father Donnelly, the Howard-Vaile government believes the establishment of the Australian technical colleges will provide a more appropriate form of education for these students.</para>
<para>When the new Australian technical college in Port Macquarie opens on 2 February 2006—and, in spite of Senator Lundy’s misgivings, I have no doubt that it will—some 260 students are expected to walk through its doors. In addition to providing trade training from four of the core trades of metal and engineering, automotive, building and construction, electro technology and commercial cookery, the Port Macquarie Australian Technical College will offer marine studies and related courses that will complement other courses to support the emerging, multimillion dollar industries of boatbuilding and aquaculture on the mid North Coast.</para>
<para>It also plans to offer courses such as retail and early childhood, which will not only attract female students to these trade based colleges but also build on other courses by ensuring that students receive basic business skills and a holistic education that ensures that students will be job ready in every sense of the word by the end of their higher school certificate.</para>
<para>I sincerely congratulate Father Donnelly and his team on their vision in providing opportunity in education for students on the mid North Coast to date. I have no doubt that they will continue to provide that opportunity very well through the establishment of the ATC early next year.</para>
<para>It is disappointing that opposition to the government’s ATC initiative has come from teachers unions and from some TAFEs. In the case of the teachers unions, one would expect that they would welcome this significant development, which will greatly benefit their students and would be particularly welcomed, I would imagine, by the students’ parents. Similarly, the opposition from TAFEs is hard to comprehend since the work of the ATCs in no way replaces TAFEs but will encourage more students to proceed to technical and further education after year 12.</para>
<para>Senator Allison referred to the Queensland government’s submission to the Senate inquiry, which said that it supported the principle of ATCs but wanted the Australian government to consider alternative models which would achieve the same objectives—that is, the Queensland government’s preferred model whereby students would remain in their existing schools in Gladstone and the ATC would have a coordinating and school based New Apprenticeships brokerage role.</para>
<para>The ATCs will operate as best suits the particular region. The government has set minimum requirements: the ATC must be a school so that students gain their higher school certificate, it must offer SBNAs and it must be industry led and relevant to industry needs. Beyond that, it is up to local industry and communities to determine the best model for their region and their students. The potential Port Macquarie college is a very good example of that. I am advised that the ATCs will be seeking to cooperate with existing schools, both government and non-government, not compete with them. We hope that state governments will take a similar approach and that they will not raise obstacles to successful implementation of the ATCs.</para>
<para>The Howard-Vaile government recognises the importance of enabling more students to take up a trade as a career choice, and the <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline> provides real opportunity and real choice for young Australians. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline>

</talker>
<para>—Although I rise today to speak on the <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline>, I do not do so with any great enthusiasm. As someone who has spent a lifetime looking at issues associated with trade training and who, since coming to this place, has spent many hours in committees looking at the issues of skills and skills shortages, I see this bill as a slap in the face for every teenager in this country. It will contribute nothing over the long term to dealing with what is a chronic skills shortage in this country and will provide nothing in the short term to meet the needs of our businesses, large, medium and small—and particularly small businesses and high-value export industries which are desperately crying out for qualified staff.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is also a slap in the face for our current institutes that are training the skilled tradespeople of tomorrow, and that is in the TAFE system. These 24 technical colleges will be a pimple on the training infrastructure of this nation. The money and resources that will go into establishing these colleges—some $340 million—would have been much better spent on boosting the TAFE system that currently exists and providing the extra training places which this government stripped out of the TAFE system over the past five years. That would have done much more to encourage young people into the trades and to boost the number of young people in skills training.</para>
<para>I am amazed at this proposition. I do not know who thought it up, who drew it up or who conceived the idea, but if the minister had walked down a street where he lives, in his own electorate, and looked at what is occurring in training in the building industry and at the building skills centre at Rocklea, he would have found a ready-made formula to boost skills training in this country. That is an institution that is funded by a levy on the building industry in Queensland, which builders pay. That institution has married private sector training with public sector education institutes. It has married its structure with the TAFE structure.</para>
<para>That is an institution that has the capacity to train 3½ thousand apprentices per year in the building industry. It is training carpenters, it is training bricklayers, it is training plumbers, it is training welders and it is even training boatbuilders in its institute—but it is doing more than that. It is also training independent individual contractors not how to perform their work but how to run their businesses. And we know that many independent contractors in the building industry and other industries go broke every year because they do not have the basic concepts of how to run a business. That is a ready-made formula sitting there which could have been implemented right across this country for nowhere near the amount of money that is being spent on these technical colleges.</para>
<para>There is another one in the Hunter Valley: the Hunter Valley Training Company, which is training apprentice welders, boilermakers and mainly others in the metal trades. It is run by the AiG and it has a classic structure that could have been readily picked up again and emulated right across this country to deal with the skilled work force shortage in the metal industry. It has a ready-made structure. People knew about it; people have visited it; people have gone and looked at it. It is not just dealing with young people in year 10 and it is not just dealing with educating people to year 12; it is picking up young people in year 9 and the beginning of year 10 who are in danger of falling out of the school system. It is giving those young people a taste of what the possibilities are and how to get on a path to a constructive career. In many instances when these young people have been picked up, they have gone back to school willingly to complete their year 10 maths because they know that year 10 maths is central to a valid career in a trade. There is virtually no trade in this country in which, if you do not understand year 10 maths, you will be able to effectively operate. That institution is performing that function.</para>
<para>Whoever designed this product—these technical colleges—knew nothing about what is inherent in a skilled tradesperson. They knew nothing of what is required to train a skilled tradesperson. The tragedy in this country has been that we have put the future of our future skilled work force essentially into the hands of the private sector. But what is the truth of training in this country? The reality is that a substantial proportion of all our skilled tradespeople have been trained in the public sector. Public utilities are where the bulk of our trade skills come from.</para>
<para>The private sector in this country has been notoriously poor at training. It is very poor at training, unlike its counterparts in the UK and elsewhere. It has been notoriously poor in this country primarily because it has been small. With the exception of a few companies like BHP, which trains substantial numbers of apprentices, the bulk of our apprentices came through the public sector, through public utilities. If you think that, because you put 24 of these institutions around the country, the private sector is suddenly going to start picking up young people and training them, you are going to be very disappointed.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">This is a very significant report that was tabled out of session and released in a quite extraordinary manner. There are two points that I would like to make before I begin thinking about the content of the report. First of all, there is the fact that the information was actually available during June 2004, so when it was released late on a Friday evening, on 30 September 2005, it had been delayed for 15 months. Also, the way in which it was released late on that Friday evening, with no fanfare and no media release, raises the question of why that might be so. I can certainly understand why that was so, because the report reveals some startling and embarrassing information for this government and for the minister.</para>
<para>I can tell you that the report shows that government funding to this sector has continued to decline and that students’ contributions, and therefore debts, have continued to rise. It shows that the accumulated HECS debts have risen from $3.9 billion in 1995-96 to $9.1 billion in 2002-03. In fact, this will rise to an estimated $13.2 billion in the year 2005-06 as a vast majority of the currently 409,505 HECS liable students attending university are forced to pay an additional 25 per cent, courtesy of the government and Minister Nelson.</para>
<para>The report shows that the universities have been forced to find an ever-increasing amount of their funding from overseas; $6.9 billion was sourced from overseas students studying in Australia, which I might add is significantly more than the $4.9 billion provided by the Commonwealth in 2003. This $4.9 billion in Commonwealth funding represents 41 per cent of total university funding, which is a drop from 57 per cent in 1996. The report also tells us that since 1996 fees and charges have risen from 13 per cent to 22 per cent and that the amount of funding obtained through HECS has risen from 12 per cent in 1996 to 16 per cent in 2003. It is very clear from the report that Minister Nelson’s push for a user pays system in higher education is biting hard.</para>
<para>In 2004, 29 universities attracted 13,959 undergraduate fee paying students. The proportion can now be increased from 25 to 35 per cent of the total number of places for domestic students in a course. This increase will see spiralling debts, with students paying upwards of $100,000 for an undergraduate degree. This level of indebtedness is likely to deter many from entering university, knowing that they are going to have a debt of some $100,000, which, as we know, is twice the deposit required to obtain a loan for an average home in Sydney, which is Australia’s most expensive property market. So people will be making some pretty tough decisions about whether they will pursue a university education or try to secure their future home.</para>
<para>The report highlights some disturbing trends in university attendance, with those in the most disadvantaged groups suffering the greatest declines. By looking at the report we can see that in 2004, for example, the number of Indigenous students across Australia declined from 8,988 to 8,895, with the number of commencing students contributing to most of the decline, with a drop of six per cent. The number of enrolments of rural students dropped from 17.6 per cent in 1996 to 17.1 per cent in 2004. The number of isolated students dropped from 1.9 per cent in 1996 to 1.2 per cent in 2004. The number of Australian students from non-English-speaking backgrounds dropped from 5.4 per cent in 1996 to 3.6 per cent last year.</para>
<para>It is clear in this report that the government is trying at every opportunity to shift the cost for a university education onto the students and the universities themselves and, in doing so, is putting the cost of higher education beyond an increasing number of Australian families at a time when this government is experiencing unprecedented budget surpluses. So the report is an indictment on the government’s higher education policy at a time when Australia has a skill shortage. I certainly guarantee that the Labor Party have noticed this government’s report and will continue to fight to remedy the damage outlined in a report such as this.</para>

<para>—I also wish to speak on the <inline font-style="italic">Higher Education Report 2004-05</inline> and certainly endorse some of the comments that Senator Stephens has just made. Senator Stephens and I—if she does not mind my saying so—were honoured to be guests at last night’s Prime Minister’s Prize for Science dinner. I do not think the irony was lost on any of the people there that we were celebrating, as indeed we should, Australian endeavours and achievements in science and science teaching. We were there in the presence of one of the Nobel Prize winners, Professor Marshall. Of course, the government was also taking great delight in the significant achievements, yet we are living in a country where the higher education system—that is, the institution arguably at the forefront of many of these endeavours, including the intellectual development and wellbeing of our young people, mature age students et cetera, but certainly the wellbeing for the future—is under attack like never before.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>When Senator Stephens says that there is some bad news in this report, you had better believe it. Anyone who looks at this report even fleetingly should be astounded by some of the statistics they see. When you go to the chapter in this report on the participation by equity groups, the news is bad, bad, bad and runs contrary to everything the government is saying about the impact of its higher education reforms, particularly on disadvantaged students or aspiring students.</para>
<para>You look at the students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, and the report says the number of students has remained relatively low in 2004—surprise, surprise—and the number of students from a non-English-speaking background has decreased since 1996. So you turn to students from rural and isolated areas. In 1996 rural students comprised 17.6 per cent of domestic students and isolated students were 1.9 per cent. In 2004 the proportion of domestic students from rural areas declined slightly to 17.1 per cent—again, a decline. Indigenous education? If anything is an indictment of the system it is that section of the report. It indicates what an indictment the policies are. In 2004 the number of Indigenous students across Australia declined by one per cent. We are talking about small declines, yes, but declines nonetheless.</para>
<para>We have seen 10 years of radical reform to the sector particularly in the last five years. We have seen an increase in the costs—that is, a user-pays system—for students in this country. Students pay among the highest fees in industrialised world for public university education. Yet look at these stats: do you think we have got it wrong? If you want to talk about the necessary ingredients for a positive, thriving, secure, sustainable intellectual system of higher education, as the government does—and so does the minister in the introductory remarks to this report, where he talks not only about the state of play but also of the fact that we need to continue to reflect on how Australia’s national interest can be best served by our higher education providers—then we have got to address some real issues. They include investing properly in the system for the long term—not just cost shifting, not just making students pay more, not just expecting business and industry to make token contributions, but actually being gutsy about public education as a priority for government.</para>
<para>But then you also have to remove the barriers: take away fees and charges and then ensure that the system is being supported. You do not take away props like universal student membership that might assist students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds or rural and remote areas or those people who may have kids and need child care. You get rid of voluntary so-called student unionism as a policy and what else do you do? You ensure that research and development is adequately funded. You ensure that universities do not have to rely on blackmail in order to get the funding that is deserved. You do not tie university workplace relations requirements to funding that they may get through the Commonwealth Grants Scheme, for example. There is a whole range of mechanisms that we could be employing to ensure that our higher education sector is vibrant for the future and that those people who have never really had a shot at the system—unlike some of our ministers who have at least one if not more degrees—are able to have a go. You do that through student income support and reduced fees and charges. And, overall, what do we need? We need indexation. We do not see indexation as a key part of this report. So, yes, this report is an indictment of the system. But I am not surprised because I am aware of the government’s ongoing attacks on the sector. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

</talker>
<para>—On the MPI earlier today I spoke of the failure of the Howard government to manage defence procurement. Now, in this adjournment discussion, I continue those remarks. One of the most common failings in defence procurement in recent times with some projects has been the cost-plus model. These were projects where there was no fixed price simply because the specifications had not been developed. Contractors, consultants and lawyers love this approach, as academic case studies show. In fact, as we know, the consultancy industry in Canberra is opportunistic, waiting to get a long straw into the defence budget via this model. At the end of the day they leave, purses full, with little accountability.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The example of the new personnel computer system, PMKeyS, is relevant here. The price there for the consultant was accepted at $1.22 million, but the eventual price delivered was something in the order of $15.76 million. This was simply due to the cost-plus, open-ended contract negotiated at the inception. Further, in the end, the project was less than half developed with long-term serious consequences. This in turn in part led to the ANAO qualification of the Defence annual accounts in 2003-04, with little likelihood of early removal.</para>
<para>The same criticism was made by the ANAO of the Orion aircraft upgrade. The ridiculous irony of this is that over the last decade we have been regaled by the current government about the need for greater emphasis on tendering and contracting processes. In a period of emphasis on outsourcing of hugely valuable services, especially in IT computer technology, this has been fundamental. Sadly, the Defence experience in procurement at least, is a poor example of that new found discipline. To hear that Defence might outsource more of its function is therefore of major concern. In itself outsourcing is not the objection; it is the way it is managed. In fact it could be the answer. But it is a catch 22. The concept relies on Defence getting it right the first time, and there is little cause for optimism on that score. It is daunting, however, no matter what the government does, to see the same mistakes on tendering and contracting outsourcing—that is for what we do see and that is probably only a small proportion of the total. Let me summarise the most recent cases which highlight these continuing problems. I have already mentioned the frigates contract. There are three new air warfare destroyers now to be built in Adelaide. In terms of capability, were these frigate upgrades necessary at all? It might at least make easier any decision to mothball a few more.</para>
<para>Second is the PMKeyS project to develop a new, single personnel system for all defence personnel, civilian and uniformed. Originally to cost $25 million, only half the planned functionality was built. Commencing in 1997, it was supposed to have been completed by June 2000. To date it has cost $131 million, with an unknown amount to be spent to complete it. The trouble is that it simply must be completed. As we know, defence records have been a mess for decades. We can no longer tolerate circumstances whereby individual entitlements cannot be properly determined due to missing or incomplete files. That is not to mention the continued failure to properly calculate the outstanding liability for leave accrued.</para>
<para>Third is the Orion upgrade project on which ANAO has just reported. ANAO found this project, budgeted at $962 million, overspent by $243 million. Again, the faults were the cost-plus basis of the contract and a failure to investigate and plan for the purchase of some aircraft from the United States. I will address this project in more detail at another time.</para>
<para>Next there is the armed personnel carriers, subject of ANAO’s report No. 3 of 2004-05. The first phase of this project was proposed in July 1992 at a cost of $39.9 million. The first delivery date was for 537 vehicles between 1996 and 1998. The balance were to be delivered in late 2000. Now the refit will be done to only 350, the cost has blown out to $550 million and not one vehicle has been delivered yet.</para>
<para>The next disaster was the Bushranger vehicle. Originally ADI was contracted to manufacture 341 of these vehicles at a cost of $183 million in 1995. In December 2001, a recommendation was made to the minister to terminate the contract. The government, in its wisdom, caved in and the contract was renegotiated for $218 million. Unit costs increased by 40 per cent and 4 years was added to the delivery time. The vehicle, now much lauded as another government smokescreen, has not been trialled in Australia but is in place in Iraq. That has to be a significant capability risk, produced simply by failed procurement process alone.</para>
<para>There are no doubt many other chapters yet to come in this saga. It is a sorry tale, and one for which the Howard government ought to be held accountable. We hear much about the brave new world of the DMO and the impact of the Kinnaird report recommendations. The proof of that pudding, of course, will be in the eating in due course. I would like to be optimistic, but the history to date is far too telling.</para>
<para>I do acknowledge that there are some projects which are well handled and come in at cost and on time. If we consider the findings of ANAO in its report No. 45 on the Management of Selected Defence Systems Program Offices, experience is patchy. Clearly some areas of the services are much better than others. Some personnel have obviously done outstanding work to conclude their procurement processes on time and at cost. We are told, for example, that the new Armidale class patrol boat is a fine example. We certainly hope that the new ships to be built will follow the example of the Anzac ships about to be completed at Williamstown by Tenix. Those experiences do augur well. However, the performance to date of some major projects has been extremely poor. For the taxpayer it is a question of how much more can be tolerated given that demand for funding elsewhere is growing. Waste is not to be tolerated any more. Governments and ministers must be accountable. Certainly in the Defence portfolio there is a long way to go.</para>
<para>By way of summary, overruns in expenditure in Defence are chronic and show no signs of improvement. The biggest cause of this is time delay due to a number of things including inadequate specification, poor costing, poor contracting processes, poor oversight and inadequate management. Contract details appear to be extraordinarily flexible with constant renegotiation over quantities, specifications and payments. Financial management practices are sometimes illegal, with advance payments and the use of trust funds which are not accounted for. Cost-plus contracts inevitably exceed estimates. Contracts too commonly result in reduction of quantities and specification in order to stay within budget or to limit overspend. Publicly available documentation is sparse and often contradictory. The bottom line is that the taxpayer is being constantly misled, as is the parliament. Worst of all is that the capability sought is not being provided.</para>

<para>—Since I arrived in this place I have to say how impressed I have been by the people that I have met here and how impressed I have been by the decency of everybody I have come across. I think it is very important for us, as at any level of leadership, to be very decently behaved and very respectful if we are going to be respected as the Upper House that controls this nation. Unfortunately, today I experienced something that made me realise that even in this place there are some very grubby moments. I speak, of course, of the duplicitous, deceitful and misleading behaviour of one of those opposite while taking notice of answers. I will quote Senator Crossin from today’s <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. Referring to me, she said:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">Senator Scullion, one of the boats in the harbour that your company looks after was known to have a dog on it in recent months ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">On the face of it, this is not something to leap out of bed about. However, as is well known in this place, the implication could well be—and as far as I am concerned, it is—that I had, and continue to have, some inappropriate, vested interest in this matter and in this company. The implication of that statement was that the company that looks after the boats for the Commonwealth agency was, in fact, mine. Of course, that statement also implies that I am currently in breach of section 44 of the Constitution and should not be in this place.</para>
<para>From my perspective, what is more concerning is the impact it could have on my wife and the families of those workers that work for her—some 42 people in the Northern Territory. My wife is one of the most amazing Australians. I suggest she is doing the normal thing tonight—putting three kids to bed, doing homework, running down to the harbour, jumping into a dinghy, roaring out into the harbour and climbing up the three metre side of a bucking vessel to go and help out doing whatever she does under the contract.</para>
<para>However, it is of great concern to me and it should be of concern to anybody associated with this place that, from my wife’s perspective, when people point the finger at me in here and say, ‘You’re inappropriately associated,’ it does not help her position in a very serious sense, because the implication is: Nigel is a part of the Commonwealth, so she will get some unfair dealing or something like that. Of course, all of us in this place know that it is quite the opposite, but that is the perception. It is the perception, certainly of my wife and her workers, that that has not helped them and that that is not in their interests. I have to say that neither I nor anybody else should tolerate what is effectively an attack on my wife’s future.</para>
<para>Normally I am a very reasonable bloke, and anybody in this place will say that that is the case. Perhaps it was a mistake. Maybe Senator Crossin did not mean to mislead parliament. Maybe it was just a mistake. So I rose—and I quote from today’s <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>—and said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The senator just said that there were boats in Darwin Harbour being looked after by my company. She knows full well that is not the case. I have absolutely no association with Barefoot Marine, and for three years in this place committees of this chamber discussed that and found unequivocally that that was not the case. I think she should withdraw that remark.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is as far as it should have gone. Senator Crossin should have stood and said, ‘I have made an error and I withdraw the remark,’ but there was none of that. There was not even an attempt to withdraw that remark, although there were calls from this side to be decent and to withdraw the remark. That often happens in this place—in the heat of the moment it is probably over the top and you move to correct the record. But no such attempt was made.</para>
<para>Perhaps it was that she did not know. I am a reasonable bloke, so I checked the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory News</inline>. It was an issue about whether I was to stay in this place. It hung over my head for three years. On 17 February, the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory News</inline>—maybe Senator Crossin does not read the <inline font-style="italic">NT News</inline>—said:</para>
<quote>
<para>Territory CLP Senator Nigel Scullion has been cleared of any wrongdoing over his family company receiving $1.3 million from a Federal Government agency.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is pretty clear. I am not sure how many other papers said that; I have not had time to do much research. The article went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para>He resigned as a director of the family company on February 25, 2002, and sold his shares to his wife three months later.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Anybody who was elected to this place at that time knows every little piece of that story. Mr Shaw, who is a QC, was asked on behalf of a committee of this parliament to look into this matter. The article went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para>Mr Shaw’s finding was conclusive.</para>
<para>He said: “In my opinion the facts and circumstances as disclosed to me do not show that Senator Scullion had any direct pecuniary interest in any agreement with the public service of the Commonwealth.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is pretty clear. But in case Senator Crossin does not read newspapers in the Northern Territory, watch television or listen to the radio, maybe she paid some attention to an issue in this place that I thought she was keeping a pretty good eye on. Certainly some of the comments were that she was keeping a pretty good eye on the issue. Perhaps she listened to Robert Ray, who said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The one thing we accept is that Senator Scullion acted in good faith in these matters. He did not attempt to exploit his position as a senator to maximise a contractual relationship with the government. Nor did he realise at the time he became a senator that this might be a problem. It was only later that he discovered that and, to his credit, he brought it immediately to the attention of this chamber.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This again goes beyond that, and I am making a couple of points here. The only other person to comment on this in this chamber was Senator Bartlett, who is in the chamber at the moment. Senator Bartlett said:</para>
<quote>
<para>Also, it should be noted that the approach Senator Scullion took to this issue, as far as I can see, was also fully above board and he should be commended for that. Perhaps there would have been a temptation to just quietly fix up his affairs and hope that nobody noticed—and perhaps they would not have; I do not know—but certainly he did handle it appropriately. He notified the chamber immediately he became aware of it, put all the facts there and let them fall where they may.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I do not quote those remarks because they are about me—they are about the decency of two people who are not necessarily well known for being nice and kind to those on the other side. When Senator Robert Ray and Senator Bartlett think people on this side need a bit of stick they give it to them, but this was a matter that they recognised was very sensitive, and it was very reasonable that they should behave in a decent, responsible and honourable manner—the sort of manner that would lead people to say, ‘That’s the sort of person I need representing me in parliament.’ Instead of the disingenuous, misleading and grubby way this was handled by Senator Crossin, there is an example from other people in the Labor Party and on the crossbenches of how it should be done. As a representative of Territorians, this senator is an absolute disgrace, and I hope that the Territorians bring it to her attention. It is never too late to correct the record. It is never too late to come to this place, stand up, behave decently and correct the record.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I should try and think of something to stick it to Senator Scullion about now just to balance it out, but I will focus on what I was going to talk about. The issue known as the stolen wages matter, which was raised in this chamber a number of times by my former Queensland Democrat colleague John Cherry, is one that I believe needs much further public debate and public and political pressure. In short, whilst an enormous amount of detail is now available, thanks particularly to the research of Dr Ros Kidd, the simple facts are that a large percentage of the wages, federal child endowment and related welfare payments that were made to Aboriginal people in Queensland over many decades was put aside into government run trust accounts and other accounts and only a fraction of it was ever paid to the individuals who were legally entitled to those wages and payments.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There is quite a lot of data now in the public arena that shows basically what was large-scale theft by the Queensland government of the wages and income support payments that Aboriginal people were clearly legally entitled to. To give the Queensland government a small degree of credit, it has in recent years endeavoured to address the issue by providing reparations. In 2002, the Indigenous Wages and Savings Reparations Project was established, which provides eligible claimants with a lump sum of $2,000 or $4,000 plus an apology in parliament. In order to receive that payment, individuals have to relinquish any legal rights they may have under the various so-called protection acts that were in place in Queensland between 1897 and 1984.</para>
<para>This is not just a matter of racial discrimination or unfair treatment of Indigenous people, although it certainly is that. It is an issue of basic wages justice and basic rights under workplace and industrial laws. At a time when the community is debating potentially very significant changes to industrial relations laws, it is important to note this very serious breach of basic workplace justice that still remains unresolved in Queensland. Whilst there has been a small reparation offered by the Queensland government, it is quite clear—the facts are on the public record—that it is far less than what many people would be legally entitled to. It also applies only to people who are still living; it does not apply to the descendants of people who were unlawfully not paid or prevented from accessing their wages and other entitlements.</para>
<para>It is estimated that up to 60 per cent of workers’ wages went into a general trust account, 10 per cent went into the Aboriginal Welfare Fund, and approximately 30 per cent was given to Indigenous people. This is an area where there is still clearly injustice that needs to be redressed, and the Queensland government—whilst it should be noted it has done something—has clearly not done enough. The Queensland Labor Party’s own policy adopted at their state conference specifically required full and proper reparation of all entitlements. To fail to do so and to simply buy people off, in effect, with less than they are entitled to, and to give them an apology only if they agree to sign away their future legal rights to anything else they may be entitled to, is showing pretty poor faith. In many respects, this issue is also about showing basic respect for what is a clear-cut case of injustice.</para>
<para>There are ongoing efforts by many people to try to get full justice for people who are entitled to reparations. There are related issues of large numbers of Indigenous people in Queensland who were underpaid consistently for many years and who were unlawfully underpaid from the time of the federal Racial Discrimination Act coming into force in 1975. There are many cases where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were paid significantly less than other people doing exactly the same job. Those are clear-cut cases of racial discrimination, as has been found by the courts. This is an area where there are still unresolved injustices.</para>
<para>It costs the state government money to make proper reparations to people, but clearly it is money that people are entitled to. It is not acceptable for Queenslanders to have money taken from them unlawfully—whether it is Aboriginal people or anybody else—by any government; and it is not acceptable for them to be unlawfully underpaid and then for future governments to say: ‘Sorry about that. That is the way things were back then, and it is a bit of a shame. We might give you a little bit of money to make ourselves feel better.’ We are talking about many thousands of Indigenous people. We are also almost certainly talking about very dodgy bookkeeping on the part of the government—which is fairly ironic, given that Indigenous organisations are often attacked for inadequate corporate governance.</para>
<para>Research that Dr Kidd has done in going into some of these files shows that there were regular warnings from auditors and regular warnings of fraud in the way that money was taken from Aboriginal people and basically put sideways into other people’s pockets. There were warnings that the so-called thumbprint system was corrupted and that there was a risk of widespread fraud and inappropriate use of power over people by having control of their money.</para>
<para>I should also say that this issue really only came to light because somebody started looking into it. If it had not been for concerted efforts to follow through and start digging out the truth, it may well have never been properly revealed. I think there is a growing case to be made for similar examinations in other states. There is already recognition in New South Wales that the previous so-called Aborigines Protection Board—which had power over the earnings, savings and entitlements of many Aboriginal people—had money placed in trust accounts, and it is suggested that there are many potential claimants who deserve to have their lawful entitlements paid back to them. There is some work being done on trying to work out the best scheme for that in New South Wales. An Aboriginal trust fund reparations scheme was established by the state government towards the end of last year, and we need to make sure that that is adequate.</para>
<para>There is initial evidence that the practice of withholding moneys in trusts and other separate accounts occurred in a reasonably widespread way in Victoria. There is certainly evidence in South Australia, where the controls were similar to those in New South Wales, that Aboriginal people who were apprenticed out to work had controls on their wages and savings regulated by government and there was evidence of widespread fraud by employers.</para>
<para>In Western Australia, initial research by a Western Australian academic, Anna Haeblich, shows that WA modelled its controls on Queensland legislation, and there are about 5,000 potential claimants alive today who may be entitled to receive moneys that they were always entitled to. Every state is different. In the Northern Territory, which for a long time came under direct federal control, the situation is different again. There is a growing argument that there needs to be an overall examination of the extent of this disgraceful injustice, which extends back over many decades, to try to get to the truth. I think that, in many ways, acknowledgement that injustice was done is more important than the money. There needs to be reparation where possible and there certainly needs to be a recognition of the extent of this clear-cut example of racial injustice and workplace injustice.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise tonight to talk about the culture of fear, intimidation and menace that currently exists in Tasmania as a means of maintaining the power of the forest industry in Tasmania, particularly by Gunns Ltd which, in fact, has become the de facto government of Tasmania and the puppet-master of the Labor Lennon government. Tonight I would like to talk specifically about the case of a young journalist, Wes Young, who was employed as a cadet journalist at the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> newspaper. He was employed there until such time as he tried to do his job. His job was to write for that newspaper in a column called ‘Around the region’.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This young journalist was trying to write stories about what was really going on in the Tamar region of Tasmania, in response to the announcement by Gunns that they would build a native forest based pulp mill at that particular place, wanting access to native forests for 30 years. Allegedly, in the first place, it is a chlorine-free pulp mill no longer. It is now to be elemental chlorine-free, which means that it will use chlorine dioxide with all the associated pollution problems. The problem for Wes occurred when he tried to write the stories of the region, including a story about the emergence of a group called the Tamar Residents Action Committee, which was formed to oppose the particular technology and the siting of the mill. It was made very clear that the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> was not going to run the story of the formation of that particular group.</para>
<para>He then tried to write another story. This time it was in response to West Tamar Deputy Mayor Peter Kearney telling him that there would be a motion tabled at the council meeting calling for an elector poll along the lines of, ‘Do you support the proponents of the proposed pulp mill’s decision to build it in the Tamar Valley?’ It was clear that the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> chief of staff did not want that story written, and so he indicated to Wes Young that he was not prepared to run the story unless he saw something in writing. When the something in writing turned up at the newspaper by way of a fax to confirm that the story was true, the story was run, but Wes Young was then hauled over the coals for having run the story. The fact is that it would have been impossible for a cadet journalist to write a story like that, off his own bat, to get it past the night editor and the subeditors and to get it into the paper if it had not been seen and approved by all those people in the hierarchy.</para>
<para>What is going on here is that the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> newspaper has a special relationship with Gunns and the state government. You only have to look at the relationships in Tasmania to see that. The former editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> now works in the Premier’s office. A former journalist from the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> is the public relations person for Gunns. You also have a longstanding history going back to 1989, when the chairman of the board of Gunns Kiln-Dried Timbers attempted to bribe a member of parliament to cross the floor, saying that the reason he did so was that, if the Labor-Green Accord came to power, it would affect his timber interests and the profits from those timber interests. The royal commission that followed found him guilty and he was imprisoned for that attempt to corrupt democracy in Tasmania.</para>
<para>The power of Gunns is as one of a de facto government. The journalist concerned was trying to do his job at the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline>. He was then offered a job with Rural Press at a neighbouring newspaper and he accepted that job because both the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> and this other newspaper are owned by Rural Press. It was, in effect, a transfer. He spoke to the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> about that transfer. In the meantime, the chief of staff then rang the other newspaper and spoke in a way that undermined the journalist, Wes Young, and the offer of the job was withdrawn as a result. When Wes went back to the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline>, saying that the opportunity for the job in the sister newspaper, if you like, had been withdrawn and therefore he withdrew the transfer, the chief of staff took the opportunity to say that he had not regarded it as a transfer, that in fact it had been a resignation, that he had accepted the resignation and that was the end of it. All of the journalists at the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> were horrified by this treatment and signed a petition to that effect to the management but to no avail, and the matter is now in the Industrial Commission in relation to unfair dismissal.</para>
<para>This is really about freedom of speech in Tasmania. It is about a community trying to have the facts and the news reported as news rather than as an advertorial for this particular company, Gunns. We have already seen with Gunns 20 how Gunns have taken to court people who have dared to promote what they are doing in Tasmania. In fact, an article in Saturday’s <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> said:</para>
<quote>
<para>Gunns supporters say the company is simply exercising its right, via the courts, to operate its business in peace. But for Brown—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is, Senator Brown—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">his co-defendants and supporters what is at issue is the right to speak freely on issues of public interest without the risk of being sued.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And, in the case of Wes Young, without the risk of losing your job because you are trying to do your job in a frank and fearless way. There are stories by other journalists at the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline>. One was about Les Rochester and another was an interview with John Gay. In that interview, John Gay admitted that the pulp mill has not going to be state of the art and so the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> did not run that story, but it was very keen to run very prominently an article written by Greg Barnes critical of Les Rochester, the spokesperson of TRAC.</para>
<para>What we can clearly see is that the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline>’s coverage of the pulp mill issue is biased—that is without doubt. One only has to look at the coverage to see that that is the case. There is example after example of the suppression of stories that are in any way critical and the promotion of stories that are in favour. <inline font-style="italic">Media Watch</inline> exposed the ludicrous situation earlier this year when the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> ran as news what was in fact partly taken straight from an advertising feature, presumably a fair bit of which was paid for by the state government.</para>
<para>The point of raising this here in the Senate tonight is to inform people around the country of just how serious the situation is in Tasmania. Richard Flanagan a while ago indicated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Lies, innuendo, smears, the threat of no more employment: all these devices are used and used to great effect to bring an oppressive silence back on this island.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is what is going on in Tasmania—it is an attempt to bring an oppressive silence back to our island. I stand here tonight to stand up for the people of Tasmania who are asking for freedom of speech, for the right to control their own destiny, for the community to be properly consulted and for a capacity for people to challenge the relationship between the state government, the big end of town and the newspapers that operate in Tasmania—in particular, the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> newspaper.</para>
<para>I make a plea for people to support young journalists such as Wes Young and take an interest in this matter because, whilst it is happening in Tasmania at the moment, Tasmania is a microcosm of the rest of the country. As we are seeing a rush to take away civil liberties and freedom of speech around the rest of the country with excessive laws, we might well think about what is going on in Tasmania and fear for the future unless people of good heart stand up for an open society in which debate is encouraged and where journalists can report without fear or favour and be supported for doing so by their editors and chiefs of staff instead of being dismissed in the appalling way that Wes Young was.</para>
<para>I think he should be reinstated. People should get behind him. Even the ABC was threatened with legal action because they dared to interview Wes Young and talk about his situation. It is disgraceful. The people of Tasmania need to really challenge this relationship between the state government and Gunns and the culture of fear and intimidation. It is time to get rid of both the puppet and the puppet master.</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>There are substantial taxation concessions for superannuation in order to promote self-provision for retirement and restrictions are placed on the early withdrawal of superannuation savings to ensure that they provide for genuine retirement income.</para>
<para>There are two criteria that an applicant must satisfy in order to be eligible for early release of superannuation benefits on severe financial hardship grounds. The applicant must be able to show that they have been in receipt of a qualifying Commonwealth income support payment for a continuous 26‑week period, and must also satisfy the trustee that they are unable to meet reasonable and immediate family living expenses.</para>
<para>Youth Allowance payments do not constitute a qualifying Commonwealth income support payment. Youth Allowance benefits (for students studying on a full-time basis) are designed to assist in meeting the costs of undertaking a course of study, and are not intended to provide full financial support to the recipient. In general, a Youth Allowance recipient’s income would be supplemented through family support, prior savings and part-time or casual employment. Moreover, recipients of Youth Allowance make a voluntary decision to pursue a course of study having regard to both the immediate and future financial consequences of doing so.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The Government does not consider that Youth Allowance payments should be included in the list of income support payments that would entitle the recipient to early access to their superannuation benefits. The existing early release mechanisms strike a balance between the need for superannuation benefits (which receive significant taxation concessions) to be preserved for retirement purposes against the need for access to be provided where superannuation fund members experience personal hardship.</para>

<para>—The Minister for Veterans’ Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>and (2) Pensions and other payments to widows, family members or other dependants of those who died in, or due to, the 1996 Black Hawk accident may be made under one or more of:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>the Defence Act 1903; or</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para>Under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, lump sum compensation may be paid to and for the benefit of persons who were dependent on the Australian Defence Force members who died in the Black Hawk accident. Lump sum benefits for children are paid into trust and are held until the child reaches the age of majority.</para>
<para>The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 also provides weekly compensation payments for the benefit of children. Weekly payments for children cease only when they reach the age of 16 years. However, if a child continues in full-time study, weekly payments can continue to be paid up to a maximum age of 25.</para>
<para>In 1998 an additional lump sum death benefit was provided under the Defence Act 1903 for a widow and for each child of a member who died due to service in the Australian Defence Force. These payments were available retrospectively and included the widows and children of those who died in the Black Hawk accident.</para>
<para>Under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986, compensation may be provided by way of a war widow’s pension and orphan’s pension. Entitlement to a war widow’s pension remains for the life of the widow. Orphan’s pension ceases only when the child reaches the age of 16 years. However, if a child continues in full-time study, the orphan’s pension can continue to be paid up to a maximum age of 25.</para>
<para>Compensation payments for which the Commonwealth is liable are secure, subject to legislative provisions that duplicate payments should not made by another Commonwealth benefit or by way of a compensation payment for which a third party is liable. </para>
<para>Hence, should a widow or dependant of an Australian Defence Force member, who died in the Black Hawk accident, obtain an award of damages from a third party, all compensation benefits paid under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, up to the amount of that award, would be recoverable by the Commonwealth. After such damages are awarded and benefits are recovered, no further benefits are payable under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988.</para>
<para>Payments made under the Defence Act 1903 are similarly recoverable to the extent that a third party is liable to pay compensation for the member’s death.</para>
<para>Under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986, a war widow’s pension and orphan’s pension will be limited (including a complete limitation), if damages or compensation in respect of the member’s death are made by a third party or a benefit is paid under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988.</para>
<para>An additional death benefit for a widow or orphan under the Defence Act 1903 does not affect benefits under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 or the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The review of payments to which the question refers was conducted immediately following the Black Hawk accident. On 11 June 1997, in response to concerns about the amount of compensation available, the Government announced the significant additional compensation payments that are made under the Defence Act 1903. These payments for severe injury or death of members in the course of their military duties recognises the special nature of the service rendered to Australia by members of the Australian Defence Force.</para>
<para>After extensive consultation with service organisations, the three Acts that provided compensation at the time of the Black Hawk accident have ceased to apply since 1 July 2004. For service on and from this date, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 provides a single compensation scheme which is specific to the Australian Defence Force and which further recognises the special nature of the service of its members.</para>
<para>The Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 provides a modern, military specific compensation scheme for service-related injury, disease or death comprising the best elements of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Defence Act.</para>

<para>The Conditions of Offer for Tender No. L2004/1274 for the ‘Provision of Weekly Air Services to Remote Areas of Australia’ stated that ‘the Department must be satisfied that Offerers have the experience, technical capacity, financial, management, quality system, and necessary infrastructure to meet the requirements of the Department. To assist in this regard, Offerers should ensure they address the evaluation criteria contained in the Tender Specification when preparing their response’.</para>

<item label="(b)">
<para>The following evaluation criteria were set out in the Tender Specification:</para>
<para>A. in relation to aviation safety regulatory considerations, meet the Commonwealth’s civil aviation safety requirements, as specified in or under the Civil Aviation Act 1988, the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988, the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998 and the Civil Aviation Orders, as these relate to the carriage by air of passengers and cargo.</para>
<para>The successful tenderer will be required to hold a Regular Public Transport (RPT) Air Operators Certificate (AOC), authorising operations into and out of all specified ports, or demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) and DOTARS, that they are capable of upgrading to an RPT AOC authorising those operations within a reasonable time-frame.</para>

</item>
<item>
<para>In preparing tenders, operators must demonstrate that they made sufficient inquiries to determine whether it will be possible to commence services to all communities in this Region at the one time, or whether some of the specified ports will be added progressively as necessary aerodrome works are completed and subject to CASA’s authorisation of operations into and out of those aerodromes. (Tender prices should reflect any progressive addition of these communities.)</para>

<para>Prospective operators should factor into their tender price costs associated with necessary aerodrome surveys, inspections, and reporting requirements of the kind for which the air service operator is properly responsible.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para>B. demonstrate that they will establish adequate aerodrome “positive” reporting systems with RASS communities [Note: in relation to the “positive” reporting system, it is envisaged that failure of communities to positively report on the safety of their aerodrome is to result in the air operator refusing to land if the aerodrome does not meet the required safety standard – these procedures will need to be included in any ‘approved’ system, whereby an operator is authorised to conduct air transport operations under an AOC into an aerodrome that does not satisfy the requirements specified in the regulations or the Orders].</para>
