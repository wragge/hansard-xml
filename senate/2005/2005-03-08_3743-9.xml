<para>—Yesterday I was talking about the differences between the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s powers and the Postal Industry Ombudsman’s powers proposed in the <inline ref="S431">Postal Industry Ombudsman Bill 2004 [2005]</inline>. I thought they were quite significant. The second reading speech for this bill says:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">In many respects, the PIO will be provided with similar powers to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. For example, the PIO will be able to require a person to provide information in writing or to attend before the PIO to answer questions. The PIO will also be required to provide procedural fairness to Australia Post, registered PPOs and their employees in the investigation of any actions they have taken.</para>
<para class="block">However, whereas the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s powers are tailored to the investigation of public sector administrative actions, the PIO’s powers will be customised for the investigation of service delivery complaints in relation to both Australia Post and private operators. Moreover, as the PIO will have jurisdiction over non-government entities which have voluntarily registered with the PIO, the PIO will not have certain powers that are considered unnecessary or which would act as a deterrent to PPOs registering with the scheme. For example, it was not considered appropriate to provide the PIO with the power to enter premises or to override a person’s claim to legal professional privilege.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Senator Conroy also referred to the fact that the PIO will not have the powers, which are currently provided to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, to order compensation.</para>
<para>These changes obviously concern me to some extent in that it is also made clear that, in respect of Australia Post, the PIO will be expected to deal with delivery of mail matters whilst the Commonwealth Ombudsman will continue to deal with the administration activities of Australia Post. This does concern me, but we will have to see how it develops in practice—whether this difference of powers will impact on how Australia Post is dealt with by the Ombudsman or the PIO in the future. That is something we will consider later.</para>
<para>What did concern me in that particular section and in the bill is the fact that the government has chosen to give the PIO fewer powers than the Commonwealth Ombudsman to encourage private sector providers to sign up to the PIO and its scheme. I really think that is unnecessary. I think it is an unfortunate approach that the government has adopted. Given that the delivery of post is such an important matter in terms of communications in Australia, the matter of voluntarism should never have come into play. The government said that the PIO would apply to the private sector as the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman applies to the private sector—that is, to everybody. Not only is this scheme voluntary for private sector providers but, as an incentive to get private sector providers to sign up to the scheme, the powers of the PIO vis-a-vis the Commonwealth Ombudsman have been reduced.</para>
<para>I certainly express the Democrats’ concern with that approach. I notice the ALP are moving amendments on this, and we will certainly support those when we get to the committee stage. There is no benefit to this bill vis-a-vis current arrangements if we do not get the private sector providers into the PIO scheme. The scheme has been made voluntary and has been pared back to encourage private sector providers to come. This scheme is not going to be working effectively unless we get the benefit of the private sector coming in.</para>
<para>I hope the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, will address in her concluding comments what measures the government has taken to get private sector providers to sign up to the PIO scheme, whether the minister is confident that the major private sector providers will be signing up to this scheme and, if it ends up being a voluntary scheme, what measures she intends engaging in to get the private sector providers to sign up to it. If they do not sign up, this bill will be of no benefit and we will have wasted the public’s time. The Democrats will not oppose this bill, because it is revenue neutral, but we certainly think it is important that the benefits of this scheme be promoted further to bring the private sector on board and, if need be, that the scheme be based on the telecommunications precedent that requires they join up rather than simply leaving it to be voluntary.</para>

<para>—I thank the senators who have contributed to the debate on the <inline ref="S431">Postal Industry Ombudsman Bill 2004 [2005]</inline>. The bill implements a government election commitment and will establish a dedicated Postal Industry Ombudsman within the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman and provide consumers with a recognisable, dedicated and independent entity to deal with complaints about the provision of postal services. The Postal Industry Ombudsman will have responsibility for investigating postal delivery services, including the receipt, processing and delivery of postal articles and the provision of courier services. The Postal Industry Ombudsman’s powers will complement the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s existing powers. The Commonwealth Ombudsman, for example, will retain existing powers to investigate actions by Australia Post that do not relate to the provision of postal services, such as employment matters.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Provisions in the bill will mean that most, if not all, service delivery complaints against Australia Post will be dealt with by the Postal Industry Ombudsman in a similar way to those against registered private postal operators. However, complaints against Australia Post can still be dealt with by the Commonwealth Ombudsman where it is more appropriate to do so.</para>
<para>I am heartened to hear senators in their contributions to this debate say that they support the establishment of a postal industry ombudsman. The legislation has been drafted after an extensive process and with historical evidence following consultation with the state and territory offices of fair trading. I have to say that there have only ever been 37 recorded complaints about the delivery of postal services by postal service providers other than Australia Post. I think that that really puts it in perspective.</para>
<para>It is disappointing to see that there are foreshadowed amendments proposing to take what is an almost non-existent problem and create a compliance burden by requiring everyone to participate in the scheme. The opposition have foreshadowed an amendment that in my view is unnecessary for this bill.</para>
<para>In developing the scheme, it is important to balance the rights of consumers—of course, that is always a critical factor—with the level of complaints. We always have to look at the cost and complexity of implementing the scheme for business and, indeed, for government. After an exhaustive consultation process, we do believe—and I must say that I personally believe—that the provisions in the legislation strike the appropriate balance.</para>
<para>During the course of the debate—although unfortunately I was not able to listen to all of it—there was a comparison of the volume of complaints in the postal industry with that of the telecommunications industry, which is entirely a gross exaggeration. To give an example: in 2003-04 the TIO—that is, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman—handled 75,904 complaints, of which it investigated 59,850. The TIO has an annual budget in excess of $6.5 million and has over 1,000 members. In very stark contrast, the Commonwealth Ombudsman handles only 900 to 1,000 complaints every year for Australia Post. As I said earlier, the state and territory offices of fair trading have advised that there have been only 37 recorded complaints about the delivery of postal services by postal service providers other than Australia Post. Quite simply, the reality is that this industry receives an entirely different level and nature of complaints compared to the telecommunications industry.</para>
<para>I can only suspect that homework has not been done on this issue and that serious thought has not been given to what a waste of resources it would be to impose the expensive TIO model on the entire postal industry. Rather, establishing the PIO as a dedicated office within the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s office will ensure that the correct balance is achieved between the protection of the rights of consumers and the cost and complexity of administering the scheme. It will offer many of the same benefits as the TIO but with a lower cost and the advantage of using existing expertise in the field.</para>
<para>In summary, the government believes that this bill, as it is currently being considered, will be beneficial for Australian consumers, small business and private postal operators. It will provide consumers and all postal operators, including Australia Post, with an avenue to more effectively resolve service disputes and difficulties. I commend the bill.</para>

<para>—I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 4446:</para>
</talk.start>
<amendments>
<amendment>
<para class="ParlAmend">(1)    Schedule 1, item 11, page 19 (after line 31), after subsection 19ZA(2), insert:</para>
<para class="subsection">      (2A)    Notwithstanding subsection (2), where a PPO meets the conditions specified in this section, it must apply in writing to the Postal Industry Ombudsman to be registered for the purposes of this Part where:</para>
<para class="indenta">              (a)    the PPO comprises 20 or more employees; and</para>
<para class="indenta">              (b)    the PPO annual financial turnover threshold is greater than $1,000,000.</para>
</amendment>
</amendments>
<para class="block">This is a straightforward amendment. As I indicated in my remarks during the second reading debate, this amendment seeks to expand the jurisdiction of the Postal Industry Ombudsman by requiring significant private postal operators to join the scheme. This contrasts with the government’s approach to the bill, which says that private operators can choose to opt in to the scheme. The amendment inserts a new subsection into section 19ZA of the bill to require private postal operators to register with the PIO if they have more than 20 employees and an annual turnover that exceeds $1 million. This should capture major private operators like DHL and UPS and improve the level of consumer protection offered by the scheme. Mandatory registration should not be a major financial impost for these large private postal operators.</para>
<para>As was noted during the second reading debate, the costs of running the PIO are recovered from postal companies based on the number of complaints that the PIO receives relating to that company. Companies with high service standards are unlikely to have to make major contributions to the PIO. The government has argued that operators who do not join the scheme will still be regulated by state offices of fair trading. Where is John Howard’s centralism when you need it, Senator Cherry!</para>
<para>Labor does not believe that this is a satisfactory justification for limiting the scope of the PIO scheme. The growing significance of the major private postal operators means that users of their services should also be entitled to call on the services of the dedicated Postal Industry Ombudsman. A PIO with a broader jurisdiction also has the potential to raise standards across the entire industry. In addition, Labor believes that it is appropriate that Australia Post’s major competitors are also subject to the scrutiny of the PIO, so I commend this amendment to the chamber.</para>
<para>I again make the point that this is simply about trying to hold the government to its own promise, made in the year 2001. Richard Alston promised to deliver a robust PIO, similar to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. This government, after three years, is trying to crawl away quietly from this commitment. This is a small and simple amendment, which is the minimum needed to make this a reasonable scheme. I urge senators to support this amendment and I even call on Senator Coonan to accept this as a reasonable proposition. Let us move forward and hope this new jurisdiction works successfully on behalf of consumers.</para>

<para>—The Democrats will be supporting the ALP amendment. I note in particular that, because it excludes smaller organisations, the amendment will apply to only the larger organisations, as Senator Conroy pointed out. I note in particular that, according to Ibis World, the courier industry is dominated by small businesses, with nearly 75 per cent of management unit locations employing fewer than 10 people. So we are carving out a very large chunk of the industry. I would hope—in fact, I would expect—that this amendment would make no difference to the government because, as I said in my speech in the second reading debate—which I hope the minister addresses—I would presume that the minister already has the larger companies signed up. I would be disappointed if we were setting up a PIO without having the larger companies already signed up. I do not think this amendment would create compliance problems because I would be very disappointed if these organisations had not already agreed to signed up. They should agree to sign up and, that being the case, it is far better to have them all in rather than all out; otherwise, frankly, there is no benefit in this bill.</para>

<para>—I will be very brief in responding to the amendment moved by Labor and supported by the Democrats. The government will not be accepting the amendment. The opposition has moved an amendment which, if adopted, would result in membership of the Postal Industry Ombudsman scheme being mandatory for what might be described as ‘large private postal operators’, yet we have evidence that there has been only something like 37 complaints. It seems a very disproportionate reaction to then require everybody over a certain threshold to be subject to the scheme. That brings me to the point that I have not heard very clearly articulated from the opposition in bringing forward this amendment: why the threshold that is being advocated for private postal operator membership is there. It seems to me to be entirely unsubstantiated. It is certainly an arbitrary threshold and it is unclear just how many operators would be affected. It seems to be, from the point of view of both the Democrats and Labor, ‘big’ as opposed to ‘little’, but it usually has to be a bit more precise than that when you are developing policy. There is no indication of what will happen to operators who do not comply; no thought appears to have been given to the mechanism for prosecuting who would be captured under the amendment; and there does not appear to be any evidence, at least not that I have been able to see, to suggest that there is a greater incidence of complaints against private postal operators comprising 20 or more employees and with an annual turnover of greater than $1 million—that is, the threshold—than any other service provider. It is a clear example of trying to score a point—policy on the run, without any clear policy rationale.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government believes that the opt-in provisions of the scheme will be attractive to a large number of private postal operators who can use it, obviously if they wish, as some distinguishing marketing aspect of their business. Indeed, it may be a marketing advantage to postal service providers over their competitors. Registering with the scheme may be attractive to all operators as they could present it as a benefit to customers using their services, and it has the advantage that the PIO would also serve as the final arbiter for the resolution of difficult disputes, which obviously would be of benefit to both the postal service providers and their consumers.</para>
<para>Once again, for the policy reasons that I have advanced, we think it is not appropriate to load up businesses with yet more obligations when there is a disproportionate policy need to respond to. As I have previously indicated, there were 37 complaints and that does not warrant the disproportionate burden of requiring all operators over a certain threshold to join it. For those reasons the government will not be supporting the amendment. My view is that, even on reflection and even if we can find out the answers to these questions, there would need to be much more policy work to look at the proposed threshold than is possible with an amendment brought forward at the last minute and, I suspect, for dubious reasons.</para>

<para>—Senator Cherry, I am very disappointed but not surprised to hear that once again the government has caved in to its large business mates and that it is interested in self-regulation. The fact that anyone who had a complaint with these organisations had nowhere to go seems to be a sufficient reason to say, ‘Well, there were almost no complaints.’ How circular an argument can you get? But, as usual, this government has the soft touch—the light touch approach to regulation. That is what we are seeing again today. I hope that the government, if this amendment passes—and there seems to be a fair chance that it will pass today—will take it away and just think about it. It will not be an impost. If complaints are as few as you say, Senator Coonan, there will be virtually no change to the way it operates. I urge you to reconsider and urge all senators to support this amendment.</para>

</talker>
<para>—The <inline ref="R2235">Navigation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> is a minor regulatory bill which makes some technical adjustments to the Navigation Act as it affects the safety of ships at sea. The first two amendments in the bill simply remove an inconsistency within the current law. The bill also removes the uncertainty caused by a lower court decision as to whether offences under the act are indictable or summary. To that extent the bill is not controversial.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Another amendment relates to penalties. Essentially, it will bring penalties in the Navigation Act into line with those set out in the Crimes Act. Instead of specifying financial penalties and jail terms specifically, the formula approach will be adopted. For example, the Crimes Act provides that, if an offence is expressed to be subject to a penalty, no fine is specified. Instead, the maximum fine will be five penalty units multiplied by the maximum prison term in months. In essence, the application of this formula will help to standardise the Navigation Act, although it will effectively increase the penalties as well. This is a practical issue, and we on this side of the chamber support the changes.</para>
<para>There is, however, a matter referred to in the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest.</inline> It concerns the relationship between the principal legislation and the setting of penalties in regulations. The point is well made, and it goes to consistency of approach. As this bill seeks to make all offences under the bill indictable offences, the offences and penalties set out in the regulations ought to be contained in the principal act, not in the regulations, and attention is drawn to this anomaly. The suggestion is that the bill should have provided an opportunity to bring about that consistency. The minister might care to address the reasons for that in his or her response in closing the second reading debate.</para>
<para>It is also opportune today to address some matters on shipping policy. As Australians, we ought to be embarrassed about our either disappearing or disappeared shipping industry. After all, we are almost totally dependent on shipping for our export trade, and perhaps a few facts should be outlined in order to set the context of my remarks. Of the world seaborne trade of 6,000 million gross tonnes, trade to and from Australia comprises almost nine per cent—quite a significant figure. The Australian industry’s part of that nine per cent is only 1.4 per cent—in other words, about 85 per cent of our shipping costs are paid to overseas operators. The cost to Australia, in those same net terms, is over $3.6 billion per year, and growing—almost 14 per cent of the current account deficit. As we all know, the current account deficit is at an all-time high, and is most likely to keep growing. The trend for Australian participation is downwards, with increasing foreign dominance and increasing losses of foreign exchange.</para>
<para>The story is almost the same with insurance. Very little insurance underwriting is done by Australians. It almost seems that we have a fatalistic attitude that these are not native industries for ourselves. The question is exactly the same as in any other industry—essentially in our secondary and tertiary industries. It is interesting, of course, to ponder that riddle, particularly in light of more recent discussion as changes in the economy, the net foreign debt and the current account deficit become more central to our future.</para>
<para>In economic terms, transport cost is invisible—and one makes the obvious point in passing that for this government that is a most appropriate description. In addition to what might be called a cringe mentality, in Australia we have always suffered the dead hand of conservative forces in this area of creation and maintenance of emerging industries. It is a matter of great regret that these forces are strongest in government in the area of primary industry, which has always been dominated by the National Party. It is no accident that for many years the transport portfolio has been captive to the National Party, with few exceptions. Nor is it an accident that trade and industry portfolios have again been dominated in this context over time by the National Party.</para>
<para>Given the huge power of that single vested interest, it is little wonder that trade, industry and transport policy in this country is so skewed. Look at transport policy: whether it be road funding, rail investment or shipping—both international and coastal—the purpose is the same. It is the user who is the sole beneficiary, not the industry providing the services or consumers who pay the costs at the retail end. There is not the slightest interest in transport industries per se; they are simply a crude cost. And if they are only a crude cost, the obvious solution is to reduce the crude cost to the lowest possible point. Yet we see that the cost of this policy direction to our economy in net terms is absolutely enormous.</para>
<para>We therefore have a glaring double standard in that we choose which industries we as a nation support, and that support, obviously, and in another context properly, is determined by those who are elected to government and those who are in power. In terms of consequences it means that effectively we do not have a real transport policy in this country. What we do have is a piecemeal of road funding and, belatedly, early signs of a regenerating rail industry. But the gaps between the two continue to be enormous. We still have massive bottlenecks at our ports, for example. It is not a new problem caused by the huge demand for coal or iron ore, which has been the subject of media reporting over the last three or four months. No amount of buck-passing back to the states can excuse the losses to the Commonwealth and, by definition, to all of us when the losses are national and apply across the board to every citizen living in this country. Getting a container released through Customs is as slow as it has ever been, largely due to the processes put in train by Customs. Of course, Customs is a Commonwealth government agency.</para>
<para>Other Western nations have built new container ports outside metropolitan areas. In Australia, where nearly all mainland cities are growing areas, the main container ports are landlocked by suburbia. The crisis with the bulk loading facilities has now, apparently, caught everybody by surprise—but there should not be surprise. We simply do not have a comprehensive national transport policy. The current government’s response is glib. They say, ‘Gee, yes, we do have a problem, but congestion at our ports is a state problem,’ and they give the state governments a flick in passing. But out on the Pacific Ocean there are hundreds and hundreds of ships sitting at sea awaiting a berth, paying tens of thousands of dollars demurrage every day, and the government say it is not their fault. If it were wheat or meat it would not happen. They are not new problems. They are endemic in Australia simply because of the totally self-interested producer basis upon which transport policy is formed, maintained and implemented. That is the way it has always been. So it is no surprise to anyone that the shipping industry currently is in such a parlous state.</para>
<para>There are some others who are accountable for these appalling circumstances. Here I refer to some of those more influential economists whose thesis has long been based on the theory of natural advantage or natural comparative advantage: you concentrate on what you are best at and you do not allocate funds or resources to develop alternatives over time. Therefore we grow more meat and wheat and we dig more iron and coal—we do whatever comes not necessarily easily but whatever comes naturally. By that attitude, when international shipping is so cheap, we are silly not to take advantage of it, the argument goes. It does not matter if it is a floating hulk of unknown ownership with a crew of virtual slaves travelling up and down our major coasts.</para>
<para>So the theory of natural advantage is very convenient. If it were applied to any other industries we would have very few at all in this country. It also assumes that shipping will always be cheap but, as we are now seeing, that cycle has shifted. Freight rates have gone through the roof and even more export dollars are being lost through the added costs of shipping. Exporters are suddenly complaining as their added transport costs have spoilt their competitiveness. Market forces are wonderful when they run so strongly in your favour, but it is a great excuse not to have a policy. But now, of course, the consequence of the inaction of the last 10 years is that we are at the total mercy of overseas providers, hence the question of why we have no shipping industry of our own.</para>
<para>We in the Labor Party believe that we should have an indigenous shipping industry. We cannot see why shipping should be different from any other industry. But it does need a policy and it does need a fair degree of leadership, and we suggest that they have both been absent over the last 10 years under the current government. Indeed it is ironic that this bill is about some minor regulatory policy on ship safety, and yet one of the big issues is the safety of much of the international fleet which is used to transport Australia’s trade. The government’s policy means that our coastline is increasingly being serviced by tramps from around the world.</para>
<para>The single-voyage permit system, as it is now administered, is about dumping services against the interests of local industry. It is no wonder then that, since this natural advantage or comparative advantage argument has taken hold, our coastal shipping trade has been decimated to the point where it is virtually non-existent and, if one were a realist, almost impossible or impossible to revive. The scheme of single-voyage and continuous-voyage permits has seen a reduction from 40 per cent to 25 per cent in the number of Australian flag ships plying our coastline. Of course, all the dollars involved in that have gone overseas. And so the story goes on and there is no end in sight.</para>
<para>There are few countries in the world where cabotage is not fiercely protected, and that includes that great bastion of free trade, the United States. That is why we believe that we too should have a competitive shipping industry. Many will know that coastal shipping around Australia carries 30 per cent of the non-urban freight task. Why is that the case? It is because, in the final analysis, it is more efficient than both rail and road. For example, the supply of petroleum products to North Queensland is managed by two ships. For road transport, that is the equivalent of 30,000 B double trips per year. So what can we do to get some policies in place to encourage the growth of our local industries?</para>
<para>Firstly, and obviously, we need to get The Nationals out of the control room or out of their dominance of industry, trade and transport related portfolios. While ever they run those central portfolios we cannot expect a rational or efficient approach in the genuine national interest. Secondly, we need some changes to attitudes whereby some equivalence is given to the regulatory and financial environment in which an Australian industry can grow, and grow successfully over time. In doing that we need to recognise the reform already implemented in the 1980s by the then Labor government in shaking out a lot of the undesirable featherbedding that was occurring. Given access to modern technology, there is no reason for Australian crews not to be competitive with shipping from other Western countries. But it must be said that there does need to be a level playing field.</para>
<para>As we know, the government continues to stall in its response to the Independent Review of Australian Shipping, which was commissioned by the Australian shipping industry in 2002—over three years ago. That report was presented to government in September 2003, and since that time there has been no comment—only a stony silence—from the government. Clearly, for the reasons I have set out, it is fair to say that there is not the slightest interest. The conclusions of that independent shipping review are quite instructive and worthy of serious consideration.</para>
<para>The review observed that international shipping is obviously a global market in which Australian operators are encumbered by constraints not faced by competitors. Those constraints were described variously as: the inability to choose a ship register of their choice because of the provisions of the Shipping Registration Act; the inability to recruit and retain Australian officers at internationally competitive terms, due to the operation of the tax act; and an in-built prejudice or bias against an indigenous Australian shipping industry. In simple terms, the remedies recommended were the removal of these constraints but stopping short of any policy requiring government grants or subsidies. For coastal shipping, the review found that domestic operators were at a regulatory disadvantage to overseas operators using the single- and continuous-voyage permit system.</para>
<para>The key element though is that foreign operators are not burdened by the Australian tax system, employment conditions or employee costs. That is, shipping services are effectively being dumped in circumstances that would not be tolerated in any other domestic industry. However, I say again that that should not surprise anyone because none of these reforms, none of these changes and none of this desire to create an indigenous shipping industry is in the least bit palatable to the government. To them, any Australian shipping industry is a threat and, therefore, all other policy is subjugated to that prime need.</para>
<para>One asks the obvious question: what future is there for shipping? It seems to us that the simple answer is that, while ever we have The Nationals in control of these key policy areas—transport, industry and trade—there is little hope. Other industries, like the manufacturing of agricultural chemicals, fertilisers or any other primary industry need, also face that same attitude. That is why the debate on a free trade agreement with major countries such as China all of a sudden becomes so interesting and fascinating—because, again, guess who is in control of policy? The debate that will come with the free trade agreement with China and the current debate that we are having on shipping policy are indeed sad ones—firstly, because it is so vital for our country that we do something other than bend before the self-interested sectional interests that dominate these areas of policy; and, secondly, because we need to grow and get past attitudes, which may have had some strength or relevance one hundred years ago, whereby we deny ourselves opportunities into the future. It is simply time for change and it is time for the development across-the-board of some serious transport policies that are truly nationally focused and nationally orientated and that give national outcomes as opposed to narrow sectional or purely producer outcomes.</para>
<para>We must say that at this stage there is a serious vacuum, and you would be very generous indeed to suggest that there is any sign at all that change will occur over the next two or three years. The obvious forecast—although not the hope—is that our shipping industry will be allowed to wither and we will continue to pay increasing amounts in both real and normative terms to foreigners to ship out the goods we produce. Unfortunately, that is the bottom line in this debate.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2235">Navigation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> makes a few minor amendments to the Navigation Act to clarify certain legal points and remove certain anomalies. Schedule 1 of the bill clarifies that certain offences under the regulations shall be indictable offences. This follows a ruling by the Victorian County Court that offences relating to the failure to display lights on a ship in order to avoid a collision should be treated as summary offences. The bill removes references to nautical assessors, which became redundant some 15 years ago. Nautical assessors, as I understand it, were once appointed to advise a court in matters dealing with offences against regulations. The bill also brings penalties into line with the <inline font-style="italic">Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences, Civil Penalties and Enforcement Powers</inline>. Section 258 of the Navigation Act sets penalties of up to $10,000 or two years in prison for offences relating to collisions, lighting and signals. However, the details are left to regulations. Under the <inline font-style="italic">Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences, Civil Penalties and Enforcement Powers</inline>, serious offences punishable by penalties such as these should be contained in the parent act to enable the parliament to scrutinise the laws being made.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The large numbers of laws made through regulation and disallowable instruments no doubt mean that some will go unnoticed, except perhaps by a few who may or may not have any knowledge in the specific area of law being dealt with. Often we wonder whether that suits government and we wonder whether the government leaves the detail to regulations because it wants that detail to go unnoticed. Our view is that detail should be scrutinised by stakeholders and the parliament wherever possible. As this bill deals with section 258, it would have been a perfect opportunity to tidy up this anomaly, together with some of the other anomalies that might also have been dealt with. We urge the government to do the necessary work—to find those sections where regulations should be brought into the parent act and to take the action required to make that happen. The Democrats will support this bill unamended.</para>

<para>—I thank both Senator Bishop and Senator Allison for their contributions. I think Senator Bishop’s contribution ranged a long way wide of the very sensible amendments in the <inline ref="R2235">Navigation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> which, from the short briefing I have had in relation to this, seem to seek to address issues raised particularly by the Victorian County Court decision of November 2003 and some related matters. But I cannot let my summing up go by without addressing the issues of transport planning in Australia that were raised by Senator Bishop. Having worked alongside the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and leader of The Nationals, John Anderson, in the development of the AusLink policy that was announced last year, when I was still in that portfolio, I would say that I only agree with Senator Bishop to a certain extent. The efficiency of the Australian economy and the efficiency with which we can deliver goods to our ports and then goods to the rest of the world, be they bulk goods or manufactures, comes down to having an integrated transport plan.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In fact, under the leadership of John Anderson, AusLink was the first serious attempt at creating a national transport plan that seeks to increase the efficiency of Australia’s transport system. It not only created a very comprehensive and sensible policy framework that sought significant new investments in rail and road infrastructure to make it as efficient as possible, but it also saw a significant increase in the Commonwealth’s investment in that infrastructure and took investment in road and rail on to a new five-year framework, recognising the fact that investments in major infrastructure are not things that naturally fit into a three- or four-year budget cycle. AusLink, for the first time, has put transport planning into a far more sensible and coherent structure but has also put it on a long-term and substantive funding structure. As I recall, the increase in funding for both rail and road projects was in the order of $12 billion over that period.</para>
<para>What you find—and I follow this debate closely because I regard Australia getting more goods out to the market as absolutely pivotal to addressing the current account deficit—is that the people of the world want to buy Australian goods, but a lot of these artificial barriers and constraints on the economy were created by a lack of good integrated transport policy planning in the past. You only need to look in Senator Mark Bishop’s home state of Western Australia and see the transport chaos that is being wreaked on that state by his comrade the minister for transport in Western Australia, Ms Alannah McTiernan, to see just how culpable that state government is. It is indicative of state governments around the country. I am sure you, Mr Acting Deputy President Brandis, as a Queenslander, and Senator Boswell, who is in the chamber, would know the sort of chaos that the Queensland government has put in place, with its lack of long-term planning around the south-east Queensland region and the lack of a plan that allows for the massive growth that is taking place around south-east Queensland and the greater Brisbane area and can see what that is doing to Queensland.</para>
<para>In Western Australia successive federal and state governments have funded a major link between the industrial areas out to the east of the airport and the port, linking the hinterland of Western Australia to the port of Fremantle through a major construction work known as the Roe Highway and the Fremantle Eastern Bypass, to effectively get large trucks out of suburban Fremantle. This project was funded by both political parties at the Commonwealth level, and it has been supported by previous administrations at the state level. It has been a bipartisan plan to build this long-needed link in Western Australia, and it really is emblematic of the problem we have with transport planning in Australia.</para>
<para>Previous state and federal governments put hundreds of millions of dollars into building this long link—some tens of kilometres linking Fremantle with the eastern hinterland—and getting it designed to make sure trucks can get into the port quickly and efficiently. From memory, if the Roe Highway project is completed—and it certainly will not be completed in the next four years, because the state Labor government has halted it—it would get rid of 24 sets of traffic lights for a truck moving from Midland and the east down to Fremantle. Any environmentally minded person would recognise that having a truck starting and stopping 24 times with a full load while heading to a port is an environmental disaster in terms of both greenhouse gas emissions and all of the other pollutants that get emitted every a time a truck puts its brakes on and has to go through a dozen gears to get back to normal speed. That is a disaster. What Western Australia has done after successive governments—</para>

<para>—It transcends the politics of an election, it really does. It is something that transcends this debate because it applies right across Australia. One day, when Senator McLucas is an ageing minister in a future Labor government, she will have to contend with this as well. Ultimately, if we do not get that conjunction of federal and state long-term planning right, then Australia will be held back, Queenslanders and Western Australians will be held back and all those other less important people in the rest of the states will also be held back. It is very important we get this right.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I use the example of this particular road in Western Australia because it is very clear in my mind and because it is emblematic of a problem that is replicated from Ipswich to Brisbane and in many areas of south-east Queensland. This road—the Commonwealth and state funded Roe Highway—has gone through stages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, and it is creeping towards Fremantle. It is a magnificent piece of road infrastructure which really would transform the efficiency of that port and create great outcomes for the Australian economy, but for very short-sighted political reasons the state government decided to stop the road as it got to a key marginal seat.</para>
<para>Those of you who have seen <inline font-style="italic">The Truman Show</inline>, starring that magnificent comedian and actor Jim Carrey—and those of you who have not seen it, please go and see it—will remember Jim Carrey sitting with his mate on the edge of a beautiful piece of road throwing cans off the end of it. I always think of Roe Highway stage 7 as similar to that situation in <inline font-style="italic">The Truman Show</inline>. You have this road that just stops. If some sensible state government does not complete the link, future generations will always wonder why they have this magnificent road that just stops. To understand, they will have to look back at the politics of Western Australia of the last three or four years and the one marginal seat that got in the way of this great piece of infrastructure.</para>
<para>That is a reality around the country—we are going to have short-term political considerations. AusLink, I have to say, is the best opportunity we have to get past them. I tell Senator Bishop that I watched very closely when the previous opposition spokesman on transport, Martin Ferguson, was chasing me around the country when I was roads minister. He was promising whatever I promised and then adding 10 per cent to it. He kept on promising a national land transport plan and I was genuinely looking forward to it. In fact, I had a bit of trepidation because I thought that Martin Ferguson might actually come up with a land transport policy. We had put our heart and soul into AusLink. We had put a hell of a lot of money into it. Yet all that Mr Ferguson seemed to do was to follow me around. Wherever I promised to spend a bit of money on the Calder or the Ipswich Motorway, he would always come along to the same seat and promise to spend 10 per cent to 15 per cent more. He kept on promising a national land transport plan but it never came out during the election. I kept on asking the people in our campaign headquarters whether Martin Ferguson had released his policy yet, and the answer was always no. Nothing ever came out. It was just a mishmash of bandaids and electoral promises depending on which marginal seat he was visiting.</para>
<para>So it is slightly hypocritical of Senator Bishop to be talking about the lack of an integrated transport policy. The reality is that, under the leadership of John Anderson and this government, with AusLink we now have a substantial transport plan. It is not just about building more roads. It is about massively investing in rail infrastructure, catching up on massive underinvestments in both road and rail in past years and investing billions of dollars in links around our ports—and that will benefit shipping by improving the efficiency of shipping in and out of and around Australia.</para>
<para>The other thing AusLink does, as I said, is massively increase investment at the Commonwealth level. One of the simple things the states could do, rather than having a spat about who spends what on infrastructure, is simply agree in the next round of budgets to match the funding increases that the Commonwealth have put in through AusLink. That would be a good compact. I make that challenge today in the context of this speech in the second reading debate on the navigation bill: why don’t the states simply match the funding increases that the Commonwealth are putting into road and rail infrastructure through AusLink in the next five years? That would see a massive increase.</para>
<para>In Queensland, for example, we have increased funding by, from memory, 61 per cent. In Western Australia, we have increased funding by about 76 per cent. In Victoria, from memory, there has been just over a 100 per cent increase in road and rail spending by the Commonwealth. Quite frankly, if the states simply matched those AusLink increases, signed up to AusLink, stopped all their squabbling about the construction code and got some of this money onto the ground as quickly as possible then many of the constraints that are referred to in newspaper articles about the current account deficit could be abolished very quickly. To that extent, Senator Bishop, by raising the debate today, has done the country a service. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2217">National Health Amendment (Prostheses) Bill 2005</inline> amends the National Health Act 1953 to allow the minister to determine prostheses that are going to be covered by health funds with no gap payable and prostheses which are to be covered by health funds but for which a gap will be payable by the health fund contributor, and to determine the minimum and maximum benefit amount listed for each gap permitted prostheses. In making these determinations, the minister may take into account advice from experts in the area of prostheses and in the health insurance industry.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This bill requires that health funds must provide no gap cover for at least one prostheses in relation to every in-hospital procedure for which a Medicare benefit is payable. The stated aim of the bill is to enhance the value of private health insurance and increase choice for consumers—and I will say more about the stated aim at a later point. The estimated savings from this measure are $4.3 million in 2005-06 and $20.6 million in 2006-07, based on an implementation date of 1 April 2005. It is interesting to note that the earlier bill that was introduced prior to the last election proposed savings of $61.9 million over four years based on the same implementation date, 1 April 2005. That being said, this measure originally featured in the 2003-04 budget, which identified savings of up to $49.6 million, with an implementation of 1 July 2003. I make that point simply to say that the figures seem to be moving around a little bit.</para>
<para>This bill was first introduced into the parliament on 12 August 2004. However, it lapsed when parliament was prorogued for the election. The bill varies from the original bill only in some relatively minor technical aspects, although some of these may, in Labor’s view, impact on patient costs. From the beginning, the Labor Party has expressed real concerns about this legislation. We have expressed concerns for a very transparent reason: that the premise of this bill, ostensibly, is about saving money for the government and for the health insurance industry. Doctors groups, including the AMA, have been consulted and so has the hospital sector, both public and private. However, it is obvious that the major impact of this legislation will be felt by patients because they very well may have less choice and certainty and face more out-of-pocket costs. But it is not an issue that consumers have been made aware of. I acknowledge the difficulty in doing this. It is not until we face having to access prostheses that we, as an individual or a community, truly understand what the cost of that might be. It is only when you have to have a hip replacement or a new heart valve or a stent to clear your arteries after a heart attack that you truly understand the cost of prostheses.</para>
<para>Patients are being ignored by this legislation—which, unfortunately, is typical of this government. There is nothing in the bill that ensures that a patient is informed about their out-of-pocket costs, and there is nothing in the bill that ensures that any savings that may be made by the health insurance funds will be passed on to consumers. We clearly need some changes in this area, and we acknowledge that. The system that we have needs an overhaul. But there are many questions regarding the capacity of the legislation that we have in front of us to bring about the required change. In April 2003 the Howard government announced the introduction of a range of reforms to:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… make private health insurance more efficient, competitive and deliver better value for money for members.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They claimed that this set of reforms would tackle supply costs, with their subsequent pressure on premiums, by seeking to rein in the costs of prostheses and eliminating the second tier default benefit—which ensures that there is a reasonable private health reimbursement level, even when a fund does not have an agreement with a hospital—for all but a few small rural and remote private hospitals.</para>
<para>In the 2003-04 budget the government estimated savings from these proposals at $49.6 million over four years. But the department unfortunately could not provide us a further breakdown of how those savings would eventuate. It was clear to us then, as it is now, that these initiatives are being driven by the private health insurance sector, not by consumers. As a result of questioning from Labor on these issues and a push from the private hospitals and the doctors’ groups on the licence given to the private health insurance industry in the proposal, the government finally rescinded the decision to abolish the second tier default benefit. Therefore, the bill in front of us is dealing with only the remaining prostheses commitment, first announced in the 2003-04 budget.</para>
<para>In terms of how private health insurance currently covers the cost of prostheses, as it stands, there is a list of items—known as ‘schedule 5: benefits payable in respect of surgically implanted prostheses, human tissue items and other medical devices list’—that health funds must fund for privately insured patients. Manufacturers or suppliers of prostheses must apply to the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing for the prostheses that they supply to be included on the list. The department subsequently assess the application against specific criteria. If a prosthesis is listed in schedule 5, private health insurance will cover the full cost of the prosthesis and there is no gap.</para>
<para>An expert committee, the Private Health Industry Medical Devices Expert Committee, oversees the listing of prostheses in schedule 5. The committee comprises representatives of consumers, the medical profession, private hospitals, private health funds, prostheses manufacturers and the government. A frequent and quite justified complaint about the system is that each fund is required to notify each hospital which prostheses they will cover the cost of. The choice of prostheses, as we know, is generally made by the doctor—hopefully in consultation with the patient. The level of cover, though, is provided by the fund, and either the hospital or the patient is left to fund the gap.</para>
<para>Industry data reveals that in the year to June 2003, prostheses costs to the private health insurance industry were $546 million, up 24 per cent from the previous year, so you can tell this is a growing area of cost. The growth of new technologies makes prostheses the fastest growing sector of private health insurance cover and an area that makes the private health insurance funds keen to reel in. Three factors are driving the increase in prostheses costs for private health insurers. Firstly, the largest factor is the increase in utilisation. More people are using their private health cover to have, for example, cataract surgery or to have the hip replacement that they need. The government’s plan to have more people aged 65 and over take out private health insurance would, if it eventuated, add further pressure on the costs of utilisation. Secondly, many of these new technologies and new devices will generate cost savings because people require less time in hospital recuperating or require fewer replacements. As technology is developing, prosthetic knee devices, for example, have a longer life span so the likelihood of needing a replacement one is limited. Thirdly, but to a far lesser extent, is the increase in supplier costs.</para>
<para>In Labor’s view, the new process for the determination of which prostheses will be listed as ‘no gap’ or ‘gap’ and the pricing structure that will be assigned to each category under this legislation is untested and extremely complicated. There is nothing here that ensures that more than one product is listed in each ‘no gap’ category or that new technologies are considered as they become available. The likely consequence is—and this is the view of some in the sector—that only the oldest and the cheapest products will be listed as ‘no gap’. The current system for regulating prostheses, and particularly for evaluating their cost effectiveness, has been limited, and there is little by way of independent data on which to base decisions in the future. Nor is there anything to ensure that patients are provided with choice or that the savings are passed on to consumers, through a decreasing rate of premium increases, although that is the stated intent of the policy. In fact, the most likely outcome is that patients will have less choice or will pay more out-of-pocket costs for medical procedures involving prostheses.</para>
<para>My colleague Senator Moore will talk about the ‘hopeful’ legislation. I had to use that line; it is a beautiful line. This is very hopeful legislation, and during the inquiry we heard from many witnesses that they hoped that this would be the outcome that we would achieve. I spoke in the chamber last night about needing good data and good modelling on which to make decisions that are expensive and that impact on both public and private costs. I expressed a view about the legislation we were debating last night that making public policy requires good research and good data. This bill is in the same bucket as the aged care bill that we looked at last night that did not have very much data to support it.</para>
<para>I am afraid to say that, while the Howard government seemingly has a policy intent, the fact is that this legislation may very well not be able to deliver that policy intent. On the one hand, the government is championing private health insurance as being about choice but, sadly for consumers, this bill will limit choice and, in our view, increase out-of-pocket costs. The government is involving itself in an endless series of contradictions on health policy: it wants more people to take out health insurance but not to use it, it promises more choice and then joins with the private health insurers to limit that potential choice, it talks about the need to address the issues of healthy ageing but wants older Australians to pay more for their cataract surgery or their hip replacements, and it wants the savings from reining in private health insurance costs but does nothing to ensure that these are handed on either to consumers or to the budget through the 30 per cent rebate.</para>
<para>Labor recommended that this bill go to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee to allow for public discussion on the implications of the bill. The report of that committee confirmed Labor’s fears with regard to choice for consumers. While there appear to be some steps in place to establish guidelines, codes of conduct and standard forms for doctors to assist with the provision of appropriate information to patients, Labor is not convinced that these processes are sufficiently established or tested. Given the level of hope that was expressed in that report and that will be expressed in this chamber, and given the level of uncertainty associated with the implementation and the medium-term effect of the bill, Labor moved a second reading amendment which called for a review of the bill after 1 July 2007. This is consistent with the view of a number of submissions to the Senate committee and underlines the department’s statements during the hearing which noted that the government has given a commitment to commence a review two years after full implementation of the new arrangements.</para>
<para>Labor’s amendment also called for the review to report in a timely manner, by 1 October 2007, for this review to be tabled by the minister and for the conduct of the review to not be unduly influenced by the private health insurance sector and to have strong representation from consumers. This amendment ensures that the issues associated with this bill that remain outstanding do remain on the table and that the appropriate checks and balances and evaluations are in place. In other words, we can be sure that we are enacting good health policy for the benefit of all Australians.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2217">National Health Amendment (Prostheses) Bill 2005</inline> aims to introduce some cost control into private health care and reduce cost pressures on health insurance premiums. The government has argued that the growing costs to health funds of covering prostheses and medical devices over the past 10 years have placed substantial upward pressure on private health insurance premiums, and it is certainly true that health insurance premiums have risen. They have risen on average by about seven per cent over the past four years—a rate two to three times the consumer price index. In April 2002, they rose by 6.9 per cent; in March 2003, 7.4 per cent; in March 2004, 7.82 per cent; and in March 2005, 7.96 per cent. In fact, health insurance fees have risen 30 per cent since 2001.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>One thing that has been constant as far as private health insurance is concerned is the increase in premiums. It is also true that, following the government’s deregulation of prostheses in 2001, the total benefits paid for prostheses have risen rapidly. In 1989-90, 15 years ago, prostheses accounted for 1.7 per cent of total hospital benefits, whereas they now account for 12 per cent of hospital benefits. In the two years from 2001-02 to 2003-04, the growth in prostheses costs has been 29 per cent. Having let the price inflation horse bolt from the stable, as it were, it is certainly not before time that the government has looked at this issue.</para>
<para>This is a reasonably complex bill which has the potential to introduce some cost savings for the health insurance industry and, consequently, for people who pay health insurance premiums. But there are risks for consumers. There is nothing in this bill that will guarantee that any savings made by insurance funds will be handed on to consumers; there is nothing in this bill that will guarantee that a patient is informed about their out-of-pocket costs; and, of course, there is a great chance that the consumers—the patients themselves—will pay more.</para>
<para>It would seem to be that there is general agreement amongst the majority of groups that reform is needed in relation to current arrangements for the provision of private health insurance benefits for prostheses. The bill tackles that issue by essentially proposing the introduction of a system similar to that used by the PBS to address pricing of drugs. With that system, the PBS pays for the least expensive clinically effective drug and, if companies insist on charging more than the benchmark price for a particular drug, the patient has to bear that cost. Similarly, this bill will introduce gap and no gap lists of prostheses. Prosthetic items whose price is considered by an industry committee to fall outside a cost-effective range will end up on the gap list. The idea is that suppliers will be more likely to agree to lower prices than face the possibility that their device may end up on the gap list and become unattractive to patients and their doctors when compared to similar devices that would not carry a gap. These lower prices will mean savings for health insurance funds, and extra costs associated with the devices on the gap permitted list will be met by the patient, not by the health fund, adding to the savings the funds will make.</para>
<para>The question is: will private health insurance premiums stop rising at the phenomenal rates of the last few years? The relationship between private health insurance premium growth and prostheses has clearly been one of the driving forces behind the legislation. It is thought that the growth in prostheses alone is responsible for two per cent growth in private health insurance premiums each year. However, as I said, there is no guarantee that this bill will have any substantial impact on controlling the costs for prostheses or, if it does, that these savings will be passed on.</para>
<para>There are three main drivers for increasing costs. First, there is an overall increase in volume due to advances in surgical techniques and anaesthetics. Prostheses are now put into younger and older people than previously and they are available for more conditions. This is not necessarily a bad thing as the use of prostheses can mean improved quality of life, overall savings in health costs due to shorter hospital stays and reduced recovery time following surgery. Secondly, the cost of prostheses has also been driven up by new technologies, including the development of prostheses for conditions which used not to exist and ‘me too’ technologies that essentially do the same thing as older versions but cost a lot more. Thirdly, price inflation also has had a role to play in increasing the cost of prostheses.</para>
<para>As I said, this legislation only deals with the latter issues; therefore it may have a limited impact on reducing costs to health funds and subsequently a limited effect on keeping premiums down. The government’s own projections of savings to expenditure on the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate from the effects of this bill are a very modest $24.9 million across the two years from 2005-07. The Parliamentary Library <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> for this bill estimates that savings for 2005-06 represent less than one-half of one per cent of current expenditure on the rebate. Of course, there are many factors which impact on the premiums. The cost of prostheses is only one. Other factors are still likely to result in health insurance premium rises in the future.</para>
<para>There is concern about informed consent and out-of-pocket costs for patients. The new arrangements have the potential to substantially increase out-of-pocket costs for prostheses for privately insured individual consumers. I say ‘potential’ because we do not know how many of the roughly 9,000 items currently listed would end up on the gap permitted list. The more items that go onto the gap permitted list the greater the likelihood that people will face a gap. There is also a risk that allowing the introduction of gap permitted prostheses might lead to a differential quality of care based on ability to pay if prostheses that end up on the gap permitted list are of a higher standard than the non-gap prostheses.</para>
<para>At this point in time it is not known how many frequently used devices which would previously have been provided at no cost to privately insured consumers will attract that gap payment. It is assumed that the vast majority of prostheses will be on the no gap list. The government suggests it will be 80 per cent but, of course, that cannot be guaranteed. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one product with no gap for each procedure related to an MBS item. But, if patients choose to have other medical devices or prostheses, they will pay more.</para>
<para>Like legislative arrangements concerning other potential gaps, such as doctors or hospital costs, there are no legislative requirements to ensure informed financial consent. We are well aware of the many cases of people who believe that having private health insurance will give them cover for the cost of their treatment, only to find that, when they do go for treatment having made that decision, they are faced with substantial bills. The 2004 Private Health Insurance Ombudsman report states that consumers generally do not have a good understanding of how much it costs to be treated in a private hospital. If a health fund member finds they are not fully covered by their health insurance, the amount of money involved can come as an unpleasant surprise.</para>
<para>PHIAC statistics for the June quarter of 2004 showed that around 20 per cent of in-hospital medical services provided to patients involved out-of-pocket costs. That means a substantial minority of people are already facing out-of-pocket costs, and we can assume from the complaints made to the ombudsman that some of these people have not been well informed about these costs. The AMA has made strong statements that it is not the responsibility of doctors to ensure that patients are informed about the costs that flow to them because of the existence of the legislation. But the question is just whose responsibility it is. Hopefully, as part of a clinician’s decision-making process they will take into account the cost effectiveness of particular prostheses when deciding which is right for a patient. It is essential that doctors are well informed.</para>
<para>Failure to obtain informed consent can have substantial consequences for consumers and there is clearly good intent among industry stakeholders to ensure that patients are appropriately advised and informed of any potential gaps they may face. Given that there is no legislative requirement for independent monitoring or review of the adequacy of informed financial consent procedures following the introduction of these processes, it would seem important that there is this element in the new arrangements.</para>
<para>Independent review of the extent of out-of-pocket costs faced by consumers for their prostheses would be very valuable, particularly given experience with the PBS system and the high proportion of people facing premium charges for medications. The Democrats will support the Labor amendment that puts in place that review. We will also support the call for this legislation to cover prostheses implanted by a podiatric surgeons. I understand Senator Lees will move that amendment. As we have argued before, there is evidence that treatment outcomes for foot conditions treated by podiatrists and podiatric surgeons are in many cases better than when these conditions are treated by orthopaedic surgeons and other types of physicians. Podiatric surgeons may also provide a more cost-effective service than orthopaedic surgeons. Patients who wish to use the services of a podiatric surgeon should not be forced to use orthopaedic surgeons or pay out-of-pocket costs simply because their health insurance fund does not have coverage for a prostheses if it is implanted by a podiatric surgeon.</para>
<para>In conclusion, it is encouraging to see the government beginning to address the issue of cost control in the private sector. We hope that this is the first of many such measures along these lines. The 2004 OECD paper examining private health insurance in Australia reported that private funds do not exercise control over the quality, quantity or appropriateness of care provided and private health insurance has led to an overall increase in health utilisation as there are few limits on expenditure growth. If the government is to continue with its obsession with privatisation of health care, despite the plethora of evidence that the greater the degree of privatisation in health, the greater the cost of health care to the population as a whole, it at least has the responsibility to make sure that costs are contained within that sector.</para>

<para>—I was fortunate enough to be a member of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, which the <inline ref="R2217">National Health Amendment (Prostheses) Bill 2005</inline> was referred to earlier this year. Until that time, ‘prostheses’ was but a term to me. I had heard about the legislation and had read up on it, but when I was given the opportunity to sit with this committee I became more aware of not only the number of people for whom this was an interesting point but also the number of members of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee who had prostheses themselves. They self-identified before the committee started, and I found that particularly interesting. I myself do not have any devices currently, so I can speak with openness on this topic.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In terms of the information we have had, my colleagues in the Senate have talked about the technical aspects of this bill. I want to concentrate on a few points which I think we need to consider when we are looking at passing this legislation. As Senator McLucas mentioned, I have referred to the committee as the ‘committee of hope’ because, whilst we had 12 submissions and a number of people gave evidence before the committee, the one common theme that we heard was that everybody really ‘hoped’ that this legislation would work. Everybody really hoped that there would be some containment of, some acknowledgment of and some improvement in the way this issue was being handled in our community. Reflecting that hope, there was also genuine agreement that what was happening currently was not good. We heard, for instance, from the Australian Private Hospitals Association, which said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Reform of these existing arrangements is therefore not optional, it is essential.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">We heard that it was absolutely critical that we as participants in this government looked effectively at the way legislation would be introduced so that there would be some real understanding of the way the budget would operate and so that the medical profession, the hospitals and all those people who had an interest in this area would be able to cooperate to ensure that we had the best possible system. In the submission from the Department of Health and Ageing—and this was also reflected in the explanatory memorandum to this bill—we heard about the issue of cost. Of course, that is important. The Department of Health and Ageing said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Prostheses have been identified as one of the major cost drivers of health insurance premiums. Current rates of growth in prostheses costs are estimated to contribute around 2 per cent a year to total premium growth. There was an annual average 29 per cent increase in prostheses benefits paid in 2003-04 compared to 2000-01. Benefits paid in 2003-04 totalled over $647 million.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is in payment to people who made genuine claims for surgical processes which included devices—and I hope to use that word for the rest of this speech. I only caught that one during the committee hearings. I think I would have used that word much more commonly if I had known that earlier. The expectation is that the new arrangements the changes that are before us are expected to make a significant contribution to reducing the pressure on health insurance premiums by limiting the rapid growth in benefits being paid. The anticipated savings are significant. I believe that they are almost essential in terms of where we are going as a community. But what worries me deeply is that the introduction of the legislation is based on hope. The actual details are not yet clear. In fact, Catholic Health Australia made that comment in their submission, which they followed up with evidence as witnesses to the committee. They said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Not all of the detail has yet been worked out and we are yet to see what the outcome of the new arrangements will mean in terms of the extent of gap payments that consumers may face.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Nevertheless we believe that the goodwill displayed by all parties to date and the consultative processes in place should provide comfort to Senate that the Bill should be supported.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I truly hope that the Senate can be comforted by those processes, but it always concerns me as a member of this place when we are asked to agree to legislation when the details are not clear and when we rely on the goodwill of all participants to achieve it. Certainly something that all the people who appeared before our committee shared was goodwill, because there was hope that these processes would operate. Nonetheless, it seems to be a precarious way to move through the process.</para>
<para>Up until now, people in the community having these surgical procedures could have confidence that their costs would be paid for any devices apropriately used in surgical procedures. The change is that there will now be gap payments in some cases. Gap payments are not new to the Australian community. As was submitted to our committee, gap payments are standard in so many parts of our medical system. The real issue here, though, is that up to now there has not been a gap payment for this procedure. Now there will be. We do not know how large the gap will be. That provides a great deal of concern for all those who are part of the industry and all those who feel that they will probably need a device in the future—and it probably concerns the minister. No-one wishes to make significant changes to legislation, including cost factors, without knowing exactly what the gap payments will be. I think that is something that should be more a reality than a hope.</para>

Is the minister aware that, of the 1.6 million workers whose pay is subject to the minimum wage under state and federal awards, 965,000 or 60 per cent are women? Further, is the minister aware that over the last nine years the Howard government has opposed every single wage claim for an increase in the minimum wage for these women? Minister, do you support the government’s proposal to change the mechanism for setting the minimum wage which protects the income of these low-paid women?</para>

It is a special day on which we celebrate the achievements of women. We celebrate the achievements of women in Australia, where we have seen increased participation in the work force and, despite what the spokesman on the other side has been saying about average weekly earnings, we have seen a reduction in the gap between women’s average weekly earnings and male average weekly earnings. Last week we saw average weekly earnings of women increase at a higher rate than average weekly earnings of men.</para>

They do not want to hear that more women are participating in the work force. They do not want to hear that there are fewer families with parents out of work. They do not want to hear that, because of strong economic management, we have been able to ensure that more women are in the work force and more women are receiving pay. We have seen, for example, with some of the initiatives we have put forward, particularly the superannuation bonus, that the people who have benefited most have been women.

<para>—Senator Ferris asks how many women were unemployed. The vast majority of those unemployed were women. Women have now increased their participation in the work force and increased their participation in apprenticeships. We have increased the number of apprenticeships significantly—I have forgotten the exact percentage, but it is an enormous increase—and many of the people in apprenticeships are now women. You want to talk about the minimum wage and the increase in wages. When we have a strong economy, businesses employing people and a third of people in small business are women, we are seeing women making economic progress.

Women’s savings for retirement have increased, women’s participation in the work force has increased, women’s participation in education has increased and women’s participation in apprenticeships has increased. Why don’t they celebrate that today rather than making hypothetical assumptions about our industrial relations policy, changes that may or may not occur?

As I said before, through strong economic management, opportunities and choice for women have significantly increased under the Howard government. There have been more jobs—and this is something Labor does not want to acknowledge. Since 1996, the Howard government has created more than 1.5 million new jobs and 800,000 of them have gone to women.</para>

<para>—Shout all you like. You do not want to hear the good news. In 1996 fewer than 50 per cent of Australian women were in employment. This has now risen to a clear majority of almost 54 per cent. Full-time adult ordinary time earnings for women have increased in real terms—that is after inflation—by $152 per week. Under the Howard government, real earnings for women have gone up 2.2 per cent each year. Do you want to know what happened under Labor? The annual rate was only 0.6 per cent, or almost four times lower.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I would like to take this opportunity to expose the fallacy and the misinformation that is being put around in Labor’s claims regarding the difference between men’s and women’s wages. Women’s earnings have increased as a proportion of men’s, rising from about 83 per cent in February 1996 to almost 85 per cent today—a closing gap. Through this government’s strong economic management, Australian women have now reaped the opportunities and choice and the benefits of work force participation. One other great achievement is that we now see women heading six federal Public Service departments. Eighteen of our diplomatic posts are headed by women, compared with six in 1996. These steady increases over previous years will continue. As I said before, women now account for one-third of Australia’s 1.6 million small business operators.</para>
<para>The Howard government’s super co-contribution scheme has allowed women to grow their retirement savings faster. $244 million has already been paid to the superannuation accounts of 450,000 eligible Australians earning under $40,000, and 63 per cent of recipients have been women. So 63 per cent of the 450,000 eligible for benefits under the superannuation bonus have been women.</para>
<para>I also note Labor’s recent feigned interest in skills for the Australian work force. Improving vocational training has been a high priority for the government and an area of great success. Apprenticeships and traineeships for women have increased by 500 per cent. The Howard government is about choice. Support for families with children has enabled many women to choose to balance work with caring for children. The $3,000 maternity payment has gone to all women, not to nine out of 10, and it does not depend on when you have the baby.</para>
<para>An 83 per cent increase has occurred in the number of child-care places, to over 563,000 places. We have introduced the 30 per cent tax rebate for out-of-pocket child-care expenses for approved facilities. We will spend over $8 billion in this and the next three financial years to support child care—an average of over $2½ thousand per child in child care per annum and double what Labor was spending.</para>
<para>We have increased the family tax benefit part B, which Labor was going to get rid of. In their ramshackle family policy, they were going to have single parents with children losing out. Low-income families would be losing out under their family policy. That is the record of Labor. To sum up the achievements of the Howard government is simple: there are more jobs for women, higher earnings, better support for families and a tax system that allows Australians—men, women and families—to keep more of every tax dollar they earn.</para>

<para>—My question is to Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Minister for Workforce Participation. Can the minister confirm there is no mandated training requirement in the work for parenting payment scheme, just as there is none in the Work for the Dole scheme? Given that skills development is acknowledged as a key factor in increasing work force participation, how does the minister justify a lack of mandated training in a scheme that purports to improve the employment prospects of sole parents, who are predominantly women? Does the minister expect sole parents to seek work force entry without skills development, be confined to low-wage, low-skill jobs and do nothing to ease the skills shortage crisis?</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Crossin for her question because it will give me more time to deal with a topic that will be dealt with in the next question, so I thank her for her assistance in that regard. In relation to work force participation, we encourage the participation of all Australians who can work. That is a priority of this government, and we have been actively seeking to assist all people in the Australian population to get work. Of course, that includes sole parents and single mums.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government was returned on 9 October on its record of running a strong economy and building prosperity through employment. However, there are still too many people, and that includes lone parents, missing out on the benefits that employment brings. The number of people on parenting payments, some 624,000, is now greater than the number of people on unemployment benefits.</para>
<para>People on parenting payments are eligible for a range of Job Network services. Those services are designed to take into account the preference of many parents for part-time work to fit in with their caring responsibilities. In our society, it is still largely women who take on that caring responsibility. Therefore, for them to be able to match their caring responsibilities with part-time work is part and parcel of this government’s approach. We can also help parenting payment recipients if they have a part-time job but want to find a full-time job. Those who have been out of the work force for two or more years can access Transition to Work services.</para>
<para>Often women do take time off work for two, three or more years whilst they have children and before those children start school. A lot of women make that choice for the benefit of their children, and then the transition back to work is a very real issue, and we as a government are addressing that as well. The Transition to Work program provides a range of flexible services especially tailored to parents, including training, financial assistance and advice on ways to get into the job market. Transition to Work is highly successful, with 44 per cent of participants getting an employment or education outcome. The government is committed to encouraging the economic participation of all people of working age according to their capacity, and of course that includes lone parents and single mothers.</para>

<para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, I actually asked you about the work for parenting payment scheme rather than anything to do with Transition to Work. I think I heard you mention the word ‘training’ once, although that was predominantly what my question was about. Let us have another go. Minister, if the government is serious about improving the employment prospects and outcomes of sole parents, who are predominantly women, how can the minister justify the lack of training opportunities open to them? In particular, how can the minister justify the fact that only two in every 100 sole parents access the JET program, which is supposed to help single parents enter the work force? Isn’t the government simply interested in reducing its welfare bill rather than easing the skills shortage crisis with Australian workers and building the skills and capacity of women and sole parents for successful work force participation?</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Barnett for his ongoing interest in job creation in this country—job creation being the most important welfare policy that any government can deliver to its people. More Australians are now in work than ever before in our history and the unemployment rate has been below six per cent since August 2003. In addition, real wages for full-time workers are now a massive 18 per cent higher than when we took office in 1996. I note today—on International Women’s Day—that, contrary to claims by the ACTU and the Labor Party, the gap between men’s and women’s wages is in fact closing under the Howard government.</para>

<para>—The important measure that Senator Collins wants to know about is that, since 1996, women’s average full-time weekly earnings have risen by 46.1 per cent compared to us fellas who have had only a 41.5 per cent rise. So there has been a substantial catch-up, as Senator Kay Patterson was indicating in answer to an earlier question. Over the term of the Howard government, average annual jobs growth has been around the 174,000 mark per annum; under Labor it was down to 101,000. For the past year, employment growth in Australia was an impressive 2.7 per cent or, to put it another way, there are 17,000 new jobs being created in Australia each and every month. At this rate, according to the ANZ, the unemployment rate may fall below five per cent by June this year. That is an economic and social indicator that I would have thought even the Labor Party might seek to applaud.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Having said that, we as a government are not resting on our laurels. We accept that more needs to be done. Whilst we might achieve that five per cent level, we should be seeking to drive that statistic down even further. That is why we as a government are pursuing a raft of industrial relations changes to ensure that there are greater employment opportunities in this country, such as getting rid of the unfair ‘unfair dismissal’ laws. If they were abolished, many commentators believe that we could create between 50,000 to 75,000 new jobs overnight. But, because the Australian Labor Party is so beholden to their trade union masters, they will not allow that legislation through this place—as a result, consigning about 50,000 to 75,000 of their fellow Australians to the unemployment scrap heap. We want to change the laws to stop unions from being able to barge into small business workplaces—something that those opposite in fact support and favour, as was witnessed by the votes of Senator Kerry O’Brien and other Labor senators on these important issues. Employment growth in this country has been a hallmark of the success of the economic management of the Howard-Costello team. We want to drive it even further and we look forward to Labor’s support. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

The drop-off in apprenticeships under the previous government was a disgrace.

<para>Senator Webber, the report you referred to found that the number of completions of new apprenticeships has increased by 280 per cent since 1996. Over the 12 months to June 2003, about 120,500 new apprenticeships were completed. The number of new apprentices has grown from an all-time low of 122,700 in 1993 to more than 390,000 today. The growth in new apprenticeships in new areas has not been at the expense of apprenticeships in the traditional trades. Today 38 per cent of all new apprentices are in trades and related work; the number of new apprentices in these areas has grown by 21 per cent since 1995. In the last 12 months alone we have seen a 19 per cent increase in commencements in traditional trades. There has not been a decline in the absolute number of people commencing a new apprenticeship in trades. Tradespersons still saw very healthy growth from 1996 to 2003—in fact, up 32 per cent or almost 13,000 people. This contrasts markedly with the seven per cent growth in employment over the same period. There is a seven per cent growth in employment and a 32 per cent growth in tradespersons. More people are undertaking new apprenticeships at higher levels of competency. The number of new apprenticeships at certificate 3 and 4 level has increased from 67 per cent to 75 per cent over the period. Since 1996, there has been an enormous increase in the number of women undertaking a new apprenticeship—up from 20 per cent of all new apprentices in 1996 to 36 per cent today. Seventy-two per cent of people completing a new apprenticeship reported that their training had improved their job security; 84 per cent reported that it had improved their job prospects.</para>
<para>In conclusion, Senator, you only have to go back to the recession we had to have, to a million people unemployed, and ask yourself whether a better job is being done now or not. That should allow you to draw a conclusion as to why this government has been re-elected.</para>

Isn’t it the case that one of the key reasons for the skill shortage is the Howard government’s failure to adequately fund our TAFE system, resulting in nearly 270,000 students having been turned away since 1998? Isn’t it the case that, if the Commonwealth had actually matched the states’ increases in TAFE funding since 1997, there would have been $833 million more spent by the Howard government on skills training?</para>

<para>—A lot of the money the states and territories put in comes from the Commonwealth, so I am not sure what figures you are quoting. The single point that I might make here is that the Australian government’s contribution to states and territories under the VET Funding Act has grown from $778 million under Labor to $1.15 billion under the coalition government in 2005. In real terms, the Australian government has increased funding for training by 22 per cent since 1995. That is a 22 per cent increase in real terms. By contrast, in 2004-05, most of the states and territories cut their training budgets. All states and territories rejected the Australian government’s offer of $3.6 billion for the proposed 2004-06 ANTA agreement, a 12.5 per cent increase on the 2001-03 agreement. If accepted by the states and territories, that offer would have created up to 71,000 new training places. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

Is she aware that the majority of babies that are adopted from overseas are more than 26 weeks of age? Is the minister also aware that many adoptive agencies in our states and territories actually encourage adoptive parents to take time off—in fact up to 12 months off—so that they can look after their child and thus entail the same level of financial burden as those who have a biological child of their own?</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Sherry for the question. As I say, we appreciate the fact that the opposition has finally focused on the economy. We have obviously acknowledged that the current account deficit which Australia is running is something we would rather was not as high as it is, but you have to examine why it is at the level it is at. I note in particular the reference by the International Monetary Fund in its recent report on Australia. It says that the widening current account deficit ‘mainly reflects the sharp appreciation of the Australian dollar and the relatively strong cyclical position of the economy’. These are the fundamental underlying reasons for our running a relatively high current account deficit, which obviously means that foreign debt is increasing.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Australian dollar has been relatively high, which obviously means that imports are cheap and it is tougher for exporters. We do have an imbalance in that the Australian economy has been running at a stronger and faster growth level than have those of our major trading partners. Therefore there is pressure in relation to our export markets with the Australian economy still running strongly and sucking in imports. So it is an inevitable consequence of having an economy that is strong.</para>
<para>That is what the Labor Party do not quite understand. They ignore all the good things about the economy and, in their desperation, try to find things that they think are not so good. These things are again evidence of growing pains. When you have a fast-growing economy, inevitably demand exceeding supply will spill over into the current account. There are a couple of critical things. The first is to make sure that the economy is as flexible and productive as possible so that you ensure that, to the extent that demand is running strongly, the domestic economy can meet supply demands. That is why we keep bringing to this parliament ideas and proposals to reform the economy and make it more flexible. The hypocrites opposite have spent nine years—</para>

<para>—I am happy to withdraw it if it offends the poor darlings on the other side who are so sensitive that they cannot stand the slings and arrows of political debate. Those opposite, as I have said, have opposed in this parliament virtually every proposal we have brought forward to make this economy more flexible, more dynamic, more productive and therefore more capable of ensuring that we keep some control over the current account deficit. If they have had a complete change of heart and if they are now going to support the measures that we bring forward to make this economy more flexible, we welcome that. That would be terrific. We would gladly have them on board if they are going to join us in ensuring that we can do that.</para>

<para>The other thing you have to do when the economy is running a current account deficit of this kind—and with growth that is producing that current account deficit—is to ensure that the government’s finances remain in surplus. The great achievement of this government is to reverse the disastrous fiscal situation we inherited, to return the budget to solid surplus and to ensure that the federal government is making its contribution to the economy by net savings. But again we have an opposition which, on virtually every occasion and in every budget, opposes any measures we bring in to constrain government spending, or demands that we spend more. Every shadow minister comes out with a press release saying, ‘This stingy government is not spending enough on X, Y and Z’—fill in the blanks. Again, we would welcome the opposition joining us in ensuring the fiscal discipline that is required in the situation where we do have a current account deficit.</para>

<para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. My question related to one of the increasing number of bad indicators of the economy, which is the ever-increasing level of foreign debt. Isn’t the minister aware that the OECD has warned the government that high current account deficits put upward pressure on interest rates? Does the minister accept that unless the current account deficit and the resulting foreign debt are reduced, interest rates will have to rise further?</para>

<para>—Senator Sherry is missing the point. The responsibility of the government in these circumstances is to ensure that it minimises any pressure on interest rates by ensuring that it is making no contribution to the current account deficit, which it is not because it is saving. We are saving through the strength of our surpluses, which they always attack. Whenever we have a big surplus they say, ‘The surplus is far too big; the government should go and spend it all.’ Then of course they try and turn it around and say that we are spending too much. The opposition has no clarity on this—no form whatsoever. It does not understand the nature of the economy and the nature of the responsibility on the federal government to continue to run high surpluses so that it is not contributing to any pressure on interest rates. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has made it quite clear that he accepts the veracity of the fiscal position of the federal government and that it is not putting any pressure on interest rates.</para>

<para>—My question is addressed to Senator Vanstone, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. The minister will recall the case 18 months ago of a 14-year-old boy, detained at Port Hedland detention centre, who lost sight in his right eye and almost lost his left eye after he was repeatedly denied specialist assessment and treatment. My question relates to a man I visited in Villawood detention centre last week named Masood, who has recently been diagnosed as a diabetic. Is the minister aware that on January 29 Masood collapsed and was taken to Liverpool hospital? He was told by the doctor that he needed to see a specialist in order to get an urgent assessment of his sight. To this day, Masood has not seen an ophthalmologist or a diabetic specialist. Why has the department prevented Masood from seeing an eye specialist for 38 days now, since his collapse?</para>

<para>—Senator Nettle, you may or may not be familiar with the process by which correspondence is handled in most ministers’ offices; that is, it goes to the department for the preparation of a reply. So, generally, I would not be made aware of correspondence until it came back with an appropriate reply. Of course, the tenor of your supplementary question reveals the degree of faith with which you brought your first question to this place. In fact, by the very question you have asked as a supplementary, you have indicated exactly your intent in this matter, which is more political than concern for Mr Masood.</para>

<para>Having said that, Senator, I go back to the answer I originally gave you, which is that, even though I have had experience of your getting things incorrect and putting them out as propositions and finding them to be false, nonetheless I will quite specifically have this matter checked out, because it relates to someone’s health, and then come back to the Senate and answer for what has or has not happened in his case.

<para>—I thank Senator Humphries for a very important question and one which is of concern to all Australians. The Howard government will not relent in its fight against those people who seek to exploit children. In particular, the fight against the sexual exploitation of children remains a top priority for law enforcement nationally. Across the states and territories of this country, we will not desist in any effort whatsoever to fight the sexual exploitation of children.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Last week we announced the delivery of an election commitment, and that was the launch of the Australian Federal Police Online Child Sex Exploitation Team. I launched it in Robina, Queensland, with the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Mick Keelty. This will bring to national law enforcement further resources and expertise in the fight against those people who want to sexually exploit children online. It will involve a sector of that team infiltrating the internet to seek out those paedophiles who want to use the internet to abuse children. It also will use its expertise and resources to gain intelligence and work with law enforcement, both domestically and internationally, in the fight against the sexual exploitation of children.</para>
<para>As well as that, we have now seen the introduction of new laws which will provide for up to 15 years jail for those people who groom or attempt to groom children on the internet for their own evil purposes, and also 10 years imprisonment for those people who transmit or download child pornography on the internet. We have also included internet service providers and have cast an obligation on them so that, if they become aware of child pornography being transmitted through their service, they will be obliged to take it down and refer it to the police. Of course, that gives added impetus to complaints from members of the public who come across this material and then raise it with an internet service provider. That adds extra weight to the participation of internet service providers in the fight against the sexual exploitation of children online.</para>
<para>As well as that, last year I launched the Australian National Child Offender Register, a register which is a key weapon in the fight against paedophiles. I noted with interest—and Senator Humphries will be interested to know—that in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> last week the ACT government sought to blame others for the delay in extending ANCOR to the ACT. The reason for that delay is the delay by that government in bringing in legislation which would allow it to participate in the Australian National Child Offender Register. Other states have done that, and I applaud them for that. Victoria, Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia have all come on board. This is a very important aspect of the fight against the sexual exploitation of children. It is one which the Commonwealth has led the way in, and in this fight we need a partnership between all governments—state, territory and federal—and also industry and the public at large. As well as that, we have provided funding for public awareness programs through NetAlert and the Australian Federal Police. This is a fight that we are totally committed to and one which we will engage in domestically, nationally and internationally.</para>

Has the minister advised The Nationals of this position?

Will the government be reconsidering its position on the structural separation of Telstra in the light of these National Party members’ views that nothing can be ruled out?</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Conroy for the question. One of the important points might be what the Labor Party thinks about this, and of course Mr Tanner ruled out very comprehensively structural separation. It will be interesting to see, when and if Senator Conroy ever turns his mind to Labor’s policy on Telstra and the future regulation of Telstra, what he recommends to his party as an appropriate way to consider regulation as we move towards the full privatisation of Telstra.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government is mindful that we do need to keep a careful watch on the regulatory settings so that they are optimal to encourage both innovation and, in particular, the future roll-out of new networks. Obviously the current framework looks very much at providing access to infrastructure that is already there. One of the big challenges in telecommunications is to provide a good regulatory environment that will enable certainty in investment with new roll-outs. So the government’s approach to improving communication services in Australia has been to promote competition between as many service providers as possible, and it is achieved through the regime that is set out in the Trade Practices Act, parts XIB and XIC. Very importantly, the regime is underpinned by a rigorous consumer protection regime that is certainly among the most comprehensive of any in the world, and that regulatory framework has proven to be very effective. We have recently seen the impact of the competition notice provisions, which have forced Telstra to significantly change its wholesale pricing and to offer a $6.5 million financial settlement to the ACCC. This is evidence of the current regime working effectively.</para>

<para>—I was outlining for Senator Conroy’s information and assistance the existing regulatory framework so that I could then address the issues of structural separation. I announced in December last year that I had under consideration looking at the regulatory structure that would best accommodate the new networks and the environment as the government considered whether or not it would proceed with the sale of Telstra. I should emphasise that this does not mean that the government has under consideration any position that would involve the structural separation of the existing structure of Telstra. We do not believe that slicing and dicing Telstra, splitting it into wholesale and retail or hiving off bits of it in a forced structural separation, is something that would suit either the competition regime or the future interests of the regulatory regime if the government did proceed with finally disposing of the remaining investment in Telstra.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>We do not think that it has been shown to be in the long-term interests of either investors or consumers that the government should take a role in forcing some slicing and dicing of Telstra—and that includes splitting it into a country arm and a city arm. What delivers benefits for consumers are price controls and the structures that relate to competition. I think a lot of people who make comments about structural separation may not appreciate what particular form of structural separation they are talking about and what in fact delivers benefits for consumers. All commentators have said that it should only proceed if there are cost benefits to doing so. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>The most important thing that has improved the situation for women in Australia in terms of their opportunity to work and in terms of enabling them to work in an environment where their small businesses can be successful—a third of all small businesses are run by women—is that we have run a strong economy. We have not racked up government debt and we have not borrowed beyond our means. We have had surpluses, we have had low interest rates and we have had low unemployment. And women have been some of the main beneficiaries.</para>
<para>I am not going to discuss what might or might not be in the industrial relations reform. That question is more appropriately directed to the minister representing the minister for industrial relations. But what I can say is that we will be watching very closely any issues that affect women. But when you look at Labor’s record in government, when we saw record unemployment and interest rates sending small businesses to the wall—and many of those were run by women—Labor failed to recognise what their policies were doing to women. What we have seen is increased participation by women in the work force, an increase in the average weekly earnings of women, increased opportunities in education for women and—through lower interest rates—increased opportunities for women to purchase and own their own homes. We have seen enormous benefits to women through the fact that we have run this economy soundly and strongly and will continue to do so.</para>

What we have seen is women being able to benefit by increasing their contribution to superannuation. What we have seen is women being able to choose their superannuation fund and not suffer the problem, because often they move from job to job, of having a number of superannuation accounts. When you go through policy by policy, issue by issue, you see the impact that our policies have had on improving the situation for women.</para>

<para>—My question is to Senator Minchin, representing the Treasurer. Is the minister aware of reports today that the federal budget surplus has climbed to $10 billion? Don’t these reports demonstrate the magnitude of the Howard government’s continuing tax grab from the pockets of every Australian family and give further confirmation to data from the ABS showing that the Howard government is in fact the highest taxing government in Australia’s history? As the Treasurer of the highest taxing government ever in this country, why isn’t Mr Costello focusing on delivering real services like major infrastructure development to the taxpayers he is ripping off in this record way?</para>

<para>—In fact, our proudest boast is that we have stopped the haemorrhaging of the federal budget. We inherited a budget in a disastrous state, one with massive deficits. They lied to us about the deficit going into the 1996 election. They said it was in surplus when it was $10 billion in deficit. They racked up $70 billion of debt in the last five years they were in government. They left us with $96 billion of debts, which was putting pressure on interest rates. One of the biggest expenditure items in the budget was in fact paying interest on the debts they had accumulated. We are in fact very proud of the hard work we have done to get this budget back into surplus and we are envied, as the Governor of the Reserve Bank said, by countries all over the world. The specific question was about a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> this morning saying that we would have a surplus of $10 billion in this financial year. They do not say how on earth they arrived at that figure. I am not sure what the basis of the report is at all. I have no idea what they are talking about.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government’s official position is as reported in MYEFO—the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook—in December last year, just 2½ months ago. Our forecast then for 2004-05 was a surplus of $6.2 billion. Our forecast at that stage for 2005-06 was $4.5 billion. They remain the government’s projections, up until we release our revised figures in the budget itself. So we have no idea what the basis for the $10 billion figure is. We stand by the figures that we have provided, which we think are appropriate and sensible surplus figures. We are doing everything we can to ensure that we contribute to savings and that we minimise the extent to which there is pressure on interest rates, if any, from the fiscal position adopted by the government, and we will continue to deliver surpluses while the economy is growing so strongly.</para>

Is the minister aware that, while the federal government collects 70 per cent of tax revenue, it accounts for just $6 billion, or 22 per cent, of public investment? As the highest-taxing government in Australia’s history, will the government now accept the OECD’s advice and follow the lead of the Australian states by lifting infrastructure spending?</para>

<para>—The opposition is simply revealing its utter ignorance of the responsibilities of the federal government. Our single biggest expenditure is the age pension. We have responsibilities for the whole social security system and for Medicare, defence and national security. The states have different responsibilities. Their responsibilities are largely in the field of infrastructure. They are the ones who own the ports, the power stations, the gas and electricity systems. The government do not own infrastructure. Our expenditure is around $200 billion a year—which they always say is never enough; they always complain that we are not spending enough. Our expenditure priorities are focused on the national government’s responsibilities for defence and national security, for looking after elderly Australians, for providing Medicare et cetera, and we will continue to provide them, while delivering surplus budgets.</para>

</talk.start>
<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Patterson) to questions without notice asked today relating to women.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I acknowledge, as Senator Patterson and others have today, that today is International Women’s Day, so there was no surprise that many of today’s questions related to the social and economic circumstances of women. My question to the minister today related to the government’s proposal to change the mechanism for setting the minimum wage, which protects the income of low-paid women. We were talking of nearly one million women—965,000—who are protected under state and federal minimum wage awards. What do we know about the pressures that are confronting these women?</para>
<para>First of all, we know the importance of the minimum wage and that a boost to minimum wages is the key to sustaining a decent standard of living for Australia’s growing number of part-time and casual workers. The majority of low-paid workers are women. Increasing the minimum wage is an important means of reducing the gap between male and female wages. Many figures were thrown around the chamber this afternoon about the bridging of that gap. But the reality is that women’s wages are significantly lower and as such are also a significant disincentive for many women with children to work, who also face high child-care costs and the loss of the family tax benefit as their income increases.</para>
<para>What is the government’s response? First of all, in December the federal government moved to delay the ACTU national wage case, with Mr Andrews arguing that the Industrial Relations Commission would be wiser if it waited until after the May budget before its hearings began. At the time Mr Andrews said, ‘It makes sense for the AIRC to delay its hearings on the national wage case, until it has all the available economic data at its disposal.’ I was very pleased today to hear that we have a $10 billion budget surplus, which means that the ACTU wage case could be considered, in all of its aspects, to be a fair and generous approach to the low-paid wages of Australians.</para>
<para>But Mr Andrews was not prepared to stay there. He also suggested that one of the Howard government’s options was to slash the minimum wage, by removing the AIRC from the process altogether. The AIRC currently complies with the legislative directive to maintain a safety net of minimum wages and conditions, according to living standards that are generally expected by the Australian community. As part of its safety net assessment, the AIRC currently takes into account average weekly earnings, the balance of payments, inflation and productivity. The current system also allows a range of organisations, including the Reserve Bank and the Productivity Commission, to participate in a wage case assessment.</para>
<para>The minimum wage set by the AIRC is designed to protect the wages and entitlements of Australia’s lowest paid workers. It also acts as a mechanism to limit the wage divide between Australia’s highest paid and lowest paid workers. Perhaps Senator Patterson has also decided to adopt the Business Council of Australia’s view that fairness in the relationship between employers and employees is not a public policy priority. That is certainly not what Labor thinks about this issue. Labor believes that the ACTU’s claim for a minimum wage increase of $26.60 a week is a very fair and justifiable claim. The case would lift the federal minimum wage from $12.30 to $13 per hour. It would also increase the federal minimum wage from $467.40 to $494 per week or in fact $24,370 to $25,757 per year. Labor believes that low-paid workers need a decent wage rise and that their needs and their concerns must be protected by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</para>

</talker>
<para>—In taking note of the answers of the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women’s Issues, the opposition seem to be attempting to suggest that the position of women in Australia would be greatly assisted by some dramatic lift in the minimum wage, and they urge the government to support the ACTU’s position on lifting the minimum wage. The smallest amount of scrutiny and analysis of what Senator Stephens has just had to say will disclose that it is very hard to work out why lifting the minimum wage will necessarily lead to a closing of the gap in the wages between men and women. It would obviously benefit everybody who was on a minimum wage if the minimum wage were lifted. How it would benefit women vis-a-vis men is a little hard to determine. But it is worth making this point: the Howard government in the last nine years has specifically targeted the lifting of standards for all Australians as a way of assisting women as well as men. Raising the level of employment in the Australian community has been about lifting the capacity of women to find the work they need to lead independent lives, to be able to support families and to be able to make decisions that affect their own lives. Ensuring that interest rates remain relatively low has been about assisting women and their families to take out mortgages so that their position is improved.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The evidence of those measures is clear for anybody to observe at this point in time. As far as women in the work force are concerned, in January 2005 there were 4,422,200 women in employment. That is a lot of women. It represents a 4½ per cent increase in the number of women in the work force since 1996, when we took office—that is, there has been a 22.7 per cent increase in the number of women in the work force since March 1996. That is a tangible expression of the way that this government’s work has led to an improvement in the position of women.</para>
<para>Those opposite made a very thin case for some sort of change in policy and some kind of adjustment to the minimum wage that would somehow offer more benefits than those that have been delivered by this government. It is a pretty hard case to make. When we came to office the unemployment rate for women was 7.6 per cent; today it is 5.3 per cent. That is the most clear demonstration of how women have benefited under the policies of this government. Of course it will be possible to find some statistical basis on which to suggest there has been some lack of progress or some failure to achieve a target that might be set with respect to the position of women in Australian society. Of course it is always possible to find the dark lining in the silver cloud. Members of the opposition will do their best to find that dark lining, no doubt. But, if you look at the total picture—the support available to women as mothers, the position of women in the work force, the standard of living of Australian women compared with where they were nine years ago—if you look at any of those major indicators, it is perfectly clear that Australian women have benefited from the policies of the Howard government.</para>
<para>The number of women in senior positions in Australia is a further expression of that. We have heard from the minister about the record numbers of women ambassadors, high commissioners and permanent heads of our Public Service departments. That has not been through the application of some quota process; it has been by virtue of women being given the opportunity to demonstrate their talents, and those talents have led them into positions which I am pleased to say have benefited the Australian community.</para>
<para>The support that this government has given to women has been clear. A demonstration of that is available in the statistics which have measured the progress of women in the last nine years. I think it is fair enough for the opposition to try look at areas where they consider the progress has not been fast enough, but they cannot deny that progress has been real and substantial. Looking at the total picture, we see that women today have benefited from the policies implemented by this government over the last nine years.</para>

</talker>
<para>—Reflecting on how these issues regarding women were canvassed in question time today, I think the critical issue that needs to be raised is the quality of this debate as a whole. Senator Humphries talks about the need to look at the total picture—that there have been substantial advances. To be frank, reflecting on the indicators that have been canvassed during this debate and during many of the discussions and reports in recent times, I think they themselves make you seriously concerned about the quality of this debate.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Government senators highlight changes in employment, but we have seen opinion pieces and articles, time after time now, highlighting the fact that it is not just employment itself but also the quality of employment that is very critical to women. If they cannot balance their work and family lives with employment that is suitable and that fits their needs, the problems facing women will continue. Many indicators suggest that, if anything, those problems have been becoming worse. This government’s mantra about flexibility in employment has really been about employer prerogative and flexibility for the employer, rather than women being able to make more appropriate choices about how they combine work and family.</para>
<para>This is why new catchphrases such as ‘baby strike’ have arisen. Why can’t we encourage young women these days to have children? Because our society is not providing them with the wherewithal to be able to do so. This is what is getting worse for the vast majority of Australian women. It is one thing for the government to talk about the number of women ambassadors and women in senior government appointments, but we need to look at the issues that the vast majority of Australian women face. The vast majority of the Australian women who work in the corporations that Senator Patterson highlighted today have made little, if any, progress in the representation of women within their ranks. The vast majority of Australian women do continue to suffer a significant wages gap.</para>
<para>During question time today I asked Senator Patterson and Senator Abetz if they would provide the indicator they were relying on for their claims that the wages gap was improving, because I am very clear and very sure that indicators measuring the deregulated enterprise bargaining that occurred under the Howard government were highlighting that the wages gap was going backwards. Like many commentators in this area, I am aware that there are many indicators of the wages gap. You need to carefully and quite analytically eliminate the factors from those indicators to know exactly what you are talking about. Senator Abetz stumbled for a while and then came up with the indicator he had actually been given so that we could at least trace the source of the particular indicator he was relying on.</para>
<para>His flippant disregard for the issue in referring to me as a ‘quota girl’ amused me significantly. I came into this place as the only female Labor representative from Victoria. I am very pleased that today that situation has changed significantly. But I did not come here as a quota girl. There were no quotas in relation to our parliamentary representation. I think that flippant remarks by Senator Abetz about such things discredit the whole day. Today is the day to celebrate International Women’s Day. It is not the day to have banal arguments about whether quotas are targets or targets are quotas or how we can ensure that appropriate representation of women is achieved in this place.</para>
<para>We are doing much better in parliament. Senator Patterson raised that point today. We are doing much better through a variety of different means and they seem to be working across political parties. I will be pleased to see that, in another generation or two, women will be much better represented, and they will be represented with a solid base and background in political participation within their parties that will make a difference to the policies we make in this place. They are the bases that have been established. That is what the work on International Women’s Day has been able to achieve.</para>
<para>Later this year I will be celebrating what I think Senator Faulkner alluded to in his notice of motion as the 30th year of International Women’s Day. Some of us have a careful and close regard for many of the indicators of women’s participation and involvement in society and the community and of their general wellbeing. The quality of the debate that has occurred here today, I must say, is insulting. It would be good to see a clear and frank discussion of valid indicators about women’s progress, not the flippant disregard that occurred in the discussion in question time today.</para>

<para>—It was interesting to hear comments on the quality of debate from the other side. In fact, the material which Senator Patterson in particular put on the record in question time this afternoon, and to which I will refer in this debate, is relevant to precisely the sorts of people to which Senator Collins was referring. I note in passing that Senator Collins is keen to assure the chamber that she did not enter the parliament under any arrangement concerning quotas or targets or both of the above. I am sure it is important to note that for the record. But it is undeniable that those opposite in the Australian Labor Party do support a quota system that is not supported on this side of the parliament. If senators on the other side want to walk away from that now then perhaps that is an internal party matter they want to pursue. But it is a matter of fact and a matter of record that that is an arrangement in that party’s organisation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What I want to say this afternoon is that this government, for its entire term since 1996, has supported a policy of both opportunity and choice for women, and for precisely the sorts of women to whom Senator Collins referred. We are committed to providing a range of measures that assist women in all of the roles that they fulfil as they move through their lives. That is part of recognising that there are different needs in relation to education, families, work and retirement, all at different points in their lives and all at different levels of the community. We well know, over the last perhaps 18 months to two years, the extent of the debate in the community about the challenges of balancing work and family life, trying to determine where the balance actually lies, working out it means to be in a partnership trying to do that and all of those sorts of issues. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and particularly the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, have done some exceptional work in this regard. I think a number of members of the Senate have had an opportunity to examine that.</para>
<para>I will now look at some of the fundamentals that people need in order to work through their lives and deal with some of those issues. I will start with child care. In pure financial terms this government has spent and continues to spend more on child care than any of our predecessor Labor governments ever did. In fact, in the six years to 2003-04, that amounted to around $8.8 billion in child care in this country. I remember very early in my role in the Senate participating in a community affairs inquiry into child care, where changes which were proposed by the coalition government were meant to bring an end to child care as we know it. That was clearly not the case.</para>
<para>Clearly there are ongoing challenges. We addressed those in a number of our election policies last year. Those were election policies which the Australian constituency decided they preferred over the election policies presented in this area by the other side. We use the family tax benefit to assist families with children. Around two million families in Australia, who have 3.5 million of Australia’s children, benefit from that family tax benefit. Changes introduced in the 2004‑05 budget will enhance the level of support that is provided to most of those families. For example, there was the lump sum payment of $600 per child, which has been paid to families who receive or are eligible to receive family tax benefit A. There will be an ongoing $600 increase in the level of family tax benefit A payment per child. Also, from 1 July this year, secondary income earners who return to work after caring for a child will be able to keep the family tax benefit B received prior to their return to the work force. They are just a couple of examples. The chamber today discussed support for new mothers in the maternity payment of $3,000, which was introduced on 1 July last year. That payment assists with the costs associated with the birth or adoption of a new baby. That rate will increase from 1 July 2008.</para>
<para>Senator Humphries referred comprehensively to the participation of women in the work force as well. The government also pursues transition to work services particularly for parents, carers and mature aged people—overwhelmingly women, in this case—who want to return to or join the work force. That gives people guidance on possible career directions as well as help in areas like skill assessments, confidence and self-esteem issues. Whether it is career and training plans, information technology or access to training, it is all fundamental support for women who wish to continue in or return to the work force. They are baseline, important levels of support for people trying to achieve that family-work-life balance that we talked about. There is also a number of initiatives in relation to leadership. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—One of the phrases that often gets thrown around in debates like this is the ‘gender gap’, particularly in relation to issues to do with wage levels. One of the other gaps that is relevant to this debate is the gap between the rhetoric and the reality—the rhetoric of the government, which we have just heard two of the speakers from the government engage in, and the reality of what is facing workers in this country, particularly those who are low paid, those who are under awards and those who are relying on the minimum wage. In many of those cases they are women workers.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Senator Payne rattled off statistics about what this government has supposedly done to assist women to rejoin the work force as a matter of choice. The reality is that for many women it is not a matter of choice; it has become a matter of absolute necessity. In some cases they have had to return to the work force earlier than they would have otherwise wanted to because of the economic pressure, the financial pressure, on their families. Clearly, we all support choice, but it should be a choice that is able to be entered into freely, not one that is forced upon families, as we have increasingly seen under this government. The government talks about low interest rates. What it fails to mention is that if you look at the proportion of household income that has to be paid today on a home loan you will see that it has gone up substantially. That is also the case if you look at levels of credit card debt and at the pressures on families right across the board.</para>
<para>Senator Payne referred to what the government has done with the payment of the $600 baby bonus and the other announcements that were made prior to the election last year—the election bribery that it engaged in. What we know is that there are thousands and thousands of families across this country who have been hit with debts from Centrelink for the last two or three years because of the policies followed by this government. Many cases were drawn to my attention and to the attention of other members of parliament. Mothers were ringing up our offices saying, ‘I’ve just got this bill from Centrelink to repay a large amount of the family allowance.’ Those women were not ringing up to give plaudits to the government for their supposed assistance to them. They were very critical of the extreme financial pressure that they were facing.</para>
<para>I want to turn to one critical aspect of this whole debate, and that is the role of the minimum wage and this government’s approach. We have heard in recent times Minister Andrews, the Prime Minister and others talking up how, once they get control of this chamber, they are going to ram through their industrial relations policies, such as getting rid of the unfair dismissal laws. When you have a work force in this country, many of them women, who are in low-paid jobs, in casual employment—the vast majority are in casual employment—one of the only protections they have under the industrial relations system in this country is against unfair dismissal. That is going to disappear under this government after July.</para>
<para>One of the other protections they have is the right to an award rate of pay, a minimum rate of pay. I have had some experience of this, as have my colleagues Senator George Campbell and Senator Sherry in previous careers: going before the Industrial Relations Commission, the independent umpire, and arguing for national wage increases, for increases in the minimum wage, for workers under awards. What I recall is that time after time, for year after year, the conservatives, the coalition parties, opposed every single one of those national wage increases. I recall the Treasurer, Mr Costello, then an advocate for the National Farmers Federation, getting up and opposing superannuation for award workers in this country, for many of the women and men on basic award rates of pay. He said that they were not entitled to superannuation, and now we hear this government trying to take the credit for increased superannuation coverage for workers. It was a Labor government that introduced it and it was coalition governments in the states and federally under Malcolm Fraser and subsequently under John Howard that opposed that time and time again. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The matter I wish to raise in the context of this debate is indeed covered by the take note of answers motion that the Labor Party has moved. I wish to refer specifically to the issue of the maternity payment, which has been mentioned by a couple of speakers in this debate, but before I do I want to wish my female colleagues and all women in Australia a happy International Women’s Day.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We have had many debates about the maternity payment in this place. Honourable senators would be aware of the Democrat preference for a system of national, government funded, paid maternity leave, preferably for 14 weeks, as is the ILO standard, and certainly, under the bill that I have proposed, at at least the minimum rate. In the context of today’s debate and a question that I asked the minister—and that is relevant to International Women’s Day—is the fact that adoptive parents are not entitled to access the maternity payment if they adopt children who are older than 26 weeks. I do not mean to reflect upon a decision or a vote of the Senate, because we know that this debate was in full fling last night, but the government—and I commend them, as I did the minister today in question time—have ensured that adoptive parents can now access the baby bonus, albeit retrospectively. The baby bonus has been replaced by the maternity payment, but the same changes have not been made. That means that we still have a situation where adoptive parents are discriminated against unfairly because they cannot access the maternity payment if their child is more than 26 weeks old.</para>
<para>I asked about this issue today in question time. A number of senators have commented on the issue of the maternity payment, but I want to draw the Senate’s attention to one blatant, discriminatory fact. If you are an adoptive parent in Australia today and you adopt a child of more than 26 weeks you cannot get that vital government financial support to which you should be entitled and, indeed, to which, as of last night, you would have been entitled if it had been the baby bonus. I know it gets confusing, but that is what happens when you are dealing with retrospectivity in legislation and when the government makes poor policy changes even when it has been forewarned of such an issue.</para>
<para>I put on record today the fact that this is discriminatory and the fact that most adoptions that take place, particularly those from overseas, are of children of more than 26 weeks of age. I call again on the government and specifically the Minister for Family and Community Services to rectify this problem with the maternity payment, as they did last night for the baby bonus. I do thank Minister Coonan for her work on this issue.</para>
<para>International Women’s Day generally is a great opportunity for us to acknowledge how far we have come, and I do not deny that. Both major parties in this place talk about the achievements, but we also need to talk about and assess the campaigns that we have left to fight. There are a number of outstanding issues in society today confronting women. Yes, industrial relations reform is one of them. Yes, the gender wage gap, to which Senator Forshaw referred, is another—the inequity in terms of pay rates; the unequal pay rates for men and women for the same work.</para>
<para>Domestic violence is an outstanding issue. Unfortunately, the Partnerships Against Domestic Violence program is due to run out in the middle of this year. I have heard no reports that it will be replaced or continued. I have looked at the forward estimates in relation to the National Initiative to Combat Sexual Assault and I cannot see that funding being anything but halved in future years. We have a range of issues, not the least of which is paternity and maternity leave. Let us not pretend that fobbing Australian women off with a $3,000 one-off payment is actually going to address the systematic disadvantage that women have in the work force—that is, women wanting to take time off at the birth of a child.</para>
<para>There are many other issues affecting Australian women. They are the ones we should be debating and discussing today in addition to celebrating our goals and achievements. I look forward to the day when we have better and perhaps proportional representation of women not just in this place but in executive power as well. I once again call on the government to end this blatant discrimination against adoptive parents with children over 26 weeks of age.</para>

<para class="block">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned shows:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>Our concern that Australia is now one of only two OECD countries without a national scheme of paid maternity leave;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Our concern about the two-thirds of Australian working women who currently lack any paid support on the birth of a child;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Our strong support for the adoption of a national scheme of paid maternity leave for Australian working women at the earliest opportunity;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Our belief that paid maternity leave is an employment-related measure that recognises, first and foremost, the benefits of at least 14 weeks paid leave for working mothers, their children and their families, along with its contribution to equal opportunity at work, productivity, and women’s employment security and attachment.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">Your Petitioners request that the Senate should at the earliest opportunity pass legislation to provide a national system of paid maternity leave which recognises the principles of ILO Convention 183, and provides at least a 14 week payment for working women at the level of their normal earnings (or at least at the minimum wage), with minimal exclusions of any class of women, and a significant contribution from Government.</para>

<para>—It is International Women’s Day today. Many women are wearing the colours of green, white and violet to symbolise the achievements of women and to send a message to governments—not just here in Australia, but everywhere—that women’s issues matter. Today I would like to focus my comments on the lack of respect accorded to Australian women by this government which has been demonstrated in many ways, not least by its failure to address the needs of working women.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>At present, women are paid over $16,000 less per year than men. That is the difference when we compare the total average wage of men and women. On average, women working full time are paid 15 per cent less than men working full time—earning an average of $150 less. Only about 12 per cent of women workers were able to benefit from the tax cuts which went to those earning over $52,000. Women form the majority of low paid and casual workers. Nearly 1.2 million women workers are in casual work, which means that they have no access to paid leave to look after families and no security of employment to offer as collateral—for example, for a housing loan.</para>
<para>The Howard government’s proposed industrial relations measures which it will force through the parliament after the July Senate changes are of enormous concern to women. We have already been given warning of the government’s punitive and merciless approach to low paid workers, most of them women, in its proposed—and I have to say cynically titled—Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting the Low Paid) Bill 2003. Now the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and its role in setting minimum wages is under attack by the government. We know that the Howard government has done woefully little to support working women and working parents. The government has signalled its disdain for the needs of working families and of the importance of family friendly workplaces.</para>
<para>At the recent federal election, the government did not even bother to put forward a work and family policy. Work and family issues appear to be beyond the comprehension of this government, despite the degree of lip-service that they endlessly repeat in defence of their poor policies. The evidence is certainly there: the Howard government have systematically white-anted the child-care programs that were built up under Labor, thereby reducing access to and the availability of quality child care. Working parents are meant to be accorded a higher priority for child-care places than nonworking parents but the Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows that the parents of 174,500 children cannot find the child-care services that they require—that they need. So the government have chosen consistently to ignore the needs of working parents for quality community based care.</para>
<para>The Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, is presently highlighting the pressures posed by the modern reality of paid work and family commitments and has warned that these pressures may well be the reason that fertility rates in Australia are at risk. These are very real issues and they are always ignored by the largely male right wing lobby group which likes to periodically raise the issue of abortion and suggest various methods of ‘punishment’ such as the abolition of Medicare funding, prolonged counselling and other penalties which might serve to deter or prevent women from having legal abortions. Don’t they realise that they are tackling the problem at the wrong end? Instead of applying financial penalties to women after an abortion, this government should in the first instance acknowledge women’s choice and seek actively to recognise the very real concerns, financial and other, that can force women to the decision to have an abortion.</para>
<para>Two years ago the issue of maternity leave in Australia received a great deal of attention, although not a lot of it by this government. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner then pointed out:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The absence of a national scheme [of paid maternity leave] means that Australian women will continue to return to work early and leave their children early, hardly in step with a so-called family-focused nation such as ours. Meanwhile women in all other OECD countries, except the United States, are able to remain at home for at least those first ... months.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Sex Discrimination Commissioner said that it is the responsibility of the government to provide a comparable maternity leave scheme to those in other OECD countries, and urged this country ‘to commit to a national scheme of paid maternity leave as soon as possible’. Yet, despite the government’s alternative scheme of the maternity allowance to be phased in over some years, Australia’s embarrassing reservation to the maternity leave provision of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW, remains.</para>
<para>The government’s disdain of women’s issues has been demonstrated by its downgrading of the Office of the Status of Women—relegated to another department from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and renamed the Office for Women—and by its cavalier approach to the funding of women’s organisations and programs. A prime example has been the campaign to combat violence against women, which has had a sorry history under the Howard government. Delays and lack of commitment have been displayed by the ‘borrowing’ of domestic violence program funding for the terrorism fridge magnets; the last-minute pulling out of the No Respect, No Relationship campaign and its substitution six months later by a watered-down campaign which was more palatable to the Prime Minister’s male advisers; and now the lack of ongoing funding after July 2005, or the failure to date to announce ongoing funding for the Partnerships Against Domestic Violence program.</para>
<para>Indigenous women have been particularly badly served by this government, perhaps especially in its lack of commitment to initiatives to combat Indigenous family violence and to Indigenous health measures. Life expectancy for Indigenous women has actually decreased since 1996 and is now 62.8 years.</para>
<para>In education as well as in employment this government has disadvantaged women. In the science and mathematics fields women continue to battle against systems which traditionally enrol or employ far more males than females. In New South Wales a 2002 discussion paper on the placement process for selective high schools revealed that, of the students who applied, girls had a far lower acceptance rate than boys—19 per cent of the girls who applied were accepted as opposed to 24 per cent of the boys who applied. In Victoria selective high schools cater for about 32 per cent more boys than girls. Insufficient TAFE places have meant that about 20,000 women miss out on TAFE courses each year. We are desperately short of nurses and teachers, traditionally professions which have attracted women, yet thousands of students have failed to gain places in nursing and teacher training courses.</para>
<para>It is not surprising then that the research report on women’s lives, which was released today by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women’s Issues finds that women in general have become increasingly unhappy, lonely and unhealthy. Helen Kelleher, convenor of the Australian Women’s Health Network, pointed to the demands made on women, especially those who are sole parents. These women, she said, have ‘many, many things on their minds in terms of raising children and juggling custody issues, managing paid work and perhaps trying to further their education’.</para>
<para>Many of the gains which were made in the status of women’s issues to 1996 have been eroded by the coalition government since that time. The Howard government will not be able to continue to try to camouflage or talk around the deterioration of the living standards of women and families. Whilst I am yet to read the report which was released today entitled <inline font-style="italic">Women in Australia 2004</inline>, it is very clear that the numbers expressed in that document show a very disturbing picture of the trend. From my perspective, from having talked to my constituents and women around the country, that is their experience. Life is getting more difficult to handle, particularly with respect to the balance of work and family. Those pressures are getting greater. Certainly the prospect of relieving some of that pressure under the Howard government is nonexistent.</para>
<para>On a more personal note, I would like to dedicate today’s International Women’s Day to grandmothers. I would like to acknowledge the care that they have provided to their families, their children and their grandchildren for all their lives. I would also like to acknowledge those who continue to provide care for grandmothers as well. They are very special people in my heart, and my thoughts are with both of my grandmothers today.</para>

<para>—I am very pleased to rise today to speak on this matter of public importance largely because I consider that for women, in the continuum of time since their opportunities really began to open up—after, let us say, the mid-1950s—the present eight or nine years of the Howard government have been a time of opportunity and choice, which continues to expand. No-one denies that women play many roles as they move though their life span. They have different needs at different times of their lives, according to education, family, work and retirement. Certainly government policies, insofar as they can, under this government have endeavoured to provide help to women and families at various stages.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Addressing point (a), the decline in women’s wages compared with men’s wages, I would point out that under the coalition, since 1996, full-time adult ordinary time earnings for women have increased in real terms—that is, after taking account of inflation—by $152 per week. This is a 21 per cent real increase and represents an annual rate of growth in real earnings of 2.2 per cent. Over this period, average weekly earnings for females have grown by more than 35 per cent compared with 34 per cent for men. While it is correct that the absolute gap between male and female earnings over this period has increased, the relativity of female earnings to male earnings has improved. It is important that these figures be viewed in the context of the prevalence of part-time working arrangements for women. Many women prefer part-time employment as it suits their domestic arrangements and they are able to fit in with their partner, their children and any other commitments they have, such as caring for elderly parents. Forty five per cent of female employment is part time compared to 15 per cent for men.</para>
<para>Contrasting that with the situation under the previous Labor government, women’s real earnings grew at an annual rate of just 0.6 per cent. The claim made by Senator Lundy that women’s earnings grew annually by 5.9 per cent under Labor and 4.6 per cent under the coalition are not about the rate of earnings; they are claims about the rate of inflation. In contrast to these claims, we need to consider the very real gains that have been made by women under this government.</para>
<para>Effective marginal tax rates may act as a barrier to increasing the participation of women and sole parents. The level of tax rates is not the only barrier to participation. But, if we are to consider tax rates, it would be well known to every Australian voter that prior to the A New Tax System, introduced by this government in 1998, many families were facing a marginal tax rate of 34c in the dollar and family payment withdrawal rates of 50c in the dollar. This government has significantly cut taxes through three stages of personal income tax cuts, which have benefited women along with everybody else.</para>
<para>On 1 July 2000, we introduced A New Tax System, which represented a major restructuring of the Australian tax system. It continued in the 2003-04 budget, with tax thresholds being further adjusted. The 2004-05 budget tax cuts are the third element of our tax reform. We will continue our reform of the income tax scales through increases in the income thresholds at which the top two tax rates start to apply. Over this time, this has meant that around 80 per cent of taxpayers will pay a marginal rate of tax no higher than 30 per cent. We also reduced the taper rate between the maximum and base rate of the family tax benefit to 20 per cent, which reduced effective marginal tax rates for low- to middle-income families. Compared with 1999, effective marginal tax rates for families have fallen from 84 per cent to 50 per cent—a real decrease in anyone’s terms.</para>
<para>As I said, the level of tax rates is not the only barrier to participation. When we look at the help that has been provided for sole parents and the help that we provide with the cost of raising children, around two million families with 3.5 million children have been assisted through the family tax benefit and the vast majority of Australian families with dependent children are now eligible to receive the family tax benefit. Not only is there a lump sum payment of $600 per child to parents eligible to receive it, but there will be an ongoing $600 increase in the level of family tax benefit part A payment per child. Returns from working have increased for many families with a reduction in the taper rate in part A and part B from 30 per cent to 20 per cent from 1 July 2004. From 1 July 2005, secondary income earners who return to work after caring for a child will be able to keep the family tax benefit part B that was received prior to their return to the work force. If that is not helping to increase participation rates, I would like to know what is—because more families will be able to keep more of their assistance as their family earnings increase, more families have become eligible for family tax benefit, and the family tax benefit part B income threshold has been increased so that secondary earners are now able to earn more income before their income affects their family tax benefit entitlement and they lose their family tax benefit part B entitlement. We are committed to increasing the maximum rate of family tax benefit part B by $300 from July 2005.</para>
<para>Tax rates are nondiscriminatory and it is important that women’s participation in the work force is increasing. In 1996, 49.6 per cent of Australian women were in employment. That figure has now risen to 53.6 per cent, with the strong growth of our economy. Since 1996, 479,300 jobs have been created, of which 339,000 are full-time, which reflects the diversity of the aspirations of Australian women. That equates to more than half the total number of created jobs. Not only that, but there has been remarkable growth in the employment of older women.</para>
<para>The proportion of 55- to 59-year-old women in paid work has risen from around 39 per cent to over 52 per cent in just over eight years, and even stronger growth has been achieved by women aged 60 to 64 years. With the ageing of the population, it is very important that older workers who want to stay in their jobs can do so to boost their retirement savings, and it is very gratifying to see that employers are accepting that older workers are able to stay on at their jobs. Transition to Work services have also helped those women who want to go back to work after raising their family to go back to work, and participants receive help and guidance on possible career directions.</para>
<para>So we have more jobs, higher earnings, better support for families and a tax system that allows Australians to retain more of the fruits of their labour. Surely this is about achieving a better balance between work and family. I do not have time to cover it in any great detail, but I do assure the Senate that access to and the affordability of child care has increased remarkably since the coalition came to office. Not only have we provided a better child-care rebate, we have provided extra help, such as extra outside school hours care places, more family day care places and generally increased child-care services—from 7,932 to 10,126, up 28 per cent.</para>
<para>I am delighted to say that the position of women has improved remarkably in that 50 year continuum that I spoke about, and many women these days are delighted at the choice they have, not only of occupation but also of the way they structure their family and work responsibilities. That has been provided by their own very hard-working endeavours and, to some extent, the far-sighted policies of this government, which has continued to give women a very fair go.</para>

<para>—I am very pleased on this International Women’s Day to speak on the matter of public importance put before the Senate by Senator Lundy. It gives us the opportunity to address some of the important issues and barriers facing Australian women at this time. International Women’s Day is obviously a day on which we celebrate the achievements of women in Australia and around the world and also recognise what is yet to be done both in Australia and around the world. I want to talk very briefly today about the issue of the government’s broader economic agenda across a range of portfolio areas and the way it has a differential gender impact. I want to talk about the government’s economic agenda and show, in some areas particularly, how it negatively impacts on women. The first point is in the area of their industrial relations reform.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We had, one might say, a rare moment of honesty from Senator Troeth, who acknowledged that in absolute terms there had been an increase in the differential between men’s and women’s pay. That is the case. It is the case in this country that in all the years since the original Industrial Relations Commission’s decision on equal pay in 1972—when some of us were not even at school and many of us were doing very different things to what we are doing now—we are still in the situation where Australian women earn on average $150 a week less than men. We know that Australia has done relatively well, despite the fact that in 2005 women still lag significantly behind their male fellow citizens. We know that one of the reasons why Australia has been able to address the gap between male and female earnings is our centralised wage fixation system. The fact is that if you look at where people are employed in Australia—in which sectors they are employed—women remain vastly overrepresented in low-paid jobs and part-time and casual employment, and that is one of the reasons why women’s earnings are not as good relative to men’s.</para>
<para>Of course, for women in those low-paid areas one of the main ways, and often the primary and only way, in which they get wage increases is through adjustments to award minimum wages. That is one of the primary ways in which the women of this country in low-paid work actually get better wages and conditions. So when this government talks about stripping away awards, when it starts to question the basis of the minimum wage, we should understand that it is talking about removing one of the mechanisms which has improved gender equity in this country. We should understand it is talking about removing institutions, laws and a regulatory framework which has advantaged women in Australia—particularly low-paid women and women with little economic clout. That is the effect of many of the government’s industrial relations reforms.</para>
<para>I also want to talk briefly in the time that I have allotted about the issue of work force participation, but first I will mention the issue of effective marginal tax rates. This is a particular issue for women. Women on various welfare benefits who move from the benefit into work often face very punishing effective marginal tax rates. These EMTRs sap the incentive to work, punish people for earning and clearly act as a barrier to the move from welfare to work, and this has particular relevance to women. This is not a new discussion. This is a discussion that has been had for many years. It is well documented that when you move off a benefit into part-time work you face very high effective marginal tax rates and in some situations it is in fact financially—in the short term, at least—less beneficial to move into work than to stay on your benefit. This is an issue the government has talked about for a long time. It has done very little to address these issues.</para>
<para>I note that when Minister Dutton, who is the Minister for Workforce Participation, gave a rather discursive interview on the priorities in his area in December last year he said that he was ‘keen to boost training opportunities for mothers returning to work’—and I will come to that later, given what has been recently announced and what Minister Abetz said to the Senate in question time. Minister Dutton also said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We’ve got disincentives for middle-income earners in terms of childcare costs and effective tax rates ... We want to make sure we have a system that provides choices for parents—to stay at home and a choice to make it financially rewarding to return to work.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words, let us address the issue of the child-care supply problem, let us address the issue of child-care affordability and let us also address the effective marginal tax rates, which act as a barrier for the move from welfare to work.</para>
<para>As the Reserve Bank outlined earlier this month, welfare and tax reform have to be high on the economic agenda. The Governor of the Reserve Bank indicated that they are having an effect on labour force participation and, in his words, ‘they are holding our levels of participation down’. We say that is absolutely obvious to anybody who looks at those tax rates. That has a particular impact on women. This issue of the EMTRs has been so well documented over the nine years of this government as to have become notorious.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, although reform has been floated and promised and discussed we have had very little action. We have had very little reform. In fact, even with all the welfare to work policy leaks that the government engaged in prior to their cabinet strategy meeting where they discussed the work and welfare issues, it was clear that the government is again going to squib on trying to reform our tax and welfare system so as to move these marginal tax rates which act as a barrier to moving into the work force. I could be wrong. Minister Dutton or Minister Andrews may in fact announce a proper welfare reform policy that actually deals with some of these disincentives. But from what we have seen in the paper in the leaks that have come from the government it does not appear that this is high on the agenda.</para>
<para>We can say what is high on the agenda: coercion—the stick without much carrot. That is demonstrated across a range of areas but most relevantly today it is demonstrated in the area of sole parents. I said earlier that Minister Dutton said that training opportunities were one thing that he wanted to ensure were provided. That was a priority for him. What is the government’s plan so far for sole parents, the majority of whom are women? What is the government doing to actually support and encourage sole parents back into the work force? What are they doing to invest in the capacity of these sole parents—most of whom are women, although some are men—to engage in the work force? What we have so far is a program along the lines of Work for the Dole that has no mandated training component and which would require participation. People would participate in it but would not necessarily get trained.</para>
<para>If you recall, when Senator Abetz was asked about this issue today in question time he barely knew what was being discussed. He represents the Minister for Workforce Participation and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. This is a pilot that is being run out of that portfolio. I do not recall the minister in his answer mentioning any training that was going to be provided to sole parents who were prepared to participate in that pilot. Yet again, we see the government not being prepared to invest in sole parents. As I said, many of these people are women. If we are going to be serious about giving lone parents, the majority of whom are women, the skills and the capacity to move off welfare into work so that their futures and the futures of their families are better, we have to invest in supporting them. We have to invest in skills development, training and child care so as to ensure that women who want to engage in training or work and who are sole parents have access to affordable child care. Frankly, it is ludicrous to think that the position of many of these women will be improved simply by making it more difficult for them to continue to access the sole parent benefit without also investing in what they require in order to move from welfare to work.</para>

<para>—I apologise for not being here for the call earlier. I was outside at the women’s afternoon tea. The government have argued here in the chamber today that they have done great things for women since 1996, citing increased employment and a slight increase in average weekly earnings. Yet we all know that there remains a significant wage gap between men and women in Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We still have one of the lowest female workplace participation rates in the OECD. Discrimination in the workplace based on pregnancy has increased. Australia is one of only two OECD countries without government funded paid maternity leave. Women continue to be underrepresented in senior positions, on boards and in politics and women as single parents and mature age women face very high levels of poverty. Australia has one of the lowest female work force participation rates in the OECD. A recent OECD report found that full-time participation for women aged between 25 and 54 in Australia was 20 per cent below the OECD average. That report also found that Australia has some of the least family friendly policies for working mothers in the developed world.</para>
<para>Improving women’s wages to close the gender pay gap is fundamental to women’s equality, since it increases women’s labour market attachment, financial independence and life choices. When we compare the full-time ordinary time earnings—which excludes overtime—on average women are paid 15 per cent less than men. Taking into account inflation, this gap has been reduced by a measly two per cent since 1996. The government has recently signalled changes to the industrial relations system, which we say could threaten the small closure of the gender pay gap and perhaps do worse. Both the Victorian and Western Australian state governments have undertaken a review of the gender pay gap. It is imperative that the federal government also initiates an inquiry into the gender pay gap which should consider closely their proposed workplace relations changes.</para>
<para>High effective tax rates also act as a disincentive to women entering the work force. Returning to work or taking on additional work results in some benefits being withdrawn and, together with the loss of health benefits and other concessions, the high effective marginal tax rate actually presents a disincentive to work, particularly when accompanied by high child-care costs. It impacts on single women but the highest proportion of income is lost by second earners in low-wage families—typically partnered women returning to work after having a child.</para>
<para>The impact of high effective marginal tax rates is that sole parents lose about 40 per cent of their earned income in taxes and benefits, and low-wage families lose almost 70 per cent—more than twice the amount of a high wage-earning family. The solution lies in not only welfare reform but also tax and labour market reform. On the one hand, the tax-free threshold, currently set at $6,000, is far too low. The Democrats argue there is a good case for raising it to $10,000 in order to boost low wage earners’ take-home pay. At the same time, the labour market needs to be overhauled to improve employment prospects for women.</para>
<para>Lack of child care is also a barrier to work force participation. In March 2004, more than 160,000 women were interested in working but had not looked for work because of a lack of access to affordable child care. The crises in child care are fourfold: shortage of places, funding, cost and wages. Child-care costs have increased 32 per cent over the past two years—more than six times the rate of inflation and around six times the rate of increase in government child-care benefits. The government’s lack of action in providing affordable and accessible child care is very obvious, with the demand for child care still running at unprecedented levels of unmet need.</para>
<para>Trying to find child care for babies aged two years and younger can be a nightmare for many parents who find themselves on long waiting lists. Of course, even if a spot does become available it may not suit the parents’ work hours, or it may require additional travel, meaning that children have to stay in child care longer to take into account additional travel time. In my home state, I recently met with a local group in the Port Phillip area who are campaigning for more child-care places. There, 1,600 children are waiting for places, and centres have closed down in inner Melbourne because of real estate values. There is much more profit in housing development than there is in child care. Affordable, quality child care is vital for women when making work and family choices. Instead of paying baby bonuses to wealthy stay-at-home mothers, we say that this government should invest in affordable and available out-of-school-hours care and vacation care for Australian children to enable women to participate equally.</para>
<para>In addition to the issues I have already mentioned, the government should also legislate for family friendly workplace practices, like enabling women to convert full-time jobs to part time once they return to the workplace after having children; introducing government-funded paid maternity leave at 14 weeks, paid at the minimum wage; and eliminating violence against women. All of these things impact on women’s workplace participation, financial independence and life choices.</para>

<para>—I remember what I was doing on the first International Women’s Day. I lived in Sydney, I had an outdoor toilet that had no light and lots of spiders, and my children were frightened by the spiders. So I fumigated the toilet, painted it and set up a new candleholder in it. That is how I spent my first International Women’s Day, but I do remember thinking at the time: this is my choice and isn’t it great that I have the choice? So, on this very significant day for women throughout the world, the question has to be asked: why are the Labor opposition refusing to look at the facts that are important to Australian women, whatever they are doing today or any other day? Our government have a policy of opportunity and, importantly, of choice for Australian women, and we remain strongly committed to policies that assist women in the myriad of roles that they fulfil throughout their lives.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Contrary to Senator Lundy’s suggestion of a decline in women’s wages compared with those of men, there has in fact been a real increase. Why does Senator Lundy continue to perpetrate untruths? Since our election in 1996, female total average weekly earnings have risen from around $450 to around $610, as at December 2004. Over this period, average weekly earnings for women have grown by more than 35 per cent. This compares to around 34 per cent for males. Senator Lundy, why don’t you want to celebrate these achievements on International Women’s Day today?</para>
<para>There has also been a dramatic increase in the number of women who choose to work part time—a choice that I was making on International Women’s Day 30 years ago. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of women who choose to work part time. They go to work when their children go to school, and they are home when the children come home. What a choice they make—and what a choice they are able to make. In fact, around 45 per cent of female employment is part time, compared with only 15 per cent of male employment. For many of those women, it is a choice that they are making. They do not want to work full time.</para>
<para>In addition, women’s earnings have increased as a proportion of men’s earnings, rising from about 83 per cent in February 1996 to almost 85 per cent today. This gap continues to close under this government. The claim that Senator Lundy has made, that women’s earnings grew annually by 5.9 per cent under Labor and 4.6 per cent under the coalition, is not a claim about the rate of earnings. On the contrary, it is a claim about the rate of inflation in Australia. Once Labor’s record on inflation and escalating prices is taken into account, the figure of 5.9 per cent which is claimed by the opposition shrinks to an amazing 0.6 per cent. What a disgraceful record for women in the Labor Party.</para>
<para>The recent unemployment figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveal even more good news for women on this very special day. In my home state of South Australia, the Labor Minister for the Status of Women, the Hon. Stephanie Key, trumpeted the fact that the trend in the unemployment rate for women in South Australia fell below five per cent to 4.9 per cent in January 2005, and this put the unemployment rate for women in South Australia below the national average of 5.2 per cent. Of course, this figure, which is very good news for South Australian women, is in no way due to anything but the strong economy that the Howard government has presided over since its election. It is something that Senator Lundy’s state colleagues are only too happy to claim the credit for in South Australia. Perhaps Stephanie Key should pick up the phone and celebrate South Australia’s great record in employment with Senator Lundy.</para>
<para>But wait, there is even more good news for women today. Women’s participation in the work force has also risen with the Howard government’s election in 1996, when 49.6 per cent of Australian women were employed. With the strong growth in the Australian economy, this has risen to a clear majority of Australian women at work, with the figure currently standing at 53.6 per cent. That represents thousands of women re-entering the work force. Importantly, there has been significant growth in the employment of older women. According to the latest figures, the proportion of women in the 55- to 59-year-old age bracket in paid work has risen from 39 per cent to over 52 per cent in just over eight years during the term of the John Howard led government. Even stronger growth has been achieved by women aged 60 to 64 years, where the employment to population ratio for those women has grown from around 18 per cent to over 30 per cent. These figures are particularly pleasing because they show that older women are beginning to achieve financial independence, something that we are all pleased to see.</para>
<para>This government has significantly increased family benefits. Why is this important? Let me tell you. The $19.2 billion More Help for Families package follows upon substantial increases in assistance as part of the new tax system. The reduced family tax benefit, the FTB, and the taper rates applying from 1 July 2004 now allow many families to keep more of their assistance when their incomes increase. Prior to changes under that new tax system, many families faced marginal tax rates of 34c in the dollar and the family tax withdrawal rate stood at 50c in the dollar. This government, our government, the John Howard led government, has significantly cut taxes and in particular significant relief has been provided to all Australians—men, women and families—through the three stages of personal income tax cuts. The 2004-05 budget tax cuts are a third element of tax reform under this government.</para>
<para>Senator Lundy’s criticisms of child care are even more incredible. They would be laughable if they were not tragic.</para>

<para>—Yes, $8.8 billion, Senator Coonan—an extraordinary amount of money and the largest amount of money ever spent by any federal government on child care. In actual dollar terms, in its first six years this government spent more than double, Senator Lundy, on child care than the former Labor government spent in its entire last six years in office. Senator Lundy, you should hang your head in shame. What is Senator Lundy on about? Let us get it straight. The number of government funded child-care places has risen from 306,500 to 561,900, an increase of 83 per cent. That is an extraordinary figure on this important day. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—International Women’s Day is a time to celebrate the achievements of women and there have been many achievements of women, but they have not been achievements of this government. This government has failed to provide a national paid parental leave scheme, leaving Australia as one of only two OECD countries not to have such a scheme. This government has failed to address critical issues in child care: proper planning, affordable care, and decent wages for child-care workers. Instead, it wants to squander public funds on a tax rebate that will give the most funds to those who need it least.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This government has also undermined the Office of the Status of Women and ceased the production of a women’s budget statement. The government has promoted an industrial relations system that under the guise of flexibility has expanded casual work as a substitute for secure work with basic entitlements, prospects for advancement and decent wages. And it is women who are getting these insecure jobs with reduced entitlements. This government believes that those sole parents who are raising young children—as if the struggle to raise young children by themselves is not enough—should have new obligations enforced upon them whilst raising children alone and whilst they are caring for their young children.</para>
<para>Women do the bulk of the unpaid caring work in our society, whether it be looking after ill parents, children or those who are mentally ill or have a mental or physical disability, but we fail as a society to give the kind of support that we should and to recognise the contributions that these women make. The government has underfunded and cut services to public health, education and training, all vital services to women and their families. More and more people on low and middle incomes are being required to pay large payments for services that once were publicly funded. This puts pressure on women trying to manage weekly budgets and restricts their further choices.</para>
<para>We now also have an attack from conservative politicians on one of the most fundamental rights of every woman—that is, the right to control her own fertility. This right is critical to a woman’s health and her ability to control her life. The Prime Minister has failed to discourage this divisive public debate, which can serve no useful purpose other than to encourage those who would deny a woman the right to control her fertility, including the right to terminate a pregnancy. It is an absolutely absurd argument to try to force a woman to continue with a pregnancy she cannot or does not want to continue.</para>
<para>If only there was more to celebrate in this government’s actions. Instead, we are left to celebrate the work of many other millions of women across this country who continue to advocate for these changes, who continue to advocate for the rights of women and who continue to advocate for the government to take seriously their concerns and the issues that impact on their capacity to engage in public life, to engage in the work force and civil society. These issues should and can be addressed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—International Women’s Day does provide us with an opportunity to celebrate the achievements of women in this country. There are certainly many individuals who have achieved great things in this country, particularly women, no doubt and no less—for example, the women from Alice Springs who in the last fortnight won national awards for the outstanding work and contribution they have made to their community. But I think it is also a time for us to reflect on and look at the scorecard for the status of women in this country.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Just a couple of days ago, Minister Patterson tabled in New York a statement on the Beijing Commission on the Status of Women for the 49th session, or, as it is now commonly being called, Beijing Plus 10. It is a three-page document. What I want to do is make some comments about what is not in the document. There are a lot of statements in there that may look and sound fine in print, but if you look at what is not said and peel away some of the rhetoric then we really get to the truth. In the statement that was tabled in New York, this government says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In Australia, we have made significant inroads across the Beijing Platform for Action’s 12 critical areas. … women have the same or better outcomes … in … education and health, and continue to make steady progress …</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is not the case. With regard to education, since 1996 the Howard government have slashed $5 billion from universities, and HECS fees have nearly doubled. Women now attending university will be paying an increase in their HECS debt, and of course, from this year, most of those women will incur a 25 per cent increase in their HECS payments. In last year’s budget there was no increase in funding above indexation for the 2.5 million children in government schools. There were no extra university places and there were no new TAFE places. So there are not enough TAFE or university places for women. In fact, over 20,000 women wanting to undertake further study are turned away each year.</para>
<para>With regard to health, this government has destroyed Medicare and bulk-billing. We know that women use Medicare services 50 per cent more than men, particularly during the years in which they opt to have children. Every year, 600,000 families, a third of them receiving payments from this government, also receive an average debt of $900. If everything was in fact bright and rosy in the garden in terms of women achieving the same or better outcomes in health, why is it then that, since 1996, the life expectancy of Indigenous women in this country has decreased significantly and is now 62.8 years?</para>
<para>This government also says that women’s participation in full-time and part-time employment has increased. Since 1996, the gap between men’s and women’s total average wage has grown by $91 a week. Australia lags behind all other OECD countries by not supporting maternity or paternity leave. The number of women in casual work has increased to 1.2 million, with no access to paid leave to look after their families while they are doing that work. Women’s earnings have significant implications for their immediate and long-term financial security which have not been addressed by this government. We know that 27 per cent of women aged between 25 and 54—the key child-bearing and child-rearing years, as I said—are in casual jobs and that women’s growing participation in the work force has contributed to massive increases in the tax revenue collected by this government. However, only around 12 per cent of women earn more than $52,000, leaving the tax cuts that were promised in last year’s budget out of reach for 90 per cent of working women. That was not said in the Beijing statement.</para>
<para>The statement by this government also says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Australia attaches a high priority to combating domestic violence and sexual assault …</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">and:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Targeting family violence and child protection in Indigenous communities is a key priority.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What a joke! What an absolute joke! This statement does not talk about the $10 million last year that was taken out of money to prevent domestic violence—to pay for the security fridge magnets. This statement does not talk about the botched Partnerships Against Domestic Violence campaign or the No Respect, No Relationship program that was cancelled, rebadged, redesigned and then finally run in a less significant way. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The Labor Party really know no shame. To come in here today and play fast and loose with the truth yet again, on International Women’s Day, is nothing but shameful. But it does not seem to matter to them; as long as I have been here, it has not mattered to them. I want to come back to the actual subjects that were raised by Senator Lundy in this MPI.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>First of all, they claim that the federal government needs to ‘redress the decline in women’s wages compared with men’s over the life of the Howard government’. Just look at the facts, Senator Lundy; it would be a great start, I would put to you. Wages have increased by 21 per cent, at an annual growth rate of 2.2 per cent. Under the Labor Party it was 0.6 per cent. So why on earth would the Labor Party want to come in here and claim that there has been a decline in women’s wages compared with men’s? Women’s earnings as a proportion of men’s earnings have gone up from 83.2 per cent to 84.8 per cent. So, it does not matter which way you look at it: women’s earnings have actually gone up. But the Labor Party will come in here or go outside and say the reverse. It is simply untrue.</para>
<para>Part (2) of Senator Lundy’s MPI is:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">(2) develop a solution to punishing effective marginal tax rates which act as a barrier to increasing the participation of women and sole parents in particular in paid work …</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What a joke for the Labor Party to come in here and have the gall to talk about tax! They are the people who have taxed the living daylights out of every earner. Here we go once again: the facts do not substantiate the claim—</para>

<para>—and they scream like a bunch of banshees over there because they do not like the fact that prior to the new tax changes many families were facing a marginal tax rate of 34c in the dollar and a family payment withdrawal rate of 50c in the dollar. The government has significantly cut taxes. In particular, the government has provided significant tax relief to all Australians in three stages of personal income tax cuts. It is not one, not two but three stages, and the Labor Party come in here and ignore that today. How can they possibly be so blind? Is it any wonder no-one voted for them? But the fact of the matter is that the effective marginal tax rates have gone down, not up.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The third issue that Senator Lundy raised was that the federal government should increase access to affordable child care, and ensure that the supply and cost of child care makes child care available et cetera. Once again, they completely and utterly ignore the facts. The number of Australian government funded child-care places and services has increased, not declined. Child-care places have increased from 306,500 to 561,000, up 83 per cent—a mere 83 per cent—but, as Senator Ferris said a moment ago, the most important statistic that they carefully ignore is that in the six years to 2003-04 around $8.8 billion was spent on child care and that equates to more than double Labor’s spending in their last six years of office. But they come in here and completely ignore the truth. It happens day in and day out.</para>
<para>Let us have a look at women in the work force, for example. Since 1996 full-time adult ordinary time earnings for women have increased in real terms. That is after taking account of inflation. They have increased by $153 a week. The Labor Party would have one think otherwise, but that is a 21 per cent real increase, as I said before, and that represents an annual increase of 2.2 per cent. Looking at women in jobs, since 1996—</para>

They want to come in here and completely misrepresent the facts. Since 1996 women have benefited from the creation of 819,200 new jobs—53 per cent of the total of more than 1.5 million new jobs that have been created by this government.

There are a lot of women out there who have children and family responsibilities who actually want casual work, and the Labor Party cannot understand that. It cannot comprehend it. This additional employment for women is composed of 339,000 full-time jobs—do you want to go out there and repeat that, Senator Crossin?—and 479,300 part-time jobs because that in many cases is exactly what women want. It would be a really pleasant change for the Labor Party to come in here and actually tell the truth about what is happening with women in the work force, what is happening with child care and what is happening with tax rates instead of coming in here with this little litany of fibs.</para>

On the weekend of 31 July to 1 August 2004, the media gave what purported to be accounts of a discussion at a meeting held on Friday evening, 30 July, and the content of the committee’s draft report. Furthermore, at a press conference given the following Monday, three members of the committee distributed a document which included references to the draft chair’s report. For the reasons outlined in this report, summarised at paragraph 1.24, the Committee on Privileges has concluded that it should not find that contempts have occurred. These conclusions are reflected in the finding for which the committee now seeks Senate endorsement. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

<para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">This report comes from a committee that has actually operated in two parts, as a result of the October 2004 election. On 16 July 2004 the Senate resolved to appoint a Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs to report by 31 October 2004. The committee naturally ceased activities upon the end of the 40th Parliament in September 2004 and was reconstituted on 17 November with the terms of references unchanged and a new reporting date of today. There were some amendments to the membership of the committee and we duly continued the work.</para>
<para>This committee is most honoured to have had the opportunity to meet with people across most of Australia to hear their views about what is going to happen or is proposed to happen with changes to Aboriginal affairs in our country. We received over 250 submissions from people who truly cared about these issues and were able to meet with them in public meetings across four states. I want to say this afternoon that, on behalf of the committee, I apologise to those states which we were unable to visit to listen to their concerns because of the tight time frame. However, your voices have been heard. Indeed, a message from our committee must be that the voices must be heard. No longer can Indigenous people in our country feel that when we are talking about the administration of Indigenous affairs they are silent or invisible—a complaint that was made often to our committee.</para>
<para>In terms of the structure of the report, it is in five chapters with a preface. Firstly, we do a background to the whole inquiry—why it was called and how it is going to operate. Chapter 2 is about the evolution of ATSIC and the history of the review and also contains some indication of the disadvantage which everybody agrees Indigenous people live through in our country. There is no disagreement that there is disadvantage and there probably is little disagreement about the need for change, but there is disagreement about how the voices should be heard.</para>
<para>Chapter 3 talks about what is actually happening—the effects of the legislation. In this chapter we make very clear as a committee that in many ways our work has been done. We have legislation coming before this place soon talking about legalities of ATSIC. In reality, the government has already put in place a range of administrative changes which have taken the resources, tasks and projects of ATSIC and mainstreamed them into other government departments. They have also taken the people of ATSIC and spread them out to other government departments and in some cases out of the system altogether. So a real issue is exactly what effects the legislation will have on the community, the government and the way Indigenous affairs are seen across Australia.</para>
<para>Chapter 4 looks at the absolutely key issue of how representation is achieved by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in our country. This caused significant comment and debate across all our submissions and our hearings. There is no right answer, but there is one key point: the Aboriginal people must be part of this process. It is their representation and really should not be imposed in any way by other people who think they know best. Chapter 5 looks at the issue of mainstreaming, which is the core element of the government’s approach to how services will be delivered in the future. We heard from people about the difference between the new mainstreaming and the old mainstreaming. But it is a core issue for everybody to have that leap of trust to ensure that people will have their voices heard, will be part of the delivery of services and will have faith in what is going on. There are 12 recommendations in the report. Not all are agreed.</para>
<para>However, at this stage, I really want to thank the members of the committee, who have been so supportive, so patient and cooperative. I particularly want to thank the secretariat, some of whom are sitting in the gallery this evening. I want to thank Jonathan, Alison, Tim and Ian. Thank you for your help and support. Maybe now we will be able to achieve what Alison Anderson, ATSIC commissioner, hoped for, which was to have real representation. But her real concern was that, ‘Once again, we may be experimented on and that in another five to 10 years we will come back and discuss exactly what went wrong.’</para>

<para>—Briefly, in the five minutes that I have been allotted, I want to address some of the misconceptions that are bound up in the majority report. I found it very much a disturbing event to some extent to be swept up in the political charade of the clayton’s report that has been put before the Senate on this occasion. Indeed, the minority report sets out all of the shortcomings. Before I get into the report, may I congratulate the chair on a very fine job. I believe it is the first select committee Senator Moore has chaired, and I thought she did a magnificent job. It is a pity that those around her and supporting her have taken the report and used it for crass political purposes, because I believe that the matter of Indigenous affairs should always be above politics. We should strive as hard and as long as is necessary to have a bipartisan approach to what are some of the most crucially difficult issues confronting public policy and governance in Australia today.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This report contains a broad number of complete misconceptions. What we found when we went out to Alice Springs, Queensland and New South Wales—in all of the places that I attended—was a lethargy, a complete lack of upset and lack of passion with respect to the decline and the abolition of ATSIC as is proposed by the government’s legislation. I was expecting that there would be outrage or some degree of aggression towards the legislation, but, no, the opposite was the case. The constituency of ATSIC has been let down and indeed it has lain dormant for much longer than I now understand it should have.</para>
<para>This Labor framework of 1989 has, in fact, been one of the most monumental public policy failures this country has ever seen. It has delivered a system of representation to Aboriginal people on a maximum of 20 per cent of the vote. That is how representative ATSIC was at the end. When I found out the salaries and wages of ATSIC commissioners, I thought to myself, gee, I know a lot of people out in the bush in Western Australia who could really use some good water, a bit of good medicine, some transportation and some telecommunications on the sort of money that those people are receiving. At the end of the day, when we went to Alice Springs, there was simply a sense of relief that ATSIC had gone. I was in fact surprised and, I must say, the sense I came away with after listening to these people was that the government should have done this a lot sooner than it did.</para>
<para>ATSIC was dilatory, unrepresentative, unsuccessful and, in short, a failure. There were very few apologists for ATSIC. Indeed, when Chairman Clark came before us I put to him this question: how is it, if things are so outrageously bad and you have been so badly treated and your natural justice has been so abused, that you do not have a friend in the world? The fact is this: the Labor Party support the abolition of ATSIC. That is the crucial thing that every Aboriginal person in Australia needs to understand. The Labor Party support the fundamental tenet of the great, bold initiative of this legislation. To some great extent that is why it is there.</para>
<para>The other great mystical hypocrisy in all of this is that they have gone through this charade pretending to pander to those people who have some sense of outrage whilst all the time saying, ‘Yes, we’re going to abolish it,’ and not having a policy on the table. There is no policy on the table. What is the Labor Party proposing in terms of representation for Aboriginal people to replace ATSIC? It is a round number before one: a great big zero. Of course, they will say, ‘This is terrible. The minister is doing the wrong thing. The minister hasn’t listened and hasn’t taken advice broadly from Aboriginal people and from people who are interested and from stakeholders.’ Of course that is utterly incorrect. Indeed the committee heard from people who had had long suffering and had periods of time when ATSIC simply gave them nothing.</para>
<para>Let us turn to this report and to the political nature of it. At one stage it talks about the shame of this legislation. The real shame is that all the while for the last six months while this has been proposed the ALP have stood on the hose and these changes could not be undertaken because they sought to indicate to their so-called constituents that they have concern. But, at the end of the day, the fact is the legislation is going to be passed and, in whatever form, the legislation will deliver the abolition of ATSIC. This is a classic example of crocodile tears.</para>
<para>I turn to the inquiry. What sort of credibility can the inquiry have? The most amazing fact about this inquiry—and this certainly does not reflect on the chair because I think she was most earnest in everything she did in this inquiry—is that it never went to Western Australia. How can you have a representative committee report on the abolition of ATSIC when it never went to Western Australia? The fact is, senators from the eastern states never want to go across the country to Western Australia. They never want to go across the country to Western Australia. So how much credibility can a report have when about 60 per cent of the population of Indigenous people is in Western Australia and the committee does not go there?</para>
<para>Let us talk about ATSIC and the budget. The annual budget for ATSIC in 2002-03 was $1.1 billion. That was only half of what the government pays in terms of managing Aboriginal affairs and Indigenous matters in Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I also want to speak, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, to this report of the Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs and to support the majority findings of the committee. I want to commend the chair of the committee, Senator Claire Moore. She did a wonderful job. Given the difficulty of the issues that the committee has had to deal with, it is often a hard task to keep people committed to dealing with the issues that come to the table but, most of all, to produce some sort of result.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Some of the comments that Senator Johnston has made are adequate in the sense that there has not been enough consultation. I would agree with that entirely. But the agenda that has been set has been one of the government’s making, particularly given that it decided to bring on the bill to deal with the abolition of ATSIC. So, under those circumstances and time constraints, it makes it difficult to get across the country and be comprehensive in the consultation. One thing I would say, though, is: let us not forget that the government initiated its own consultation. It was called an ATSIC review report and was done by the likes of Hannaford, Collins and Huggins. Consultation in that sense was extensive and comprehensive, and it occurred right across the country. So the committee was there to supplement and echo much of what had already been said by Indigenous people across the country.</para>
<para>The report is fairly clear and comprehensive in its condemnation of the Howard government and the failed practical reconciliation agenda. The recommendations, while, in my view, are okay, do not go far enough. I would have preferred stronger recommendations. Certainly they have been put forward in the Democrats’ supplementary report. I want to make a couple of brief comments on those.</para>
<para>The rhetoric about this government’s mainstream approach being a bottom-up approach is, quite frankly, both deceptive and manipulative, because clever language cannot hide the fact that the government is committed to assimilation and opposed to self-determination, as it has unashamedly stated on many occasions. Why won’t it admit that right now? Why won’t it just say what the Prime Minister said when he was in opposition back in 1986—that is, that he does not believe in what he regards as separate development, separate programs and separate laws? As Mick Dodson said, if you listen to the way the government is dealing with this you would swear that it has not got out there and spoken to anyone because, again, it is dealing with Indigenous people as if we are invisible on this continent, let alone on the entire planet.</para>
<para>The committee found that ATSIC was not the failure that this government would have the country believe. In fact, it was extremely successful given the hurdles it was up against. Now that we are post ATSIC and ATSIS, utter chaos does reign as a result of a hasty distribution of many of ATSIC’s functions to government departments. Even the new policy dealing with mutual obligation through shared responsibility is unclear. No minister or public servant has been able to say what SRAs actually are, produce guidelines on how departments and communities should go about making them or even confirm that they are legal, enforceable contracts. There have been no comments to this effect. In the meantime it is Indigenous people who suffer while this government mucks around with our lives. The government says it is about giving power back to the communities but the reality is that the government is reneging on legitimate decisions taken by ATSIC. I am not talking about the recent debacle being reported in the media; I am talking about decisions that have been taken previously to divest itself of assets, deal with the question of transfer of properties and deal with the question of remaining funds that are being held in trust, which many communities and community organisations are still waiting for.</para>
<para>I have raised on a number of occasions through the Senate select committee the issue of the MiiMi Mothers Aboriginal Corporation. It is there in the supplementary report as a case study. I think people ought to look at that. The government keeps talking about how it wants to deal with things on the ground as a result of a partnership. Here we have Aboriginal mothers in a community on the North Coast of New South Wales. A decision has been taken to transfer property to them. Of course, the government stepped in and changed its mind because it assessed it on new criteria. So much for these practical examples of following through, not just with the intent of a previous decision but with regard to looking after the interests of mothers and children in this case. They are in shared accommodation. Quite frankly, it was an opportunity for the government to deal with the matter. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs exposes the myriad problems and shortcomings with the Howard government’s approach to the administration of Indigenous affairs. I participated in the inquiry and travelled around the country listening to Indigenous communities, and it has become clear to me that the government’s approach lacks any legitimacy. The government has failed to consult the very people affected by its decisions—that is, Indigenous Australians. The government has forged ahead with its plans to abolish the national representative Indigenous body, ATSIC, without regard to the views of Indigenous communities and before parliament has even begun to consider the matter. The government has failed to propose a suitable alternative to ATSIC, giving the communities instead a hand-picked council of advisers who, whilst they are all decent and concerned people, have no legitimacy to speak on behalf of Indigenous people.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There are varying views about ATSIC and some legitimate criticisms of its structure, the functions it was tasked with and the tensions of a body designed along Western guidelines working in a different cultural context. But the committee did not hear from any Indigenous representative that appeared before the committee that they wanted to have their national voice abolished. The government has been gunning for ATSIC since it came to office in 1996. It has forced upon it audits at the same time as cutting ATSIC’s budget for training courses to improve the management skills of Indigenous administrators.</para>
<para>ATSIC has never had full responsibility for delivering services to Indigenous people and communities but it has always been blamed for the failure of other agencies and of government. The deeply entrenched disadvantage that Indigenous people endure that manifests itself in poverty, discrimination, overcrowded housing, poor health and low participation in education and training all point to systemic, long-term failures. To imagine that a body such as ATSIC could redress all of these failures was always plainly ridiculous.</para>
<para>The government has failed to explain in its new model involving consultation at local and regional levels who it will consult with once ATSIC regional councils are abolished, as proposed in the bill. It has not committed to fund new representative bodies at a national, regional or community level and it plans to deny Indigenous input to important forums and processes dealing with the protection of Indigenous heritage, health and medical issues, and human rights. For these reasons, the Greens do not support the government’s proposed abolition of ATSIC. We will continue to call, as we do in our additional comments to the report, for a new national representative Indigenous body—one supported by communities and funded by the government. Such a body is critical to self-determination, to redress Indigenous disadvantage in Australia and to advocate for Indigenous people in international forums.</para>
<para>The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Tom Calma, in November 2004 raised concerns that others have also raised about shared responsibility agreements. He said that the proposed introduction of coercive measures to achieve improvements in the circumstances of Indigenous peoples will not work and may, in fact, exacerbate the extent of poverty, marginalisation and powerlessness. We have already witnessed a shared responsibility agreement which linked two essential requirements that have nothing to do with each other. The much-publicised Mulan agreement ties essential health services and parental behaviour to fuel for transportation, which is not a luxury in a remote area. These agreements have about them a tenor of paternalism which has no place in the management of Indigenous affairs in this nation.</para>
<para>The Greens are also concerned about the government’s proposals for mainstreaming. The 2003 review of ATSIC rejected mainstreaming as an option, and international experience shows us that the best outcomes for Indigenous people occur when they exercise control over their own decisions in their own lives through culturally appropriate institutions. The government’s model of mainstreaming would create more difficulties of coordination. The committee heard evidence about the difficulties for the proposed Indigenous coordination centres in creating a cohesive and common vision, because each lead agency involved in the centres had a different purpose and function. The government needs to acknowledge the failure of mainstreaming in Australia and overseas, and commit to a genuine process of self-determination whereby Indigenous Australians are the primary decision makers in the decisions that affect their lives, particularly the delivery of services.</para>
<para>I want to add to the comments that others have made in thanking the people who supported the committee. I particularly want to thank Hansard, who had difficult jobs in places and unusual circumstances that they dealt with, and also the person who began chairing the committee, Senator Crossin.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak to the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs. Unlike Senator Johnston, I believe Indigenous affairs in this country is highly political and has become even more so under this government. If for one minute Senator Johnston believes that Indigenous affairs in this country should be apolitical, his very speech is testament to the fact that that is not the case.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>ATSIC has been used as a whipping horse by this government since it was elected in 1996. It has been blamed for nearly every failure in terms of Indigenous statistics that the government can grasp its hands on. Yet, as soon as this government came to power, it stripped ATSIC of its funds and ensured that ATSIC embarked on a process that was set up to fail.</para>

<para>—In fact, ATSIC has been successful in ensuring that Indigenous people were empowered, that Indigenous people had a place in the Public Service and that they were trained and had jobs in implementing Indigenous programs. It also ensured that Indigenous voices were heard in some form.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>If you read this report, you will see that this report does not suggest that ATSIC be maintained. There is no recommendation in this report to suggest that. Senator McGauran, it may well pay you to read it. For Senator Johnston to suggest that we did not go to Western Australia is a lie. We did go to Western Australia. He cannot stand in this chamber and say we did not go to that state. We went to Broome and we had witnesses from Western Australia come to Canberra and present evidence to us. Senator Ridgeway is right: we should have gone to Melbourne, we should have gone to South Australia, and we most probably should have gone to Perth and Kalgoorlie, but we were under pressure from this government to get this report tabled so that we could get on with debating the bill. We do not get any thanks from those on the other side of the chamber for curtailing the work that we wanted to do. We do not get any recognition that we feel that some of us have sold Indigenous people short in this consultation, but we met this time line.</para>
<para>I think it is most appropriate that I pay homage to the Indigenous people that we met on our travels. I particularly want to thank the committee secretariat—Jonathan, Alison, Ian and Tim. I also thank Hansard and sound and vision because, when I chaired that committee in Alice Springs, we had quite a momentous day there. We heard from Indigenous women in one room and we sent some of the committee members outside and heard from Indigenous men. It is probably unprecedented in the history of the Senate that that was done. Why did we do that? Because we wanted Indigenous people to feel comfortable and we wanted them to know that they were being listened to.</para>
<para>There are three areas of the report that Indigenous people presented to this committee. I ask this government to take this on board very seriously. Senator Johnston is right: we did not hear overwhelming evidence to retain ATSIC. The report does not reflect that. The report reflects that we heard from Indigenous people that they wanted a national representative body that they chose themselves—not a national Indigenous council. If the Indigenous council were going to exist and it were to be hand-appointed by the Prime Minister, Indigenous people said that that would be fine: it would be one means of getting advice. But they strongly said to us: ‘We want a national representative body—maybe elected, maybe not. You tell us what you want and we will deliver it to you.’ They certainly wanted support for some form of regional council, regional body or regional assembly. There are some very sophisticated models out there that Indigenous people have designed because they fear that, in the new world of Indigenous policy under this government, they will not be heard, that there will be no conduit between what is happening in the community and the new Indigenous coordination centres. They want a body that gathers their thoughts together and presents them to the government in a collective way. That is no longer there, but that is what they are after.</para>
<para>Finally, of course, they want to ensure that mainstreaming works. They are not convinced that it works. It has not in the past, and they do not believe that it will in the future. They see nowhere where they can turn to get an independent, arms-length evaluation of what is going on. What is happening in the COAG trials? What is happening with the SRAs? Senator Ridgeway is right. We have no evidence about the legality of SRAs or how they can be implemented. They said to us that at least a Senate committee of some form to oversee the government’s implementation of these policies would be welcome. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I have to say that it is with some sadness that I rise today. I was hoping to stand in this place and with some enthusiasm support a bipartisan approach to what are probably some of the most significant changes that have been made to the management of Aboriginal affairs in over 30 years. Many of the government members have probably shared the view that these reforms were well overdue, but we had to wait until that white gold wielder Mr Latham appeared with what is now seen as completely conventional wisdom. He shared our views. He said that ATSIC should be abolished. He said:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">ATSIC is no longer capable of addressing endemic problems in Indigenous communities. It has lost the confidence of much of its own constituency and the wider community.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I think that makes it absolutely clear. Of course, the majority report does not reflect the leader of the Labor Party’s commitment at that time—an election commitment—nor does it reflect the sentiment of the government members. How could we possibly support a majority report that is so blatantly hostile and so blatantly political? I would have loved to have stood in this place and supported a bipartisan approach to this very important issue for first Australians. In fact, if you looked at the report, you could mistakenly think that ATSIC is absolutely fantastic, outcomes are great and it could carry on with a steady hand on the tiller. We know that demonstrates that the Labor Party is not only out of step with Indigenous Australians but out of step with the wider community.</para>
<para>I am actually very proud of the federal government’s contribution to Indigenous affairs. Since 1996, we have increased our financial contribution by about 39 per cent. I know you would agree, Madam Acting Deputy President Crossin, that that is not the only benchmark. There is a whole range of other real improvements that I think we need to look at.</para>
<para>Labor has dragged us through this inquiry. I am not sure of the exact cost but you can measure it in millions. The wages and the cost of running the regional councils and in fact ATSIC itself are measured in the millions. Luckily, we had the administrative capacity to simply get on with the job. That is what this government is about: getting on with the job. We got the reforms under way. Indigenous programs have been embargoed—they have been cocooned—protecting the essential staff and the cultural knowledge that went with those programs. They are being maintained, they have been improved and they are now being delivered by mainstream Commonwealth agencies.</para>
<para>We are not just doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome, because we know that is madness; it never happens. We have to change how we go about it. We are going about it in a much more coordinated way. There are the Indigenous coordination centres. All the agencies come under one roof. Under one roof we can have a much more coordinated approach to Indigenous Australians and the way they approach their particular agencies. The heads of department meet every month to say: ‘How do we ensure the coordination of policy happens? How do we make sure that we actually measure the outcomes of the changes that are made? We’re not going to measure them every five years or even every couple of years; we are going to measure them every month. We are going to meet and measure them.’ In fact, a public report each year will report on those outcomes. We have a ministerial task force, chaired by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs herself, who will oversee it to ensure we have complementarity of process and policy.</para>
<para>This report is completely misleading. The only people who are confused are those who sit opposite. The states and territories—that is, Labor states and territories—have had a bipartisan approach to this. We are already going down the line of bilateral agreements. They are part of the COAG trials. They are part of the way forward. They are not a part of doing the same thing and continuing to politicise this issue. They are getting on with the job. After nine months, this committee is eventually going to honour its commitment, which is effectively Labor’s commitment to abolish ATSIC. There are a couple of conditions, of course—unacceptable conditions, as far as I am concerned—such as, ‘Let’s keep the regional councils.’ They gave them another 12 months to sort things out. Another six months is not going to make any difference at all.</para>
<para>Of course, there is the shining light in the policy. ‘Let’s have another committee,’ said the Labor Party. ‘Let’s have a Senate standing committee. That will fix Indigenous affairs.’ We have made a recommendation in that area that clearly indicates that we need a coordinated government approach, a whole-of-government approach. We are recommending that both houses and both sides of parliament join together in a joint committee to deal with Indigenous affairs. If those opposite are absolutely fair dinkum about positively changing the lot of Indigenous Australians, they should get behind this bill and support it in its current form. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para class="block">I am pleased to present the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee entitled <inline font-style="italic">They still call Australia home: inquiry into Australian expatriates</inline>. The report is the result of an inquiry lasting over 18 months during which the committee received evidence on a whole range of issues relating to Australians living overseas. The response to the inquiry was considerable. The committee received submissions from over 650 individuals and organisations, many of them overseas. The committee examined the demographics of Australians living overseas and the needs and concerns of those Australians. The committee also considered the role the Australian government plays in relation to expatriates and ways in which expatriates contribute to the Australian community.</para>
<para>The committee learnt that a significant proportion of the Australian population is currently living overseas on a permanent or long-term basis. Current estimates are that almost a million Australians are living abroad. The committee also heard that many of these expatriate Australians are young, highly skilled, highly motivated and well educated. This has led some to fear that Australia is experiencing a brain drain of its best and brightest workers with potentially damaging consequences for the Australian economy and Australian society. In fact, the committee received evidence during its inquiry that Australia actually experiences a net brain gain of skilled workers. Most importantly, the committee received much evidence to show that these Australians living abroad are great ambassadors for Australia, creating valuable bridges for Australia across the world.</para>
<para>The factors driving more Australians to live overseas are many and varied. At a broad level the expatriates phenomenon is a reflection of an increasingly mobile and globalised world. Some of the key influences on the phenomenon include the rise of global labour markets, more accessible and economical international transport and increasingly more sophisticated communication technologies. At the same time, the improved technology, particularly the internet, has made it much easier for expatriates to stay in touch with Australia. As a result, the committee discovered that many expatriate Australians still feel very strong cultural links with their homeland despite being physically located outside Australia. As the title of the report suggests, they still call Australia home and they still participate in the day-to-day events of Australian society, although remotely.</para>
<para>In the same way that most expat Australians still embrace Australia as their home, the majority of the committee considers that we should do more as a society to embrace our expat community as part of the Australian nation. As a recent report on Australian expatriates by the Lowy Institute for International Policy remarked, Australian expatriates represent ‘a market, a constituency, a sales force and an ambassadorial corps’.</para>
<para>The committee found during this inquiry that Australian expatriates present many potential benefits, opportunities and new considerations for Australian policy makers. In particular, we heard that many of the needs and concerns of expatriate Australians are not being adequately dealt with by the Australian government and its structures. Many expats expressed particular frustration at their dealings—or indeed their attempts to deal—with Australian government agencies. The majority of the committee found that Australian expatriates could be better recognised and included in the Australian democratic system.</para>
<para>To achieve these aims, some of the key recommendations that the majority of the committee has made in this report are: the establishment of a policy unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to facilitate the coordination of policies relating to Australian expatriates; the establishment by the Australian government of a web portal devoted to the provision of information and services for expatriate Australians—a web portal that would be used for interactive activities both broadly across the globe as well as in particular locations—the revision of the consular role for Australian missions overseas to require posts to extend their engagement with the local expat community; and greater inclusion of expatriates in the Australian democratic system, including proposed amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act and the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I urge the government to heed the recommendations of the committee’s report and to make greater effort to connect with this most important resource of the Australian people.</para>
<para>In closing, I would like to thank all those people who took the time to make submissions and to give evidence to the committee, including expatriate network organisations and many overseas based chambers of commerce and alumni associations. I would particularly like to thank the Southern Cross Group for its assistance in distributing information about the inquiry and for supplying a steady stream of comprehensive submissions and useful background information. I would also like to thank the people involved with the Lowy Institute for International Policy. I think the institute and study set the framework and directions for government to follow, many of which were shared by this particular committee and the members of it. I would like to thank my committee colleagues, including the deputy chair, Senator Payne, and current and former staff of the committee secretariat for their work on the inquiry—that includes Phillip Bailey, Louise Gell, Barbara Allen, Kelly Paxman, Sophie Power, Julie Dennett, Marina Seminara and other secretariat staff. I commend the report to the Senate.</para>

<para>—I also rise to speak on the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">They still call Australia home: inquiry into Australian expatriates</inline>. Although I was not a member of the committee, I did lead a parliamentary delegation to the United Nations last year. Through the work of the office of Australian consul general, Ken Allen, and a division of that office called Advance, led by its CEO, Elena Douglas, I came across this issue and had the chance to meet with quite a lot of former Australian citizens and Australians who are working in the United States. It is a very large group of Australians that are overseas. In terms of government policy, I think we perhaps need to grapple with better ways of interacting with this group that has left Australia, sometimes permanently, sometimes temporarily. The size of the group is about a million people—we have a million Australians overseas. That is about Adelaide in size, but they are living and working across the world. About 200,000 of them are in the United States. These people are often referred to as part of the brain drain, but they are a group that may come back. They are a group for which we should perhaps set up mechanisms to assist them in coming back. A lot of them have gone overseas following opportunities and sometimes they lose the links and cannot get back, even if they want to. They have not got the networks to do that.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>They are developing their skills tremendously and if they decided to come back they would add greatly to the Australian economy. So we must really address this matter. Obviously, we are not going to force people to come back, but in the context of the current debate on skills—which is No. 1 on the agenda at the moment—if we could encourage the one million people to return quickly it would fix our skills shortage problem overnight. They will not do that, but we should set up the mechanisms to assist those who may want to. It would really enhance the skills base of our country. We have people with enormous skills who after developing those skills further could come back and with their overseas experience really enrich the skill base of Australian society.</para>
<para>I was therefore delighted to work with the consul general in his work with Advance. Advance is an organisation which focuses mainly on professionals overseas and tries to work them into networks and associations and build links back to Australia. The first of these I came across was the Advance research network, which was in New England. I went with the consul general to Boston and we had dinner at Harvard. I had the opportunity during the day at MIT to meet with a very large group of world-class Australian researchers who are leading research institutes in areas like robotics. I met a robot which thought like a two-year-old and could act like a 12-year-old. It is the most advanced robot in the world and it was developed by an Australian at MIT who is leading this field.</para>
<para>One of the most delightful aspects of the afternoon was meeting with Australian research students studying at MIT. I spent an hour or two with them and they talked excitedly about the research that they were doing. It is great that they are at one of the world’s leading universities like MIT, but I would hope that in five to 10 years time they might take that expertise, return to Australia and enrich us with what they have learnt and their experiences. Another group that I met with was a business community in New York. They were expat Australians who came along to listen to two Australian delegates speak on the topic, ‘What are democracy and politics going to be like in Australia after the Senate changes on 1 July?’ So it was a bit of crystal-ball gazing.</para>

<para>—You would have to read my speech, which you can find on my web site. It was an engaging discussion, with Australian politicians and diplomats engaging with Australian businessmen in New York. They are the sorts of links that we hope will help return those people to Australia at some point in the future. At another function in New York, again organised by the consul general, Ken Allen, we met with Professor Harry Messel. Professor Messel, of course, is an icon of Australian science. Through his science foundation he has spawned large numbers of brilliant scientists, many of them in the United States. Quite a number attended this dinner—all there in response to the expertise and skills of Australian science which are assisting American science and the American economy. Again, by building these links, we hope that these people come back. It is not just professionals or academics; it is a wide-ranging group of people. There are 200,000 in the United States. Through the work of Advance, links are being built so that these people may be given the opportunity to link back to Australia and possibly return in the future.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>This has been a very timely report in terms of what is now occurring in the skills debate in Australia and the way in which we should link back. The recommendation to set up a web site is excellent because obviously a lot of these people are very IT savvy. If we had such a web site then we could help facilitate those links back to Australia. A policy unit in Foreign Affairs is an excellent idea, just so that we focus on this diaspora of Australians—the one million who are overseas. Certainly, I have not looked at the details of the amendments to the electoral and citizenship acts—Senator Bolkus was a little bit cryptic in his comments—but I am sure those reforms will be very worth while as well. I too commend this report to the Senate. It is an interesting area of policy development and something we should focus on. We should really try to develop better links to those Australians who are no longer in our country but may return and enrich us all with the skills and knowledge that they have gained overseas.</para>

<para>—I also want to speak on the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">They still call Australia home: inquiry into Australian expatriates</inline>. I agree with Senator Tierney that it is very timely. The Senate committee process once again demonstrates how valuable this area is. I note that the 16 recommendations were widely accepted by all senators, including government senators, in the vast majority of cases. I urge the government and senior ministers—including Senator Vanstone, seeing as she is in the chamber and has responsibility for some of the issues covered in this report, and Minister McGauran, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs—to treat the Senate committee report and its recommendations seriously. These areas are important and are part of what is desperately needed, which is to really change our thinking about what it is to be Australian in the modern world of the 21st century and to migrate and be part of what is widely recognised as a rapidly shrinking global community.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is a little-recognised fact that if you ask the simple question, ‘How many Australians are there?’ you cannot get a precise answer. Firstly, how do you define what is an Australian? Even taking a simple definition and asking how many Australian citizens there are on the planet is problematic. In terms of getting a clear piece of information about how many Australians are dual citizens—citizens of Australia and another country—which I have tried to do a number of times, it is very hard to get anything other than a very general estimation. As this report shows, trying to estimate how many Australians there are overseas is also very difficult. How long do you keep counting them as Australian? If you are talking about what is in Australia’s interests, I would argue that it is in our interests and in almost all cases in the individual’s interest to continue to try and count them as Australian for as long as possible and to do what we can to maintain links.</para>
<para>We have been debating in recent times whether we should be getting short-term skilled workers into this country to undertake various tasks. We often do not think nearly as much about how many Australians are going overseas as skilled workers, as working holiday visa holders, as visitor visa holders or as family reunion people—all of whom are doing a similar thing but are retaining their links with Australia. We have had too narrow a focus over many years by simply thinking about people when they are standing within Australian boundaries; when they are outside of Australian boundaries they are out of the picture. We need to change that thinking in the same way that we need to change our thinking about what constitutes a migrant to Australia. People are flowing in and out of Australia and in and out of other countries much more regularly and frequently, for periods of time—for three years, for five years, for 10 years. I think that is healthy; it is certainly happening anyway. We need to make sure that we keep those connections with people who have contact with Australia much more skilfully and consciously than we have done.</para>
<para>I am disappointed that I was not able to participate much in this committee inquiry. I attempted to do so as a participating member a couple of times but was not able to because of other commitments. However, I did read some of the submissions. I note that there were over 650 submissions, which is an indication of the level of interest and the number of people that are not only touched by this issue but touched by it sufficiently significantly for them to want to put a submission in to a Senate committee.</para>
<para>To anybody that is further interested in this issue, I very much recommend a look at the work of Professor Graeme Hugo in particular. He has been looking at the changed nature of migration to Australia—the much more temporary nature of it—as well as the nature of emigration, of people moving out of Australia for short-term and long-term periods. I also recommend looking at the work of the Southern Cross Group, which has developed in recent times to give a voice to that very large expat community of around one million people, at reasonable estimates.</para>
<para>We would all know people from our own families or experience who have moved overseas for short or long periods of time. I have an aunt who I think departed Australia in the 1960s and has lived in a large number of countries and gained a lot of experience. She has lived in the US, the UK, Hong Kong, the Maldives and Cyprus and will probably end up moving back here—she is already spending a lot of time here—and contributing to the Australian economy and community with all her skills and experience. It is because of the links she has maintained with Australia that we are able to make use of that individual.</para>
<para>We have perhaps one of our most famous expats in Australia at the moment. I offer a big strong Aussie welcome to good old Princess Mary, who is in Canberra at present. Of course it is Princess Mary of Denmark I am speaking of, who until recently was an Australian but, I believe, had to give up her citizenship—I guess giving it up for love is an admirable thing. But clearly a lot of Australians still believe that Princess Mary retains a lot of Australianness about her even though she is no longer a citizen and believe that she is an ambassador for our country in another part of the world. Indeed, government ministers have spoken of what a great contribution she is making as an ambassador for Australia in another part of the world and of how she is doing a good job of it. That is perhaps an unusual example, but it is one example of how an Australian or an ex-Australian can still make a positive contribution to our country. It obviously benefits us to keep those links alive.</para>
<para>In more practical terms, beyond changing the way we think about these issues, there are legislative changes that we need to consider. We also need to improve information flows, particularly in the areas of the Australian Citizenship Act and the Commonwealth Electoral Act. This is a group of people, as is said right at the start of this report, who are a market, a constituency, a sales force and an ambassadorial corps. But in many ways they do not have a voice. Most of them are disenfranchised. Obviously there are issues about how long people retain the right to vote when they are no longer living in the country, but we should be aware of some of the approaches taken in other countries.</para>
<para>People may remember—I am sure Acting Deputy President Bolkus remembers—the story of the Melbourne based Greek-born man who went all the way back to Athens to vote in the recent Greek elections even though he had lived in Australia for a long period of time. Indeed there is a growing community of Greeks who migrated to Australia decades and decades ago and are now returning to Greece, to the place where they were born. But they are returning very much as Greek Australians, not as Greeks. That is a reverse linkage, if you like: they are leaving Australia and going back to Greece but they are still retaining that linkage to Australia.</para>
<para>There are things we need to change with the Commonwealth Electoral Act, and also with the Australian Citizenship Act, and there are recommendations about this. Recommendations 6 and 7 say that the Citizenship Act should be amended to ensure that children of people who renounced their citizenship under section 18 of the Citizenship Act, or children of people who previously lost their citizenship under section 17, should be eligible for Australian citizenship by descent. The committee also expressed concern that Australians living overseas may continue to be forced to renounce their citizenship while section 18 remains in the Citizenship Act—</para>

</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I would also say that it is long overdue that we amend our Constitution. I know that is a lot more difficult. We have more and more dual citizens, but every one of them is disenfranchised in that none of them can run for parliament. I think that is an anachronism that must be removed as soon as possible. I know it requires a referendum but it is something that all parties would support, and need to support, because that is a massive and growing pool of talent. Perhaps 20 per cent to 25 per cent of Australians are dual citizens, and they are missing out on potentially being part of the federal parliament.</para>

</talker>
<para>—The proposed agenda that we have before us in this legislation has not suddenly appeared; there has been significant consultation over a long period with all the relevant stakeholders. The government has instituted a range of advisory groups that are linked to this legislation: clinical advisory groups, a prostheses and devices committee, a policy advisory group, and also people who are involved directly in the negotiations. These groups will play an intricate role in the development of good policy in the area. However, once again I am concerned about the fact that these things are still in train and we are yet to see the whole process actually working as we are looking at making changes to legislation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>One of the key things to come out in this debate—as well as in so many others in this field—is the need for accurate, relevant data. The hope is that, with the development of these various advisory bodies, there will be available data on which people can make budget decisions, on which they can make planning decisions and on which the community can be informed on this ever growing area; because people do agree that the use of prostheses is growing, the technology is developing, and there is a greater expectation that people will have good health and effective surgical procedures. The Department of Health and Ageing made a statement in their submission and when they were witnesses, and we quoted it in the committee report, but I think it deserves restatement. It focuses on the need for this data. It reads:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">One of the things that will happen with this process is that we will have data that we have not had before. For a start we will have the data that the CAGs, the clinical advisory groups, have put together and their assessments of the actual products. Similarly, the benefit negotiators will actually be reaching benefit negotiating positions that will go as recommendations to the Prostheses and Devices Committee and then on to the minister. So we will be able to see the benefits being settled, and that will be publicly available. That data will become part of the publicly listed determination.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That particular process gives us confidence, because the idea that these processes will now be public and will be able to be debated is one of the really hopeful elements of the legislation.</para>
<para>One of the other issues that I wish to put on record—and I am sure my colleagues will be making more statements on this—is the core issue of informed financial consent. The government has acknowledged that this is a central part of the whole process, because with any procedure where people have to make decisions about payment, it is essential that everyone knows what is going on, what costs they will be liable for and who pays for what. It is of greatest concern, when you are talking about payment, that people do not know that they are liable for payment. Something has happened, they have no control, and suddenly they are landed with bills for which they were not prepared.</para>
<para>The government has acknowledged that this is a key issue, and another committee has been formed. I heard this afternoon that it is the Labor Party that is fond of forming committees. I think many people are fond of forming committees that actually work and cooperate. The informed financial consent committee has been established, and it includes all the stakeholders in this issue. The committee will work on how to best achieve a system—of course there will be times when things fall over; no system is perfect—so that we can have confidence that we are actually instituting a payment agenda where people are aware of their responsibilities.</para>
<para>During evidence to the committee, this issue was raised on numerous occasions—particularly by the AMA, who were strongly of the view that it should not be solely a doctor’s responsibility. I agree with that, and the AMA have gone a fair way down the track with advising their members about their responsibilities and the best way to talk with patients about financial responsibility. They have developed templates which they very proudly showed us on their web site; but, in terms of the bottom line, everybody involved in making decisions about health—particularly decisions about which bills will need to be paid—must know what is happening, where it is happening, who is paying and when it must be paid. I am quite hopeful that the informed financial consent committee will be able to come up with guidelines that people can accept and implement.</para>
<para>Any change of this nature must be subject to an effective review mechanism, and that has been discussed. The people on this side of the chamber were hoping for an early review so that the ongoing process could be established; nonetheless there has been acceptance by the government that there need to be significant review processes. Again, when you are implementing change, the best way to ensure that you are going to get it right and pick up things that may go wrong early—so that they do not become entrenched, so that hours of debate in this place are not wasted on something that could have been picked up early and agreement reached—is to implement an effective review process. We are calling for open review in the legislation that can be regularly seen so that change can be made quickly.</para>
<para>We know that this particular legislation is diving into the area of trust because the details have not been clearly defined as yet. However, we do know that all the key stakeholders who gave submissions—who came to our committee and talked about their desire to try to get this right—want to see this legislation implemented. They have already stated, as I said before, that what we had is not good enough and will not benefit the consumers of our country who need medical support. We believe that, provided the advisory groups are effectively implemented, provided the review process is put in place and provided there is genuine cooperation, we can move forward in this process.</para>
<para>As most people agree, there needs to be formal trust between doctor and patient. That must be the core area for decisions about what medical practice is implemented, what device is used or implanted. A patient requiring support must have the trust that their doctor will give them the best possible service. That is the best possible result for all of us. But, given that we are looking at a procedure where there will be some form of gap payment in the system, once there is informed financial consent, once people know what they are doing, once the stakeholders take their responsibilities and once the various advisory groups that the minister has implemented perform their role, this particular legislation, as we have been told by the people who came before our committee, should be given a go.</para>

<para>—As Senator Moore commented at the commencement of her speech, a number of committee members in the inquiry had a very definite interest in this area. They had prostheses. I must confess that I am one of those people—I have two hips and a knee. I have no concerns whatsoever about the procedures I had. I have no complaints about the surgeon. But I am unsure about whether this legislation will be effective. If one looks closely at the evidence given to the recent Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry, one would see I am not alone in this. However, we on this side are supporting the legislation because clearly something needs to be done. The present situation is untenable.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The difficulty has been to find a system that will work more economically and more efficiently than the current one whilst also providing Australians with the capacity to choose the prostheses they need. I found the committee process in this instance to be most interesting. The more evidence I read or heard, the more convinced I became that the bill as drafted would not make the situation any better. It is for this reason that I join with colleagues on this side of the chamber in seeking an amendment to provide for an appropriate review of the process. I think that is very important.</para>
<para>The government is to be commended for agreeing to our recommendation. I was pleased to note that in the third reading of the bill in the other place it provided accordingly. The present requirements require health funds to cover the full cost of all surgically implanted prostheses and other medical devices on the government schedule. The funds are not permitted to apply a co-payment or gap for such prostheses items. This is, of course, good for the consumer. They pay no gap and generally they are able to access the prostheses of their choice. But costs to the health system in respect of prostheses are spiralling. We are told that benefit payments for prostheses are now 12 per cent of total hospital benefits. In 1990, they were less than two per cent. It is said that payments for prostheses by health funds under the current arrangements are now contributing in a significant way to increases in premiums.</para>
<para>I am a strong believer that patient choice must be maintained. It will be unacceptable if the changes initiated by this legislation lead to a removal of the capacity for each patient to choose the most suitable prostheses for their particular procedure. This will entirely depend on the surgeon they have and the recommendation he makes to them. But it is also clear that some reform must occur. Without attention it seems that the cost of provision of prostheses will continue to rise at unacceptable rates. We did not take oral evidence from consumer groups during the committee hearings but the points they made in their written submissions on the legislation reinforced my own concerns. One of the most potent points made by the Consumers’ Health Forum of Australia related to the very reason why many Australians maintain private health insurance. The simple fact is that they do so in order to ensure that they have choice—choice about where they are hospitalised and when they can access elective surgery and so forth. In particular I refer to a paragraph from the CHF submission:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Most health consumers do not have a good understanding of whether their private health insurance is adequate for their needs until it is put to the test, often by a hospitalisation or surgery, where too often they find out that large gaps are payable for the treatment recommended by their health care providers.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is very much the case with prostheses. Not many of us think about providing for their cost until we reach the stage where our doctor tells us we need one. I have no doubt that there would be few young Australians who would, when taking out private insurance, consider whether they should adequately provide for prosthetic implantations at some stage of their lives.</para>
<para>Until now, of course, it has not mattered because private health funds have been obliged to fully fund the provision of the prosthesis of choice. But, after the passage of this bill, the issue will be a very real one. Yes, there will be at least one no gap prosthesis available for each procedure but, unlike now, it may not necessarily be the most appropriate one for a particular consumer. Here again, the consumer must be guided by their orthopaedic surgeon. Hopefully, that orthopaedic surgeon will recommend the most suitable prosthesis for the procedure they are about to have. As the Consumers Health Forum of Australia said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The average health consumer would not be taking into consideration the contribution of the cost of prostheses to hospitalisations when making decisions about their private health insurance cover.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I share the fears expressed by the CHF. Consequently, we must ensure that these reforms do not result in the privately insured realising that they do not have cover for a required prosthesis only when the surgery is around the corner. Equally, we must not allow a situation to develop where the most clinically appropriate prosthesis is available to them only if they can afford a substantial gap payment—and that was the point that I was making earlier. That is absolutely vital.</para>
<para>The real risk here is that we are creating the possibility of an environment which is inconsistent with the concept we have come to know as ‘lifetime cover’. As soon as we create the option for an individual to leave out, for example, cover for prostheses, such an option will be taken up, especially by the young and healthy. So we must explain to the young and healthy, particularly young sportspeople probably, that having coverage for prostheses is vital. They will have much difficulty in relating to the concept that they might one day need such cover. The young who are lured into private health insurance through the advantages of lifetime cover can conceive that they might need to be hospitalised, might need physiotherapy and will need dental care, but an option of coverage for prostheses is quite a different thought process. This is most definitely a situation where those who opt for private health insurance should be able to adjust their coverage options without any significant penalty.</para>
<para>As I considered this bill, the more I read and the more I heard, the more I became concerned about the consequences. Only too often during the committee inquiry it was very much the case that those we heard from simply did not know. This is why an appropriate and effective review mechanism is such a critical part of this legislation. Without it, there are simply too many unknowns and we would not be providing appropriate protection for our constituents.</para>
<para>The stated objectives of the new arrangements are threefold: (1) to reduce pressure on premiums by limiting growth in payments made for prostheses; (2) to reduce the administrative burden on the industry; and (3) to provide contributors with more choice. There was little evidence supplied to us that any of these three aims would be achieved, except perhaps the reduction of the administrative burden, although I suspect an even larger burden may well be transferred elsewhere.</para>
<para>I refer to the evidence given to the committee inquiry by the Australian Private Hospitals Association in which they said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… it is not completely clear how, or whether, the new arrangements will work to limit the rate of increase in health fund benefits in the near and medium term.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They also said they did not know ‘the degree to which utilisation, technology or price have led to the increasing benefit costs to health insurers’. Catholic Health Australia was of the view that there were other factors which might limit the impact which any downward pressure on the cost of prostheses arising from this legislation might have. The Medical Industry Association of Australia is far from convinced. In his evidence to the committee, their Director, Healthcare Access, Mr David Ross, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We believe that the outcomes of the reforms are uncertain. Like the Australian Consumers Association, we are sceptical of the capacity of these changes to bring about a long-term slowdown in premium increases. While we agree that these reforms are likely to place pressure on prosthesis prices, we believe that the real driver of expenditure is utilisation, which is not addressed by these measures.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I am also concerned about this proposition advanced by the MIAA in their submission:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">High technology prostheses that cannot be commercially sustained are unlikely to remain available in the Australian healthcare environment.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is another concern of mine—that some of these new prostheses are so expensive that they may not be available. They are being developed all the time and becoming more sophisticated. The MIAA say that Australians may be denied access to higher technology devices in circumstances where the gap payment which may be imposed will be larger than the market can bear, which is the point I just made. They are of the belief that this could be an unintended consequence of these reforms and therefore one that should be monitored. The MIAA were also of the belief that the reforms have the potential to impact on patient choice, both because some will not be able to afford the gap for the prosthesis they want and because some products may disappear from the marketplace. That is the concern I have with the cost of these prostheses.</para>
<para>I was somewhat surprised by the number and breadth of the doubts and concerns held by the APHA about the legislation. The APHA expressed concerns about the success or otherwise of the benefits negotiation process, the number of devices that will be affected by the gap, the magnitude of the gaps, the role to be played by private hospitals where informed consent has not been obtained, and, finally, the unhealthy practice of exclusionary policies offered by the funds.</para>
<para>Whilst the association was of the view that the current situation was even worse, their level of doubt about the proposed arrangements is a further cause for concern. The issue of exclusionary practices is not only a concern for the APHA. The Australian Consumers Association has a similar view and, I must say, so do I. The APHA is, in my view, correct in asserting:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… consumers do not have any objective means of assessing their risk of developing a particular condition and/or sustaining an injury and therefore cannot make an informed choice whether to sign up to a policy that excludes hospital treatment for a particular condition.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Again, that is a point I have made because it is vital that people have that information. Whilst this has been an issue in other areas prior to now, it has not been so in the case of prostheses, since all insurers have been required to provide no gap coverage for them. Under these new arrangements they will not be required to do so, if a member has elected not to be covered for the hospital procedure.</para>
<para>In summary: the submissions made and evidence given to the committee revealed some degree of hope but a much greater level of uncertainty about whether these reforms will be effective. The question must be asked whether in the long term there will be benefits to the system whilst keeping premiums under control and retaining patient choice of prostheses, and to me that is absolutely vital. The review mechanism and process is thus essential for a whole variety of reasons. It must ensure that the legislation does not create a roadblock for technological innovation of prostheses. Another of my fears is that that may well happen. It must ensure that Australians can access the most clinically appropriate prosthesis they need at the time. It should ensure that outdated technologies do not clog up the no gap list, especially at the expense of newer and more effective ones. An appropriate process must be put in place for removals from the list. As the CHF pointed out in their submission:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Without such a review, these obsolete prostheses may become the lowest cost sub-group of prostheses for a particular MBS item number and create a perverse cost incentive to use older technology, rather than relatively safer devices which require a gap payment.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That was the point I was making earlier: we must ensure that this does not happen. The review process must be rigorous in ensuring that the new arrangements are not abused to the detriment of the Australian consumer. It must ensure that adequate choice remains and that the impact on premiums is a positive one or, at the very least, one of containment. At all times, we must ensure that the most widely used prostheses, together with those which incorporate advances on such technologies, are included as no gap items on the schedule.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2145">National Health Amendment (Prostheses) Bill 2004</inline> and I would like to go back to the stated objectives of this piece of legislation. In the explanatory memorandum there are three dot points:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>reduce the pressure on the level of private health insurance premiums by limiting the growth in benefits for prostheses;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>reduce the administrative burden on the industry; and</para>

</item>
</list>
</quote>
<para class="block">I will make some more comments on that last point as we get into committee because it is on the choice issue that I want to talk about podiatry and podiatric surgeons. First I will look generally at the aims of this piece of legislation. Some of the earlier speakers have also raised issues of proof of whether or not this is really going to happen or if we are going to have to wait and see what the process is. This is why I am pleased to see that the Labor Party’s amendment is already enshrined in the bill. It has come across from the House of Representatives. It will keep us looking at and reviewing this process and seeing whether or not we have results.</para>
<para>While private health insurance premiums may generally go down—we are not going to have a full range of options, a full suite of possibilities, for various prostheses; we are only going to have the basic model—across the board there might at least be some holding of increases. I cannot see private health insurance premiums coming down, but there might be some levelling. We have seen some significant increases and apparently some of that is due to this area. But for the individual whose medical specialist perhaps recommends an alternative or who wants the latest technology, the best available model of whatever the particular item is, they are going to have to pay and probably pay quite substantially. So the first aim—to reduce the pressure on the level of private health insurance premiums—is going to be achieved across the board at least in the very short term, but that is not going to do anything for those who are going to need an up-to-date or simply a different model or option if they ever need this kind of support.</para>
<para>On the issue of choice I think the ultimate way to ensure that we have choice is to make sure that all of those who are qualified in this area to perform procedures are actually able to do that. On this issue my primary concern is that we enhance choice if we include podiatric surgeons in the provision of prostheses and professional services. Surely we have to recognise the role of all health professionals. We went through this debate with the Medicare legislation a year or so ago when four of us on this side of the chamber were able to negotiate into Medicare, for those able to access enhanced primary care programs, the opportunity to access allied health professionals. This is often not just the very best outcome for the patient but it is also cost-effective and it helps us in Australia to cope with a growing problem—the shortage of specialists and the shortage of doctors generally, particularly those who specialised as GPs. Why don’t we include all of those people who are able to do the particular procedure or process or give whatever advice it is that we are looking for?</para>
<para>If the legislation were to go ahead as it is originally written, because of the way that the public hospital system in particular operates, it would simply not be possible to have the option of seeing a podiatrist and going through the processes that might ultimately be necessary by way of an operation and potentially the use of a prosthesis. Apparently in the public hospital system there is a set of guidelines or rules that generally discriminate and limit access. Through these amendments—and I will speak to them on an individual, one-by-one basis when we get to them—we want to reinforce both choice and the issue of cost. If we keep focusing on a few very scarce surgical resources and expect people to simply do more and more, cost will often become an issue, as will delays and waiting. If we are able to make sure that all of those who are able to perform these operations do so, then it will be better for all concerned.</para>
<para>Podiatric surgeons provide specific professional services and perform minor, mostly straightforward, surgical procedures on feet and toes. As I have stated, this really is a fairly simple set of amendments to make sure we enshrine, for private health insurance funds, the ability to provide benefits for in-hospital foot surgery performed by podiatric surgeons. The issue was raised with the Community Affairs Legislation Committee and, as we saw from the evidence there, it is simply not enough to just encourage, because it will not happen. If we just ask the private health funds to do it out of the goodness of their hearts, I do not think we will ever get there. I quote from page 5, paragraph 1.21 of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee’s report:</para>
<quote>
<para>The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman commented that ‘many consumers might see the introduction of a patient gap for prostheses that would otherwise have been available with no gap, as a reduction in patient choice’.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In paragraph 1.36 it goes on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para>Private insurance companies have indicated that they will not pay for these [prostheses] unless podiatric surgeons are specifically allowed for in the legislation … The ACPS applauds the intent of the Government in this matter but is nonetheless concerned that without specific legislative amendment to the Act the insurance industry will not comply with the intent of the Government.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The amendments simply cement in place what the government has indicated. As the ombudsman said in relation to patient choice, we cement in this choice if we make sure that this is catered for. Indeed, one of the recommendations of the Senate committee is:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... that the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman monitor the implementation of the new podiatric surgical cover provisions and report on progress in the Ombudsman’s annual State of the Health Funds report.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The committee also recommends in 1.45:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... that future reviews of private health insurance cover should consider whether benefits should be paid for the professional services of podiatric surgeons ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I argue that we cannot leave it to the future intent but that, as we have such people already qualified, we should immediately give this opportunity. In relation to podiatric surgeons and prostheses, the committee report states on page 7:</para>
<quote>
<para>Podiatric surgeons provide a specific professional service. They perform minor and mostly relatively straightforward surgical procedures on the feet and toes. Podiatric surgeons generally are qualified podiatrists, but they are licensed to provide their specialist and highly-skilled services on the basis of extensive relevant further experience and postgraduate training.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">For those who are concerned that perhaps those that we are recommending be involved in this legislation are not qualified, that was one of the issues looked at by the committee and they found that most certainly these people are qualified in this area. The committee also notes:</para>
<quote>
<para>As podiatric surgeons are not qualified medical practitioners, services provided by them are not eligible for Medicare benefits. In 2004, however, the Government amended the National Health Act to allow podiatric surgeons to receive private health insurance benefits notwithstanding their lack of Medicare eligibility.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The committee report goes on to quote the Minister for Health and Ageing’s second reading speech, in which he said:</para>
<quote>
<para>There have been recent changes to health insurance legislation that enable members to access basic hospital accommodation and nursing care costs for services performed by accredited podiatrists. In those circumstances, I encourage health funds to cover the prostheses implanted by podiatric surgeons.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">As we see from the committee evidence, the fact is that if it is only encouragement then it simply is not going to happen. In summary, I believe that we need to look at the two issues of choice and cost. Again, I suppose the proof will be in the results in years to come, but I believe that consumers will be facing lower, if not no, gap payments with podiatric surgeons and they will be given the additional opportunity and benefit of accessing other trained professionals.</para>

<para>—I want to thank all honourable senators for their contribution in the debate on the <inline ref="R2145">National Health Amendment (Prostheses) Bill 2004</inline>. I do have an interest in this bill since I think some of the initiatives were commenced when I was health minister, and I had a concern about the cost of private health insurance. One of the drivers of that was the use of very expensive prostheses without any consideration by those people who were using the prostheses. I will not go into the detail. The explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech clearly outline the goal and aim of this bill. I want to acknowledge the contribution of all stakeholders over a very long time who have contributed to the development of the new arrangements for the coverage of prostheses for consumers with private health insurance. I commend the bill to the Senate and hope that we will have some time to discuss Senator Allison’s amendment. I believe that tomorrow we will be discussing Senator Lees’s amendment when she has had time to consult with Minister Abbott. I commend the bill to the chamber.</para>

<para>(1A)  The review must include:</para>
<amendments>
<amendment>
<para class="indenta">              (a)    an assessment of the adequacy of informed financial consent arrangements; and</para>
<para class="indenta">              (b)    an examination of the extent of out-of-pocket costs experienced by patients for clinically appropriate prostheses.</para>
</amendment>
</amendments>
<para class="block">This amendment goes to the question of the review. Senator McLucas may wish to add to my comments. It was our understanding that the amendment to put in place a review had not actually been accepted in the lower house, but I now understand that the government has done so. Therefore, the Democrats amendment will be to the bill as presented in the chamber today.</para>
<para>As I said in my contribution during the second reading debate, we felt it necessary for the review to look in particular at the adequacy of informed financial consent arrangements and to also examine the extent of out-of-pocket costs experienced by patients for clinically appropriate prostheses. Those informed financial consent arrangements to which I am referring are for prostheses. If patients choose to have a medical device or prosthesis they will pay more under this arrangement, which is outside the no gap arrangement. Of course, like legislative arrangements concerning other potential gaps, such as with doctor or hospital costs, there are no legislative requirements to ensure informed financial consent.</para>
<para>We are all very well aware of the many cases of people who believe that, having held private health insurance, they will be covered for the costs of their treatment. It is only when they go for treatment, often after they make a decision or perhaps even have the treatment, that they discover they will be faced with substantial bills. In fact, the 2004 Private Health Insurance Ombudsman report said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Consumers generally do not have a good understanding of how much it costs to be treated in a private hospital. If a health fund member finds they are not fully covered by their health insurance … the amount of money involved can come as an unpleasant surprise.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">PHIAC statistics for the June quarter of 2004 indicate that around 20 per cent of in-hospital medical services provided to patients involved out-of-pocket costs. That means that a substantial minority of people are already facing out-of-pocket costs. We can assume from the complaints made to the ombudsman that some of these people were have not been well informed about it. The AMA has said that it is not the responsibility of doctors to ensure patients are informed about the costs that may flow to them because of the existence of this legislation. As I said earlier today, we need to pin down just whose responsibility this is. Hopefully, as part of the clinicians’ decision-making process they will take into account the cost-effectiveness of a particular prosthesis when deciding which prosthesis is right for a patient. It will be essential that doctors are well informed as to which prostheses attract gaps and which do not. As I said, failure to obtain informed financial consent can have substantial consequences for consumers.</para>
<para>We put this amendment forward. I understand the government is not going to oppose the amendment and that the ALP will also support it, although I leave Senator McLucas to say that for herself. I think it will make a real difference to the review if we spell out the need for informed financial consent to be part of that review so that we look at how well it is working, at whether doctors are able to work with their patients to make sure that they understand what the financial commitments are that are being entered into and also at the extent of out-of-pocket costs that patients experience for clinically appropriate prosthesis. We look forward to seeing that review and suggest that this will be an important part of that.</para>
<para>At this stage, I say again that this just relates to prostheses, although the Democrats would like to see a broader application of this informed financial consent arrangement and, indeed, an examination right across the spectrum of what informed financial consent means when it comes to private health and private health insurance. In fact, it may result in quite a substantial saving to private health insurance if patients were across those arrangements.</para>

<para>—I fully support these amendments. Indeed, I agree with Senator Allison’s sentiments that they should be more widely lodged or put into the legislation. One of the factors that limits people’s interest in private health insurance is that they are still often out of pocket and do not know that extra charges are going to be incurred. This is a very sensible amendment. I hope that the government sees fit to support it.</para>

<para>—The Labor Party thinks that the amendment proposed by the Democrats actually adds to the amendment that Labor moved in the House of Representatives, which was agreed to by the House of Representatives. It goes to the question of the review of the operation of the schedule. The House of Representatives have agreed with Labor’s proposal that an independent review of the operation of the amendments made by this schedule be undertaken as soon as practicable after 1 July 2007 and that a report of that review be provided by the minister no later than 1 October 2007.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Labor moved this amendment because, as I said in my speech in the second reading debate and as Senator Moore has said a little more eloquently than me, this is a bill of hope. This is a bill for which there is reasonable goodwill across the sector—from providers, consumers, health professionals and hospitals in particular, and from the political parties. This is an improvement on our existing arrangements, but it is based on hope, not data. It is a hope that it will improve existing arrangements. It is a hope shared by all those stakeholders that the gaps that will now appear—the gaps that will have to be paid for by consumers for certain prostheses—will be kept to a minimum.</para>
<para>It is a hope that the no-gap devices that will sit on the schedule as those required to be provided by the health insurance providers will be of the quality that consumers need and will also be appropriately prescribed. It would be abhorrent if people were making decisions about a prosthesis based on price rather than on the appropriateness of the device for the service that they require. It is also a hope that costs will be kept to a minimum. Surely we should be focusing on keeping the out-of-pocket costs to the consumers to a minimum. We are surely hoping that the costs to government through the 30 per cent rebate to the private health insurance companies will be kept to a minimum. The other issue of costs that we are interested in is that any savings that the private health insurance providers may make will be passed on to consumers through a decrease in their private health insurance premiums.</para>

</motion>
<para class="block">The annual report of the Wet Tropics Management Authority concerns an incredibly important and unique area in my home state of Queensland that is best known for the Daintree rainforest but also covers areas further south of Cairns, right down to Townsville. This area is very significant in terms of its environmental value and is unique in a whole range of extraordinarily important ways. It is a particularly outstanding example of one of the major stages of earth’s evolutionary history. It also has significant cultural heritage values, although it is not listed for that reason as yet under the World Heritage Convention. Certainly I would support the proper listing in consultation with the many different groups of Indigenous people who still live in the World Heritage area.</para>
<para>Many times I have spoken in this chamber about the threat in particular to the Daintree rainforest and especially those areas that are not within the World Heritage area but are in the middle of it and surrounded by it—areas that were subdivided during the not particularly lamented Bjelke-Petersen era. Incredibly valuable ecological areas of rainforest were basically subdivided into suburban blocks. Many of those are still covered with rainforest but are still at risk of being cleared. I know the local shire council in particular and also the state government, and lately and belatedly the federal government, have been trying to ensure that those areas are protected.</para>
<para>This report talks about another environmentally significant region that was voluntarily acquired: 98 undeveloped lots of freehold land to the north of Russell Heads, located 45 kilometres south of Cairns. That is an area that was voluntarily acquired. It guaranteed the protection of freshwater swamp, and the complex sand dune system in the coastal lowlands of the World Heritage area has now been transferred into the Queensland national park. It is unfortunate that the ongoing battle over securing incredibly valuable areas in the Daintree has not been resolved. These are areas where literally the last remaining examples of species of plants in particular survive. Areas containing species that were thought to be extinct until being rediscovered recently are still at risk of being cleared just to put houses on them. It is ridiculous that that risk is still there. I am pleased that there has been some progress but, until it is absolutely locked in and guaranteed that those areas can no longer be cleared, I will certainly continue to raise concerns.</para>
<para>This report also mentions an application that is currently in place for a proposed construction by the Department of Main Roads in Queensland of a four-lane highway from Smithfield to Kuranda. This proposal has the potential to have a very significant impact on the World Heritage area, and it certainly causes me a lot of concern. I hope the authority does ensure that a proper look is given to that proposal. I mention also my concern about the ability of the authority in general to fulfil its tasks properly. It has an incredibly important role, not just in protecting the unique environmental assets of this area; let us not forget the incredibly important economic benefit it brings to Far North Queensland.</para>
<para>There are an immense number of threats that continue to apply to the wet tropics area, in part because of its popularity. It is a difficult balancing act, but we certainly do not want the authority underresourced, with uncertainty about funding or with uncertainty about how it is going to be able to operate in the future. That needs to be addressed. It is something I am watching closely. I also notice the seven-year review of the management plan is about to commence. That is also an issue that I believe is very important. It involves the local community—the local Indigenous people in particular—and also the wider Queensland and Australian community because it is an area, as its name implies, that is of world value and must be protected.</para>

<para>—I also wish to take note of the Wet Tropics Management Authority’s annual report. In doing so, I pay tribute to Lieutenant General John Grey, the chair of the authority, for his leadership in some difficult times. I also want to pay tribute to Russell Watkinson, the former CEO of the Wet Tropics Management Authority, for his stewardship of the authority over a number of years and the leadership that he showed in bringing the community together around the preservation of this environmental, economic and social asset that is important not only to the people of Far North Queensland but to all of us in Australia and, as Senator Bartlett has said, across the world, given its World Heritage status.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In my few comments tonight I want to focus on one particular area of the wet tropics that gets a lot of attention. In saying this, I want to be very clear that the wet tropics are not the Daintree. The wet tropics traverse an area from Paluma, just north of Townsville, almost to Cooktown. Whilst the national focus is always very much on the area north of the Daintree River, between the Daintree and the Bloomfield rivers, we must remember it is a much larger resource than the area that we focus on. The reason we focus on the area called the Daintree is what Senator Bartlett alluded to: the fact that, under the National Party government in the 1980s, under the stewardship of Russ Hinze, it was agreed to freehold a large tract of land, much of which had never been logged. This is incredibly significant lowland wetlands. It is an ecosystem not replicated anywhere in Australia, and very few places in the world have this type of ecosystem. But the Bjelke-Petersen government agreed to sell it off to Mr Quaid.</para>
<para>When Labor came into government subsequently, we started what we call the Daintree buyback process. I have to say that, irrespective of your politics, as soon as you get to this area you realise and you agree that that is the appropriate thing to do. Unfortunately, the policy adopted under the Hawke-Keating years has not been adopted by this government, although there is some sort of piecemeal or platitudinous acceptance that something has to happen. Everyone understands that you cannot have housing blocks of one hectare in a rainforest where a house and then the garage and then the dog and the cat will go. They do not live very well with the cassowary, I am afraid.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, during the election campaign of last year, the difference between the coalition and the Labor Party was very clearly defined. Labor committed to reinvesting $7 million, along with the state and with commitment from the Douglas Shire Council, to continue the program, to finish the job of buyback and to make sure that our contribution in a financial sense sat well with the planning instruments that the Douglas Shire Council had developed. Senator Meg Lees was involved in those discussions with the government at the same time.</para>
<para>I have to report to the Senate the disturbing events at a very large rally held in Port Douglas a couple of weeks before election day, when various parties put their position. Unfortunately, the local Liberal member could not be there. They sent somebody to videotape the event, which I thought was quite interesting. The Mayor of the Douglas Shire Council read out a letter that was sent to Senator Lees by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, which made a commitment that funds that were allocated to the buyback would not go through the Australian Rainforest Foundation. Unfortunately, at that same rally, a letter from Mr Entsch was read out that said that of course the money would go through the Australian Rainforest Foundation. I do not know what this government thinks about people in Far North Queensland, but to send two separate messages and to think we do not talk to each other is a bit silly. There was a lot of confusion and a lot of anger at that rally. It was a reflection on the duplicity of this government in its treatment of people in more far-flung areas. I commend the Queensland government for what they have done.</para>

<para class="block">In April 1999 the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments entered into an intergovernmental agreement called the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations. The purpose of that agreement was to base all future state and territorial revenue from Commonwealth sources on an entirely new footing funded by the goods and services tax. Every state and territory government in the land signed off on that agreement, as did the Commonwealth. The essence of the agreement was to give the state and territory governments, unconditionally, 100 per cent of the GST revenue in place of the pre-existing system of Commonwealth grants. The purpose of it was to enable the state and territory governments to retire a whole raft of state and territory taxes.</para>
<para>In order to ensure that the state and territory governments were not worse off in the event that the GST revenues were lower than projected, the agreement provided for what was in effect a no-disadvantage test. The no-disadvantage test can be put this way: each state and territory was to receive a guaranteed minimum amount so that its budget was no worse off than it would have been had the tax reforms not been implemented. But, in the event that the GST revenue collections were greater than expected, 100 per cent of that surplus revenue would also go to the state and territory governments. The Grants Commission established the relativities between the states and the territories.</para>
<para>As we know, the GST has been a huge success. Collections of GST revenue have in every year been larger than expected and, as a result, all of the states have achieved a windfall. Not only have they got 100 per cent of what they would have got under the pre-existing Commonwealth-state relations; they have got a windfall surplus. Nowhere in the Commonwealth Grants Commission report has that windfall surplus been greater than in my state of Queensland. In 2004-05, according to the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook published last December, the surplus on top of the ordinary GST payments to the state of Queensland is $760.6 million. That is on top of the $7.3 billion GST payment by the Commonwealth to the state of Queensland. The 1999 agreement prescribes a series of state taxes which it was the purpose of the agreement to retire in the event that the GST revenues were greater than expected.</para>
<para>In 2004-05, Queensland gets $760 million of windfall not budgeted for by the state treasury. To put that in context, that represents one-third of the total revenue raised by Queensland from all stamp duties. It represents more than half the total revenue raised by the state of Queensland from stamp duty on conveyancing transactions alone. In represents 94 per cent—almost all—of the revenue raised by Queensland from gambling taxes. It represents twice—more than 200 per cent of—the aggregate revenue represented from land tax. There is this windfall gain. The deal in 1999 was that the states, if they got a windfall gain, were to spend it retiring state taxes. What has the Queensland government done? It has not retired any of those state taxes. It has not retired the land tax. There has been no relief on conveyancing duties. There has been no relief on payroll tax and no relief on gambling taxes. The Queensland government is flush with GST surplus revenue, but Queensland taxpayers have seen no relief whatsoever.</para>

</talker>
<para>—First I would like to note the contribution of Senator Brandis, who is also from my state of Queensland, and agree that the Queensland government has certainly done far better than any other state or territory government in terms of profiting from the GST revenue. I note Senator Brandis’s description of the GST as a ‘huge success’ because it has brought in more money than expected. It is an interesting definition of success from a Liberal Party senator that a tax is successful because Australians are paying even more tax than we thought they would. From my point of view, as a member of a party that has never been shy about recognising the importance of ensuring that we have a sufficient amount of revenue to fund social services, perhaps that would not be so surprising. But a Liberal senator boasting about exactly how enormous the tax take now is is worth noting.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I should emphasise that in some ways we unfortunately still have echoes of the GST debate—Labor versus Liberal—playing out in the current debate about whether the states should be getting rid of more taxes or funding more services as opposed to the federal government funding them. People are taking up some of the same lines because of their position on the GST. Senators would probably be aware that I was one of the Democrats who voted against the GST, not because of the amount of revenue it might raise but because of concerns about it being raised in a less than equitable way. I think if you make those sorts of assessments you might come up with different criteria in determining whether or not it has been successful.</para>
<para>It is about time for us to have a good examination, five years down the track, of how that whole tax shake-up is operating and whether there are ways to make it fairer, stepping back from everybody’s individual views about whether or not it was a good idea in the first place. Obviously, the GST has happened and is now well entrenched, but I am disappointed that the Labor Party have stepped back from their position of a couple of elections ago—not that I necessarily supported everything about roll-back but the principle of continuing to look at improving the fairness of the way the tax operates is appropriate, particularly now that it has been in place for some five years now.</para>
<para>There is a good case to be made for state governments to consider removing some of those economically unproductive taxes—those that whilst they might raise revenue have a negative side effect as well—and to counterbalance, whether in terms of economic activity or social equity. Some of the taxes that are still in place are exceptionally regressive, as were some of those that were abolished. If we are talking about what is appropriate for tax reform, one issue is how much revenue a tax raises—not just what it is spent on but whether it is raised fairly. My concerns are on the record about the GST not being fair. My colleagues did a lot to try to make it fairer—by exempting food, for example. Let us not forget that some of the state taxes that are still in place are also incredibly regressive, not least the gambling tax. That is an area all state governments should focus on, not just because they now have GST revenue to replace it but because of the real problem of their being tied to that gambling tax revenue.</para>
<para>As with many cases where you have state and federal governments pointing fingers at each other and saying, ‘The other mob’s to blame’—whether it is expenditure on social services, regressive taxes or addressing issues like housing affordability—I think that both state and federal governments can do more. I get really tired of them spending more energy on pointing the finger at each other than on focusing on what they are capable of doing. We need an approach where there is less finger pointing, name-calling and shouting at each other across the divide and more getting together and looking at where we can go forward, five years down the track, regardless of whether you supported the GST or, like me, opposed it. We need to look at where we go from here, whether there are changes we could make at a federal level and what states can do in terms of changing their remaining taxes or what they spend their money on. Some of them are doing better than others. This report does not go into that so much but it is an ongoing debate that we do need to have. There is clearly still a problem with adequate expenditure on social services—in particular, in Queensland—but it is something the federal government should take a constructive approach on rather than just more of the finger pointing, political point scoring and posturing.</para>

<para>—I would like to speak on an issue that is probably of interest to you, Mr Acting Deputy President Macdonald. It concerns the wool industry and particularly the debate and controversy at the moment about mulesing and the live export trade. Senators would be well aware, I expect, of my longstanding interest in animal welfare and animal rights issues. I have certainly spoken a lot about the live export trade for sheep, cattle and other livestock. But I have stayed out of publicly contributing to the mulesing debate for some time, even though I have a personal view, which would not surprise people, of being concerned with that practice. I felt that it was something I would leave up to public debate and the court of public opinion, if you like, in terms of the differing views expressed by animal welfare advocates versus some from the industry—and of course there are some in the industry who have moved away from mulesing already.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>What has finally driven me to speak out in support of those people in a much more public sense, even though I have supported them privately, has been the very aggressive action taken by Australian Wool Innovation and, in recent times, the Australian government against People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which is a US based animal rights organisation—particularly their decision to also undertake court action against Australian animal rights activists from Animal Liberation NSW. I should declare, although it is reasonably widely known, that I am a former office-bearer of Animal Liberation Queensland, which is a completely separate organisation. Nonetheless, I have an awareness of the people involved in Animal Liberation NSW, so I do not hide from that fact. I think it is totally unacceptable that people are being targeted deliberately by court action—by a body that gets a significant amount of government funds—just because they are expressing their views, views they have expressed for a long time, about the unacceptability of the practice of mulesing.</para>
<para>It is utterly counterproductive for parts of the wool industry—and I acknowledge that it is not all of the wool industry—to be spending money specifically targeting Australian activists who are simply expressing and have consistently expressed concern about this practice. The wool industry has publicly stated that it has agreed to phase out mulesing by the year 2010, which is in five years time. It is undertaking research into alternatives. The practice is sufficiently problematic that the industry itself has said it is going to stop it within five years, yet it is using the courts to try to silence people who are campaigning for it to stop now or are encouraging others to be aware of their concerns and not buy the product until it stops. I might add that that applies to the live export trade as well. I can understand why some wool growers are concerned about that—people’s livelihoods are involved. Naturally, some people react negatively to that.</para>
<para>Australian Wool Innovation were funded by government contributions of over $14 million in the last financial year, according to their annual report. They received over $42 million from the wool levy, which comes directly from wool growers themselves, as I understand it. That would be about 99 per cent of their income—a very small amount comes from royalties and sales of goods and services. So we have a body that receives over $14 million in government funding—I am not saying they are using that $14 million; I do not know where they are drawing money from or if they are getting donations for this purpose—using money specifically to conduct court action to try to silence people who are expressing concern. It is a very dangerous practice, and it is a misuse of the Trade Practices Act to try to sue people as has been done here. I have noted some statements by Mr McLachlan from Australian Wool Innovation which I have interpreted as him saying that he is doing this because he knows it will cost those organisations money and he wants them to chew up their money having to defend these things. I may have misinterpreted what I saw him reported to have said, but that is what it looked like to me—that much of his agenda was to try to silence and intimidate people and make them chew up their resources on legal action rather than on campaigning.</para>
<para>Last week, we had the extraordinary statement by Minister Truss suggesting that PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals—which is a very large organisation in the United States—gives aid and comfort to terrorists. I know that people get worked up about this debate, as they do with many other issues. People can say strong things occasionally. But for a government minister to specifically come out and accuse animal rights activists, particularly this organisation and by association Australians who are campaigning on this issue, of being tied to people who are giving aid and comfort to terrorists is totally unacceptable. A spokesperson for Minister Truss, according to one report that I have seen, has said: ‘The minister is comfortable with his position. We are not saying that there are deliberate links with terrorist related activities, but they are allegedly providing financial support, according to evidence before a US Senate committee, to one group, the Animal Liberation Front, that has been accused of so-called domestic terrorist threats.’</para>
<para>To use one allegation about one organisation before a Senate committee in the United States that has not been tested and then just throw in the blanket description of ‘aiding, abetting and comforting terrorists’ is taking the debate into the realm of the surreal. It really is getting utterly ridiculous when we get those sorts of over-the-top smear allegations—that they are in some way linked to terrorists—by a minister of the Australian government against an organisation like PETA and others that have been tied to them via the court action by the wool industry. It is the sort of smear by association that we have seen in other areas of this government but that I have not seen from Minister Truss in the past. He certainly makes strong statements sometimes about areas that he has views on, as we all do, but to make that sort of over-the-top smear is a new low for that particular minister. It is completely unacceptable.</para>
<para>I express my support for the people involved in animal liberation in New South Wales, some of whom I have known for quite a long period of time. They are people with very strong views and passions of their own. I do not necessarily agree with every view of theirs, but I certainly strongly support their right to express their views and put information on the public record about a practice which is controversial. It is sufficiently problematic that the wool industry itself has said that it will phase it out and some wool growers have already abandoned it and found alternatives. When it gets to the stage of government funded organisations misusing, in my view, the Trade Practices Act and of government ministers using unfounded smear by association with over-the-top labels like ‘terrorist’ against people that raise these concerns, it really is going too far. It is in those circumstances that I feel obliged to speak out in defence of people expressing these concerns.</para>
<para>There is no doubt a lot of suffering involved in mulesing, which for those that do not know involves cutting the skin away from the rear end of sheep to try to prevent flystrike. As has been rightly said, a sheep that is subject to blowfly strike is going to suffer a lot more than one that has been mulesed. The key is whether there are alternatives. I support the industry in funding research to find alternatives, I support those growers who have already shifted to other approaches and I support the overall decision to phase out mulesing. But I do not support using the courts, particularly if you are a taxpayer funded organisation, and I do not support Australians in particular but animal rights organisations in general being smeared in such a lazy and crude way by absurd allegations of links with terrorists when they are simply expressing concern about an action which quite clearly involves suffering for a large number of animals.</para>

<para>—Now that International Women’s Day is 30 years old it is understandable that many women might take for granted the achievements that have been made over those years. Not least of these is the right to family planning—the opportunity to make an informed choice about whether to have a baby, when to add to the family and when to choose not to proceed with a pregnancy. This is a choice young women now take for granted, and so they should, but it was a long time coming.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In fact, 30 years ago, when we were all celebrating the first International Women’s Day, family planning was still very much a whispered choice, discussed in hushed tones behind closed doors and with little or no help from other family members. A sense of shame often pervaded this issue. There was certainly limited choice. Pregnant unmarried girls had little option: the search for a cooperative doctor, a risky backyarder, the public shame of a few months in the basement of a public hospital and the inevitable adoption, or a hurried visit interstate for a few months. They were the days of high-risk decisions, little choice and public shame.</para>
<para>I had some experience of those bleak days when a young flatmate of mine became pregnant to the local stock agent, a deeply religious father of six, who walked away from her only minutes after she broke the news to him. She was devastated, not surprisingly, and her first thought as an only daughter, a churchgoer, was to end the pregnancy with as little disruption to her professional life was possible. Sadly, her choices were limited and we found ourselves one wet Friday night driving a couple of hours to a town where the local pharmacist had agreed to help in a less than salubrious back room in his shop. For this service he wanted in cash more than each of us earned in a month. I can still remember that old man and his dingy back room. After a couple of minutes my flatmate decided it was an unsafe choice that she was not prepared to make. He, of course, facing not only the loss of cash but also the compromise of an illegal service offered but not accepted, tried to block our path, shouting, threatening and bullying two very frightened young women.</para>
<para>My friend then found herself making a series of other less palatable choices, telling her parents and disappearing to the shame of a cold hospital basement where this talented young woman washed laundry until the child was born and adopted. Sadly there was to be no happy reunion for her and her daughter—she was killed in a single car accident just months later. Australia must never return to those shameful days. Our women must always have the chance to make an informed choice with their medical adviser, their families, their partner, their support network—whoever they choose. And they must be free to make that choice without coercion and without compulsion.</para>
<para>A few days ago I stumbled upon a <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian Magazine</inline> article that I had torn out and diligently filed away. It was called ‘The body politic’ and was written in 1998. The article outlined the extraordinarily sad story of a devoted mother of three’s decision to pursue an abortion, and the bitter public debate that ensued. Why, some seven years later on a day set aside to celebrate women’s achievements, has this debate yet again been politically torched? Surely our job here is to ensure that we remain a nation where people are free to make their own choices within a legal framework that makes sure these choices are safe, accessible and of a high quality. And surely the framework should also seek to overcome the barriers caused by language, culture, ethnicity, religion, disability, sex, age and even geographical location.</para>
<para>I am pleased to say that in my home state of South Australia, the only state in Australia with a fully publicly funded abortion facility, there have been vast improvements. Last week I visited a facility in Adelaide which offers the only publicly funded family planning services in Australia, where women and their families or partners can make informed choices about how they can best deal with an unplanned pregnancy. Each year this centre provides about 3,000 of South Australia’s 5,000 abortion services, with about 48 per cent of referrals coming from doctors and 18 per cent from family and friends.</para>
<para>The caring and highly skilled staff explained to me that the only theme that applied at every stage was the emphasis placed on providing informed and safe choices. The choice to pursue an appointment is the woman’s alone, and the one-week delay that applies between her call and the appointment could be considered a cooling-off period. During the appointment, women are offered an opportunity to discuss and access information about a range of issues, including continuing with the pregnancy and adoption, again with the emphasis on informed choice. However, only 10 per cent of women do not immediately proceed to end their pregnancy. In fact, a large number want to ensure the procedure can be carried out immediately so they can be at home when their other children come home from school. Many of these women are also coping with the demands of work, a country lifestyle and difficult personal circumstances including domestic violence and substance abuse.</para>
<para>An ultrasound scan is a prerequisite part of the procedure, but again it is the woman’s choice to view the scan. Some do, some do not; some ask for a copy of the image and some come back later to ask for a copy of the image after they have thought about it. After-care services in the centre, including a telephone counselling hotline and post-operative follow-up, are again provided as options. Appointments are then made at the woman’s request. Importantly, follow-up counselling is available for all women, but only about 10 per cent of women choose to access this counselling.</para>
<para>This was a very sad place. It was quite crowded. There were many people sitting in the waiting room. Sadly they did not have a great deal of privacy. The facilities in this centre could be improved, but the money that is given by the South Australian government for the service is not generous and the staff there have decided to use the funds available to increase the options for women rather than to modernise the waiting room. However, it was one of the few places I have been to where people chose not to establish eye contact with one another. I would hope that no member of my family would ever find themselves needing to go there. But, if they did, it would be a very safe choice for them, and that is the way I think all thinking people want that choice to be provided.</para>
<para>I do not promote abortion in any sense at all, and I do not believe that I am likely to meet anyone who does. But in passionately supporting informed choice I am neither pro-life nor anti-life. I describe myself not as a feminist but as a commonsense woman who wants, on the 30th anniversary of International Women’s Day, the choices for Australian women to be free from compulsion and free from coercion. I simply want to offer other Australian women the choices that they now have and not to return to the shameful, secret and unsafe days of the past.</para>

<para>—I want to speak tonight about an issue that should be important to all Australians, and I would hope that it receives a lot more debate—certainly in Sydney. I think it goes to the question of a prevailing attitude in relation to Indigenous affairs in this country and that there is an injustice waiting to happen. It is not a popular issue but one that people cringe at and tend to walk away from, and this is the question of Redfern. I raise this because there is no other neighbourhood in this nation that carries as much weight with the mere mention of its name. Even though there are large Indigenous populations in areas of Western Sydney, it is Redfern that is seen as Sydney’s black heart—specifically the area known as the Block, which is bounded by Eveleigh, Louis, Caroline and Vine Streets.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I was alarmed—I would hope like many other Sydneysiders—when I woke up at home in Sydney on Saturday morning to read the news on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> that the new minister responsible for Redfern, Frank Sartor, had told the local Aboriginal housing company in Redfern that he wants no Aboriginal housing on the Block. Frank Sartor has already revealed that the heritage laws will no longer apply to four sites around Redfern: the Australian Technology Park, Eveleigh railway workshop, the 23-hectare public housing estate and the Block. It is almost stating the obvious to say that Aboriginal people have lived in Redfern for 60,000 years; but, to be more specific, it has been the main area in Sydney where Aboriginal people have lived since the 1930s—attracted mostly by the work at the nearby Eveleigh railway yards. Indeed, when my family first came to Sydney from the North Coast, we stayed first in Caroline Street and then lived around Redfern, Alexandria and Waterloo, because that was where Aboriginal people stayed when they came to Sydney.</para>
<para>The Redfern Indigenous community have been involved in the conception and development of Indigenous community control services since the 1970s and were amongst the first to look at the establishment of legal services, medical services and the housing company, to name a few. I think that they provided the models for a way forward, but there have been some difficulties along the way. One issue was the lack of affordable housing for Redfern’s increasing population, and it resulted in an extreme housing crisis, with people living in the Black Theatre, then the Catholic church hall and then eventually squatting in houses in Louis Street on the Block. In 1973, after much publicity and despite protests from non-Indigenous residents and the South Sydney Council, the houses within the Block were bought by the Commonwealth government and given to the Aboriginal housing company. The aim at that time was to provide a communal living environment run by Indigenous people, for Indigenous residents, with affordable rent.</para>
<para>As the housing company have promised to deliver some 62 new houses on the Block, the new minister, sadly, announced that in the brave new world of Redfern there will be hardly a black face on the Block. After the Redfern riot of February last year, the New South Wales government’s response of 54 extra police and the Redfern-Waterloo Authority does not take into account or appreciate the nature of the long relationship between Indigenous people in Redfern—especially the Block—that goes back over a significant period of time.</para>
<para>The New South Wales government’s response is a tired and lazy solution that says that the only way forward is to open up Redfern to the free market. I read Frank Sartor’s letter in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> today, about accusations about the government’s response being racist, but if it does not come close to it I do not know what does. It is the likes of which we have not heard for a long time: the targeting of one race of people for exclusion. As many letters in yesterday’s <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> pointed out, would Mr Sartor call for the removal of Jewish people from Bondi? Would he call for the removal of Italians from Leichhardt? Would they remove the Chinese from Haymarket if the developers needed that particular land? Nowhere in Mr Sartor’s grand whitewashing plan for Redfern can Indigenous people on low incomes buy affordable housing. It is shameful that there is no talk about the people in Redfern and in the Block having aspirations to own their own home.</para>
<para>This is something that the government has been going on about for some time: moving from communal to individual ownership, yet we do not talk about and apply that same concept in places like Redfern. I think in this respect we have to ask the question: why can’t Indigenous people hold prime real estate in this country and why can’t they make something from it? In this plan there is still only talk about making the local residents just tenants; or, worse still, attempting to relocate them completely—probably to some far-off place like Macquarie Fields. We saw what happened there and we know it is going to happen again in the future.</para>
<para>It is no accident that the Block itself is in the state it is. It is the result of decisions and policies that have maintained both poverty and crime—and, yes, we do need to tackle those issues, but doing it this way is not the best way forward. I think there is a lot of credence in looking at what happened in Harlem with redevelopment there. Certainly the problems were far worse than they are in Redfern—and probably will ever be—and it is now back on the tourist map. People have not had to relocate. In the process, even former US President Bill Clinton relocated his office to Harlem. I see no reason why we ought not venture down a similar path and be brave enough to do the right thing—the morally correct thing. Redfern is, in my mind at least, the best example of a remote community in the biggest and wealthiest city, where local people cannot attract local jobs, they are not working in the local retail outlet centres, and they do not have all of life’s opportunities at their fingertips. They are not unlike everyone here. In that respect it makes it harder to understand why it is that these people do not get the same life choice to be able to own their own home.</para>
<para>Fingers are being pointed at the housing company, and people are saying that it has to deal with every problem on the Block—just because it has title to the land. The point I make here is that it is a housing company; it is set up to deal with the provision of housing. How does a housing company also deal with the issues of law and order, drugs, alcohol abuse, the abuse of women and children and so on? It simply cannot. That solution is the wrong way forward. It also raises a question. The housing company holds title to land that is held privately. How can a government, even using some notion of just terms compensation, all of a sudden decide to single out one group as against the rest and say that they are going to relocate them? It is an absolute travesty; it is a miscarriage of justice waiting to happen. That is why this issue needs to be raised.</para>
<para>Most of all, I accept the weight of public opinion: the range of problems that have existed in the Redfern community and in communities right across the country hardly garners support from the broader community to be able to recognise what is there. The sad thing about the whole debate is that even when you speak to local people they have somehow become immune or conditioned to accepting that this is pretty normal—there is no need to kick up a fuss or resist what the government proposes and it is okay that on privately held land, irrespective of whom it is held by, the minister can step forward and dictate what is going to happen in respect of that land. It seems to me that, if the new authority goes ahead with its plans, its ‘us and them’ mentality will perpetuate and entrench inequality in this country. Whether we talk about it in terms of reconciliation or practical outcomes, we have to recognise that the whole approach is one that entrenches the wrong outcomes and entrenches a perceived inequality that sometimes we fail to see.</para>
<para>To me it was a perfect opportunity for both black and white leaders to show leadership to create a relationship between the Redfern community and the business community. We have to realise that you cannot just draw this artificial line around the Block to the exclusion of what is happening beyond that. There are the non-Indigenous residents and the business community. If we expect to fix the problems in Redfern we also have to include those people as stakeholders—as people who have an interest—and make sure that they are involved in finding the solutions. We are not doing any of that. We are focusing on a geographical area and treating it very differently from what any person in this place would expect, irrespective of where they live in the country.</para>
<para>Whilst there is a unique opportunity and whilst I have read Mr Sartor’s response in today’s <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, I think that we really do need to recognise that something is wrong, something is amiss. We should not allow this sort of injustice to occur. If it happens here with Indigenous people—and I accept that it does not always attract full public community support—it can happen anywhere in the country to any other group. If the law is meant to apply equally and to be colourblind, the statue of the lady who sits up there with the blindfold has to make sure it applies here as well. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Not so long ago, Mr Wayne Sawyer, the President of the NSW English Teachers Association and Chairman of the NSW Board of Studies English Curriculum Committee, created a minor controversy with his very public admission that English teachers Australia wide have failed. They have failed not as one might think because literacy standards have not been reached, or because the younger generation is not so familiar with the classics of English literature. No—not according to Mr Sawyer. English teachers have failed in their task because the Howard government was re-elected. After romping through a veritable laundry list of left wing grievances, from industrial relations to refugees, and from GST to WMDs, Mr Sawyer laments that, despite the supposed Dickensian state of modern Australia, people, including young students, still voted for the Howard government. Mr Sawyer asked the question: ‘What does it mean for us’—that is, English teachers—‘and our ability to create questioning, critical citizens?’</para>
</talk.start>
<para>A cynic might answer that perhaps it means it is time to abandon political activism in the classroom for the sake of teaching our children to read and write. But, alas, I doubt that is going to happen. You see, Mr Sawyer writes:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">English for the last ten years ... has trumpeted the cause of critical literacy. Critical literacy holds as its central premise the education of the student to be able to ‘suss’ out—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">good use of English—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">how they are being worked over—by advertisers, by politicians, by the media.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">An activist’s usual response is not to admit defeat but to redouble one’s efforts. Still, perhaps critical literacy, far from being a failure, was actually very successful and the students were able to ‘suss’ out how they were being worked over by their English teachers, and thus re-elected the Howard government. Be that as it may, I am sure that most parents, regardless of their political views, are asking themselves at the moment: is that why we are sending our children to school, or indeed to university, as the problem of academic bias and indoctrination is in many ways even more pronounced in our institutions of higher learning?</para>
<para>So, what is the role of education? Should education socialise the young within an existing culture and offer them the basic means to succeed in that culture? Or should education give to the young the means to challenge and overthrow the existing culture, presumably in order to achieve a better life? Professor Roger Shattuck, the former president of the American Association of Literary Scholars and Critics, is far from being a conservative, but he answers the question thus:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We are overloading education when we ask it to reform society, to redesign culture, and to incorporate the avant-garde and bohemia in its precincts. In a free society, original and disaffected minds will always find a platform. The university need not provide the principal home for political, social, and artistic dissidents. The primary mission of a University is the transmission of a precious heritage.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Of a fellow academic who uses his English class for ‘unashamed advocacy’ of social reform, Professor Shattuck asks: ‘Shouldn’t he be looking for a slot in political science? Or perhaps he should be running for office?’ We could ask the same questions of Mr Sawyer.</para>
<para>From that point of view, I welcome the decision by the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, to set up an inquiry into teacher training in Australia. The inquiry will investigate all aspects of how we teach those who will teach our children, but it hopefully will also focus on some less technical aspects of the matter. As the minister himself recently said, ‘In far too many instances I’ve had teacher education faculties described to me as quasi-sociology departments.’</para>
<para>Our secondary schools are, of course, only one aspect of the general problem. Universities, if anything—and I can speak from some experience—generate even more opportunities for the politicisation and indoctrination of students. If I had 10c for every story I have heard over the years of lecturers preaching to their captive audience on political subjects unrelated to the course at hand, or of students being marked up or down depending on whether their political views agreed with those of their lecturers, I personally would be able to fund several scholarships to our top universities. It is time to do something about this problem.</para>
<para>In America, thanks to the initiative and efforts of Mr David Horowitz and an organisation called Students for Academic Freedom, the proposal for a bill of rights for university students is now before 20 state legislatures throughout the United States. The driving idea behind the student bill of rights is that institutions of higher learning should provide their students with ‘a learning environment in which the students have access to a broad range of serious scholarly opinion pertaining to the subjects they study’ and that their education should be free from political or religious indoctrination by faculty members.</para>
<para>One of the provisions of this student bill of rights proposed by Mr Horowitz is that curricula and reading lists should provide students with a broad range of viewpoints—not the current trendy ideas of the post-modernist, left wing, irrelevant diatribe that colours much of the university scholarship in this country. Most of the world has given up on this French post-modernism, but, of course, in universities in Australia—the bastions of lost causes—it remains. Other provisions are that students should be graded solely on the basis of the quality of their work and not on their political or indeed religious beliefs, and that lecturers should not use their positions for political, ideological, religious or anti-religious indoctrination and in particular should refrain from introducing into classrooms matters which have no relation to the subject of study. Finally, in addition, lecturers themselves should be hired, fired, promoted or granted tenure only on the basis of their competence and expertise, not because of their personal beliefs—trendy, fashionable or otherwise.</para>
<para>Needless to say, American academics have cried censorship and McCarthyism, seemingly oblivious to the fact that the bill of rights does not deny them the right to hold their own views or to teach what they want. The bill of rights is about ensuring that students are not taught from narrow perspectives that ignore all others with whom the lecturers disagree, and that lecturers do not misuse their privileged position as a bully pulpit to propagate their narrow views. As Professor Shattuck writes, ‘Constant appeal to academic freedom, treated as a special privilege for professors to speak their minds, neglects the accompanying principle of academic responsibility.’ We entrust teachers and academics with the education, not the indoctrination, of our children. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Nearly two years ago the SBS current affairs show <inline font-style="italic">Insight</inline> reported on the tragic story of a 14-year-old boy who was going blind in an immigration detention centre in Port Hedland. The case of Shahin Agdar was a case of extreme negligence on the part of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the then operators of our immigration detention centres, ACM. Shahin was suffering from an auto-immune condition that attacks the eyes. Although an eye test in November 2001 revealed that Shahin was almost blind, he did not receive an urgent medical assessment. In fact, it was four months until he saw a specialist—a delay that ophthalmologist William Ward said cost him his sight in his right eye.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am very concerned that a similar case of negligence is happening right now. I am concerned that another detainee in one of Australia’s immigration detention centres is currently going blind because of the department of immigration’s negligence. Masood Niroomand-Hooseni has been held in immigration detention for four years. In January this year Masood began to feel unwell, suffering cramps, dizziness, headaches, a loss of appetite and constant thirst. Masood reports that the medical centre at Villawood detention centre failed to test his blood despite his repeated requests and symptoms that would suggest a blood test was necessary.</para>
<para>In mid-January Masood collapsed during the night and was taken to hospital. The doctor at the hospital found his blood sugar level was very high and, as a result, prescribed medication. Later on Masood received an injection of insulin to reduce his blood sugar levels from dangerous levels. On Saturday, 29 January, Masood was found on the floor of his cell almost unconscious. He could hear but could not see anything. He was dizzy with a terrible headache. At eight o’clock he was taken to Liverpool hospital. The doctor at Liverpool hospital dilated Masood’s pupils and examined his eyes. She said that he had blood at the back of his right eye and needed to see a specialist ‘first thing Monday morning’.</para>
<para>That was over a month ago, but Masood has still not seen a specialist. Masood is very concerned that he will lose his sight entirely. He has a new wife and baby outside the detention centre and wants to be able to see his son grow up. Masood has repeatedly requested that he get an ophthalmologist to assess his eyes. He has even offered to pay for the specialist himself. But detention centre management and the department of immigration have not allowed him to see a specialist. Nor, to this date, has Masood had an appointment with a specialist in the management of his now diagnosed diabetes. During this time Masood has complained that his eyes are watering a lot and are red and that his vision has got worse. I understand that, if he has bleeding in his eye and the blood clots, then that clot will block his vision and it cannot be removed. Masood has had his eyes measured for glasses by an optometrist, who correctly told him, ‘I cannot help you; I can only measure your eyes for glasses. You need a specialist.’</para>
<para>In his 2001 report on immigration detention centres, the Commonwealth Ombudsman said that the department of immigration’s duty of care is not able to be delegated. In other words, despite a private company being contracted to run immigration detention centres, the department and the minister still bear ultimate responsibility for the health and safety of all detainees. There are many questions to be asked and answered about the competence of Global Solutions Limited to run Australia’s immigration detention centres. Last week the BBC exposed racism and brutality in Britain’s immigration detention centres run by the same company.</para>
<para>The department of immigration cannot claim ignorance in the case of Masood. On 4 February, Masood’s solicitor left phone messages for Richard Battersby, the department of immigration’s manager at Villawood detention centre, and sent a fax outlining his concerns. Nor can the minister claim ignorance. Francis Milne, a church worker who regularly visits detainees at Villawood, was so concerned about Masood’s condition that she faxed the minister’s chief of staff on 13 February this year. When I visited Masood at Villawood last week, on 28 February, he had still not had his eyes assessed by a specialist. By phone with him again today, I have confirmed that he has still not had his eyes assessed by a specialist. I sent a letter to the minister after my visit last week requesting urgent action.</para>
<para>Masood’s case is yet another example of systematic failure by the department of immigration to take its duty of care to detainees seriously. I have spoken previously about the numerous studies that have found immigration detention centres to be seriously damaging people’s health. The quality of health care for people in immigration detention centres, from Shahin Agdar to Cornelia Rau and Masood Hooseni, has been repeatedly exposed as negligent and culpable. Why does the department wait until its negligence is exposed in the media? Why does it have to be embarrassed into action? Why is it necessary for my office to badger the minister into getting this man with a potentially serious medical condition a proper medical assessment? How many tragic cases of medical negligence behind the razor wire go unreported?</para>
<para>It is becoming increasingly clear that the treatment of Cornelia Rau was not a one-off mistake but endemic in a system that is failing to respect human dignity and basic human rights. Mr Dick Smith, after his recent visit to Baxter detention centre, said it was ‘one of the most oppressive places I’ve ever been to.’ Retired Air Marshall Ray Funnell, who is a member of the government’s Immigration Detention Advisory Group, said the government had ignored repeated requests to properly research the mental health of detainees.</para>
<para>Immigration detention is supposed to be for administrative not punitive purposes. It is becoming increasingly clear that immigration detention is being used to punish people who have not committed a crime. Last Friday I was present at a dinner where Julian Burnside QC revealed that Andrew Kirk, the minister’s former chief of staff, had admitted to him at the dinner that aspects of immigration detention were indeed being used as punishment. Julian Burnside outlined Mr Kirk’s comments that punishment without the order of a court breaches the constitutional separation of powers and that the use of solitary confinement as punishment is unlawful but that the government would keep doing it until a court told them to stop. I believe that this is a further indication that the department of immigration is a department out of control, risking and damaging people’s health.</para>
<para>Too many questions from too many quarters have been raised about the conditions in immigration detention centres for the government to brush away these concerns. There must be a public judicial inquiry into Australia’s immigration detention centres. If nothing else, the unease on the government backbench should signal to the government that enough is enough. The government should heed the call coming from its own backbench to offer an amnesty to all those currently locked behind the razor wire. But it is not because the continued cruelties of our immigration detention centres are fast becoming a political liability that the minister should be announcing an end to the immigration detention centre regime; this regime should be closed down because it is manifestly illegal, immoral and inhumane. While this government continues to rob the lives of these young families, men, and women, and while they continue to allow neglect, mismanagement and even abuse, they bring shame on themselves and this country—a shame that Australians ill deserve.</para>

</talker>
<para>—Today, on International Women’s Day, I want to talk briefly about a centenary celebration that we are having this year in Senator Santoro’s and my state of Queensland—the centenary of women achieving the right to vote at the state level. In January 1905 legislation was passed in Queensland to extend the right to vote to women. To our communal shame, that did not include all women. Indigenous women, as with all Indigenous people, did not receive the right to vote and be full citizens until the 1960s.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>That achievement in 1905 is one of which we are very proud and which we must remember today, International Women’s Day. But it was not graciously given. The myth that somehow people woke up on that morning and said, ‘Now is the right time to give women the vote,’ is just that—a myth; it is not factual. Before 1905 there were years of struggle, debate and negotiation across the whole state. Women and men understood that the right to vote was an intrinsic part of being a citizen, but they were not all the same kind of people.</para>
<para>I think that one of the things this celebration year should bring home to all of us is that the people who were struggling for the right to vote were just like you and me. They lived in their community and gathered around a cause. Very often the people who were seeking the vote were the same people who were fighting the other issues of the day. Industrial rights were really important in Queensland at the time. Emma Miller was a trade union woman who was strongly involved in looking at equity of wages, working conditions for women and also the issues at that time around peace. Emma was a long-term peace activist. Other women in the struggle, like Leontine Cooper, looked at women’s right to have a safe home and at issues of education. There was no such thing as a typical woman activist. At least two groups were formed because they did not agree on many things.</para>
<para>One of the real shames is that we have not kept our history, so it is very difficult to find the records of the meetings that occurred across Queensland from about 1890 through to the success in 1905. It would be wonderful to see what was recorded, what kinds of debates occurred and the kinds of people who came to those meetings all across the state. At the time, Queensland, as now, was a deeply decentralised state. There were large towns all across the north and to the west because of the pastoral and gold rush periods. The people who were seeking the right to vote travelled across the state, not with the ease and comfort of today, but by dray and by train. They talked to communities on the back of the drays and in public places and agitated for things as important as the right to vote.</para>
<para>Those women and their male supporters at the time must look from wherever they are now at what is happening in our parliaments in the state and across the whole country. Women have had the right to vote for 100 years and, at the state level in Queensland, they have had the right to stand for parliament since 1915. The question now is not whether we have the right to be here but what we are doing now that we are here. At this time I want to make a couple of brief comments and applaud the speech we heard earlier this afternoon by Senator Ferris. Now we have many of the same issues around education, industrial rights and pay equity.</para>
<para>But I want to talk about health and choice, because one of the issues that is getting more currency at the moment than it has for a while—it is always there waiting for the debate; it never goes away—is the open medical right of women to choose. In 2005 one would have thought that there would be open acceptance that fair, achievable and accessible medical choices should be available to all citizens—men and women. Certainly one of the issues that we have supported in the long term has been that of strong family planning and women’s health centres being available across all parts of our country.</para>
<para>I want to talk particularly about Queensland tonight because, as I said earlier, it is such a wide, decentralised state. If we are going to be talking about effective women’s health centres which provide appropriate advice about reproductive health, sexual health and the different things that families and women need to know, we should be making sure that they are not just available down the east coast or in the capital city but that they are resourced and effectively placed all through the state. It does not matter where you live, you should be able with privacy, importantly, and open choice to attend doctors and medical support practitioners who can talk with you in a sensitive, informed way so that all kinds of choices are open to you.</para>
<para>Way too often this debate becomes focused on the issue of terminations of pregnancy, but it is much wider than that. We should not run away from the debate about abortion, because that agenda is there and we need to ensure that women’s voices are strongly heard. But not all people think the same way. In the same way that in 1905 people had strongly different opinions on a whole range of issues, now in 2005 we have the same range of opinions in all kinds of movements. What really concerns me and makes me frustrated is that, when we get to the discussion of women’s right to choose, mutual respect is lost. It is seemingly impossible, from my experience, for people to sit down and have a reasonable discussion about different positions on this issue. Emotions, religious backgrounds and cultural positions intrude on the debate and people are targeted, marginalised and not treated with respect. I would have hoped that by 2005 we would have learned the ability to debate and to consider the feelings of others without degenerating into the kind of passionate attack which seems to particularly colour issues around termination of pregnancy.</para>
<para>My hope would be that in 2005, with the legacy of the people who struggled to achieve the vote and the right of people to be in places like this, we would be able to understand people’s values, to talk and listen and to have appropriate debates. In 2005 I would expect any woman in this country to be given the respect to make up her own mind on all issues to do with her own medical health. Effective and professional health services always have to be provided. But by now I would have hoped that we would be able to have this discussion in a medical context rather than having a personal debate in which things often end up being said that attack people and not their beliefs.</para>
<para>As we celebrate in 2005 and as we celebrate on International Women’s Day, I think that we can look at the achievements across our history. We have had people who have been able to effectively operate in parliament, take on professional careers, access education and in many ways feel confident in their lives. But somehow, when it comes down to this issue of personal choice on medical issues, we lose that freedom and we lose that respect.</para>
<para>In 1905, I do not think they openly talked about the issue of women’s medical health. They certainly did not have women’s medical centres. Unfortunately, as we heard earlier from Senator Ferris, in the 1960s that option was not available either. I would expect that in 2005 we would have the maturity, the understanding and the professionalism to accept that women have the right to choose—the right to choose the doctors who will give them the support they need—and that they would expect that their fellow citizens accept that they have that right and not limit themselves to personal, vicious and hurtful attack. I also defend people’s rights to make that choice without being labelled publicly and without having their privacy compromised by people checking on what appropriate mechanisms they had taken before making the decision with their doctor.</para>
<para>In 2005, we have earned that right and we have earned that respect. When I think back to the women who were working across Queensland leading up to the 1905 decision about the vote, I believe that they would expect that the sisters in 2005 would have that right and freedom and would not have to keep up this battle as we lead into the second century of the right to vote and stand for parliament.</para>

</talker>
<para>—Tonight I wish to speak about a very serious challenge that faces Australia. It is the challenge of the so-called sea change phenomenon. This is something that is creating tremendous difficulties for local governments in coastal areas—the areas we all like to visit on day trips, spend time in on holidays and some of us look towards as retirement homes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Late in February, I attended a lunch organised by the Property Council at Mooloolaba in Queensland. The Sunshine Coast in my home state is a typical sea change community. Like other places in Queensland and in other states, it is clearly under very great pressure from the influx of people—visitors and settlers alike. New settlers place tremendous pressure on the infrastructure and services, and of course short-term visitors do not directly pay towards that infrastructure’s maintenance and development. The Gold Coast, another Queensland icon of tourism, faces similar problems, about which I have spoken in this place before and about which I will speak again in the future.</para>
<para>Tonight in the parliamentary precinct are some of the Gold Coast’s leading citizens, and I would like to acknowledge their presence in this place. We welcome scrutiny of the representative democracy in action and I say to the Senate tonight that the Gold Coast deserves your interest and close attention in relation to the sea change challenges which also confront that wonderful part of Queensland.</para>
<para>At the lunch to which I just referred, the speaker was the Mayor of Maroochy Shire, Councillor Joe Natoli, spokesman for the National Sea Change Task Force that has been set up by coastal councils around Australia. Mayor Natoli is an able advocate not only for his own region—his shire is one of a group of three local government areas that is home to 265,800 people—but also for the urgent need to find some way to cope with the sea change issue. Thirty per cent of the Sunshine Coast’s population lives within only one kilometre of the coastline and 60 per cent lives within five kilometres. In the year ending June 2003, population growth was more than 10,160 people—that is 3.8 per cent. Some idea of the pressures on the Sunshine Coast can be seen from the statistics on land supply: 1.2 per cent is considered suitable and potentially available for urban residential development; 1.6 per cent is considered suitable and potentially available for lower density development; 2.2 per cent is already developed; 8.3 per cent is allocated to road casements, railways and watercourses; and 86.7 per cent is considered not suitable and/or not available for residential development. These statistics would be very broadly duplicated in many, if not most, sea change communities.</para>
<para>Last October, Mayor Natoli spoke at a conference in Western Australia that was attended by none other than you, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, my friend and colleague. Mayor Natoli made an eloquent plea for national action to protect coastal communities, to provide them with adequate funds to meet growing infrastructure needs, and to plan properly on a regional basis for population growth that is sustainable both economically and in terms of the environment. In many ways, confronting this problem and dealing effectively with it is a true test of Australian federalism, both in terms of its capacity to reflect regional realities and meet the separate needs of diverse and widely scattered communities and in terms of its ability to react within the heavily structured three-tiered system of government.</para>
<para>Federalism itself, as an element of how we govern ourselves, is another matter on which I intend to speak out at another time. In relation to the sea change phenomenon, we have got to find an answer. There is a lot of argument in our political system over responsibilities. But there is one clear responsibility in this case, and that is that the states must make and pay for the infrastructure commitments that are vitally needed in sea change communities. The states encourage tourism and population shift and their local economies benefit from this through the GST on consumption spending by tourists—estimated at $60 billion in 2003-04—and by new residents and from land and other state taxes. It is their responsibility to help create workable communities.</para>
<para>The federal Treasurer is absolutely right when he says that the states are not spending their GST funds in a responsible manner. As honourable senators know, this is the very point that I have been making in this chamber ever since I entered the Senate in 2002. The Commonwealth has its own responsibilities aside from that of ensuring the states have access to a growth source of discretionary spending.</para>
<para>In relation to transport infrastructure, it rests in the AusLink program that is spending $11.8 billion—a $3.6 billion increase—on land transport nationally, including a massive upgrade of Australia’s east coast road and rail systems. The Roads to Recovery and Black Spot programs directly fund local government. This year under Roads to Recovery local councils will get $253.1 million to spend on local road priorities alone. In the four years from 2005-06 to 2008-09, a further $1.2 billion will be provided—$800 million directly to local councils for local road priorities and $400 million available to councils on a competitive basis for projects of regional strategic significance. These are projects which will strengthen regional economic and social opportunities but are beyond the boundaries or financial capabilities of individual councils.</para>
<para>The states must pull their weight too instead of just passing the buck to the Commonwealth and undermining their own constitutional validity in the process. Local government should not be the poor cousin, especially when it has to deal with the effects of regional and national population movement. Local governments are subordinate authorities to state governments. That is as it should be. But local governments should have the most powerful voice possible within their states and, as the essential third tier of government, local governments deserve to have direct advocacy access to the Commonwealth.</para>
<para>The Australian Local Government Association is a very able advocate and a powerful voice, and quite correctly it is represented on the Council of Australian Governments. The National Sea Change Task Force has published a paper that makes very interesting reading and also some very good points. These are supported by studies being undertaken by a team at the University of Sydney, which has also produced an interesting paper. I commend both of these documents to honourable senators and I seek leave to table a copy of each of them.</para>

<para>—One of the arguments put forward by the National Sea Change Task Force is that the sea change phenomenon is so important that it really requires special advocacy within government. I agree, and I intend to pursue with colleagues the matter of having a specific reference to sea change within the Commonwealth and state ministerial portfolios covering local government. How we meet the challenge of sea change as a national community is something that I believe requires concentrated effort at all levels of government and in the communities most affected.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Coastal area growth has clear national implications. It impacts on the environment and must be managed with that in mind. That is primarily a Commonwealth responsibility. It impacts on transport infrastructure and in the provision of services that are within the remit of the states. It heavily impacts on local traffic and utility services that are local government responsibilities. We need to address these difficulties with a single agreed outcome in mind. As environmental technology advances, as it inevitably will, we can expect that it will become possible to cope with larger populations in all but the most fragile of our environments. That is, in essence, the whole story of human advance since the Mesopotamians began farming and, despite the efforts of the Greens to argue otherwise, the clock only moves forward. We must work out financial and governmental mechanisms that actually put the money that is needed into the hands of those who actually have to do the job. That may mean that we need to experience a sea change of a different sort: one that will deliver us from the interminable arguments over cost shifting—invariably downwards—and the resulting disputes over political responsibility.</para>
<para>When I attended that Property Council lunch at Mooloolaba last month, I did so, I frankly admit, not fully realising the urgency of dealing with a phenomenon that, when I thought about it afterwards, I had myself experienced over many years of holidaying on the Sunshine Coast. It focused my mind. There is a lot more to be said about sea change communities and how they deal with the problem that the Australian community as a whole has presented them with. There is the issue of effective funding for works that must be done. There is the issue of lifestyle and change—often rendered in shorthand as developers versus greens. There is the urgent issue of funding and implementing a national strategy to protect assets for the future. There is the issue, noted by the tourism lobby, of the fact that local governments are simply not equipped to service visitor numbers. Finally, there is the issue of how all these things should be managed politically and governmentally. These and other matters will benefit from being raised at the ministerial council to be held in June and at a workshop planned by the task force in July on the Sunshine Coast. The National Sea Change Task Force has put a weighty agenda in front of the people of Australia. I would suggest that it deserves our deepest consideration.</para>

<para>—Without diminishing the role of the Defence Force personnel from other parts of Australia, I rise tonight to highlight the key role being played by Northern Territory based soldiers in Australia’s defence commitments on foreign shores. The soldiers from the Top End have travelled to a number of countries to act on Australia’s behalf in strategic operations overseas. We have 114 Territory based soldiers of the 1st Brigade serving in Malaysia as part of Rifle Company Butterworth. We also have 67 soldiers in Iraq taking part in Operation Catalyst.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Closer to home, I would like to specially welcome back from Banda Aceh 100 combat engineers from the Darwin based 1st Combat Engineering Regiment, who have been providing humanitarian assistance in Banda Aceh. I understand they are due to return home today from tsunami relief efforts in that heavily impacted area. By all accounts, the soldiers involved in Operation Sumatra Assist have performed their duty in an exemplary fashion. I am sure the way they have performed their duties will make both previous and future generations of Australian diggers proud. In fact, all Australians should be very proud of the task they have performed.</para>
<para>This was not a task that was performed in normal circumstances. You can imagine the horror these young men and women walked into. We have seen some evidence on the television, and we have read about and seen photos in the media of the sorts of circumstances they would have been working in. Coming from Darwin, I am used to working in the hot tropics. They would have worked in very difficult circumstances. There were huge amounts of debris. Communities that they were assisting effectively would have had no access to sewerage, septic facilities or fresh water. Fresh water was one of the most important aspects. Because they are a combat engineering division, they would have had the capacity to put in place water purification plants and the like to alleviate some of the most important concerns. Having purified water when there is no other water available is a critical issue. The temptation to drink from other sources of water can lead to the spread of diseases, such as cholera, and those sorts of issues. Some 4.7 million litres of clean water was created over the period of time that the engineering regiment was in Banda Aceh.</para>
<para>There was 9,000 cubic metres of debris. Some quick maths will tell you that that is about 3,000 tonnes of debris. Much of this debris was not shifted with bulldozers. When these people first went there, this was pick and shovel work, carried out in the sun and in the most horrific conditions. These men and women have done an absolutely outstanding job. The efforts of the Territory based Army engineers embody the spirit—born of Anzac—of pushing on in the face of adversity. It did not matter how bad the conditions got; these brave men and women put their shoulders to the wheel. They should make every single Australian proud. I welcome the diggers home and congratulate them on a job well done.</para>
<para>I have had some concerns recently about those who have questioned the readiness of 1st Brigade—again, from the Northern Territory—to deploy a 450-strong task force to Al Muthanna in Iraq. Those questions are clearly misinformed. I have some concerns about the source of some of that information. I know Kim Beazley said something on this today. This man has form. As I recall, he had a fair bit to do with defence in previous iterations. He was the Minister for Defence for a large number of years. One would think that he would understand very clearly the capacity of 1st Brigade and their capacity in an operational area. He should not be making the sorts of outrageous comments that were attributed to him.</para>
<para>Mr Beazley said this morning that he has a real concern about the way in which troops are being equipped and supported to undertake the mission that they have been asked to undertake. I would like to put the Leader of the Opposition’s mind at ease. Before he made these derogatory comments about our brave young men and women who go to service Australia’s concerns overseas, he should have made the effort to travel to Robertson Barracks to talk to the brigadier, to meet these men and women, to have a look at the sorts of circumstances in which they operate and to then consider their state of readiness. If a journey to the most beautiful place in the world, the Northern Territory, is a bit much for him, he could simply seek a brief from the minister’s office, because that is readily available to both sides of parliament.</para>
<para>When I visited 2RAR, 2nd Cavalry Regiment, I watched these soldiers train. I have spoken to them about their state of readiness. I have spoken to the officers that are leading the task force. Not only is the task force well on track and ready to deploy; their training is the very best in the world. I am absolutely certain that they will make all Australians extremely proud with the wonderful job that they are going to do and the wonderful contribution that they are going to make. In a matter of weeks now, 1st Brigade will be leaving for the Al Muthanna region and is going to be as well prepared as any military unit can be.</para>
<para>The soldiers I spoke to told me: ‘I have come back from Iraq. I have some language skills; I have some good cultural connectivity.’ Most importantly, they are about to go into a cycle at the combat training centre. I have participated as part of the Australian Defence Force parliamentary program in that excellent process. They are put on country. There are no surprises for these people. When they go into the cycle of the combat training centre, the expectations are that people will speak English, that people will not steal their gear and that the centre will provide opportunities for experiential learning that they would not get anywhere else except in an operational sphere. The soldiers that come out of that process are second to none. There is no higher state of readiness.</para>
<para>Reading what was said by the Leader of the Opposition, I am supposed to assume that we are ill equipped. Perhaps he is referring to the 40-odd ASLAVs that will go with those men in the deployment. They have shown their metal on the battlefield in action in recent times and have been shown to be the very finest. We continue to work at upgrading those systems. We now have turret-down, cap-down services whereby the .50 calibre or the 20 millimetre gun can be brought to bear and activated without having someone’s scone sticking out of the top of the ASLAV. These are great innovations. We are continuing to improve that. We have ballistic vests around the inside of all the ASLAVs. They are being fitted prior to being deployed. We are providing them with the very best. I think it is an absolute shame that the Leader of the Opposition should have so little concern for the men, women and soldiers that are going over there and their families as to make such an outrageous, misinformed statement about the process.</para>
<para>The Australian government do not send the sons of this nation into potential harm unless we are absolutely sure that they have the very best equipment and the very best training. We are in a position to help, and it is our responsibility to lend a hand. I, like every other Australian, was absolutely thrilled to bits to see the birth of the world’s youngest democracy. I am so proud of the role that Australian soldiers played in that. Can you imagine going to the election when 30 of your mates get shot on the way there? Sixty per cent of Iraq turned out, under fire, to go and create that democracy.</para>
<para>It is difficult in Iraq. Nobody resiles from that. But, just because it gets tough, we are not going to cut and run—despite the suggestions of those on the other side. We have a responsibility at this critical time—and the Prime Minister referred to it as the tipping point—to provide the assistance. It is not just helping someone out. It is not a handout; it is a hand up. We are helping people with critical training so that they can take their affairs in hand. That is the sort of help we are providing. I say to the newest democracy: ‘When you’re mates with Australians, you’re mates whether the going gets tough or otherwise. We’ll be there through thick and thin, as we have been since the formation of Anzac. We are not going to back off on this, despite the criticism from others.’</para>
<para>This deployment is particularly important because it looks after one of our key allies in the Asian region. Looking after the Japanese and looking after that region is an investment in developing that regional partnership. I am very proud to have fine young people living in the Northern Territory and I want them to know that their families have my full support and that of this government for the duration of this deployment and beyond.</para>

<para>—I rise tonight to provide a contribution to a debate that has been going on not only for the last 12 months but for many decades in this country. It has been rehighlighted in the last few months. I have chosen International Women’s Day to put on the public record my views about the matter of abortion. I want to begin by saying that I come from a family of very strong women—I had two very strong grandmothers and a very strong mother—who certainly do not resile from their principles and who have always upheld strong beliefs in a range of matters. I have to say we are never shy petals in putting forward these beliefs. I have bred three wonderful women in Melinda, Amanda and Kate, who I know will follow in the footsteps of my grandmothers. They, too, have never been too backward in saying what they think about a particular issue. I am very proud of that and could probably at times be accused of encouraging it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I think it is the strength of your family inheritance and a sense of purpose which brings particular people to this parliament. For me, one of the issues in coming to this parliament was that there was a need to raise the issues associated with the legislation and the deliberations in the federal parliament that affect women. The issue of abortion is an issue central to women and highlights why quite a number of us are here.</para>
<para>I know that Senator Moore spoke earlier about Senator Ferris’s speech in the chamber this afternoon. She spoke about International Women’s Day. Senator Ferris started that speech by making a comment about spiders and the fact that there was a matter of choice. In this country there is choice for a whole range of citizens. It is a signal of our freedom and of the opportunity that we have in this country. We have choice in a whole range of areas. We can choose whether to smoke or not to smoke and whether to take drugs or not to take drugs. We can choose what school we want to go to and what school we do not want to go to. We can choose what doctor we go to and what doctor we do not go to. But women, particularly, have a very special choice: whether or not they have a child.</para>
<para>The status report on women which was tabled today, which Senator Patterson launched at lunchtime, outlined some of the choices and responses that people have about these areas. Of course, it was a report about women. We have choices about body image, choices about our sex lives and choices about reproductive health. I think the recent debate about abortion hides behind the concern that more information is needed. We have had people in this parliament tabling questions on notice, as they are quite right to do. We have had people suggesting that more statistics ought to be kept. But what I believe really seeks to push the agenda is a sense of others trying to impose their morality on women’s rights—to move women’s rights and their right to choose off the agenda. It is an attempt to limit the choices that women have and to take control over what a woman should decide: what is best for her, both mentally and physically. To suggest that a man should tell me, as a woman, what I should and should not do when it comes to how I regulate my body in terms of its physical or mental wellbeing is something I find offensive, and I do not agree with it. I know that 81 per cent of Australians actually support the right of women to have that choice and in fact support the right of women to choose to have an abortion if they want to.</para>
<para>Let me spend some time putting some facts on the table. Abortions can be performed in public hospitals, private hospitals, day clinics or doctors’ surgeries—in other words, in private clinics. We know that, if an abortion is performed on a public patient in a public hospital, there is no Medicare rebate payable and the data on the total number of abortions performed will only be available if the public hospital or state government releases it. If an abortion is performed on an admitted patient in a private hospital or on an admitted private patient in a public hospital then the patient may be eligible for a Medicare rebate equal to 75 per cent of the schedule fee. There are two Medicare item numbers which relate to procedures that can be used for abortion. Procedures to which these two items relate are also used for other purposes, such as dealing with the consequences of a spontaneous miscarriage. There is no way of telling from the Medicare data what the purpose of the procedure was.</para>
<para>According to Parliamentary Library research, from information received from the Department of Health and Ageing, private health insurance legislation and regulations do not make specific reference to pregnancy terminations. It is a condition of registration that private health insurance funds must provide coverage for all items on the schedule of Medicare benefits as long as they are performed in registered hospitals or day centres. The federal government does assist with the funding of abortion in four ways: it pays Medicare rebates, it funds the Medicare safety net, it funds the private health insurance 30 per cent rebate and it makes a Commonwealth contribution to the funding of public hospitals.</para>
<para>How many abortions are there? As far as we know, only South Australia collects comprehensive data. We do know, however, that the number of Medicare rebates for the two procedures that can be used for abortion is often used publicly as if it is the number of abortions. However, this number gives an inaccurate picture. The procedures are used for purposes other than abortion. The Medicare rebates do not apply to public patients in public hospitals. One study has indicated that up to 10 per cent of women who would be eligible for a Medicare rebate for an abortion do not claim—presumably because of an extreme sensitivity about confidentiality. Also, these Medicare items are not used for third trimester abortions because the procedures are not suitable. In 1996, the NHMRC stated that around one in every four known pregnancies in Australia is terminated. That is down from one in every three pregnancies in the 1930s. Of course, that was when contraception was not readily available.</para>
<para>But I think we ought to look at who has an abortion these days, and why. What we can tell from the statistics, surprisingly enough, is that most abortions are performed on the 25 to 34 age group. The past decade has seen a dramatic ageing of the average abortion patient. The proportion of Medicare funded abortions done for teenagers has actually fallen by 12 per cent. The proportion of patients over 35 rose by 37 per cent. In every year since 1995, abortion patients have been more likely to be over 35 than under 20. In other words, what we are seeing is a trend towards older women, rather than teenagers, having an abortion. Data from Sydney, for example, shows that the number of abortions for women over 40 increased 250 per cent between 1992 and 2002 and that an abortion patient was 40 per cent more likely to be married or in a de facto relationship in 2002 than in 1992. I think they are some interesting statistics that, if I have time, I will come back to.</para>
<para>We also know that in all states and territories, except the ACT, the practise of abortion is regulated through the relevant criminal code. Of course, in the ACT it is in the health code. The procedure is not regarded as illegal if it is undertaken to protect physical or mental health. We know that access to safe abortion has reduced the high rates of women suffering negative outcomes. Before 1971 abortion was a major cause of maternal deaths in Australia. The World Health Organisation reports the risk of maternal death from unsafe abortion is 100 to 500 times greater than the risk under safe conditions. The impact of limited access to abortion through Medicare will have major implications. Fewer women will be able to afford the procedure and statistics show us that that will lead to more maternal complications.</para>
<para>We have a responsibility to ensure that there is equal access for women to all procedures in our health system. We should not provide a gateway of morality. Women have a right to control their body and we, as a parliament and as legislators, should support and respect this. Women make decisions about their fertility, planned or unplanned pregnancies, regardless of their situations, their views and their beliefs. They know their situation, they know their beliefs and sometimes the decision is not an easy one. But we should ensure that what we are doing is actually supporting those women who choose to make that decision. We should have a look at the current debate. We should question whether or not we provide enough sex education in our schools, whether we fund family planning clinics adequately and whether or not we should all be pushing an agenda that removes the abortion procedure from the Criminal Code and moves it into the health code, where it really belongs. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Both sides of politics support and applaud the contribution and sacrifice that our defence personnel make towards Australia’s security. Our people are of critical importance to our defence efforts, and every endeavour should be made to ensure the highest of standards in the management of our defence people. Labor expects that, when there is a breakdown in management practices, the Minister for Defence will take timely and remedial action to fix the problem. When no corrective action is undertaken, Labor will unreservedly pursue the government and the minister to remedy the situation. Our national security demands no less.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>That is why the circumstances surrounding the two official investigations by successive inspectors-general of intelligence and security into an allegation by Lieutenant Colonel Lance Collins remain bewildering and confusing. The Howard government and successive ministers for defence, including Minister Hill, have plainly failed to carry out their responsibilities to remedy what was an unacceptable and unauthorised action by DIO officials. I refer specifically to Lieutenant Colonel Collins’s original allegation, which has now been proved to be correct by the current Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Mr Ian Carnell, that in 1999 DIO officials deliberately withdrew access by Australian Defence Force staff in East Timor to a DIO intelligence database.</para>
<para>This action was taken without proper authorisation. Apparently neither the secretary of Defence nor the Chief of the Defence Force were consulted. The DIO action was taken without reference to our deployed forces and without reference to Headquarters Australian Theatre, the headquarters responsible to administer our deployed forces overseas. The cut-off was sudden and without warning. In short, the action was approved, initiated, monitored and restored by DIO officials. Sanity eventually prevailed. Let there be no doubt, this was a significant disruption with the potential to damage ongoing operations in East Timor and to hamper planning for future operations, particularly along the border between East and West Timor.</para>
<para>In 1999 tensions between Indonesian armed forces and INTERFET forces in Timor were real, not imaginary, and Australian lives were at risk daily along the border. These were warlike operations necessitating the fullest support the nation could provide. The safety of our troops was at threat. The loss of access to crucial intelligence information was without precedence. Fortunately a tragedy did not eventuate, but access to that database was deliberately denied to our military forces for some 26 hours. An incident was hidden from the Australian people until last year, nearly five years after it occurred, when documents relating to Lieutenant Colonel Collins’s redress of grievance were published in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>.</para>
<para>Lieutenant Colonel Collins has been wrongly pilloried for his actions and derided for the allegations in his redress of grievance. His career has no doubt been adversely affected. He was, nonetheless, finally proved correct on the deliberate nature of the loss of access, but it took courage and perseverance to continue to raise the incident within a bureaucracy that was far from sympathetic. Lieutenant Colonel Collins, of course, was the senior intelligence officer in East Timor. He had been personally involved in the incident. Some might say his actions as an intelligence officer were the cause of what happened, but for five years his allegation was mocked and scorned for reasons that still remain hidden.</para>
<para>In December 2000 he wrote to the then Minister for Defence, John Moore, on a number of matters, one of which was to seek ministerial action to remedy the deliberate blocking of access to intelligence data. The minister referred the matter in the same month to Mr Bill Blick, the then Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Time passed. In the absence of a response, Lieutenant Colonel Collins wrote again in 2001 to the Minister for Defence, then Peter Reith, who requested an update from Mr Blick. A year passed and in despair he submitted his redress of grievance, which became bogged down in a complicated system of additional investigations and administration.</para>
<para>These notorious administrative shortcomings have generated a Senate inquiry into the effectiveness of the military justice system, and I hope that the committee’s report will be completed soon. Eventually, Lieutenant Colonel Collins received an edited version of Mr Blick’s report in July 2003, which stated that the loss of access to the database resulted ‘from technical problems rather than a deliberate decision’. Lieutenant Colonel Collins knew this was wrong. During the period of no access, he had received an email from the Canberra based DIO project office managing this particular database stating that the loss of access was ‘not a technical matter but a DIO policy decision’. Therefore others knew Mr Blick’s conclusion was wrong.</para>
<para>Alarm bells should have been ringing in the highest echelons of the Department of Defence, within Army headquarters and, most importantly, in the offices of successive ministers for defence that something had gone terribly wrong. To remedy this appalling wrong, Lieutenant Colonel Collins now had only one course of action available to him: to write to the Prime Minister, which he did in 2004. His letter was also published in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>. It said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">During those five years, we saw the Prime Minister, Minister Hill, the Secretary of Defence and CDF Cosgrove publicly declare at different times that the loss of access was from technical reasons and was not deliberate.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">But it took additional inquiries for Mr Carnell to discover that that was plainly not the case. Indeed, through questioning Mr Carnell during the recent Senate estimates hearings, he indicated that he found it necessary to interview some 15 witnesses, three of whom were important DIO officials who had not previously been interviewed, and to arrange for technical checks of the relevant DIO service and communications links to confirm the new information from the additional witnesses.</para>
<para>As a result of these initiatives, Mr Carnell was able to establish that the loss of access was a deliberate act undertaken within DIO. Mr Carnell also confirmed that he was able to ‘ascertain who did the transactions and who gave that person the direction to do it’. I appreciate that Mr Smith, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, is presently overseeing disciplinary and administrative actions in respect of Mr Carnell’s conclusions. Once Mr Smith has satisfied natural justice requirements for those so named in the report, Minister Hill has indicated that he will then be in a position to consider the release of Mr Carnell’s report. It is comforting to note that Mr Carnell has made the task easier for the minister because he drafted the report with a public release in mind.</para>
<para>The release of the report is important because it satisfies the notion of natural justice and fair play for Lieutenant Colonel Collins. He has wrongly suffered for five years. It also satisfies the requirement to correct bad management practices in DIO that permitted this mess to occur. DIO has, as its publicised task, to provide all-source intelligence assessments in support of ‘the planning and conduct of Australian Defence Force operations’. The task is unambiguous—the provision of intelligence assessments for the ADF. So how could DIO officials withdraw that support without proper authorisation?</para>
<para>I have heard a number of officials state that the loss of access did not place our troops in danger because access to other databases was still available. What tripe! Does this government condone the concept of handicapping our troops in the field, or is the behaviour of this government about making sure our forces overseas have the very best that the nation can provide? Our forces should be given every support to carry out their mission and not be hampered by decisions taken in Canberra within DIO by officials not authorised to do so.</para>
<para>One might have therefore expected that remedial action would have been speedily undertaken once knowledge of the loss of access became known. One might have expected at least one of the three ministers for defence involved in this fiasco to demand explanations, to seek corrective action, to punish those responsible and to ensure that similar actions were not possible without the necessary authority, checks and balances. One might have expected departmental officials to be immediately involved in all those actions, not only to discover who authorised denial of access but also to discover under what circumstances access was restored.</para>
<para>What is so disturbing about the incident is the difference in the conclusions between the two IGIS investigations. Such a profound difference begs the questions: why was this the case and was there a cover-up? These are legitimate questions. Clearly, Mr Carnell and the minister are in a position to identify who authorised the cut-off and who undertook the actions within DIO to limit access. The public has a right to know how these actions were authorised without reference to the minister, the CDF and the secretary of the department.</para>
<para>At least one would have expected that the CDF, who is the commander of the ADF, should have been involved in the decision making to withdraw access to the database. What is even more disturbing is the role of the director of DIO in this episode. The director has apparently been found not to have authorised the cut-off, but he was found to have been implicated in the resumption of access. The public has a right to know why the director imposed new conditions on the Australian intelligence staff in East Timor in using the information from the database before access was restored. What right did the director have in imposing these new conditions? How long did this take and was the removal of access a means to impose these new conditions?</para>
<para>It is now widely understood in the defence community that action was taken to deny access after a meeting in the director’s office—a meeting which involved the director and the same three DIO officials who were not previously interviewed. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> Mr Carnell has already confirmed that the context of that meeting is addressed in his report, but there is more that is hard to comprehend. If the director, on hearing of the loss of access, did not take immediate action to correct the situation then his lack of action was in essence condoning the cut-off. If the director undertook no disciplinary action against the DIO officials who were responsible for the cut-off, either during or after the event, one can only conclude that those actions had been condoned. Knowledge of the cut-off without corrective action is by its nature an indication of complicity. That is why the role of the director in this matter needs to be exposed to scrutiny.</para>
<para>Mr Carnell indicated during Senate estimates hearings that he was obliged under section 21 of the IGIS Act to circulate his draft report to the director because he was the relevant intelligence agency head. This process involved interactions with the director, which resulted in some refinement of the draft report. In fairness to all, Mr Carnell added that the interactions did not substantially alter the draft report. This process, however, did expose a weakness in the IGIS Act where the head of an intelligence agency involved in the investigation receives the draft IGIS report. Nevertheless, Minister Hill must be satisfied by the actions of the director; otherwise, why would he have endorsed Mr Lewincamp’s departure from DIO to a position in the Defence Materiel Organisation at the same level of seniority and pay? In fact, he endorsed him publicly.</para>
<para>Was there something rotten in the state of DIO in 1999? It certainly was not the best of years—1999 was the year of embarrassing revelations of sex, spying, Simon Lappas and Jean-Philippe Wispelaere; 1999 was the year of damning leaks of DIO assessments on the role of the Indonesian armed forces in militia activities in East Timor. These leaks embarrassed the Howard government. The leaks were so extensive that an AFP search warrant was later issued to seek out those responsible and to close down the leaks. Lieutenant Colonel Collins’s name featured so prominently as a dissenter in the DIO world that his name appeared—wrongly, I might add—on that warrant. His home and office were never searched, but his name was splashed across the pages of the major dailies.</para>
<para>Also, 1999 was the year that the late Mervyn Jenkins, a DIO official serving in Washington, committed suicide. The circumstances surrounding the suicide remain unclear. There were two investigations into this matter. The first involved a two-person interview of Mr Jenkins in Washington over the sharing of classified documents with Australia’s allies. Some of these assessments were about East Timor. Two days after the interview, he committed suicide. The second investigation was initiated to report upon the alleged security breaches by Mr Jenkins, but the terms of reference for the second investigation did not include the requirement to establish the reasons for his suicide.</para>
<para>An unclassified report which was finally released in October 2000 concluded that there were no suggestions of espionage or personal gain in Mr Jenkins’s actions. It would be inappropriate for me to go further on this matter now, because I understand that Mrs Jenkins’s claim against the Department of Defence is still unresolved even though her claim was lodged in the ACT Supreme Court in November 2000, over four years ago. It beggars belief that this matter too remains unresolved, and I urge the minister to do his best to ensure a speedy settlement. Mervyn Jenkins and Lieutenant Colonel Collins were friends, and the circumstances of the investigation into the suicide were also a cause of concern in Lieutenant Colonel Collins’s redress of grievance and his letters to the Prime Minister, Minister Moore and Minister Reith.</para>
<para>East Timor binds the actions of both men. East Timor was the political story in 1999. East Timor caused relations with Indonesia to fracture, unsettled relations with the United States and found the Howard government wanting. East Timor embarrassed the Howard government, because its ministers ignored DIO warnings that Indonesian armed forces were assisting the militias in East Timor before the plebiscite on independence. The Howard government downplayed DIO warnings that violence would break out if the East Timorese voted for independence. It was many of these DIO assessments that were leaked in Australia and allegedly given to our allies by Mr Jenkins.</para>
<para>In the context of Lieutenant Colonel Collins’s allegations, Mr Jenkins’s suicide should be seen as another indicator of a DIO culture of malaise. That malaise involved inadequate training, poor instructions to and preparation of overseas liaison officers, unsatisfactory instructions on sharing AUSTEO intelligence with allies, and superficial investigations on security breaches—in summary, poor administration and management of personnel in working toward the core tasks of a defence intelligence collection, analysis and reporting agency. It was therefore not surprising that Philip Flood found it necessary to make recommendations on DIO’s processes when tasked to report on the performance of Australia’s intelligence agencies in 2004.</para>
<para>Mr Flood recommended that DIO should review its work force management structures, including a possible introduction of agency-specific work force arrangements, and undertake an integrated review of its business systems, including those for information, collection and liaison management. He noted that DIO ‘needs to develop more robust management processes and systems to underpin its efforts’. The management environment in DIO has been far from healthy. The simple act of pretending that something is other than what it is, the heightened level of cynicism that occurs through falsification of facts, the observed political flights to safety, or the devaluing of a person’s commitment—all of these in their particular fashion have undermined the health of DIO. Only the release of an unabridged Carnell report can clear the air. That is why Labor is pressing for a total disclosure of the Carnell report.</para>
<para>The Howard government has failed the test of a first-class government: the practice of ministerial responsibility. Ministerial responsibility is about generating an environment in which professionalism, integrity, courage, innovation and teamwork can be fostered—caring for the people in that organisation. It is also about setting the culture for the department that one manages and taking responsibility for that. Wherever I look, I do not see that commitment from the government or from Minister Hill. It should not be forgotten that in the nine years of the Howard government we have seen four ministers for defence, four departmental secretaries and three CDFs, not to mention a range of assistant ministers.</para>
<para>Lieutenant Colonel Collins should have been treated differently. His allegation in the first instance should have demanded the respect and attention of an alert minister. What has occurred in DIO is another Defence example in the government’s litany of deficient outcomes. But an opportunity now exists to correct at least one past mistake. If this minister cares and if the Howard government is concerned about the valuable contribution and sacrifice that defence personnel make on behalf of the nation then the Carnell report will be made available in full.</para>
<para>As I stated before, Mr Carnell indicated on 16 February during Senate estimates hearings that the main report, less attachments, had been written to permit its full disclosure. This matter—the deliberate denial of access to an intelligence database—is so important that I call upon the Minister for Defence to release the Carnell report in full as soon as possible, and detail: who was responsible, why did the cut-off occur, was there a cover-up, what disciplinary actions have been undertaken, and what corrective actions are now in place to prevent a similar incident occurring? Anything less would be to totally devalue the contribution of Australia’s defence personnel.</para>

</talker>
<para>—Tonight I wish to speak about the Australian Arabic Council and some of its activities. According to its website, the formation of the Australian Arabic Council was prompted by racism experienced by the Australian Arabic community during the first Gulf War. As a proactive response, the AAC was formed in 1992 to focus on the relationship between the Australian Arabic community and the wider Australian community. The purpose of the AAC is, therefore, in common with many other community groups representing Australia’s diverse migrant communities, to raise awareness about issues of concern to them—in this case Arabic issues—and to foster better recognition of the contributions made by people of Arabic origin to the cultural, economic and social fabric of Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Perhaps at this point I should add that it seems to me that, for the majority of Australians, the terms ‘Arabic’ and ‘Muslim’ are largely interchangeable—quite incorrectly. One describes a group of people who share a common ethnic, linguistic and cultural tradition; the other describes various groups of people united by one religious faith. Although Islam gave foundation to and shaped the greatness of the Arabic civilisation that dominated the Western world between the seventh and the 13th centuries, and Arabic is still a common language for all Muslims for the study of the Koran, the majority of today’s followers of the teaching of the prophet Mohammed are not of Arabic origin. In fact, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nigeria are the most populous Muslim nations. Conversely, not all people of Arabic origin are Muslim—the Christian Lebanese, for example. This interchangeability is, of course, one of the problems of perception that the AAC must overcome.</para>
<para>To achieve this purpose, in addition to the more general efforts to promote a better understanding of Arabic history and culture by other Australians, and to engage in a common campaign against racism by addressing its causes, symptoms and solutions, the AAC sees that one of its main tasks is to campaign for more accurate media representation of Arabic issues. Thus, the AAC established the AAC Media Award with the aim—to quote from the chairman’s message from the 2004 award—‘to raise awareness of the role the media plays in shaping public perception and the effects of media stereotyping on the fabric of a multicultural Australia’. The annual award was inaugurated in 1995, and the 2004 award was celebrated at the Sidney Myer Asia Centre in Melbourne on 26 November 2004. I was pleased to be invited to attend, and certainly found it an interesting experience, not least because of the number of small surprises that kept coming up—perhaps not what the AAC would have intended but nevertheless thought-provoking.</para>
<para>I want to congratulate the Chair of the AAC, Roland Jabbour, and other members of the council; award coordinator Nabil Sulaiman and other committee members; the judges of the award—Dr Ray Jureidini, Ms Farah Farouque, Mr Peter Manning and Ms Mary Kostakidis; the award winner and the other short-listed journalists. It was an event of thoughtful concept and high-quality presentation, and it was well executed and generously supported by sponsors. I should also inform the Senate that the AAC’s work on public education continues apace. Tomorrow night at 6.30 p.m., it will be hosting a free public lecture in the Sidney Myer Asia Centre, to be presented by Professor Peter Manning, Adjunct Professor of Journalism at the University of Technology Sydney, entitled ‘The war on terror: Australian media representations of Arabs and Muslims’. I have no doubt it will be another informative occasion.</para>
<para>Let me now return to the 2004 AAC Media Award. The guest of honour and keynote speaker was Mr Jon Faine, a Melbourne based ABC radio presenter of some note. Mr Faine was an unusual but outstanding choice by the AAC for this role. Firstly, he is Jewish. Secondly, he is all but unique amongst ABC political presenters in that, if you switch on his program and do not know who he is interviewing, you would not be able to tell from his manner and his comments what political party his subject represents—notwithstanding the fact that he is, or was, a self-acknowledged Labor Party member. Either of these attributes would have set Mr Faine apart from his ABC colleagues, and it is certainly to his credit that he carries off both.</para>
<para>None of these were the surprises that I spoke of earlier. For me, the first surprise came in the subject of Mr Faine’s speech. He spoke of his recent experience attending an international conference overseas—in the UK, I think—where he made acquaintance with the representatives of the independent Arabic television service al-Jazeera, who were ostracised by the BBC because of al-Jazeera’s controversial airing of the beheading of a number of hostages. That was the first surprise—not that Mr Faine would befriend the members of the Arabic network, but that the BBC would take offence at al-Jazeera’s coverage, considering that its own reporters were reportedly on the verge of being banned by the British forces, who were angered by what they considered to be biased reporting.</para>
<para>Mr Faine recounted that he found the professionalism of the al-Jazeera journalists above reproach. He later had the opportunity to visit the network’s operations centre in the Gulf, and again was impressed by their professionalism and integrity. So, after he returned to Australia, he undertook the task of canvassing opportunities for contact between Australian media and al-Jazeera, in the interest of fair reporting. To Mr Faine’s surprise—though not to mine—the reaction he had ranged from total apathy to outright hostility, including amongst his colleagues in the ABC. I think he thought the Australian media were immune from the mob mentality and biased values. I too was surprised, not by what he found but that he was surprised by what he found. So what Mr Faine offered was a salutary lesson on media behaviour and a cautionary tale that a harmonious multicultural society is something that requires constant nurturing for it to flourish, with a touch of holier-than-thou-ness, which unfortunately he then proceeded to discard.</para>
<para>A few weeks earlier, an Islamic school, the Ilim College in the Melbourne suburb of Broadmeadows, was burnt down by an unknown arsonist. In his conclusion to the award evening, Mr Faine alluded to this as an example of the malice and intolerance which we must guard against. A reasonable line to take, one would have thought, except that, the weekend before, I attended the Festival of Eid ul-Fitr in Broadmeadows—also attended by Maria Vamvakinou, the member for Calwell, and Commissioner Mick Keelty of the Federal Police—at which the principal of Ilim College, Mr Ibrahim Dellal, with great enthusiasm and thanksgiving told the gathering about the planned rebuilding of the school and referred with forgiveness to the perpetrator of the fire, who was drunk at the time and who had already been arrested. There was no racial overtone. But there might have been, and Mr Faine could not resist the temptation of an easy conclusion. Et tu, Brute? Indeed!</para>
<para>We then went on to the announcement of the 2004 AAC Media Award. There were nine short-listed news reports. These ranged in content from reports of life in the suburbs of Sydney to the analysis of Middle East politics and diplomacy. And here was the real surprise of the evening. Madam Acting Deputy President, I have something like five or six more minutes of my speech and I see I have only one minute of time left. Instead of detaining the Senate, I will merge the remainder of my speech into a speech tomorrow night on a similar subject.</para>

<para>—The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">All employers should make sufficient superannuation contributions to a complying superannuation fund for their eligible employees on a quarterly basis. Where an employer fails to pay the required amount of superannuation by the due date they become liable to pay the superannuation guarantee (SG) charge to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Employers are responsible for self-assessing their liability to pay the SG charge. The ATO has in place a comprehensive compliance program with a view to ensuring employers meet their SG obligations.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The ATO is unable to disclose specific information about its actions in trying to secure employer superannuation support as it relates to the affairs of another taxpayer. While this is frustrating to employees who may not have received their correct superannuation entitlements, it is essential that the ATO protect the rights of all parties.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I wish to emphasise that the ATO contacts all employers who are the subject of complaint and requests that they provide the name of the fund into which the contributions have been paid. The ATO will then check with the fund and make further contact with the employer in the event that the fund does not have a record of contributions having been made. Employers who refuse to co‑operate with the ATO or provide misleading information risk prosecution and substantial penalties.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Consistent with the Government’s 2001 election commitment, employers have been required to make at least quarterly superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees since 1 July 2003 or incur the SG charge. These arrangements are designed to ensure fairness between employees and to encourage employers to make regular superannuation contributions. Quarterly contributions will benefit employees in a number of ways, including lower employee exposure to the loss of superannuation benefits in the event of employer bankruptcy or insolvency.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Government is committed to preventing persons and companies abusing the corporate form by using phoenix-like strategies (such as changing corporate identity) to avoid debts, including tax and superannuation contributions. Both the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the ATO are actively pursuing companies and individuals that engage in phoenix company activity.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Government has implemented a number of initiatives to greater combat phoenix activity. Recently it implemented recommendations of the Cole Royal Commission by:</para>
<list type="unadorned">
<item label="">
<para>-       increasing from 10 to 20 years the maximum period of disqualification of persons from managing corporations for insolvency and non-payment of debts; and</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>-       forming a Working Party consisting of representatives from ASIC, ATO, State and Territory revenue agencies and the Privacy Commissioner to improve information sharing between agencies, which will facilitate greater identification of phoenix offenders.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Additionally, the Government has provided additional funding for ASIC of $12.3 million over four years for a program directed at targeted surveillance of insolvency‑related misconduct by company officers, including phoenix company activity.</para>
