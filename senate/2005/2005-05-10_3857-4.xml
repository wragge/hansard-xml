<para>—I inform the Senate that Senator Tierney resigned his place as a senator for the state of New South Wales on 14 April 2005. Pursuant to the provisions of section 21 of the Constitution, the Governor of New South Wales was notified of the vacancy in the representation of that state caused by the resignation. I table the original and facsimile copy of the letter of resignation and a copy of the letter to the Governor of New South Wales. I have received, through the Governor-General’s office, from the Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales, a facsimile copy of the certificate of the choice by the New South Wales parliament of Concetta Anna Fierravanti-Wells to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Senator John Tierney. I table the document.</para>

<para>—Order! Senator Evans, by letter dated 17 March 2005, has raised a matter of privilege under standing order 81. The matter is the failure of Senator Lightfoot to provide a statement to the Registrar of Senators’ Interests in relation to sponsorship of a trip which he took to Iraq in July 2004. Senator Lightfoot referred to the sponsorship of this trip in his written statement presented to the Senate on 17 March 2005, but did not provide a statement declaring the sponsored trip to the Registrar of Senators’ Interests until later that day.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The resolution of the Senate of 17 March 1994, requiring that senators declare registrable interests, includes in the list of registrable interests sponsored travel exceeding $300 in value. The resolution provides that any senator who knowingly fails to provide a statement of registrable interests to the Registrar of Senators’ Interests by the due date shall be guilty of a serious contempt of the Senate.</para>
<para>I am required to determine whether a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee should have precedence over other business, having regard to the following criteria:</para>
<para>(a)    the principle that the Senate’s power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and</para>
<para>(b)    the existence of any remedy other than the power for any act which may be held to be a contempt.</para>
<para>A matter has been held in past presidential determinations as passing criterion (a) if the matter could be found by the Senate to meet the test specified in that criterion, having regard to past determinations of the Senate.</para>
<para>By its resolution of 17 March 1994 the Senate has, in effect, determined that any matter involving a knowing failure to register interests in accordance with the resolution will automatically pass criterion (a). My decision on criterion (a) is therefore made for me by the resolution.</para>
<para>In relation to criterion (b), matters have been held to meet that criterion if there are no other readily available remedies. There is no remedy for the failure of a senator to declare a registrable interest other than the jurisdiction of the Senate itself.</para>
<para>The matter therefore clearly meets the criteria I am required to consider. I therefore determine that a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee may have precedence over other business under standing order 81.</para>
<para>It will now be for the Senate to determine whether the referral should take place, having regard to the circumstances of the particular case. If the reference is made, it will then be for the Privileges Committee and the Senate to determine what finding should be made on the particular case; for example, whether the failure to declare the interest was a knowing failure. I table the letter from Senator Evans. Notice of a motion may now be given.</para>

<para>—Labor opposes the <inline ref="R2221">Workplace Relations Amendment (Right of Entry) Bill 2004</inline>, for the reasons I will now outline. The principles underpinning any right of entry regime need to be about rights and responsibilities, the implementation of which are fair for both employees and employers. The bill does not meet this basic requirement. The principal objectives of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 are found in section 3. They include:</para>

</item>
</list>
</quote>
<para class="block">Freedom of association is a fundamental right. To have genuine freedom of association requires that an employee has a personal choice to access his or her union at the workplace. As a consequence of this general principle, the ILO’s tripartite committee has, for example, determined that unions should have access to workplaces to meet with employees. In Australia there has long been a tradition of allowing unions reasonable access to workplaces. In this bill, the government is seeking to severely and unfairly restrict employees’ access to their representatives and restrict the representatives of employees from being able to properly and effectively represent their members in industrial matters.</para>
<para>Another fundamental right infringed upon by this bill is the right of an individual employee to decide to collectively bargain with other employees. Collective bargaining is only able to be effectively exercised when employees have access to a level of skills, advice, support and information comparable to that of employers. Without such access, employees do not have access to a fair collective-bargaining environment. The according of a right to an individual brings with it the obligation on an individual to exercise that right with responsibility and to not unreasonably impinge upon the rights, dignity or civil liberty of others. That is why a right of entry regime has to be fair and balanced. The regime created by this bill is simply not.</para>
<para>A legislative right of entry was described in the former Industrial Relations Act 1988. Pursuant to section 286 an officer of an organisation was allowed to inspect premises ‘for the purposes of ensuring the observance of an award or order of the commission’. Those premises which could be inspected by the officer of an organisation were those occupied by an employer bound by the award or order, or those at which work to which the award or order applied was being carried out. An inspection under section 286 could be authorised by the secretary of the organisation, or the secretary of a branch. If required, the officer was obliged to produce evidence of this authority. Inspection could only be permitted during working hours, and the right to inspect was subject to conditions provided by the award itself. The section also authorised the interviewing of any member or person eligible for membership of the organisation. This regime was amended in 1996.</para>
<para>The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Act 1996 made a number of amendments to the Commonwealth’s then legislative right of entry regime. Since 1996, right of entry has been provided for through division 11A of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Right of entry is now allowed only for the purposes of investigating a suspected breach of an award, agreement or relevant legislation rather than for the general purpose of ensuring the compliance of an award or commission order.</para>
<para>The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Act 1996 abolished award based right of entry. Section 127AA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 provides that any award or order giving union officers or employees the right to enter premises or inspect records and other things and interview employees is unenforceable. Award based right of entry was replaced with a right to enter to hold discussions with employees who wish to participate in these discussions, provided that discussions with employees are held only during breaks. As well, a requirement that a union give at least 24 hours notice to the employer of their intention to enter premises was introduced.</para>
<para>The Workplace Relations Act 1996 does not at present limit the inclusion of right of entry provisions in certified agreements. It is common for agreements to include such provisions, although this is now being tested as a result of Electrolux and other cases in the High Court. Right of entry has been considered by relevant Senate committees on a number of occasions since these changes were made in 1996. A coalition majority of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee recommended in 1999 that ‘changes to right of Entry in the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999 should be passed, including requiring a written invitation from an employee and allowing the employer to choose the place where discussions take place.</para>
<para>The report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills on entry and search provisions in Commonwealth legislation unanimously concluded in 2000 that no evidence was put before the committee suggesting that unions should not have a right to enter. The committee found that, while dissatisfaction was expressed about the way that the provisions operated in certain circumstances, a voluntary code of practice developed between employers and employees, as opposed to legislation, was a more appropriate remedy.</para>
<para>The bill was introduced in the House on 2 December 2004. It was referred to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee on 8 December 2004. The committee will report today, 10 May 2005. The bill will further restrict the ability of union representatives to enter the workplace. It seeks to limit the scope of state law by using a range of constitutional powers to allow the Commonwealth to exclude the operation of state right of entry laws. The bill introduces a raft of more stringent criteria before a union employee or official can be deemed a fit and proper person to be granted an entry permit. The bill also expands the grounds for suspension and revocation of permits.</para>
<para>The government argues that the bill would continue to allow unions to represent their members in the workplace, to hold discussions with potential members and to investigate suspected breaches of industrial laws and instruments, but that this would be balanced against the rights of employers and occupiers of premises to conduct their business without undue interference or harassment. Labor believes that employers already have significant protections in the current act to enable them to conduct their businesses without undue interference.</para>
<para>This bill will severely impact upon employees’ access to their representatives. The restrictions to right of entry proposed in the bill would prevent employees from being able to choose to be effectively represented by a union in collective-bargaining processes and would limit unions’ capacity to ensure that employers abide by awards and agreements applying to them. The bill would prevent unions from being able to effectively represent employees who choose to be members of a union and from being able to recruit members. Restricting union entry to once every six months per work site for recruitment purposes assumes that the employer would have knowledge of the content of the conversations between an employee and a union. Further, the size of most workplaces would mean that many employees—especially shift workers, part-time employees and those in industries with high staff turnover—would not see a union representative at all. It amounts to a practical banning of recruitment at the workplace. There is no explanation for choosing this time limit in the bill.</para>
<para>As a part of the rights both to freely associate and to collectively bargain, employees should be able to choose to have conversations with their representatives without fear of retaliation from their employer. An employee should have the right to join a union and have discussions with their union representative without any undue interference from their employer. In practical terms this means that an employer does not need to know which employees are meeting with a union. Further, an employer should not know without the employee’s consent whether the employee is or is not a member of a union. And it is a breach of the employee’s privacy for the employer to know the content of discussions between an employee and the union.</para>
<para>Because of the nature of Australia’s industrial relations system, unions are the only properly resourced enforcement mechanism for awards and agreements. The level of enforcement able to be provided from the government departments’ inspectors is massively underresourced and certainly has no capacity to systematically ensure compliance with awards and agreements. This bill erodes an employee’s rights to freedom of association by effectively conferring upon employers a right to oversee interactions between employees and unions. The bill offends an employees’ right to privacy and potentially allows discrimination against an employee on the basis of union membership through the requirements for unions to access only members’ employment records.</para>
<para>The bill proposes that permit holders comply with a reasonable request from the employer to conduct interviews in a particular room or area of the premises and to take a particular route to reach that room or area. The bill will restrict the capacity of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to exercise discretion to resolve disputes in this area and again may place employees’ privacy and freedom of association at risk. Genuine freedom of association and an effective right to bargain collectively depend upon employees having ready, practical access to advice, information and representation by trade unions in their workplace.</para>
<para>The rights of workers to organise are articulated in ILO convention 87, on freedom of association and protection of the right to organise. ILO convention 98, on the right to organise and collectively bargain, is undermined by the proposed prohibition of right of entry as a legitimate subject about which the parties to an agreement may bargain. It is also inconsistent with the scheme of the Workplace Relations Act 1996—which seeks to encourage employees and employers to determine matters affecting the relationship between them at the workplace or enterprise level, subject to appropriate and fair minimum standards—to impose this limitation about what may or may not be the subject of bargaining, especially where both parties agree.</para>
<para>The bill is not balanced. It does not address any existing problem with the right of entry provisions. For example, employees covered by AWAs currently have no rights to visits from a union at their workplace. This is discriminatory as these employees have lesser rights to access assistance and information than employees on other industrial instruments. The issue is only partially addressed in this bill.</para>
<para>There is no compelling evidence of widespread difficulties for employers associated with the operation of the current right of entry provisions. Indeed, even the current right of entry provisions in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 make it difficult in practice for unions to operate effectively. The proposed more stringent requirements for granting a right of entry permit are unnecessary, onerous and discriminatory. The commission and the registrar have already shown an ability to deal with inappropriate behaviour by permit holders, including by the revocation of permits.</para>
<para>Finally, the bill does not create a single statutory scheme; it creates confusion. It replaces simple, well-understood state laws with a highly restrictive federal scheme for the sake of the 35 per cent of corporate employers who are currently covered by state systems. The bill adds to this confusion by proposing to retain different laws for small businesses that are not incorporated.</para>
<para>The bill was referred to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee for inquiry. The New South Wales, Queensland and ACT governments each made submissions to the Senate inquiry into this bill. Key points made in these submissions included: there has been no consultation with state governments, employees, employers or industrial organisations in the development of the bill; there is no policy case for change; there is no legal case for change; the bill seeks to impose a centralised ‘one size fits all’ approach on employers and unions; the bill aims to replace simple, effective and non-controversial state legislation; the bill would create contradictions with existing state and federal legislation; the bill will hamper unions’ ability to monitor effectiveness of state laws and otherwise carry out statutory duties; the bill unnecessarily and arbitrarily restricts employees’ rights to collectively organise using representatives of their own choosing, contrary to international obligations; and, finally, the bill will facilitate the identification of employees on the basis of their union membership, contrary to the principles of freedom of association.</para>
<para>A number of employer groups, including the Master Builders Association of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Mines and Metals Association and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, made submissions to the Senate inquiry. The views of the employer groups can be summarised as being in support of the bill as they believe it will provide a more balanced framework for right of entry. The employer groups are particularly supportive of measures designed to produce a more uniform or unitary national system of right of entry provisions. The employer groups believe that the bill will assist in preventing and addressing abuse of right of entry provisions. Employer groups maintain that right of entry should only be exercised where employees choose to be represented by trade unions in respect of a particular workplace matter and that such an approach is consistent with freedom of association principles.</para>
<para>Submissions were received from a wide range of unions and trade union councils. Key aspects of the unions’ submissions include the views that: the bill would impose unreasonable restrictions on employees’ access to unions at their workplace; the bill would place Australian law in further breach of international obligations in respect of freedom of association and collective bargaining; the bill ignores unions’ role as parties principal to awards and agreements; there is no evidence that there is widespread abuse of union right of entry and that the basis of the current scheme is in need of major change; and, under current laws, both state and federal tribunals have a wide discretion to revoke right of entry permits if they are found to have been misused.</para>
<para>The Senate committee was due to report its findings on Monday, 7 March 2005. This has been delayed until 10 May 2005 by request of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations as they are considering possible amendments to the bill. The department indicated to the Senate committee:</para>
<quote>
<para>Following a number of concerns raised by submissions to this inquiry, the minister has decided to consider some possible amendments to aspects of the bill. These aspects are the limitation in the bill on a permit holder being able to engage in recruitment conduct only once every six months; the maintenance of the existing rights of union officials to enter premises, pursuant to the Victorian Outworkers (Improved Protection) Act 2003—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">the Labor Party will be moving amendments in the committee stage in that respect—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">and the requirement that notice of entry must be provided during working hours. The department is not yet in a position to provide any details of the precise nature of these amendments.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is what Mr James Smyth, Chief Counsel of DEWR, said in the committee <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 18 February 2005. The possible amendments, while welcome, would not appear to be significant enough to warrant Labor’s support of the bill overall. The bill is deficient because it does not meet the basic tests. It does not prescribe fair and reasonable right of entry provisions that meet the needs of both employers and employees, and their representatives. In addition, the bill will override state laws and in this respect create gaps and uncertainty in its application. The states have not been consulted in the development of this bill.</para>
<para>The bill will undermine the role played by unions in ensuring compliance with the various awards and agreements they are party to, thus further eroding the rights and entitlements of Australia’s working people. Unions are party to awards and certified agreements. Their role is not confined to merely representing their members. As a party to a type of contract, unions have a direct interest in ensuring that the provisions of the award or agreement are adhered to, that breaches are investigated and that the award or agreement continues to meet the needs of the employees whose employment is subject to it. This principle underpins the current provisions permitting unions to enter premises for the purposes of inspecting wage records as well as other documents and things and to interview employees in order to investigate any suspected breaches and ensure the enforcement of the award or agreement.</para>
<para>The bill infringes on basic rights: the right to freely associate and the right to collectively bargain. Freedom of association is a fundamental right. Genuine freedom of association requires that employees have a choice to access their unions at their workplace. An effective right to bargain collectively can only exist when employees choose to have ready, practical access to advice, information and representation by trade unions in their workplace. In these respects the bill breaches our international obligations to abide by ILO conventions. Neither of these rights is anything other than undermined by this legislation. In summary, this bill undermines union members’ right to privacy, it undermines rights to representation and it undermines freedom of association and rights to organise. It compromises both individual and collective rights, and as such undermines the most basic principles of our democracy. Labor will oppose this bill.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I stand in strong support of the <inline ref="R2221">Workplace Relations Amendment (Right of Entry) Bill 2004</inline> for the fundamental reason that boosting productivity in Australia through a combination of workplace relations reform and sound economic management is the most generous gift that a government can bestow upon, firstly, its work force and, secondly, their families. This is a fundamental policy understanding. The government are committed to continuing a program of workplace relations reform that started in 1996. We are still doing it and we will continue to do it in the months and years ahead. We are doing this because it will improve living standards, it will increase jobs and, as I said, it will boost productivity and, indeed, enhance international competitiveness.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The good thing about this bill is that it commits to and locks in an election commitment right on the head. That election commitment was to reform the union right-of-entry laws and to exclude the operation of state right-of-entry laws where federal right-of-entry laws also apply. The right-of-entry provisions in the Workplace Relations Act confer significant rights and privileges on unions to enter workplaces to represent their members, but the government believe—and I want to emphasise this—that these significant rights must be carefully balanced with the rights of employers, such as small businesses and the occupiers of those premises, to conduct their business without undue interference or harassment.</para>
<para>The government also consider that as far as possible a single statutory scheme should apply across Australia. In workplaces where both federal and state right-of-entry laws apply, confusion about rights and responsibilities may arise. In fact we had an inquiry of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee and that confusion was made clear to the members of that committee. Such confusion and uncertainty can leave employers—small businesses, big businesses—vulnerable to abuse by the unions of their statutory right to enter the workplace.</para>
<para>Senator Marshall made it clear in the Senate today that he believes there is no legal case for this legislation. He believes there is no business or economic case for this legislation and for this reform. I would like to draw his attention and the Senate’s attention to the Federal Court case of BGC Contracting Pty Ltd and the CFMEU. The Federal Court found that unions could gain entry to sites under state right-of-entry law, despite the fact that all workers on the site were working under the federal law. This is clearly unsatisfactory. It is clearly in breach, in my view, of the intent of the federal law. It imposes an unnecessary extra layer of regulation and paperwork on businesses. So, in workplaces where federal and state right-of-entry laws apply, confusion about rights and responsibilities clearly exists at the moment. This uncertainty, as I said earlier, can leave employers vulnerable to the abuse by unions of their statutory right to enter the workplace and, importantly, can subject employers to inconsistency with respect to the law: whether they are a big or small business, exactly what law does apply to them?</para>
<para>The government believe very strongly that workplaces operating under the federal system should not be subject to inconsistent elements of the state system. Workplaces under the federal system should be free to operate under a single system of workplace regulation without having to also contend with aspects of the state system. That is why this bill uses the corporations power under our Constitution to enact a single system for right of entry, to the extent possible within the limits of this power. Where an employer operating under a federal system is a constitutional corporation, unions will be able to exercise their right of entry only under the federal act.</para>
<para>The bill will restore certainty. It will ensure a secure understanding by businesses and employers across the country of what law applies, whereas at the moment there is inconsistency and there are potential loopholes and complex duplications that the BGC Federal Court case has created—and this is the legislative response to that Federal Court case. So there is a legal impediment to enact the legislation to ensure consistency and there is also a business and economic case in favour of workplace relations reform. The Workplace Relations Act should be able to provide a single system of regulation for a workplace in which all employees are employed under the federal act. It was never intended that state law would be able to be used in this way to create a backdoor right of entry where none exists under federal law.</para>
<para>If the act is not amended in this way, it is conceivable that state governments could widen their state right-of-entry powers so much that unions could gain entry wherever they liked, even if they were denied the right under the act. This is a fundamental reason why we are proceeding with this workplace relations reform as quickly as possible to ensure that consistency is injected back into the economic and business environment in this country. It is also important to note that the bill will not restrict the rights of entry that unions currently have under state occupational health and safety legislation.</para>
<para>I want to make a few comments about our government’s past performance in terms of workplace relations reform. I advise the Senate that, since the Howard government came to office, average wages have increased in real terms from $811.80 a week to $961 a week. We have delivered historically low unemployment and historically low inflation. We have delivered high growth in real wages and we have delivered more than 1.3 million new jobs—that is, jobs that have been created. We are looking forward to seeing that locked in and bedded down again tonight with the Treasurer’s delivery of the federal budget, which will lock in the benefits that have flowed through to Australian workers and their families.</para>
<para>It is disappointing, in my view, that some in the union movement and other critics of the Howard government’s foreshadowed workplace relations reform are still saying that it is an attack on workers’ rights. What is good for the worker is the increase in real wages. The Howard government is a friend of employees because we have delivered—the runs are on the board—and we will continue to deliver, and we are confident about that. Sadly, the opposition in the Senate has already blocked 28 separate pieces of workplace relations legislation since 1996. The opposition parties have blocked unfair dismissal reform legislation, for example, over 41 times.</para>

<para>—It is reform fatigue from Mr Beazley. He expressed a view at the Australian newspapers’ sustainable development summit in Melbourne not so long ago and essentially said: ‘I’ve got reform fatigue. I believe that enough has been done in terms of workplace relations reform and we don’t need to do any more.’ The Australian public will make that decision with respect to whether or not Mr Beazley is spot-on. We believe he is entirely wrong with his small target policy and his view that nothing further is required in terms of workplace relations. I know the views of the business community and I am sure that the employees, particularly of small business, would have a different view.</para>

<para>—He could do exactly that—learn how to govern the country without actually governing. The Hon. Senator Ian Campbell has made it quite clear that that is an option for Mr Beazley, perhaps in his next chapter. In terms of bargaining at the workplace relations level, this encourages wage increases to be linked to productivity improvements. That is a fundamental understanding ensuring flexibility. Higher productivity, of course, leads to higher wages, higher employment and higher living standards—the runs are on the board, as I said. Workplace relations reform is, in my view, no magic pudding but it does produce a bigger pie for all of us to share—the employees, their families and the like—and the benefits spread. We have come so far, so why not keep going? Mr Beazley says: ‘Stop. Everything has been done. We don’t want to go any further.’ There is no reason to believe that, in another eight years, sensible reform cannot deliver an extra $100, $150 or whatever a week more for the work force in real terms.</para>

<para>I have long supported a single national industrial relations system to supersede the cumbersome spread of six separate federal and state jurisdictions and a jumble of awards. This legislation is part of the tapestry, although it is a comprehensive tapestry, of workplace relations reform. What it will do is simplify the arrangements for business. It will ensure certainty and security for business across this nation instead of having the hotchpotch approach that we have, which is our current 100-year-old system, which is indeed antiquated.</para>
<para>Let us have a look. Why do we need to clutter the system with costly myriad federal and state awards? The recent count of awards in Australia showed that there were over 2,200 federal awards and over 1,700 state awards—nearly 4,000 awards across this country. We have businesses operating across state borders. Of course they operate across state borders. They are operating in a federal jurisdiction and in state jurisdictions. In different states they are operating under different terms and conditions. It is that simple. So a single jurisdiction is the way to go. This was so eloquently put by the Hon. Kevin Andrews just last week in Adelaide to a business forum which was very well attended and well appreciated. If you read his speech—it is on the minister’s web site—it gives very clear arguments in favour of a single workplace relations system. It makes it clear that the constitutional powers are there, under the Corporations Law, to cover 85- to 90-odd per cent or thereabouts of the businesses across this country. And, of course, the constitutional corporations are covered.</para>
<para>In the last count that I had a squiz at, there were 857 state awards in New South Wales, more than 300 in Queensland, 80 in South Australia, 354 in Western Australia and, in my home state of Tasmania, 129-odd. Most large and small business employers in the states have to deal with this complex nightmare of both federal and state awards, particularly if they are operating across borders, as many do. We have many home based businesses operating across state borders as well, via the internet. In the 21st century this is happening more commonly. We are asking the Labor Party and the other opposition parties to come on board and to get with it to ensure the benefits flow through to the employees and their families.</para>
<para>Senator Marshall referred to the Senate committee hearings. Indeed, I was there with Senator Marshall. We had hearings, including here in Canberra. We had business groups—including the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Mines and Metals Association and, indeed, others—who expressed their views. The employers, the businesses, expressed their strong support for this legislation to be passed—and not only to be passed but to be passed as soon as possible. That is why we are debating this bill today as the first agenda item on the Senate list. I hope that the Senate will see the merit of this bill and have it passed quickly.</para>
<para>In terms of the Senate committee hearings, I was told of the different provisions applying in different states regarding the unions’ right of entry to the workplace. Why shouldn’t the same provisions apply across the country in the different states when you are operating under one system? Of course they should. Let us look at it from a business perspective, from the employers’ perspective. Let us not just see it from our perspective or the unions’ perspective. That is wrong. What is in the public interest? We know what it is: it is to ensure that this reform is passed. Legal experts have looked at the single-jurisdiction option. Minister Kevin Andrews made it very clear that the constitutional corporations will be covered. The large, overwhelming majority will be covered by this legislation and by similar legislation that has been foreshadowed by the Prime Minister and by Minister Kevin Andrews. It will remove the duplication and streamline the arrangements, and it will, of course, have a guaranteed safety net and minimum conditions.</para>
<para>I also want to mention that, in addition to the awards I have referred to—129-odd in Tassie—the business lobby say that employers in Tasmania have to navigate their way through 2,000 pages of laws, regulations and amendments, often covering dual federal and state awards. While large companies have an industrial or human resources department to deal with this—and, to give them their due, that is their right and entitlement, and indeed it is entirely appropriate—let us think of the small businesses that have to find their way through this myriad complex regulation and red tape. Let us make it easier for small businesses—and remember that over 80 per cent of small businesses are microbusinesses of five employees or fewer and small businesses of 20 employees or fewer. We have to be out there helping them.</para>
<para>Remember as well that, with regard to employment, small businesses employ on average 50 per cent of the private sector work force. That is where the work force is—in small business. In Tasmania, my home state, over 50 per cent of the private sector work force is in small business. We lead the country; we are a small business state. I want to support these small businesses by ensuring that there is reform of the workplace relations agenda and these arrangements, which, quite honestly, are antiquated. They are 100 years old and in desperate need of reform.</para>
<para>This is one of the reasons why the Labor Minister for Industrial Relations in Victoria, Rob Hulls, supports this approach of a single jurisdiction. That should be noted. Thank you for that encouragement, Minister Robert Hulls.</para>

<para>I want to draw the attention of the Senate to the February 2003 Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee report, <inline font-style="italic">Small business employment</inline>. Some people might think that this is new or revolutionary, but page 152 of the government senators’ part of the report of that committee, of which I was a government member, clearly says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Government senators also believe that moving to a single jurisdiction for industrial relations could do much to remove complexity and uncertainty from the employment framework and that this would be of significant benefit to small business.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Too right it will! We recognised that in February 2003 and indeed over the course of that inquiry, which took nearly 12 months. And here we are in 2005 and people would think that the sky is about to fall in. That is the way the Labor Party would like to see it.</para>
<para>In the few moments I have left, let us have a look at the Labor Party’s platform and views with regard to right of entry. Let us see what they say about it. The Labor Party’s current platform—the policy they took to the last election—proposes an enormous widening of the right of entry powers for unions. They have not said that yet here in the Senate. Let them speak about their own policy and actually own up to the fact that they wanted to widen the right of entry powers for unions. The ALP’s policy would have given unions unfettered rights of entry by abolishing this requirement and replacing it with the requirement that an industrial award need only have the potential to apply to a workplace, regardless of whether it actually does and regardless of whether there are any union members on the site. So under the ALP’s policy there would be nothing to stop union right of entry to a family home if an employer were running a home based business. Bear that in mind. So the legitimate role of unions in the workplace is still preserved. This is Labor policy. We have expounded on our policy. Let us hear from the Labor Party and the opposition parties.</para>

<para>This piece of legislation before the Senate is just one of many that the government will of course be pursuing. It is part of the broader attack on workers and the union movement. It really shows, I think, the hatred of workers that the government have. The very mention of unions for this government reminds them of Darth Vader and the evil empire. They think something strange is going to happen because a union is going to be involved in a workplace. Workers do have rights and workers do have rights to be members of unions. This bill will take away the freedom of association that is enjoyed by workers in Australia today. Workers depend on unions to represent them, and to take away the access of a union official to visit members in their workplace—</para>

<para>The bill will prevent unions from being able to recruit members, and recruitment is an important part of the exercise. But, as the minister pointed out, workers have a right to say no, they do not want to be a member. That is the way it is. It seems terribly difficult for employers to say, ‘You do not have to be a member.’ What about the pressure that is put on companies by the employer organisations to ensure that they have all of the companies in their organisations to represent them? Are they going to be restricted from entering workplaces? If a union official goes to talk to a worker in the workplace, there is good reason for it. Quite often the worker has said, ‘I want to see you about an issue.’ It could be—</para>

<para>—Yes, I will try to do that. He is so excited over there I thought he was one of those on the shop floor at a mass meeting. Anyway, we will press on. When a person wants to see a representative, it could be about a range of issues. That range of issues could include, as I said before, workers compensation or superannuation. It could be an issue that they have at home that is affecting their attendance at work. It could be a range of things, and it could be something that is private and that they want advice on. They do not want to be hampered by an employer standing around or stopping the representative going to talk to them at a time that is convenient to them. To say, ‘You can only see them in a lunchroom or in a special room that we have set aside,’ is a nonsense. It just shows that this government does not understand what the workplace is all about. How many times do you go to a plant or a workplace where there are shift workers and where there is a continuous process going on? The workers do not actually go to a crib room. They do not have that privilege. They eat at their workplace. They take their lunch or their morning tea break when it fits in with what is going on at work. So if you go and make your right of entry to comply with that and you go to the workplace, some may be working and some can usually stop to talk to you while you are there. It is not a way of disrupting and stopping productivity.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I took note of the comment made earlier by Senator Barnett that this bill will boost productivity. That comes out of fairyland; it is a nonsense. This bill has nothing to do with productivity. All it will do is restrict that ability of unions to carry out their proper and legal business. I find it difficult to understand why this government is trying to erode the rights and freedoms of any people. We fight wars to protect people’s freedoms and rights and to ensure that democracy reigns. I believe in democracy. I believe that we should protect democracy as much as we can, and democracy even goes down to the workplace. But that does not seem to apply to this government. It seems to think that it stops before you get to the worker and that the employer has a democratic right to prevent their employees from being members of associations.</para>
<para>If you look at the great developments that occurred during the late 1980s and 1990s, there were revolutions in industry, there were massive changes to productivity and there were massive changes to workplace structures and to how people went about their work. There was multiskilling and upskilling and cross-skilling of people so that they were not tied to one job; they could do a multitude of things. Workers were allowed for the very first time to take their brains to work. I point out that all that was brought in under a Labor government. That process has been hampered ever since. Those things were brought in so that workers have opportunities to do things. They have the ability to do a lot more than what they are given credit for.</para>
<para>All of those changes during the 1980s and the 1990s—and I was very proud to be involved in much of the restructuring of industry and workplaces—took place because the unions and the companies cooperated. It was not company led; it was not union led. It was a matter of companies and unions assisting each other in the workplace. I will point out, because it is so close to home for me, the now OneSteel plant at Whyalla. Look at the structure they have there. That could never have happened without the involvement of the union. The reason it did happen was that the union was prepared to work with the company and got credit and praise from the company for its actions. That was repeated all over the country. Workers, their unions and companies worked together. In workplaces where they were stifled—where the employer wanted to have the upper hand at all times—progress and development did not happen. Some of those companies are not in existence now.</para>
<para>Other companies came knocking on union doors to see how they could do it. They did not go to their chamber of commerce or their employer organisation; they came to the unions first. They said, ‘We don’t have a unionised workplace. We have only a few people employed. But can you help us make our company more productive and more competitive in the industry?’ And we did it. The unions did not hesitate. They went in there and they helped, taking the role of the employer organisation as well. They do not get any credit for that from this government because this government is too interested in knocking workers on the head.</para>
<para>I am particularly offended by the government’s approach to this bill—one of many that they will seek to introduce and force through the Senate when they get control in July. We come back all the time when we are talking about workers’ rights to the fundamental right they have to freedom of association. In essence, what this bill is going to do is prevent them having the right to freedom of association. That is what is behind all of this: stopping them being union members. If the union cannot freely go and visit their membership in the workplace then the membership will say, ‘We don’t need the union,’ despite the fact that behind the scenes everything is happening because of their actions. This bill will take away a right that is given to every worker. They will fight back eventually and we will have another revolution against the employers and the government for their meanness. The present government will not be there all the time. I look forward to them exiting the treasury bench at the next election.</para>
<para>This is something that is a personal choice of the employee. I agree that if someone says, ‘I don’t want to be a member of the union,’ then that person has made a choice. I have never argued against that. It does not mean that I do not support the idea of bargaining fees applying, because you are doing the work for them anyway. But as I said to the minister earlier, if you can find an instance where that occurred where I was involved you must be looking in the wrong books, because it never occurred. And I would say that I speak for most union officials. That was the way it was.</para>
<para>The bill also seeks to severely and unfairly restrict employees’ access to their representatives in that their representatives will not be able to go down and talk to them at the workplace and find out what the problems are. I was very fortunate as a union official because my branch was, on the whole, in a small area. Everyone knew where I lived. If they could not get to the office, they could come to the house in the evening or I could visit them. But many of our outlying members, such as those in Alice Springs or in Woomera or Roxby Downs, did not have as much access and we would go to them. We could not always say, ‘We’ll be here on Thursday’; we would go when we could. This government does not understand that that is the way things happen.</para>
<para>The other thing is that if we are talking about an agreement to operate in the workplace, and if we are looking at an industrial agreement concerning wages and conditions, we will see there has always been an insistence by the employer and by the commission that the union determine whether its members agree with it. The easiest way to find that out is to call a stop-work meeting and all get outside the gate and have a meeting about it to go through, clause by clause and line by line, the agreement.</para>
<para>I have done that many times. Over a period of two or three hours, union officials and members can go through the agreement so that everyone is clear about what they are voting on and everyone is asked, ‘Do you agree with what we have negotiated?’ If they do, we are all happy. If they do not, we go back and do more work and have another stop-work meeting until agreement is reached, because the employer insists on all of his work force agreeing.</para>
<para>To avoid that, a system of workplace meetings based on the right of entry is used by union officials to go and talk to members and explain what they have been doing. It might mean going to six or eight work sites in a particular plant over a period of the day. It should not always be at lunchtime when they stop for lunch—if they do stop for lunch—but should be when officials can see them on the job. This should not be by invitation but should still be at the convenience of the workers and the union and it should cause least disruption to the workplace so that productivity continues and the goods come out the other end of the factory, unaffected by union involvement. There are good reasons why union officials should continually be going down to see what the problems are. One is so that in drafting, redrafting and negotiating agreements officials will continually have the ear of the worker and understand what they want and the workers will understand why the union is doing what it is doing. Inevitably, what we want does not always come out. We cannot get everything we ask for. That is understood but, if union officials are continually down there talking to their members, they understand what their members really want to have and do in the workplace.</para>
<para>My concern about the idea that union officials would be restricted to visiting work sites to perhaps once every six months—and it might be agreed that they would visit every two months or whatever—is that there is a real danger where workers do not have easy access to the officials, as they did in my branch. If you are in a capital city or a large regional centre, it is often a long way to go at the end of the day to see a union official. The unions, like any other office or business, do not stay open 24 hours a day. I know most union officials see people after hours by going to their house or have them come to the office late at night to try to get that business done. To restrict them to going to a workplace perhaps only once every six months means that members do not have access to the union official. The problems within the business get worse. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I appreciate the opportunity to engage in this debate about the right of entry of union officials to a workplace to represent the interests of their union members. In making this presentation on the <inline ref="R2221">Workplace Relations Amendment (Right of Entry) Bill 2004</inline> this afternoon, I want to talk about the right of a union member to seek representation from their union in an industrial sense. The other thing that comes out of that, especially in the human services sector, is the flow-on effect of the benefit of the right of entry to the service that is being provided.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In a former life I was a schoolteacher. I was a very proud and active member of the Queensland Teachers Union. I valued very much the experience that I had in that union. I want to share with the Senate an experience of mine when I was a teacher at a one-teacher school. I contacted my union because of my concern about the workplace environment in which I was teaching. That environment was a very beautiful one, but the construction company that was building a resort, as it was in this case, had a road that went past the school that I was the principal of. It was a coral road, and I was concerned about the dust that was billowing into my school. I was concerned not only for my health and that of my teacher aide but also for the health of the 13 children who lived there. Upon ringing my Queensland Teachers Union organiser, he said that, because of his budget, he would find it hard to justify to the union a trip to Hayman Island where I was the teacher. I said to the organiser: ‘You really do need to come. This is potentially an unsafe environment.’ Fortunately, that union organiser had a background in chemistry. When he finally came, he expressed his concern about the potential carcinogenic effects of the dust from the coral not only on me as a union member but also on the 13 children that I had in my charge. The right of entry for a union organiser not only supports the rights—in this case, the occupational workplace health and safety rights—of a union member but also supports the rights of those in the broader community. For that reason, I will not be supporting this bill, and I urge people on the other side of this chamber to consider its potential effects not only on union members but also on others.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2221">Workplace Relations Amendment (Right of Entry) Bill 2004</inline> is one of many in a long line of attempts by this government to undermine the rights of workers in Australian workplaces and no doubt take a sledgehammer to the trade union movement. It specifically relates to the rights of entry for trade union officials in workplaces to conduct what is not only rightfully their business under the Workplace Relations Act but also rightfully their business under international law and having regard to the rights of workers around the world.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As a former union official I can say with absolute certainty and knowledge that the ability to access your members or even potential members and to quickly respond to their requests is a vital function of the union, and the right of entry is a necessary key to undertake this role. Workers who are experiencing problems and difficulties in their workplace come to rely on this fact and come to know with some confidence that you will be able to enter their workplace and seek to talk either to them or to their fellow workers and respond to their requests as soon as possible without the restrictions that this bill attempts to put in place. If you are not able to access those members or those potential members then the capacity to recruit, represent or just be there to deal with the concerns of members in a timely manner is severely limited. This has a tremendous impact on the capacity of unions to represent their members. But of course that is what this government wants—to limit the effectiveness of the trade union movement in this country.</para>
<para>It has always been patently clear that the Howard government have real problems with the concept of unions insofar as Australian workers go. They do not like them. They want to try to blame unions for everything that is wrong in the Australian economy, and they do not like any united or collective voice that might criticise their mindless, unrealistically ideologically driven policies. This is another malicious attack on Australian workers by the Howard government—no doubt one of many to come in this country in the following months. It is not surprising that Labor will be opposing this bill.</para>
<para>The right of entry is about the rights and responsibilities of both sides: the right of entry needs of the worker and also the needs of the employer. The rules need to truly represent a balance which is fair to both sides. This bill does not meet those requirements—far from it. It is extremely skewed to represent the interests of the employers. But this is a government that is devoid of any original workplace relations policy. It has to rely on the work of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry or the Business Council of Australia to push its industrial relations agenda in this parliament. It does not provide a balanced framework which would support fair and effective agreement making. It does not ensure freedom of association. Instead, this bill seeks to severely and unfairly restrict employees’ access to their representatives. It infringes on the rights of individual employees to decide to collectively bargain with other employees.</para>
<para>I am a member of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee. We had a hearing into this bill in Canberra, in which we took evidence from a whole range of representatives from both the employer side and the trade union movement. We tabled a report in our last sittings. During the Senate committee hearing on this matter, the President of the ACTU, Ms Sharan Burrow, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">As a member of the ILO governing body, I can assure you that the cases I watch and participate in ... in terms of breach of freedom of association and the capacity to organise, would absolutely provide a similar context into which this bill would fit. Fundamental rights under ILO convention 87 and its capacity to support ILO convention 98 would be breached by the nature of this bill.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Ms Burrow went on to say that, by its nature, this bill ‘absolutely fetters’ the right of employees to access union support, advice and information about a wide range of matters relevant to employees. Furthermore, she said that, as the bill will make access to union officials more difficult—and make it a potentially very lengthy and unnecessarily complicated process, I believe—many matters which are now able to be solved quickly will develop into much larger disputes.</para>
<para>I would like to summarise, albeit briefly, the background to the right of entry legislation that is before us today. It was first included in the Industrial Relations Act 1988, when an officer of an organisation was allowed to inspect premises to ensure observance of awards or an order of the commission. That officer could be obliged to provide evidence of his or her authority to do so. Access to premises was during work hours only and subject to conditions contained within the award itself. This provision was amended in 1996 under the Workplace Relations Act, which started to restrict the rights of access to investigate only suspected breaches of awards or agreements—not just general compliance, as was previously the case. The 1996 act abolished the award based right of entry provision, further restricted the timing of any meetings to break times only and introduced the requirement that 24 hours notice of the intention of the trade union official to enter the premises be given to the employer. Of course, many will know that the trade union officials were forced to go to the commission to get a right of entry permit.</para>
<para>Right of entry has been considered by Senate committees on a number of occasions since 1996. For instance, in 2000 the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills concluded on entry and search provisions that there was no evidence suggesting that unions should not have a right to enter. I was a member of the committee at that time. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee further found that there was a voluntary code which had been developed between employers and employees and that it would in fact have been a more appropriate way to go if this code were to have been subject to some formal agreement between the ACCI and the ACTU rather than amending further legislation.</para>
<para>The bill now being debated further and severely restricts the right of entry by union officials and officers, introducing a raft of more stringent criteria before an officer can be deemed a fit and proper person to be granted an entry permit. It also expands the grounds on which permits can be revoked or suspended. For these, among other reasons, the Labor Party believes this bill is far from a balanced approach to right of entry. Indeed, we can only wonder how any fair-minded person could even attempt to justify the bill as balanced.</para>
<para>As well as requiring employees to put in a request for a union officer to visit, their reason and identity must be stated openly. This bill will leave such an employee open to harassment and retribution and make reporting of complaints less likely. It will leave employers able to get away with breaches of agreements and awards and ignore workplace bullying and occupational health and safety problems in the workplace. During the committee hearing, the ACTU stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Finally, there is a real issue about the creation of a workplace based on fear and intimidation and potential invasion of privacy. For an employee who might already be concerned about the security of their employment, who might not have the confidence to actually approach the CEO or the appropriate human resources or industrial relations manager about an issue concerning them to have to put their name potentially to a request for an investigation … or simply to be seen by the employer to approach the union … is something we would be very concerned about.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That in itself will limit employees’ rights of access to their representative, even without the other measures which will be imposed—for example, an employer having the right to determine the location for a meeting and the route to be taken in order to get to that meeting. These are extreme measures that are unnecessary and unwarranted in this day and age.</para>
<para>During the hearing we heard of one instance, from the financial services union, where a major bank in Melbourne—in abuse even of existing law—was able to drag out the time between an initial request for access to a trade union official to investigate a problem and the union official actually getting there to 18 months. It did this by saying that interviews with employees, which should have been confidential, had to take place in a room open to other common use. Let there be absolutely no doubt: this bill will severely impact on employee access to their representatives and vice versa. It will also severely limit the opportunity for unions to recruit. It will severely weaken the rights of both workers and unions, but this is what the Howard government has always dreamed of, wished for and now planned for.</para>
<para>Because of the nature of our industrial relations system, the unions are the only real, properly resourced bodies to enforce mechanisms for awards and agreements. We all know that, under this government, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations have had their ability to enforce mechanisms for awards and pay conditions taken right away from them, out of their hands. The Howard government have, lo and behold, hacked away at this ability. They are determined to move Australian workers towards the conditions of our Asian competitors—working in sweatshop conditions with minimal rights of protest or action. But, of course, they will sell this as being in the national interest. This morning, I heard people on the government side saying that this measure would lead to improved productivity and keep us globally competitive. Smash the trade union movement, smash the rights of workers to access international rights and conventions, and that will make us globally competitive!</para>
<para>During the committee hearing, the highly experienced Ms Burrow was asked if she had any reports of problems on right of entry from peak employer organisations. She had this to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Prior to the discussion at the workplace relations consultative committee with the minister where it was in fact raised by us, I cannot recall an incident where a peak body has actually raised an issue with me.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">If it is of such concern to the employer groups in this country, why hasn’t it been raised with the ACTU? Why is it not an issue that is foremost in the mind of a peak trade union body like the ACTU? It is because no-one has actually picked up the phone and said that it is an issue. We heard evidence during the Senate committee hearing about that very fact. In fact, all the submissions made to the committee lacked any substantial evidence of systemic misuse of the rights of entry. Figures provided by the ACTU show that only 15 cases have occurred since 2000. The ACTU have examples of being called by employers to come in and help solve problems—again showing that informal, voluntary codes of conduct have been perfectly adequate.</para>
<para>I can see no evidence of the need for this bill. There was no evidence put before us during the committee hearing that showed that there is any need for this bill. It does not address, in a fair way, the right of entry provisions. There can be no doubt that this bill is being put forward by the Howard government as an ongoing part of its blinkered, ideological, confrontational approach to trade unions.</para>
<para>I will now turn to the report produced by the committee in order to further emphasise this point. Even the government senators on the committee had some sympathy for concerns about various aspects of the bill which were raised during the public hearing. These concerns were mainly about the imprecise terminology used in several clauses. I refer, for example, to clauses 280F, 280J and 280M of the bill, which cover, respectively, when permits are not to be issued, orders by the commission for abuse of the system, and the use of right of entry to investigate suspected breaches of awards. A majority of committee members accepted the view that a number of terms covered by these provisions appear to be neither properly thought out nor defined with due regard to how they might conflict with other areas of the law.</para>
<para>Notwithstanding the government’s stated objectives, opposition senators are concerned that the intention and practical effect of this bill will make it harder for employees to join a union and participate in legitimate union activities. Evidence given in written submissions and at the public hearing demonstrated that the bill places unreasonable impediments to the rights of trade union officials by further restricting the grounds for entry, the number of workplaces that can be visited, the locations of meeting places, and the route that a union official can take to access a meeting place. Opposition senators agreed with the assessment of the Australian Rail, Tram and Bus Industry Union that the provisions of the bill—and I quote:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... establish a kind of labyrinthine structure of bureaucracy and regulation to undermine the capacity of a union to simply speak to his or her members or potential members, and vice versa.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The claim made by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Andrews, and DEWR, that the bill strikes a balance between the rights of unions and the rights of employers, does not wash with the trade union movement, with most workers in this country, and certainly not with opposition senators. Evidence before the committee from various unions demonstrated that the relatively uniform state right of entry laws work effectively and have done so for some time. This was acknowledged by government senators at the public hearing.</para>
<para>The government’s so-called policy justification for the bill amounts to unfounded paranoia about fictitious unions flouting the law and exploiting, or potentially exploiting, vulnerable employers by pressuring and harassing employees at their workplaces. Apart from isolated cases in one or two industries, there is absolutely no evidence to back up this proposition.</para>

<para>—My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone, and it concerns recent findings by Justice Paul Finn of the Federal Court. Is the minister aware of the court’s recent finding that the treatment of two detainees was negligent and that for one of them it amounted to ‘culpable neglect’? Minister, why is it that both detainees spent 12 months and 21 months respectively without seeing a psychiatrist? Why didn’t they receive help or treatment earlier? Is the minister satisfied with her own running of a detention system which puts detainees at serious risk of becoming mentally ill, as the Federal Court has found?</para>

<para>—Yes, I am aware of the decision to which you refer. In relation to the detail of that case, I will take it on notice. You do invite me to comment on whether I am satisfied with the detention system, which you assert—roughly using the senator’s words, Mr President—‘puts patients at serious risk of mental illness’. I am not prepared to come to that conclusion, but I am prepared to say that I think we can do better—we can do much better. I would not get too excited about that. For Senator Ludwig’s benefit, my basic approach to life is that everyone can do better. But it is clear, to me at least, that in relation to care we can do better. I am in the process of ascertaining what precisely we can do in the short term.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The senator will be aware that there are a number of things that were changed in the department as a consequence of the Rau matter. I indicated at the time of making those changes that the department were happy, willing and desperate to be looking for more changes to see what we could do to make these exceptional cases not fall through the cracks, as they have apparently done. The department have not stopped there. I have made sure of that. I have asked them to come up with further things and see what else they can do to make sure these things do not happen again.</para>
<para>To put it in perspective, Mr President, because I think that is fair, over the period we are looking at, which is roughly a three-year period, I have received advice that there are a number of cases of people who were detained and who were subsequently found to be lawful. It would be a mistake to assume that all of those cases were people who had been lawful all along. That category refers—for Senator Ludwig’s benefit, because I know he has a genuine interest in this—to people who may not have been able to identify themselves at the time but whose identity we were subsequently able to get and who were then released. That would mean that they were lawfully detained at the time because a reasonable suspicion was held that they were an unlawful noncitizen. But within a relatively short period of time that suspicion, having been checked, was cleared and removed and the person was released. One cannot infer that, because a number of cases have been referred to Mr Palmer, they are all cases of people who should not in the first instance have been detained.</para>
<para>I might indicate to you, Mr President, that some people might be detained for a number of hours—for example, in a raid late at night—and released early the next day. That would show as a day in detention, because that is done on a daily basis. Some people will have been detained for longer periods than that, some will have become lawful while they were in detention and some will have been lawful in the very beginning but have presented identification problems. Ms Rau is a classic example of that: someone who gives another name. The expectation is that somehow the department can easily find someone who gives us another name. That is of course the case with Ms Alvarez.</para>
<para>The short answer is that I think the department do an excellent job. We are talking about 0.2 per cent of the cases. Nonetheless, it is not satisfactory and we can do a better job and we should. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

However, we are talking about the Federal Court case and I think the minister is going to take that part on notice. Can the minister inform the Senate as to why her department has spent more than $13,000 in eight court hearings defending the denial of proper psychiatric care to another detainee? That is what the minister needs to be able to provide. Why do we now have the situation where detainees suffering from mental illness need to go to court to try to get proper medical treatment?

<para>—I remind the senator that his question did go specifically to one case, but he did add a general question at the end and that is the question that I answered. As he rightly indicated, I said I would take it on notice. In relation to the case he refers to, I will come back with a detailed answer as to the reason the department defended the particular matter. It may not be fairly categorised as Senator Ludwig chose to categorise it. I am not going to agree with that, but I will come back to him with an answer with respect to that.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The immigration area is a very litigious area. The senator will understand that many people have tried continuous litigation as a means of hoping, I think against all hope, that the department would simply give up. The department and the government are certainly determined to ensure that people are offered appropriate health care. There have been some examples that have been unsatisfactory. I do not say, ‘You would expect that and therefore it is okay.’ It is not, and we will be fixing it.</para>

<para>—I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate that the first main body of Australian Defence Force troops that make up the Al Muthanna Task Group has arrived in southern Iraq and has commenced operations in the Al Muthanna province. The balance of the force will be joining them in the near future.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I can also inform the Senate that I recently met the governor of Al Muthanna, Mohammed Al Hassani, and reinforced to him the fact that Australian forces are there in his province to assist the people of Iraq, particularly in helping to train Iraqi armed forces and ensuring the security environment within which the Japanese Self Defence Force can continue their important humanitarian work.</para>
<para>The job of training the Al Muthanna provincial security force is an important contribution to help prepare Iraq to take on the task of providing its own security in the future. The governor indicated to me that the Australian forces were welcome, and that certainly seems to also be the early response of the Iraqi people from within the province.</para>
<para>It is also encouraging to note the further progress being made in the formation of the new Iraqi government, the transitional government. The Iraqi constitutional assembly has now approved the cabinet, which includes representatives of the key ethnic and community groupings, including those who boycotted the elections. A willingness to be inclusive is going to be very important in building public confidence in a very fragile environment.</para>
<para>During a meeting with the Iraqi Prime Minister, Ibrahim al-Jafari, I passed on the Australian government’s congratulations on the formation of the new government and restated the Australian government’s commitment to help build a peaceful and democratic Iraq. The Prime Minister, in turn, indicated to me how much he valued Australia’s role in providing training to help the Iraqi people take responsibility for their own security.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, Iraq remains a dangerous and violent place, as witnessed by the kidnapping of the Australian Douglas Wood. It has distressed us all, but for his family, in particular, it is clearly a terrible experience. The government, through all possible avenues, continues intense efforts to achieve his safe recovery. We pray that his kidnappers will exercise compassion and release him.</para>
<para>In this difficult environment, Australian forces continue to perform superbly in providing medical aid, in the training of a new security force, in supporting the new ministries, in providing security for our diplomats and in so many other ways. Their professionalism and their good spirit is an inspiration greatly appreciated by the bulk of the Iraqi people and our coalition allies, and we thank them for their service.</para>

<para>Senator, because you asked me a question that you must know, with your intellect, it is impossible to give a yes to—an absolute set-up question designed to have me say, ‘No, of course I can’t’—of course I am going to say, ‘No, of course I can’t.’ You say to me that because I cannot give an absolute guarantee in relation to something that there should be a royal commission. There will be a very long list of matters into which there will be royal commissions, if, simply because a minister cannot give an absolute guarantee to a question on which he or she would not be able to give one anyway, we have a royal commission.</para>
<para>In relation to the inquiry that we have set up, I am aware of the fact that it does not please members of the media and it does not please some people in the opposition that Mr Palmer has been given the opportunity to set about doing his work. I have faith in Mr Palmer. He is trained as a lawyer and practises as a lawyer. He was the Commissioner of the Northern Territory Police. He was Commissioner of Police of the Australian Federal Police, appointed first by the Labor Party and then reappointed by us. I cannot say whether you have confidence, but I do. I am happy to give Mr Palmer the tools to do the job. I met with Mr Palmer yesterday and asked him directly, squarely, eyeball to eyeball: are you satisfied that you are getting every bit of cooperation that you possibly could get and are requiring from the department? The answer was yes.</para>
<para>The findings will be made public in relation to both this and the Alvarez matter, but we do not assist Mr Palmer in coming to the findings by idle speculation in the meantime. They will be made public, and we will have to answer for them, but the appropriate time will be when the inquiry is concluded.</para>

<para>—I thank the senator. What is going on behind closed doors, Senator? A normal federal inquiry where seconded people are undertaking tasks at the instruction of former Commissioner Palmer to find the facts in a matter. That is what is going on. I would not have thought it required someone to spell out for you what happens in an inquiry. ‘When will the families get justice?’ you ask. The implication is that they are not getting that by the inquiry being conducted. As I have said, when we have the conclusions we can have a discussion about what ought to happen. I do not think it is appropriate to come to those conclusions now.</para>

<para>Senator, you refer to a failed detention system. I remind you that mandatory detention is in fact a Labor policy and it is not one with which the Labor Party disagrees. I also remind you that, as I have said, the cases referred to Mr Palmer amount to 0.2 per cent of the cases. By and large, the immigration department does a fantastic job. There are mistakes, and the ones that I am aware of are not good ones. I am annoyed about them and will get them fixed. But I will not stand by and let someone pretend that therefore every case that is dealt with is a mistake, when on my advice that is not the case. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Australia’s humanitarian mission to provide emergency disaster relief to Indonesia is now complete. The last of the personnel returned home on board HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline> just over a week ago. The ADF did an outstanding job in a very difficult environment. They provided much needed emergency assistance in some of the worst hit areas of Banda Aceh and Nias Island. Operation Sumatra Assist was the largest humanitarian assistance mission ever performed by the Australian Defence Force, with more than 1,000 ADF personnel involved in the operation. All Australians should feel a deep sense of pride in the work that our men and women have done. Our sailors, soldiers, airmen and airwomen have worked tirelessly together to help those in need, and their work has made an incredible difference to the many tsunami and earthquake victims.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>However, it has been at a high cost, with the death of nine ADF personnel and two others severely injured in the recent Sea King helicopter crash. Following the death of so many young people in that terrible tragedy, I pass my deepest sympathy and no doubt that of all honourable senators to the families and loved ones of those who died. Australians will always remember their sacrifice in helping to provide emergency medical assistance to the people of Indonesia. The sacrifice was commemorated in a moving national ceremony in the Great Hall of this parliament. We hope it provided some comfort to the families.</para>
<para>The accident investigation has made progress. Its work will feed into a board of inquiry which has now been established and which has the complex task of determining the cause of the accident. The Indonesian government has expressed its appreciation to the Australian government and all who have assisted in the response to the tsunami and the earthquake. The Indonesian military has also been very grateful for the support Australia has provided, and its leadership has personally thanked both me and the Chief of the Defence Force for Australia’s early contribution.</para>
<para>Overall, the ADF’s contribution included three RAAF transport aircraft, aviation support crews, Army medical personnel, logistics specialists, engineers and support from HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline>. They worked tirelessly to clean drains and buildings, delivered many tonnes of medical and humanitarian supplies, carried out urgent medical evacuations and treated hundreds of patients. Assistance in Aceh and Nias has now progressed to a repair and reconstruction phase and Australian assistance will continue, but it is to be provided through our civilian agencies.</para>

<para>—My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Has the minister now been briefed on the new case of an Australian citizen with a mental illness who was wrongfully deported by DIMIA to the Philippines and who has not been seen nor heard of since? When did the department first come to know that this Australian woman had a child and when did the minister first become aware of this fact? Why was this woman deported when she had a nine-year-old boy waiting for her in Australia in foster care? How is it that the acting minister, Minister McGauran, claimed that the department only knew of its mistake some four years after her deportation? Isn’t it actually the case that the department has known of this issue since 2003? Minister, when did your office first become aware of this case?</para>

<para>—Senator, you asked me four questions. The first was: have I been briefed? Yes, in a limited way while I was overseas and in a somewhat more substantial way yesterday afternoon, which was my first day back here in Canberra. When did the department first know the woman had a child? I will get you the date, but the advice that I have is that, when the woman was sent back, it was on the basis that she had indicated she had no family in Australia. I will just make that clear—that is the advice I have at this point. They may have subsequently become aware of that. Clearly they have. I will get you the date of that.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Your third question was: why was a woman who had a child here sent back to the Philippines? The answer is, on the basis of the advice I have, that she had indicated at the time that she did not have any family here. She had given a different name from that in which her passport or citizenship was held, and those cases always make it more difficult. I do not say that as an excuse or an explanation; it is in no way satisfactory. There is not an ameliorating circumstance I can think of to explain why an Australian citizen is sent away. But I do say that when someone presents with an alternative name it does make it extraordinarily hard. So, as I indicated, the advice I have is that the department was not aware at the time she was sent away that she had a child. As to the dates you ask about, I will get you those quite specifically on notice.</para>

<para>—I am not aware. I am inclined on the basis of advice that I have been given at this point to say that no, she did not have a psychiatric assessment between the time that she came to the attention of the department and the time she left. But I will check that, and the reason I will check that is that there is a gap between the time period that she came to the attention of the department and when she was first interviewed. She came to the attention of the department in early April and she was first interviewed by the department in early May. I cannot say what happened while she was in hospital during that month gap but I do not have advice that she received a psychiatric assessment after she was released from hospital. I make that point because she was not in fact sent back to the Philippines until late July. The proposition was put to me— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—My question is also to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. I ask the minister about matters relating to the Edmund Rice Centre’s report <inline font-style="italic">Deported to danger</inline>, which was produced last year, which interviewed 40 different asylum seekers of 13 different nationalities who had been returned by Australia to 11 different countries. The report found that some of those people were deported on false paperwork and, of those 40, only five could be deemed to be safe. Can the minister outline what actions her department has taken to follow up the veracity of the information contained in that report? She has stated on radio that the centre was asked to give information to verify those claims and has not provided it. Isn’t it the case that there have been meetings with the centre? Isn’t it the case that the report is on the web? What is the information that the department has not got that has prevented it from properly validating these very serious claims?</para>

In relation to the Edmund Rice Centre, Senator, you correctly identify what I said. That is what I have been told—that they have not been forthcoming. There may well have been a number of meetings. That does not mean that the information has been provided. The Edmund Rice Centre has made these allegations. Presumably you make allegations on the basis of evidence that you have. I have in the past said publicly, and I say it again now: give us the information and we will follow it up. It is not appropriate for the Edmund Rice Centre or anybody else to simply make a bald allegation and say, ‘You go away and check it out.’ If you have made an allegation, I assume in good faith and I assume therefore on the basis of some evidence, we would appreciate the evidence and we will follow it up.

<para>—Mr President, I have a supplementary question. Given that in itself the centre has provided a 63-page report, available on the internet, surely that provides sufficient information for some following up by the department. Can the minister also indicate whether the government will now reconsider the recommendation made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee over five years ago—a unanimous recommendation, including her colleagues Senators Coonan and Payne, who I am sure she would agree take a very considered approach to difficult issues—to consider establishing some mechanism with non-government organisations to informally monitor the fate of people who are returned to countries that are unstable.</para>

<para>—I thank the senator for the question. Yes, I do have great respect for Senator Coonan and Senator Payne. I will have a look at that recommendation and what the government response was to it. But I can say automatically that if anyone, an NGO or an individual—you do not have to have the status of being an NGO—has evidence that someone has been improperly returned they should give us that evidence and they are free to do that at this point, and it will always be taken into account. We do not need a mechanism—I am intuitively responding to you here—because the door is always open to someone who has the evidence to come forward and give us the evidence. If they are unhappy giving the evidence solely to the immigration department then let them give the evidence to a parliamentary committee by way of letter so that members of that committee can always check on whether the immigration department has done the right thing and followed that information up. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am sure that the letter has been correctly read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. From when I read it some time ago, I do recall mention of a turnaround area for coaches. The purpose of the works was to provide a safer and more convenient environment for the many thousands of visitors who attend commemoration services at Anzac Cove on Anzac Day. The justification for that work, I think, came out of the circumstances of there not being either a safe or a convenient environment for these people, who include the elderly. The work was of course to be carried out by the Turkish authorities, and that has been taking place. I had a lot of trouble following the relevance of the last part of the question, but I do agree that the works are being done. If the honourable senator is putting to me that that was the purpose of the work then I agree with him. I hope that it has successfully provided the safer and more convenient environment which we sought for visitors to that very important commemoration.</para>

<para>—I think it is unfortunate that the opposition seeks to make political mileage out of this attempt to provide a safer environment for the thousands of visitors attending the dawn service at Anzac Cove. As I said, the work was to be carried out by the Turkish authorities; it is their peace park, it is their responsibility. We can provide some guidance through the war graves authorities, and did so. My recollection is that, when we learned of the retaining wall that was to be constructed, officials who visited the site expressed some concern about the consequences of that wall, as a result of which we requested that the Turkish authorities pause in their works. What has flowed therefrom, I am not sure, but I am quite happy to make inquiries of the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and bring the honourable senator up to date. But I stress again: the purpose is well based, and it would have been helpful if we had got a bit more support. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—When you have to defer to the Greens, you have dropped pretty low in the barrel! Mr President, we believe that early justice is good justice, and we have made representations for the trial of Mr Hicks to be brought on as quickly as possible. As all honourable senators know, legal processes in the United States mean that civilian courts are now addressing issues of procedure in relation to the military commissions, and that has further held up the process. That is really out of the hands of Australian authorities, which I suppose is the point to which the honourable senator was referring in her question. But we will continue to make representations to the Americans—and this is where I believe Senator Nettle is wrong—that there be an early resolution of this matter and that the trial of Mr Hicks be pursued in a way that is fair and just and which accords with the standards of justice that we believe are important.</para>

<para>—My recollection is that Australian authorities have had consular access to Mr Hicks, which has included an opportunity for him to make any allegations. I certainly do not recall from him any allegations of the type that have just been mentioned by the honourable senator. There has also been Red Cross access and there have also been further investigations by US defence department officials as a result of representations made by the Australian government. So we do take an interest in the welfare of Mr Hicks in the same way as we take a consular interest in the welfare of all Australians. But he is detained and he will be tried be a US military commission on serious offences. Our interest in that regard is to ensure that the trial is fair and is conducted as promptly as possible.</para>

<para>—My question is directed to Senator Hill, representing the Prime Minister and the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. Minister, given the Prime Minister’s panic action to remedy the damage done at Anzac Cove by the roadworks his ministers have oversighted, what specific action has been taken either to build or to suspend the new road proposed from Lone Pine to Chunuk Bair? Wasn’t this new road specifically requested by the former Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Mrs Danna Vale? Given that over 4,200 Australian bodies were never recovered at Gallipoli, what archaeological research has been conducted on that route to ensure that those bodies are not disturbed by Australian funded or requested roadworks? When is this vandalism going to stop? When will we see a properly considered plan for the protection of the heritage of Gallipoli?</para>

<para>—I really do regard this as a cheap shot because surely the Labor Party would say that we have a responsibility to the 20,000 visitors to try and provide for their safety. As everybody knows, the road system was inadequate. It meant that there was a danger for people having to walk long distances before dawn with vehicles on the road. It was not a safe environment. Something needed to be done. The Australian authorities spoke to the Turks and asked that work be done to provide a safer environment. I would have thought that that was the responsible thing to do and something that the Labor Party ought to applaud. But, no, it is a cheap shot because it is difficult. There is no doubt that it is difficult to expand roadworks within what is basically a cemetery environment without disturbing the grave sites or other aspects of the wartime heritage that are important to preserve. It is not an easy task to fulfil. But this government asked the Turks to do it.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The Turks, in my experience, have put in a great deal of effort to conserve and preserve that heritage that is so important to us—something that is sacred to us. I would have suggested a bit more support from the Australian Labor Party for the Turks in doing that would also have been helpful. But, of course, that is far too much to expect when there is a chance of a cheap political shot. As to what is happening in relation to further works that need to be done, I will seek advice from the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and report back to the Senate. But, so far, what was intended to be done, and what was done, was for the benefit and safety of those who were to visit the site. I think that was a responsibility of this Australian government, and I am certainly not going to apologise for that.</para>

The minister might think it is a cheap shot, but the Australian public and those who were at Anzac Cove this year know that it was an expensive disaster. Is the minister aware that the Prime Minister’s blaming of the Turkish government for these roadworks has been directly repudiated by the Turkish Ambassador to Australia and that, as a result, relations with the Turkish government have now been severely strained? Further, can the minister confirm that this is the reason that the Prime Minister’s belated attempt for heritage listing has been rejected and that in future all negotiations on Gallipoli are to be managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade?</para>

<para>—That is a load of nonsense. I know that because I made representations to the Turkish government a year ago on the heritage issue. It had nothing to do with these roadworks at all. It is just further evidence that what the Labor Party is up to in the Senate is simply a cheap shot and not an attempt to address the issue of either the conservation of the heritage or the safety of Australian visitors. I think that is disappointing. The relationship between the Australian and Turkish governments is good. I certainly do not hear the Prime Minister criticising the Turkish government. This government appreciates the work that the Turks have done to conserve this very important heritage which is, in many ways, a joint heritage of the Turkish people, the Australian people and others who lost young men during the Gallipoli campaign. We, the government, will seek to provide a safe environment for visitors and we will also seek to provide the proper heritage protection. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I thank Senator Barnett for this important question and recognise his longstanding interest in ensuring that the Australian economy continues to grow. It is no accident that the Australian economy has been one of the best performing in the world during the period of this government, nor is it an accident that since being elected the government has overseen the creation of over 1,500,000 new jobs. These outstanding achievements are the result of the good policy decisions and, at times, the difficult policy decisions taken by this government—policies such as the introduction of Australian workplace agreements, which have improved flexibility and pay for those workers who chose to take them. I note in passing that in the last 12 months there have been 200,000 AWAs approved. How about our waterfront reform, which has massively increased our productivity? And let us not forget the building industry royal commission which is cleaning up our building industry. All of these, might I add, were opposed by Labor. But there is more to be done, and over the course of the next few months this place will be asked to further improve our industrial relations system, including outlawing compulsory union fees, increasing the power of the building and construction industry task force and reforming the unfair unfair-dismissal laws—all relating to bills which Labor has vigorously opposed in the past and no doubt will continue to oppose in the future.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is reported that Mr Beazley yesterday pledged to back his union masters in a ‘blood fight’ with the government over our IR reforms. Let me just place on record my disappointment that Mr Beazley would be reduced to using such inflammatory and violent language when discussing policy issues. But that is what you resort to when you run out of logic and commonsense. If Mr Beazley is really after a blood fight, he will have to start with his shadow ministry. On 12 April, in the National Press Club, Mr Beazley claimed, ‘The industrial relations lemon has been squeezed dry.’ But on Sunday the shadow Treasurer, Mr Swan, said, ‘There will always be more to be done in industrial relations.’ And let us not forget that on 7 April, just a week before Mr Beazley’s press club address, Mr Beazley’s own IR spokesman, Mr Smith, said, ‘I am happy to contemplate serious industrial relations reforms that improve the productivity and efficiency of the economy.’</para>
<para>Mr President, talk about lemons being squeezed dry! Mr Beazley has simply run out of policy and reform juice. As the Prime Minister noted recently, the recycled Labor leader really does seem to have reform fatigue before he has even started on the task—without having undertaken anything, except to carp from the sidelines. It is time for the Labor Party to stop grovelling to their union masters and to support our sensible industrial relations reforms for the sake of future jobs and wages growth in this country.</para>

<para>—I might start by saying that when we were in opposition and Labor put up a policy that was a reasonable one we actually supported it. There were a number of measures that we might have disagreed with, but in opposition we did not try to be a government-in-exile and we supported reasonable suggestions and reasonable propositions from the government. But, as people will remember, when we brought legislation into this place—I think it was Senator Ian Campbell who brought in the legislation—what did Labor do in their typical style? They opposed the measure.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We are talking about a measure that Labor have indicated they are prepared to get rid of. This is a measure that helps families who have large out-of-hospital out-of-pocket expenses, a measure that did not exist and a measure that had to be amended because Labor failed to support the government. It was a measure that had to be amended—and I say this again—because Labor failed to support the government. What we have done is to bring back the Medicare safety net to the level we introduced here in this chamber to ensure that it is sustainable and to ensure that people who have high out-of-hospital out-of-pocket expenses actually get some assistance, with 80 per cent of their fee being paid. Labor indicated that they were going to get rid of the Medicare safety net.</para>

<para>—What I can confirm is that, when Labor was in government, people had high out-of-pocket out-of-hospital expenses and got no relief or assistance. So people, particularly low-income families, would face unexpected high out-of-pocket expenses. What we will see now with the Medicare safety net is that about 2.3 million Australians will be assisted by the safety net during 2005, a safety net that I can confirm Labor said they would get would rid off, a safety net that Labor sat in this chamber and opposed. They opposed people who, because of illness in their families, face high out-of-pocket out-of-hospital expenses. That is what Labor opposed. They do not want to accept that now, but that is what they opposed. What we have done is brought back what we proposed in the chamber here. It is achievable and sustainable. What Labor did was oppose that measure, leaving people with high out-of-pocket out-of-hospital expenses.</para>

I ask the minister: in light of last week’s findings by the Federal Court in South Australia that the government had comprehensively failed in its duty of care to severely mentally ill long-term detainees, and reports of a three-year-old girl in detention in Villawood with serious effects on her wellbeing as a result of the detention, will the government now act immediately to bring an end to indefinite long-term detention? Given the court’s finding; the unanimous all-party recommendation of the Human Rights Subcommittee of this parliament, chaired by Senator Ferguson, that there should be a time limit on the detention of asylum seekers; the unanimous finding of the same committee that detention is not conducive to good mental health; the unanimous recommendations of the Senate committee in 2000; and the comprehensive inquiry by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission into the harm that detention does to children, how many more alarm bells does this government need to hear before it will act to address and end long-term detention?</para>

<para>—Senator, I have not read the full judgment of the case that you refer to, but I am sure it does not go to the whole question of detention. It goes quite specifically, as the senator indicated in his question, to the health care providers. I indicated in an answer to an earlier question from a senator of another party that I have already asked the department to have a look at what changes they can make to make sure that the opportunity is not there for that sort of finding again. In other words, there will have to be some changes. There will be changes, and we will not be waiting for any inquiry to do as much as we can in the short term. But, if subsequently Mr Palmer has further things he wants us to look at, I indicate we will also do those. If the judgment clearly indicated that there was a problem in the circumstances of those people, I do not say therefore that I am not prepared to look any further than that. The judgment may well be a warning bell and I am determined that we will have a look across the board to see what changes can be made to make improvements in health services and in particular in mental health services.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Senator, you refer to the policy of indefinite long-term detention. There is not indefinite long-term detention. You raised the case, for example, of Ms Leong and her mother. I am advised that this family has no ongoing migration related litigation. I am further advised that they can choose to depart Australia voluntarily at any time, subject to obtaining travel documentation. The advice that I was given before I came into the chamber is that the mother refuses to sign an application for travel documentation for the daughter. So I think it is fair to say, given that advice is correct, that the child is not in detention simply because of a policy of mandatory detention of unlawful noncitizens but is there because the mother refuses to sign an application for the child to get travel documents to leave with her and go home.</para>
<para>I draw your attention also, Senator, to an announcement made some time ago that the government will be introducing a new form of visa to accommodate those people who are cooperating in terms of identifying who they are and whom, for one reason or another, it is not practicable to remove at this time. This will therefore give the immigration minister at the time greater flexibility than they now have, because the flexibility available at the moment is either in the limited form of a bridging visa—and that is not available to as broad a group as some people might like—or to say, ‘We give in. We will give you a full blown visa.’ Either of those might not be appropriate in some cases, so I have argued, and the government has agreed, that we should have a further visa to cater for those whom we cannot yet identify, who agree that they do not have a further claim and who agree that when it is safe they will go home but should not necessarily be kept in detention in the meantime. So, provided they cooperate and agree, we can look to giving those people a visa that will keep them out of detention. But many people are there because they are, rightly and fairly, choosing to use their opportunity to appeal decisions. I do not seek to take that away from them, but there is a policy that people will remain in detention until their status is clarified, and that includes until litigation has concluded.</para>

<para>—What you have particularly asked about is the mental health of long-term detainees. I answered that in relation to your first question and I indicated to you that I believe there has been a court finding. I will have a good look at the case. I have already asked the department to look at what changes they can make to provide a better system, not just so that it does not happen to people in the circumstances of the case to which you refer but so that we have a better system. When I have some answers on that, I will obviously be making an announcement with respect to that matter.</para>

<para>As to children, this is a vexed issue. No-one wants to see children in detention. But I do not want to separate children from their parents, either; nor do I want to say to people smugglers, ‘If you bring people with children they will be out and will not be detained.’ It is a very difficult issue. I note that Senator Bolkus faced this issue when Labor was detaining hundreds of children at a time. Did I hear a peep from the Democrats then? I do not think I did. We were the first to start residential housing projects. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I wish to add briefly to an answer that I gave today to a question from Senator Jacinta Collins. I had not been focusing on the time and therefore did not get to make the point concisely. In relation to Ms Alvarez, there have been media reports that she was removed within three days of coming to Immigration’s attention. The answer is more like 3½ months to four months, as I indicated to Senator Collins. She first came to Immigration’s attention in early April. As I am advised, she was first interviewed in early May. She was then on a number of bridging visas and was in fact removed towards late July. That is a very long way from three days. That may give senators opposite and senators on this side of the chamber some indication of how careful they have to be about relying on media reports.</para>

</talk.start>
<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to questions without notice asked by Senators Bishop and Forshaw today relating to road works at ANZAC Cove, Gallipoli.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">Predictably, the minister’s answers to the questions concerning the construction of the new road at Anzac Cove were inadequate; in fact, they are probably best described as waffle, all things being considered. That is understandable, as these are not questions the government wishes to respond to meaningfully in any way at all. What we have seen in this debate is the Prime Minister at his evasive best. What is crystal clear is that neither the government nor the Prime Minister had any idea as to what has been happening at Gallipoli for some time.</para>
<para>What the Prime Minister expected was a 90th anniversary commemoration of the 1915 landing, starring him. What he received was a stormy controversy about the destruction of Anzac Cove by roadworks which his minister had sought by letter. First, he proudly accepted responsibility through the confession of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Now the Prime Minister has sought to evade responsibility by denying that the letter to the Turks requested any such thing. He must have been reading a different letter to the one that was released on 22 April. That letter quite specifically asked the government of Turkey—under cover of diplomatic note, as I understand it—to fix the road at Anzac Cove. Specifically, the letter and the attachment seek improved bus turnaround facilities. Further, such facilities, as we now know, were designed to improve VIP access. It is there in black and white in the correspondence released.</para>
<para>The request by the Howard government to destroy Anzac Cove is undeniable. Neither can the Prime Minister or his hapless Minister for Veterans’ Affairs deny that they had any knowledge of this sequence of events. The minister has read to me excerpts from a detailed briefing he has been given, presumably via the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, on this matter. That brief, from the director of the Office of Australian War Graves, clearly set out the problems being encountered with the roadworks sought. The need to construct a rock retaining wall to prevent further erosion of the cliff face was a key issue identified by the minister in her letter written to the Turkish government and pursued by our government. Yet it is with respect to that rock wall that the Prime Minister has requested that construction cease. The Prime Minister and those briefing him seem to be completely ignorant of the fact that the Office of Australian War Graves has been consulting with the Turks on this exact and particular issue for a long time—indeed, over many years. The government not only requested this work but has had full knowledge of the detail of it from the very beginning until the present time.</para>
<para>The result, as we know and as has been reported by the press, is one that can only be described as disastrous. What we have as a direct result of the Australian government’s urging is the complete destruction of significant portions of Anzac Cove. The cliff faces scaled by the Anzacs in the dark of 25 April 1915 have been bulldozed into oblivion; they are now sheer. The beach across which they ran and died has been covered with spoil and because of erosion will continue to be covered by spoil. The sites of valuable headquarters no longer exist. The Prime Minister cannot wriggle his way out of this mess that he has been responsible for creating. No matter what spin is tried, the government remains culpable in this matter. The Prime Minister tried to throw money at this issue to solve the problem—in his typical fashion—but it is too late. The damage has been done and that cannot be changed in the future.</para>
<para>Moreover, it is not unfair to say that arising out of this the government has a diplomatic incident on its hands. Not only has the Prime Minister seriously breached diplomatic protocol in releasing the letter of August 2004 as part of his desperate bid for self-preservation; he has also had the gall to blame the Turks for his own mistake. The Turkish Ambassador to Australia has properly directly repudiated this claim in the press. One asks the obvious question: is it any wonder that the Turks have refused his heritage listing proposal and the Prime Minister’s bid for them to cease work on the rock wall? Is that any surprise at all? Sadly, and more importantly for the future, they might also ignore the Prime Minister’s other request and proceed with the new road from Lone Pine to Chunuk Bair. In those circumstances, we have a very serious problem indeed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—What a disgraceful display of politicking about a sacred time and a sacred place in our nation’s history! I recently had the honour and privilege of attending the 90th anniversary celebrations at Anzac Cove as part of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program. I say that it was an honour and a privilege, and I know that those feelings are shared by many other colleagues from this place and the other place who also attended. I want to say to you, Mr Deputy President, and to honourable senators here and listening elsewhere that nowhere in Turkey—nowhere at Anzac Cove and nowhere at Gallipoli—did we pick up any of the political static that those senators opposite are perpetrating within the Australian community.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We just heard Senator Bishop talking about diplomatic issues that have arisen and which he says are to Australia’s detriment. I spoke to hundreds of Turks who regard Australians as the closest of friends politically, socially and economically. At no time during any of those discussions did any of them talk about the diplomatic issues and incidents that the senator opposite has talked about and which other senators opposite have alluded to during question time. Our diplomatic and political position in relation to Turkey is unchallenged and unquestioned by the Turks themselves. Let me also list the others with whom I and many of my other colleagues spoke. We spoke to the labourers; we spoke to the transport people that carried us to Anzac Cove in buses; we spoke to the porters; and we spoke to many other people of Turkish birth and Turkish nationality who work at, around and in relation to Anzac Cove. Not one of them was able to tell us from their knowledge, their insights or their permanent residency in Turkey that they had heard of, seen or had any evidence that suggested that war graves had been disturbed or that any were going to be disturbed.</para>
<para>I will tell you what else I saw there. I saw thousands and thousands of Australians, mainly young Australians, who were able to make their way in their thousands, to that sacred piece of Australian soil at Anzac Cove in far greater comfort and with far greater ease than people previously had been able to enjoy. The claim by the senator opposite about the Prime Minister wanting to create a facility to accommodate VIPs is just an outright untruth. That road—the construction of which I totally support as a result of first-hand experience from only a week or so ago—caters for all Australians who want to get closer to their history, to their heritage and to the spirit that spawned this nation. That is what we are all about in this debate. To hear senators opposite belittle the sanctity of the 90th anniversary celebrations—</para>

<para>—I know why they are objecting: it is because they know that they have been caught out, because only a week ago we were there and were able to repudiate through first-hand knowledge, first-hand inquiries and first-hand witnesses the arguments that have been put forward by those opposite. That road is not a road for VIPs; it is a road for all Australians—present and future—who want to access a sacred Australian site and pay respect to the memory and the sacrifice of the Australians buried there, Australians who made it possible for people like us to stand in a place like this as free citizens exercising and enjoying our democracy. I cannot understand how senators opposite have lost the plot in such a comprehensive way and in such an unpatriotic manner. I suggest that next year they should go over to Anzac Cove like thousands of other Australians and make their own direct inquiries. They will be inspired. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Actually, Senator Santoro, I would prefer to take the word of Senator Bishop on this. There is a very good reason why: last year Senator Bishop and I were in attendance at the Anzac ceremonies in Gallipoli. Senator Hill was there too. This year, Senator Bishop was back there and, as such, has had the first-hand experience of seeing what the situation was prior to the roadworks at Anzac Cove being undertaken and seeing the impact since. On this score, I think Senator Bishop talks with far greater experience than you do, Senator Santoro.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Gallipoli is a very special place. We know that. That is why thousands and thousands of Australians go there in increasing numbers each year. As I said, I had the great benefit and privilege of being there last year and participating in the ceremonies. It was estimated that 15,000 people attended last year, despite warnings from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that, due to terrorism concerns, Australians should not attend. This year, it was reported that there were over 20,000 in attendance at the 90th anniversary.</para>
<para>As we all know, Gallipoli is not Australian land, despite what Senator Santoro said a moment ago. He seems to have forgotten that fundamental fact. It is Turkish land. However, the memory of that conflict is as important to the Turkish people and to the Turkish government as it is to the Australian public and the Australian government, and has been since 1915. That is why there has always been this close relationship and spirit of cooperation between Australia and Turkey in looking after that site and in sitting down and looking at what improvements and maintenance need to be done, particularly in those parts of the Gallipoli peninsula which are so special for the Anzac tradition and for the tradition of other nations who fought there.</para>
<para>It has been kept as a park. The Turkish government honoured Australia and honoured the memory of our soldiers who fought and died there by naming the beach Anzac Cove. We are all aware of the pressures that occur on the entire peninsula, but particularly at Anzac Cove, on Anzac Day—we are all aware of that—with the increasing numbers and the difficulties of access. But the problem with this situation is that the government, having made a request to the Turkish government to undertake roadworks and other works in that area, then dropped the ball. The then Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Mrs Vale—who is fortunately no longer the minister—basically stuffed this up. She made the request on behalf of the Australian government. Apparently that request was unbeknown to the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time. Then there was a failure to oversee and report in full.</para>
<para>We do know that briefings were given to various ministers on the roadworks that were being undertaken, but along the line nobody was focusing on what was really happening. Those of us who were not there this year have seen the photos and the coverage. Those of you who were there, like Senator Bishop, Mr Beazley and others, have seen first hand the destruction that occurred. It is an incredible tragedy. It is a terrible disaster, really, to have seen that happen. What is even worse is that today Minister Hill stood up and essentially repeated the line of the Prime Minister, which was to say, ‘It’s really the responsibility of the Turks.’ Somehow it was their fault. But it was not their fault.</para>

<para>—It is a great privilege to stand here and respond to the grubby accusations made by the senators opposite, because I had the immense honour and privilege of attending the Anzac dawn service at Gallipoli and spending several days there around Anzac Day this year. It was at that dawn service that young people wept and mourned their personal loss. You anticipate this emotion when you go to Gallipoli—it was the first time for me—but it still hits you like a thunderbolt when you are there. That is what happened to me and indeed to many thousands of other Australians—predominantly young Australians. You simply cannot visit Gallipoli without being gripped by this loss, but you are also gripped by a pride in your Australian heritage.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I start by saying that because I believe the opposition’s tactics today are going to be seen for what they are: grubby political tactics to gain a media headline. It is a cheap political shot. It is undeserved. You are trying to gain a media headline, and it is demeaning to your position in the Senate. Senator Forshaw should know better. He has been to Anzac Cove.</para>
<para>Senator Santoro, Mrs Bishop, Mark Baker MHR and Stewart McArthur MHR were there, as were members of the Labor Party, who I will mention because they were there: Harry Quick, Kim Beazley, Senator Mark Bishop and Senator Chris Evans.

I want to commend the department for the work they did. This is a logistical nightmare. You know it, because you have been there, Senator Forshaw. This year we had record crowds again. I want to comment on that. The increasing relevance and resilience of Anzac Day has brought with it record attendances at commemorative services both here in Australia and at Gallipoli. It has also brought challenges and problems—of course it has. Gaining access, catering and caring for a growing number of visitors in a Turkish national park is not easy. Members opposite are trying to gain media attention on this issue. That is what you have done in recent weeks, and now you are doing it again, to no avail.</para>

</continue>
<para>An estimated 20,000 patriotic, passionate Australians attended the 90-year anniversary. In my view they have been sadly misrepresented by people in the media and by people on the other side of the Senate chamber, because the overwhelming majority of those people travelled over 14,000 kilometres at their own expense and in their own time. They made this investment because they want to show respect and honour for their forebears and for those Anzacs. They were motivated to do that because they love Australia and they love the qualities demonstrated by our Anzac diggers. What is happening today is a cheap political shot.</para>
<para>I want to speak about the Turkish government. I want to commend them and thank them, because this is an Australian event, an Anzac event, happening on foreign soil. How gracious of our Turkish hosts to work with the Australian government, the New Zealand government and the other countries involved in hosting such an event. I want to pay tribute to them, because I cannot conceive of an occasion when the Japanese would be doing this on US soil—or the Germans in London. That is inconceivable to me.</para>
<para>I also want to acknowledge President Ataturk. He was involved in the Anzac battle and was successful. He became the President of Turkey, and he was the one who said that the Gallipoli peninsula is now the home of the Australian, New Zealand and allied men who died and that they are now in the bosom of Turkey. He said to the mothers of the Anzac diggers, ‘Do not be saddened.’ <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>—It is regrettable that the government speakers today want to turn this debate into a contest about who is the most patriotic and try to avoid the real issues about the vandalism that is taking place over in Gallipoli at the moment. It is well known that 8,709 Australians were killed at the Gallipoli site. It is well known that 4,223 Australians were never recovered from the Gallipoli site. It is also well known that there are more unrecovered bodies at the Gallipoli site than there are bodies buried there. These are important facts to Australians, and these facts should be well known by the government. They should be well aware of these facts. But when we asked the government, in question time today, when we would see a properly considered plan for the protection of the heritage of Gallipoli and when the government would put a halt to the vandalism of the road building, what did we get in answer? We got hypotheticals. We got a hypothetical proposition about an accident involving a bus and an elderly person who was injured or killed, and we were asked what we would say about that. It completely avoids the responsibility that this government have to ensure that this site which is very sacred to all Australians is properly protected and monitored.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We then got the accusation that we were having a cheap shot, as if we wanted to make some political gain out of this. This is something the government seeks to hide behind. Accusations about hypothetical accidents and cheap shots do not say anything about the competence of this government. They do not in any way defend the competence of this government. Their actions throughout this very sorry tale have simply been those of incompetence and misrepresentation.</para>
<para>Senator Hill told us how difficult it is to construct a road over there. I probably accept that. I do not know how difficult it might be. But that does not mean that it is impossible to construct a road, having due regard to the burial ground and the sacred nature of Anzac Cove and Gallipoli. He told us that there is a great deal of effort going into this—but obviously not enough. He made the very firm statement, which this government likes to rely upon, that this government will not apologise for what has happened over there. We are all owed an apology for this incompetence, and the minister should apologise.</para>
<para>Then we saw, in defence of this proposition, Senator Santoro wrapping himself in the flag—as if that is a defence of the vandalism that is taking place over in Gallipoli, with this government’s consent, with the road building. He wants to avoid the whole issue of competence and responsibility and talk about who is more patriotic than anyone else. That is not the issue, because the opposition are just as patriotic about what happened at Gallipoli. We care about it just as much as they do, and I do not want to cheapen this debate by trying to say that we care more than they do. It is something that all Australians care very deeply about. There is no dignity in this government trying to lower this very important debate, which is a public issue, by trying to wrap themselves in the flag as if that is some sort of defence of the incompetence that is going on at Gallipoli.</para>
<para>Let us look at the sequence of events as they have unfolded. After listening to Senator Barnett and Senator Santoro, I do not think that they could have read a newspaper and followed this issue at all. I do not understand why they were asked to get up and defend the government’s position—or maybe their ignorance is the reason why they were asked. The Howard government asked the Turkish government in August 2004 for the extensive roadworks at Anzac Cove to be carried out in time for the 90th anniversary of the Gallipoli landing. I do not think that is disputed by anyone. Dr David Cameron, an Australian archaeologist from Sydney University, found human remains in early 2003 at the site where the roadworks were to be done. Dr Cameron told the Office of Australian War Graves and the Australian Ambassador to Turkey what he had found. He also briefed Environment Australia before he began his archaeological survey. In April 2003, Dr Cameron reported directly, and in detail, to Air Vice Marshal Gary Beck, the head of the Office of Australian War Graves. Dr Cameron gave Air Vice Marshal Beck photos of a human thighbone and other wartime artefacts that he had found at Anzac Cove. The Turkish government began work at Anzac Cove, following the request from the Australian government. Dr Cameron emailed Air Vice Marshal Beck on 13 March this year, reminding him of their discussion two years ago. Dr Cameron says that he was condescendingly dismissed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked today relating to immigration and detention centres.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">This really boils down to a simple point: how many times can this government get a clear signal that the long-term detention regime directly causes immense, irreversible and unnecessary suffering for a huge range of people, including children? How many more examples do we need of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs overseeing major failings in the administration of law and major injustices towards individual people? It is getting to a stage where it is not possible to list all the different examples that are pouring into the public domain.</para>
<para>Last week there was a court case which found a clear-cut breach in the government’s duty of care—the absurd situation of people with severe mental illness having to go to court simply to get proper medical treatment. That sends pretty bad signals about contempt for the mentally ill, let alone the poor running of the detention centre regime. Then there was the deportation of an Australian woman to the Philippines. No-one knows if there are any others. According to evidence provided by this government, at least 33 people have been released after being found not to be unlawful. We do not know further details about how long those people were detained, or whether there were others.</para>
<para>None of this information is publicly available. It all has to be crowbarred out, piece by piece, by the community sector, by the Senate and by others. We have a situation in which the Edmund Rice Centre, a non-government organisation, is having to take the trouble to follow up 40 different people who have been deported—failed asylum seekers—to see whether they are facing a situation of danger, because the government will not do it. I guess it comes to the point of how many different people this government is going to ignore. It is not just a matter of the scandal of the day; it is a matter of a comprehensive examination of these issues by a whole range of different people.</para>
<para>I mentioned in my question the report <inline font-style="italic">A Sanctuary under review</inline>, from June 2000. It is a very comprehensive report of over 400 pages into our onshore assessment regime. It made a wide range of recommendations, including a unanimous one recommending that the government follow up the possibility of some form of arrangement with non-government organisations to informally monitor people who are returned, particularly to areas where there is a general risk of danger. A unanimous recommendation by that Senate committee, which included Liberal party members, was not agreed to by the government.</para>
<para>The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission did a report in 2001 on detention centres in a whole range of areas. Amongst other things, its recommendation was quite clear that indefinite long-term detention should not be continued:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Migration Act ... should be amended to impose specific time limits on detention, with provision for review of continuing detention ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That recommendation from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was ignored.</para>
<para>The Human Rights Subcommittee of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade did an inquiry in 2002—with members from all parties and chaired by a Liberal Party senator of long standing, Senator Ferguson—and unanimously recommended a time limit on migration detention. Again, that recommendation was rejected, with gratuitous abuse of the members of the committee from the then migration minister, I might say. The same committee, a year or two later, made another unanimous finding:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Of particular concern is the issue of mental health associated with long-term detention ...</para>
<para>While the physical conditions in the Baxter—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">immigration detention facility—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">were unquestionably better than the facilities we had seen in our previous visits ... they are not conducive to good mental health and well-being, and cannot negate the impact of long-term detention, particularly the psychological effects.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It was a clear-cut and unanimous finding from the committee. The findings of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and its comprehensive report into children in detention, <inline font-style="italic">A last resort</inline>,were ignored. Ombudsman committee inquiries have been ignored. The Select Committee on Ministerial Discretion in Migration Matters heard widespread problems associated with the ministerial discretion regime, which were ignored. How many more times? How many more court findings, committee inquiries, Palmer inquiries are we going to have before we get a simple recognition that the system does not work? It is time to change it and the government should do so without delay.</para>

<para class="block">At 9.15 pm on 3 September 1939, in a radio broadcast, Australians heard the voice of the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… it is my melancholy duty to inform you officially that, in consequence of the persistence by Germany in her invasion of Poland, Great Britain has declared war upon her, and that, as a result, Australia is also at war.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">When hostilities ceased on 8 May 1945, more than 50 million people were dead, including over 11,000 Australian soldiers, sailors and airmen who had sacrificed their lives for the freedom of Europe. Of course, victory in Europe marked the end of the war on only one front. Another three months of bloody fighting against the Japanese lay ahead before victory in the Pacific would also be achieved.</para>
<para>The war against Germany and Italy cost Australia dearly. In the campaigns of North Africa, the Middle East, Greece and Crete in 1941 and 1942, the Australian Army suffered the loss of 2,718 men killed and had 6,203 taken prisoner of war. Three warships of the Royal Australian Navy were sunk by enemy action in the Mediterranean, and the Navy’s most grievous loss ever in war occurred on 19 November 1941. On that day the cruiser HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> sank with all hands, 645 men, after an encounter with the German raider <inline font-style="italic">Kormoran</inline> off the coast of Western Australia. In the skies of Europe and the Middle East, the RAAF lost 6,532 airmen killed and more than 1,450 airmen became prisoners of war.</para>
<para>This massive military effort was sustained by a truly incredible performance on the home front. It remains the case to this day that those at the front line can only be sustained by the efforts of others left behind. In the type of total war that enveloped the globe between 1939 and 1945, the entire industrial resources of this nation were called into action to sustain the military struggle. It is important that we also remember today the efforts of the workers in the essential resource and manufacturing industries and the women who held families together whilst also serving as test pilots, drivers, machinists and engineers.</para>
<para>Some today might question Australia’s commitment to a war in Europe, and it is sometimes said that this nation was fighting other people’s wars. No-one, however, should be in any doubt that, had Germany prevailed in those dark days of 1940 and 1941, the consequences for this country would have been dire. In control of all of Europe with access to the Suez Canal, Germany could have joined forces much more readily with Japan, her ally in the East, and increased greatly the threat to Australia’s security. Then also, as now, Australia made common cause with allies and friends in the service of freedom. In helping to liberate occupied Europe from the yoke of Nazi rule at a cost of much blood and national treasure, Australia marked itself as one of the great democratic and free nations of the world.</para>
<para>As we look back upon the span of 60 years, it is hard for most of us to imagine the sacrifice and loss endured by a generation of Australian men and women who knew the full horrors of global war. For what they endured and for the countries they helped liberate from tyranny and occupation, they deserve our great respect and our solemn remembrance. As the passage of time sees their numbers dwindle, they should know that today’s Australians and those that follow will never forget the debt we owe them. I commend the motion to the Senate.</para>

</talker>
<para>—The opposition joins with the government in supporting this motion. We welcome this opportunity to reflect on the significance of VE Day some 60 years ago. Last Saturday evening I had the privilege of speaking to a large crowd of Russian veterans hosted by the member for Melbourne Ports, Mr Michael Danby. Present were many hundred Russian veterans, men and women, resplendent in their World War II uniforms, with row upon row of decorations. Such is their pride and custom.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In addressing them I paused to consider the links we have between Australia and Russia. These, of course, go back to Gallipoli where, if the grand strategy of Churchill had succeeded, our two armies might have met outside the city of Constantinople. The 8,709 Anzacs who died at Gallipoli did so in an attempt to open up a second front against Germany together with the Tsar. The rest is history.</para>
<para>Later we were allies against Germany again, though Australia’s role was smaller. But, as with many engagements around the world, Australians served where they were needed. One of those areas was service on the convoys which plied the North Sea, carrying to Russia necessary supplies. Australian seamen and merchant mariners served on those ships.</para>
<para>I am reminded of this by my family in Adelaide, who befriended a number of these young men as they signed on. My mother corresponded with a number of them, knowing that any contact from home would be most welcome in those very dark days. Sadly, in some cases the replies ceased arriving and outward letters were returned unread. I can recall from when I was a boy the terrible sadness, which lingered long after the war, about their inevitable loss at sea. I use this simple anecdote to show how far the effects of war in Europe reached across the world to Australia. Our losses by contrast were small. No matter what one’s occupation, every person was directly touched in some way.</para>
<para>The war between 1939 and 1945 in Europe remains the greatest calamity of the 20th century simply in terms of lives lost. We can never forget the horrors of the western front and our own symbols such as Gallipoli in World War I. That was sheer waste in an age of transition to a more liberal and democratic world. But World War II was worse for its total impact. Australia made a magnificent contribution to the war effort in Europe. Australian service was probably most conspicuous in the Royal Air Force and, of course, in the deserts of North Africa. There cannot be any doubt about the value of that commitment, which, as we know, was terminated due to our own defence needs against the Japanese. Therein lies another chapter but, despite that diversion of our forces, our effort in Europe continued.</para>
<para>It is appropriate that this motion today be in the form of a condolence motion. As I have said, the loss of life in Europe was horrific. Unlike World War I, this war also entailed the loss of many millions of civilians—not just Jewish people but millions of others as well. In Russia alone, millions of civilians perished as the Germans invaded and then retreated. The bombing of countless large cities in Britain and Germany in particular saw massive numbers of civilians lost. In fact, it has taken almost 50 years for that loss to be made good in economic terms as well.</para>
<para>It is appropriate, therefore, that we remember these losses and the pain left in so many families. We particularly remember the pain of Australian families whose sons and daughters left for Europe and never returned. We will remember them. However, we must not forget that VE Day, while significant for us, is only part of our war experience. As VJ Day approaches we need to consider a phase of the war which was even more important. No doubt we will have that opportunity next August or September.</para>
<para>Having noted the nature of this motion today, we cannot avoid the sense of celebration on VE Day as well. The television portrayal from Europe that we have all seen in the last few days, from Moscow in particular, has been one of triumphalism. That is understandable given that Russia fought off the Nazi invaders at a cost of at least 20 million dead—and some now put the figure at 26 million. That is more than Australia’s current population. Many find such a loss of life difficult to comprehend. What has followed has been some controversy as the victors parade in Red Square. That celebration is totally warranted by the Russian people. Indeed, of all the nations involved in World War II, none suffered as much as the Russian people. The people of eastern Europe, of course, have objected to this sense of celebration. It is hardly likely they will celebrate the removal of the Nazis to remain subservient to another invader for another 50 years.</para>
<para>To that extent, it is also relevant to note that VE Day is not just symbolic of the removal of Nazism or fascism. It also marked a shift which occurred between those competing pressures of totalitarianism, communism and liberalism. As we know, liberalism has won. But it has been a struggle for those caught in the sharing of spoils and the carving up of the globe between the winners. So there can be no doubt that VE day does symbolise the end of the tyranny of totalitarianism. VE Day saw the absolute removal of Nazism and Hitler—noting that Mussolini had already departed the scene and Franco would later. What remained were the remnants of Stalinism, which, along with communism in Russia, in turn met its own slow demise. The turning point can therefore be said to have been VE Day, without question. Liberal and democratic ideals were restored throughout Europe and have prospered without hesitation ever since. Indeed, in Europe now there is no further conflict from those former competing ideologies. Instead they have returned to the more traditional competition in trade in a world of largely free-market economies.</para>
<para>May I conclude that, while it is appropriate and proper that we remember the enormous loss of life in this motion, let us also celebrate the passing of a great horror in the world. We live in prosperous times, and that is because of those who fought and died in the fight against the tyranny of totalitarianism. We should not forget what the world endured between 1939 and 1945. Those who celebrate should do so with gusto. They are truly entitled to do so. At the same time, we know they will also remember their mates, friends, families and loved ones. We share that with them today.</para>
<para>As we remember the sacrifice of generations past, it would be remiss of the opposition not to note the successful conclusion of our assistance to Indonesia and the return of our defence forces today, which the minister talked about in a response in question time. We should also note our other forces in the Solomon Islands, Iraq, Afghanistan and other parts of the world. There are a range of other peacekeeping missions in which men and women of the Australian Defence Force currently serve. We remember them, we wish them well in their endeavours and we look forward also to their safe return in due course.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I wanted to speak on this motion on the conclusion of the Second World War in Europe because it is a period of history that has had a particular fascination for me. I was born just a few months after the war concluded but when I was a young boy some of the evidence of the war was still around in Australia. I can remember that in the backyard of a house I lived in there was still a zigzag trench dug right down the back. I could not work out what it was for except that it was a good thing to play in, but the significance of it dawned on me many years later.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This was a time in the world’s history which was very complex politically. There were huge divisions and debates between fascism and communism and what we followed in the democratic free world. Those particular ideologies arose from some of the mistakes that the world made in the First World War. Indeed, in retrospect many commentators have said, and I agree, that the Second World War was but an extension and continuation of the First World War. The reparations put on Germany were such that it actually swelled a series of political manoeuvrings within Germany that led to the rise of the National Socialist Party. It started off in a democratic form. Hitler was actually elected to a parliament. There were a few incidents that happened that may have been manipulated in a much greater way than any of the political parties manipulate in Australia these days. We do not go to things like burning the Reichstag to get a particular political emphasis. There were a lot of machinations which seemed to be a lot more extreme than we ever experience in the Western democracies. It did start out that way but degenerated into one of the vilest activities that this world has ever seen. That was the slaughter of some six million people for no other reason than their racial origin. Certainly the extermination of the Jews by Hitler’s Europe was something about which all human beings must hang their heads in shame.</para>
<para>The period also demonstrated what appeasement will do. You might remember, Mr President, that the British Prime Minister at the time did all in his power to appease Germany and to allow Hitler to continue in his march towards some of the programs that we later saw executed. That appeasement, I think, demonstrates to all of us that we should never appease tyrants. It is a lesson that some in this chamber could well understand and well follow as they debate issues of contemporary Australian politics.</para>
<para>The war had an important and at times quite devastating political impact quite right across Europe. In France at least 50 per cent of the people thought that Hitler was right and fascism was not too bad. Another 50 per cent of the people thought quite differently. There were great problems faced by the French government at that time and, as a politician looking back 60 or 70 years, one can understand some of the traumatic decisions that had to be made at that time. History shows that Marshal Petain collaborated with the Nazis and gave the northern half of France to German occupation. He moved his headquarters to Vichy and ran a collaborationist government in Vichy for several years before the Germans finally understood that they needed the whole of France under Nazi control to try and protect the borders. That must have caused particular problems in France. It is interesting to read of some of the difficulties in France, with de Gaulle in London running his freedom fighters but on the mainland of France all these different groups who were fighting against the Germans and very often fighting amongst themselves. There were the Free French on one hand and the Communists on the other hand fighting each other at the same time as fighting the Germans. That pattern was followed in many parts of the Balkans as well. They must have been very difficult times in that era.</para>
<para>The Australian involvement with the war started the day that the British government declared war on Germany over the invasion of Poland. You will recall the famous words of Robert Menzies saying that, when Britain goes to war, so does Australia. That was the sentiment of the time. Australians enthusiastically went to the defence of the mother country, as it was then seen, and in the early years of the war many Australians participated in Europe and in the Middle East, particularly, with great distinction. Many Australian pilots were involved in both the RAF and the RAAF in the fight against Germany. I had two uncles—of course I never knew either of them—both of whom were killed in the 1,000-plane air raids over Germany in 1943-44. They were one of my mother’s brothers and one of my father’s brothers, one of whose diaries we have. It is very poignant to read it and to follow through from the day he left Cooktown, where he was shire clerk, went to Canada with the Air Training Corps and ended up in England. He went to Egypt, as I recall, and went back to England and wrote a diary about his particular exploits every night. It is quite eerie when there is one diary entry that says, ‘Going again. Tomorrow we might be doing this but today we are off,’ and that is where the diary comes to a stop.</para>
<para>There were a lot of Australians involved in what we see as the defence of the Free World in that area. Of course, by D-day, on 6 June 1944, Australians had been recalled to our homeland to fight a menace to our own country—the threat from the Japanese forces in the north. Some Australians stayed in various elements, but our involvement in the final days of the war in the landing at Normandy was fairly minor.</para>
<para>I have just come back from a trip to Canada, to a fishing conference at St John’s in Newfoundland. We were there when the Canadians were opening their war memorial, and they had a series of paintings on loan from the Australian War Memorial. I had the honour of being present when that art exhibition was opened as part of their new war memorial. At the time we were there the Canadians were involved in commemorative activities in Holland, where the Canadians were during the last few days and weeks before the end of the war. The Canadian press were running some again very poignant stories about Canadians who were killed two, three and four days before the war ended. One reads those and cannot help but feel the futility of war in many respects.</para>
<para>The aftermath of the war was very traumatic for people. We do not fully understand, I think, the extent of the civilian casualties of the war. Certainly, when Germany were on the advance, their treatment of civilians, particularly in Russia, was horrific. Similarly, when the Russians were advancing in turn, their treatment of civilians in the occupied countries, particularly in the Baltic States, was equally devastating. I understand from people I know who were German civilians that the period after the Russians reached Berlin was quite horrific. It does not matter which side you are on; the civilians always lose out. And I suspect that no side is any better than any other side when it comes to some of the atrocities committed. In France in particular, and in Britain to a much lesser extent, there were recriminations against those who had collaborated—all very popular at the time, but in retrospect, after 60 years, one wonders about some of these elements.</para>
<para>The end of the Second World War really signalled the start of the Cold War. We then had a couple of decades of Russian totalitarianism. It is interesting to note that, while the Russians ended up on our side, that only occurred after Operation Barbarossa—when Germany turned on what was then its ally, Russia. You might recall that, before Operation Barbarossa, Russia and Germany had agreed between them to collaborate in splitting up Poland. They were allies, but then the Germans attacked their own ally—Hitler had always mistrusted the Russians—and they became total enemies. It is quite interesting, but not thought about a lot, that when the war started the communist countries were on the side of the Nazis, against the Free World. Of course, it did not end up that way. Following the conclusion of hostilities, the Cold War started, and we have learned of or read about some of the atrocities in the Russian-occupied territories that occurred until the fall of the Berlin Wall, not all that long ago.</para>
<para>One thing that is perhaps useful for us to reflect on as we think about the termination of hostilities 60 years ago is that we do seem to have, to a degree, learnt from our mistakes in that era. I think we have learnt that total war is entirely unacceptable; it achieves nothing. Since the collapse of the USSR totalitarian regime, we have been a world relatively at peace. However, I think we must always remember that appeasement never helps. Since that time there have been a number of lesser conflicts—the most recent being Iraq, of course, and Timor and various other places—in which Australia has played a leading role. Fortunately, the world conflagration that was exemplified by the first and second world wars has not happened again. I do not think it ever will, because we have learnt the lessons from the wars fought midway through last century.</para>
<para>Like other senators, I celebrate today that milestone in the world’s history, the conclusion of the Second World War, with victory to the allied forces, the forces of democracy. In doing that we should of course always recall all of those who paid the supreme sacrifice for what they believed in—from all sides, I might say. We as Australians and as part of the allied forces are grateful to those on our side who died, but there were others on the other side who died fighting for a cause they believed in. It is an appropriate time to recognise the courage and the sacrifice of so many combatants from Australia and other countries in that war. It is, I think, great encouragement for us all in our determination that those sorts of worldwide conflicts never again occur.</para>

<para>—I am very pleased to have the opportunity to support on behalf of The Nationals this VE Day condolence motion moved by Senator Hill. When Senator Hill commenced his speech, he quoted part of Prime Minister Menzies’s famous speech on 3 September 1939, where he said:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">… it is my melancholy duty to inform you officially that, in consequence of the persistence of Germany in her invasion of Poland, Great Britain has declared war upon her, and that, as a result, Australia is also at war.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So commenced nearly six years of war, which ceased with VE Day on 8 May 1945. Of course, the total conflict ceased with VJ Day the following August, later in 1945. VE Day brought to an end probably the greatest conflict that the world has ever seen. It saw the destruction of fascist Germany and the unconditional surrender of fascist Germany on 8 May. Germany, on that day, ceased to exist as a recognisable state. It was divided up between the successful allies. It brought to an end World War II, which had seen the devastation of much of eastern Europe—Poland, East Russia, much of Russia and, of course, the Baltic States. World War II had also seen the annihilation of European Jewry, the death camps, the genocide of millions of eastern Europeans, millions and millions of Russian civilians and, of course, a very large number of Russian soldiers. It is estimated that between 30 and 40 million lives were lost in those six years. You also have to remember the impact on Italy, Greece, the Middle East and occupied Europe—the western European countries and the Scandinavian countries—which were also subject to the rigours of occupation and the pain that the Nazi regime was able to extend towards them.</para>
<para>In May 1940, just before Dunkirk, which was in June 1940, when England stood alone, Prime Minister Churchill made one of his many famous speeches. I think it is worth reminding the Senate of what he said, in part:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many long months of struggle and ... suffering. You ask, What is our policy?

I can answer with one word: “Victory—victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory however long and hard the road may be; for without victory there is no survival.”</para>

<para class="block">That in fact was the absolute core of the success of the Allies. They had that feeling that they were fighting the war of all wars and, without that, they would not have succeeded. If you read the history of the time, and you read the interpretation of the history by experts since, you really start to understand just how close the Allies were to being defeated by the might of Nazi Germany.</para>
<para>Later on, of course, Hitler, having been unsuccessful in the Battle of Britain in September 1940, turned his attention towards Russia, which had previously been a friend of convenience. It was another totalitarian state. He invaded Russia in June of 1941. The Eastern Front was probably the greatest conflict in World War II—probably the greatest conflict of any that we have seen in human history. The Germans, by Christmas of 1941, had had over a million casualties. To put that in perspective, they may have had 20,000 casualties in successfully invading France. They had a million casualties and, in the next 3½ years, the Germans suffered five million casualties and had many millions taken as prisoners of war. The Russians suffered the most horrific treatment. The Germans treated the domestic civil population of Russia with complete and utter disdain. This was a fight to the death between two very strong and mortal enemies. No-one knows quite how many were lost, but, in the next 3½ years, maybe 25 million Russians lost their lives. That was the case right up until the end in 1945 when, of course, the Russians stormed the Reichstag and secured Berlin.</para>
<para>I think it is worth saying that the effects of World War II have very much shaped the events of the last 60 years—a period during which almost everybody in the Senate, and certainly everybody in the chamber now, was born. It certainly has shaped the world that we have seen develop over the last six decades. We have seen the division of Europe. Very shortly after the end of World War II we saw the Iron Curtain come down. We saw the communist enslavement of many proud and formerly independent states, particularly in eastern Europe. We saw the Cold War and the concept of mutually assured destruction between NATO and the Soviet bloc. In the broad, the war has brought peace, prosperity and cohesion to many millions of Europeans. In fact, in a sense, it has brought an interdependence that has not been fully played out but will be seen in the next few years with the emergence of Germany and France as substantially the powerhouses of the EU and the broadening of membership of the EU also, which may extend even as far as Turkey and beyond. These are times of great interest in terms of convenient world trading blocs joining together and becoming powerful forces within themselves.</para>
<para>We have also seen the collapse of the Soviet Union. As we move forward and see the very close interdependence of Russia and western Europe, these events are a cause for reflection and they have to be reflected on in the context of what has happened over the last 60 years as times have changed and as countries have forgotten perhaps the animosities they felt in the past. Of course, the eastern European bloc collapsed from within because it was not able to meet the challenges of modern economies and the development of free enterprise.</para>
<para>It was a remarkable day on 8 May 1945. We are now 60 years on. I think it is important to mark this date not only as a time of great excitement for those people who had been in World War II but also as a time when we remember those Australians and the many others who lost their lives, particularly our airmen who were in western Europe with the RAAF, which had its own airmen there, and also those who were embedded with the allied air force, which lost 7,000 men over western Europe, with many thousands of casualties. It is also important to remember the troops that served in the Middle East and North Africa. This was a very difficult time for Australia. We had 100,000 men serving in Europe and North Africa and we had around 17,000 people who died in those arenas. So it is a time to remember those people and it is a time to remember this enormous conflict of human proportions that has very much shaped the last 60 years and shaped the world in which we find ourselves.</para>

<para>—I would like to support this motion commemorating the 60th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. Of course, that event was not the formal end of the Second World War, and perhaps more relevant to Australia to some extent was the final surrender of Japan and victory in the Pacific. Nonetheless, it is a significant anniversary of a significant part of our nation’s history. The Second World War was a war of such horror that for many people it is literally unspeakable. We all would have heard of service men and women who returned from the war and never spoke about it. I think that is the perfect demonstration of when something is literally so horrific as to be unspeakable. There were the extraordinary—in the worst sense of the word—depravities of the Holocaust, in particular, with the deaths of the millions of Jews who are mentioned in this motion and also of the disabled, the mentally ill, gays, gypsies and political opponents, all of whom were exterminated in the most callous and dismissive way. The trauma of that alone lives on 60 years later in the lives of many people.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is important to acknowledge anniversaries like this and it is important to honour, remember and thank Australians who gave their lives in the war—over 11,000 Australian soldiers, sailors and airmen—and also to remember the greater price in some ways, depending on how philosophical you want to get, paid by their loved ones, by their immediate family. Again, some of those people are still living with the pain of that loss some 60 years on. Similarly, some of those who did return still live with what is quite a visceral and—for those of us who did not go through it—barely imaginable pain. I think it is also appropriate in the context of a motion like this to pay particular tribute to our nation’s wartime leader at the time, John Curtin, a man who perhaps had the curse but in some ways, for a leader, the appropriate ability to sense—to a greater extent than many people acknowledge—how immense that suffering and pain was for so many people. He felt that directly himself. I do not think there is much doubt that that was part of what significantly shortened his own life. He thankfully lived to see Victory in Europe Day, but he did not live to see the final conclusion of the Second World War. I think he should be part of the tribute we pay. It is pretty rare for me to put a politician anywhere in the same vicinity as service men and women in terms of sacrifices and what should be noted, but I think John Curtin’s contribution should specifically be noted.</para>
<para>I do think it is appropriate, however, in the context of motions like this to also note our own failings as nations, even on the winning side—the appropriate side of freedom and democracy—in this conflict. There was a blind eye turned to atrocities and I believe actions were taken that were unnecessary. The bombing of Dresden is the most notorious one, but I think there are others as well. After the war, many nations took in people who were perpetrators of war crimes, such as Nazi scientists and others—some unwittingly and some perhaps only unknowingly because they chose not to know. There is of course continuing controversy about the role of the Vatican in the Second World War and how much it did or did not look the other way. I do not seek to explore that further; I simply seek to ensure that those failings on our own side are not forgotten as part of continuing to aspire to not repeat some of these mistakes.</para>
<para>The 1951 refugee convention, which even this very day in the chamber was so topical in political debate, was something else that grew out of the enormous upheaval and suffering of the Second World War. Some of the failures at that time to offer sanctuary to people who were fleeing persecution were because it was not convenient. It is because some things are not done when it is not convenient to do them that things can move in the direction of the sorts of monumental atrocities that eventually became part of World War II.</para>
<para>The motion talks of the 60 years of relative peace and records gratitude for that. Again, I think it should be mentioned that we here in Australia—I suspect it is the same for others but I know for sure that I, having lived all my life in this country—really do not know how lucky we are not to have been subjected in any significant way to large-scale conflict, war and violence on our soil. That is something that is a remarkable blessing and long may it continue for the sake of all of us. The importance of that peace, and the absence of the pain that results from the breakdown of peace, is probably the greatest privilege of being an Australian in many respects. It should be mentioned that, whilst the period of 60 years since the war has been one of relative peace, it certainly has not been one of absolute peace. It has mostly, although not completely, been one of relative peace in Europe. But clearly in other areas, including areas quite close to Europe, there continue to this day to be significant major conflicts and wars, some of them stemming over many, many years—much longer than the Second World War.</para>
<para>When we commemorate the end of such a horror as the Second World War, we should not do so out of triumphalism or even out of a sense of relief—although we certainly should out of a sense of gratitude—but as a reminder of our continuing duty to seek to do what we can to end war everywhere. The suffering that so many Australians endured, and, as I mentioned earlier, the continuing pain and the scarring of lives that some people feel as a consequence, is something that many others in the world are still experiencing today. Where we can help to alleviate that I think we should. That is the deeper purpose of motions such as this.</para>
<para>I would like to specifically emphasise that when we acknowledge the contribution of troops, whether it is in this conflict or in others, we should also acknowledge and emphasise at every opportunity our responsibility to properly care for those that do return, and for the families of those who do not return as well as those who do. They pay a significant price above and beyond the rest, and their special contribution should be acknowledged not just with medals and parades, important though those are, but with ongoing assistance for them in dealing with what their lives have now become. I think we continue to fall short in those areas in some respects, and we should always use motions and opportunities like this to reaffirm our need to do better in that regard.</para>
<para>We should also take the opportunity to acknowledge the many Australian troops who are currently overseas and away from loved ones in circumstances of significant risk to themselves on peace enforcement missions around the world. Most notably and controversially, of course, are those in Iraq, but there are also those in the Solomon Islands, those in North-East Asia, those in other parts of the Middle East, those delivering aid in Indonesia, those still assisting in Timor Leste and those 15 who are soon to go to the Sudan. It is important to emphasise in all of those cases that, although individual Australians may not support the specific political decision to make some of those deployments, we should always support those troops who go where they are told to go. Whilst I will certainly continue to focus on the need for greater emphasis and effort towards peace and disarmament, I acknowledge that, whilst we want to avoid wars and do more to stop them, there must always be Australians willing to go off and fight them, and they should be supported and acknowledged in that particular sacrifice.</para>
<para>I do think that we have to ensure that we carefully tread the fine line between noting and commemorating events like these and glorifying war. It should not be mythologised; it should not be seen as romantic; it should not be politically exploited by politicians, religious leaders, commercial entities or anybody else. That in many ways cheapens the enormous sacrifice that has already been made. It can gloss over the atrocities, the injustices, the poor decisions and the mistakes that all add to the slaughter and the loss and the pain. A commentary I read by one person on a web site flowing on from Anzac Day made an impact on me because it moved it back to the individual level. There were 11,000 Australian soldiers, sailors and airmen mentioned in this motion who lost their lives in the Second World War—defending their country and defending freedom and democracy for people in other countries as well as our own. In addition to that 11,000, there were many more who did survive but who returned changed forever by what they experienced. This one person spoke of their grandfather. He had left school at 15, fought for his country because he believed he should, become a major and, indeed, got married in his uniform. He was brought home from fighting in New Guinea half dead from disease. Whilst they never heard him speak about the war, they heard him fight it night after night in his sleep.</para>
<para>His great-uncle, who was a Rat of Tobruk, was not able to go home, even to see his wife, before he had to be shipped off to the Pacific to fight again. He survived—indeed, he is still alive—but his wife was rendered so fragile by the anxiety of his perpetual absence and the fear of what would happen to him that her mind shattered not long after he had finally returned. There is the impact of his father who did not go to Vietnam because he was at university, and his cousin who did go because he was not at university. Even though his father opposed the war, he still sometimes felt guilty because he did not go and his cousin felt gutted because he did. His mother took great care of a tiny leather bound diary her great-uncle had kept, which tells of trenches, gas attacks and the piercing fear. There are photos of the green miles in France that formed his unmarked grave. His grandmother would gently and regularly lead his grandfather back to bed, reassuring him decades later that there were no enemy around.</para>
<para>Those are examples from just one family; I have truncated the story a little bit. If you multiply that by tens and tens of thousands of Australians and the millions from other nations, the enormity of the suffering and the stupidity of wars like this, in the most enormous way possible, are beyond what is comprehendible. Whether you look at it in terms of the large scale, the unthinkable numbers involved or the individual pain and suffering just to one family, it is something that we should continually use to remind ourselves that we must do all we can to halt it in other parts of the world in the future.</para>
<para>I think motions like these are important for all of those reasons. Sixty years on, our duty to those who made those sacrifices is as strong as ever. Reminding ourselves of that is a reminder of how far we have to go. Maybe things are relatively peaceable in some parts of the world, but we are still falling well and truly short of where we should be. There is still too much of that unspeakable pain happening and we should be doing a lot more to stop it. I think we should take occasions like this to reaffirm our commitment to do so. I support the motion, note the contributions that so many people made and reaffirm my desire to do what we can to ensure it does not happen again.</para>

<para>—Victory in Europe was on 9 May, although some hostility ceased on 7 May, yet some wanted to hold it on 8 May, but journalists at the time could not hold the secret—‘So what is new?’ I hear someone say. So, instead of holding it on 9 May, as it should have been held, it was held prematurely in parts of Europe and Russia on 8 May. In other places I think it was held on 8 May.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>A week before last, I was in Red Square in Moscow. It was quite eerie standing there knowing that they had celebrations there the day before, knowing that 27 million young Russians perished in that conflict with Germany and its allies—we must remember that Germany had allies: Romania and Italy, to mention some in Europe—and knowing that they were then subjected to the purges of Stalin, where another 25 million died. One wonders why Russians are able to march today with pride at what happened, given the atrocities that were committed against them over that 10-year period. But celebrate they did and in a grand fashion. One saw the old men and women marching proudly with their medals—chins up, chests out, shoulders back—and almost revelling in the fact that they defended their motherland and survived.</para>
<para>I travelled on through Europe and had the pleasure to be in Rome at a ceremony for Anzac Day, as we call it. In a small graveyard where the ceremony was held, I saw the graves of several young Australians—mostly airmen—who were shot down over Italy and the grave of a young woman who had been killed and buried in that picturesque and peaceful little cemetery where they are sleeping. She was a 26-year-old physiotherapist. It was particularly poignant to see that. I think of the First World War and other wars that Australia has participated in—the Boer War, even the Maori wars in the 1840s, the Vietnam War, the Malaysian emergency and the war between the Koreas—and I wonder when it is going to stop. I wonder when young men and young women are going to stop giving their lives for older people who make the decisions to send them to their deaths. I think of our Australians in Iraq, where I have been on a couple of occasions. You may have read recently that I was in Iraq in January. I wonder when the sacrifices are going to stop. I am buoyed by the fact that the Second World War seems to have heralded something of a cessation in the gargantuan number of lives that are given for the defence of one’s country—ostensibly, at least, for the defence of one’s country.</para>
<para>Being a former national serviceman, I am not given to visiting cemeteries normally. They are rather morbid places to be, even at the best of times. But I have been to a number of cemeteries around the world where young Australians are buried. There are 100,000 young Australians buried around the world in far-out places. They are not just in Europe, where many are sleeping in France, Poland, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Italy and Great Britain, but in way-out places like Labuan Island off the coast of Borneo, and Sandakan, where the death march, the atrocity committed by the Japanese, began from. I have been to the centre of Borneo. There is a picturesque little cemetery right in the centre of Borneo, up in the mountains.</para>
<para>I have been to cemeteries in India, South Africa and Crete. I was in Crete just last Friday. I had no idea how mountainous it was. I thought of my uncle, who had his shoulder blown away by a German Stuka. He was evacuated from Crete and rehabilitated in Egypt before he was taken home at the age of 22, already partly crippled. I have been to other places: Papua New Guinea—New Britain, part of Papua New Guinea—Java, in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Iran. When I was in Iran a couple of years ago I went to a picturesque cemetery again, not far out of Teheran, in a walled area. It is maintained impeccably by the Iranian government. I do not know whether they are paid for it or not, but it is maintained impeccably. Some Australians who are buried there were fighting during the 1920s somewhere in Europe. They were evacuated to hospital, died there and were buried in Teheran.</para>
<para>I think 100,000 young Australians is enough. We had one million men under arms during the 1939-45 conflict. It is too much for a nation of six million people to have a million men and women under arms. I would suspect that there is a tapering off on these great wars. Remember that the First World War was the war to end all wars. I do not know how many we have had since then. I suppose young men and women will go off again if they are called to do so.</para>
<para>On this occasion, we are remembering victory in Europe. I remember it. I remember the end of the war. I remember my mother being very excited about my father coming home. He had served for five or six years during the war, almost the entire period. Because he was married with children he stayed home for a while, but only for a few months. At the end of the war he did not come home, unfortunately, although he was not a casualty in terms of being wounded or killed. I guess my family was a casualty, because he found someone else and stayed away. There are all sorts of casualties of war. One does not need to be wounded or to die to be a casualty in war. I thought, ‘How would I get on if I had served five or six years?’ Thankfully, when I put my age up to 16 and joined the Army, hoping to get to the Korean War, the war ended before I was able to get there. My mother had me kicked out because I had forged a signature, and then I was called up for national service.</para>
<para>I am very pleased to be able to speak this afternoon on this condolence motion. I do have the utmost respect and affection for our young men and women who are sleeping all over the world. In the cemeteries that I have seen, they are being cared for reverently, with manifest affection, as one can see from the plots that are so immaculately tended and the flowers that are there. Those young people gave their lives so that I can stand here today in absolute freedom and speak of the sacrifice that they made. They are sleeping all over Europe.</para>
<para>When I was at the Menin Gate last year with Mr President, I found my grandmother’s brother, who, at 26, was cut down. His grave had been somewhat ‘lost’, in a sense. The embassy in Brussels provided a magnificent bunch of flowers so that I could lay it at the foot of the grave. I am 70 next year. I have had a very interesting life. I reflected on all of those people who will never see that, never experience what I have, yet they made the greatest of all sacrifices. I thank all those young men and women who gave their lives for real freedom so that I can speak, so that people can choose to listen or turn off if they wish to and so that we can go about our busy lives. On this one day we reflect on those young Australians who never had the opportunity that I had.</para>
<para>In August we will celebrate the victory in the Pacific against the Japanese. No doubt people will be able to talk then about the atomic bomb and Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Let me say very briefly that victory in the Pacific was in a sense much more visible for us. I was in Adelaide when the Japanese capitulated and Emperor Hirohito signed the unconditional surrender as a result of the almost 200,000 people who died as the result of two atomic bombs. I remember it so well. I was 10 years old, and I remember the celebrations—the dancing in the street. I saw giant rockets. I do not know whether they were meant for combative purposes or celebration purposes, but they were big rockets. Perhaps they were just big because I was 10 years old. I had never seen anything like it before, nor have I experienced anything like it since. Once again, we will have the opportunity of reflecting on all those young men and young women who gave their lives in that theatre of war.</para>
<para>I want to finish by saying that it is not easy for me to talk about sacrifices or even to be emotional, but it is very easy for me to be emotional—even though it is difficult for me to talk—about these issues. It is a great honour for me to have visited Russia in the week before last, to have visited Rome and to have participated in those celebrations. Whilst in a sense I do not look forward to the celebration in August, I do look forward to expressing myself and thanking those who sent their sons, their daughters, their fathers and their loved ones away to those wars. I trust that, whilst there will always be conflicts, they will never be on the scale of the First World War or the Second World War or of those massive losses that not just Australia but others in the world suffered.</para>

<para>—The matters I raise go to the hours of sitting and the available hours that we have. Today we have heard a motion to vary the hours of sitting, which is one of those areas where it is usual for discussion to take place between the government, the opposition and minor parties about how these matters are progressed. In the past, there has been reasonable discourse, discussion and consultation between the managers of business about both the hours and other matters that surround the hours and the use of the available time within the Senate. I would like to take a couple of moments now to set down a few issues that I think are important to ensure that there is management within this chamber to allow what will be quite a compressed period as we run up to 1 July. There are two weeks effectively remaining. We have Senate estimates, and then we go into the last two weeks before the end of the winter sittings.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I must say that there is usually more consultation leading up to these three days than I have experienced so far. One example is the condolence motions that we have here today. Of course Labor were aware that there would be a need for a condolence motion for Mr Grassby, for instance. We were aware that there were probably other matters such as the Sea King tragedy that should be reported or at least dealt with in this house. There was also the death of His Holiness. If you go back to precedent, that also looks like a matter that is dealt with by condolence motion. Having looked at those, we contacted the government about how we might proceed.</para>
<para>For whatever reason, and I do not really want to put blame here, it took quite a long time—I suspect right up to some time this morning—for the government to finalise its position. We also did not have a red. We had a draft red, but even then it was quite late in the process, for whatever reason. We finally had a red that we could follow to understand the position that the government had adopted in relation to the work but, for whatever reason, that was still quite late in the process.</para>
<para>We think that there are lessons to be learnt from this. If we are going to utilise the last two weeks of the sitting pattern in winter to deal with legislation, then we have to talk a little bit more and a little bit earlier as well about how we are going to manage the time. The condolence motions are one example. If they could have been discussed a little bit earlier, we would have made a number of other suggestions about how to deal with them in order to ensure that time management could be applied whilst ensuring that everyone could still deal with the issues they wanted to deal with. At the moment, not only do we have me speaking now for five minutes but also the government is eating up government time in dealing with condolences which would otherwise be spent in dealing with legislation. I understand that it is budget night, but we still can consider legislation or utilise government time. Instead, we are dealing with condolence motions. I do not have a problem with that if that is the government’s wish. The issue will come in the next two weeks when we will also have valedictories to deal with—quite a number, I suspect—which will also need to be time managed, so we will need to discuss those.</para>
<para>The condolence motions that have been put today could have been put in alternative ways to utilise time that was otherwise not government time. That would have been our preference. It is not the case that we are disappointed that this is the way the government want to deal with them. If the government want to eat up government time, that is a matter for them, really. Some of these issues could have been dealt with in an adjournment debate. There might have been ways to ensure that everyone who wanted to had an opportunity to deal with them. But that was not to be.</para>
<para>We need to look at how we are going to program the government legislation, valedictories and any condolence motions that come forward. There are usually side winds that turn up to take valuable time in the last two weeks. If the government decide not to engage and consult now when they do not have the numbers, my concern is that post 1 July they will act like an arrogant government and not consult. That will invariably eat up government time. Maybe I am giving them a warning that they do not need. But all they have done by managing the business in this way is eat up government time.</para>
<para>Notwithstanding all that, the other issue is the precedent that might be set by dealing with motions in this way—particularly condolence motions. My examination of the record indicates that this is not the way this place would normally deal with condolence motions, so there is a precedent being set here by these condolence motions. They will obviously be set down as markers for the future. Notwithstanding that, it seems to be the government’s will to deal with them in this way. So be it. I simply put on the record that improved consultation would have assisted.</para>

We seek to cooperate with the opposition party and the other parties in the Senate, firstly, because it is the right thing to do and, secondly, because it saves time in the long run. The only issue that is a little out of the norm here is the decision to move the condolence motion in relation to the late Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen in the condolence section rather than perhaps in the general business section or alternatively in the adjournment debate. That is justified in the circumstance of his very close relationship, through his wife, with the Senate and by the fact that a like decision was taken in the House of Representatives and we would not have wished there to be any misinterpretation. That is why we made that decision. That the program for the day was settled somewhat late is always to be regretted but it is quite often the case on a first day back and when we seek to work in close liaison with the other house.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Looking at the number of opposition members who are retiring, we will be asked a little later in the session to help the opposition with some government time in relation to valedictories. In a spirit of cooperation, we would want to do that. That does require a bit of give and take on both sides. I note what Senator Ludwig has said; I take it in a spirit of goodwill. We will seek to play our part in this chamber in a constructive and cooperative way.</para>

<para>—I will add a word to the problem, if I may, of such important matters coming before the Senate on the same day as the budget. The motion on VE Day is one that the Greens support. Here we have a recollection of and a memoriam to the possibly more than 50 million people who died in extraordinary circumstances from which the world has not learnt. I am aghast that the world is still divided and is spending more on arms than it ever has before and that the tragic loss of so many millions in the last century—some 200 million people—to wars has still not been learnt from. We must honour those lives that were lost because of human disputes not being settled in a better way. We must also honour those people who survived—no-one returns from war uninjured. We must honour the service they gave to great ideals and indeed to this country. The matter ought not be submerged on a day like this by other immediate matters. I hope the government can better arrange for such debates in the future.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate notes the death on 2 April 2005 of His Holiness Pope John Paul II and expresses its profound regret at his passing.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">The unprecedented outpouring of grief at the passing of Pope John Paul II stands as testament to his impact on many millions of people around the globe. In many ways, Pope John Paul II was the first entirely modern pope. It is said that his extensive travel meant that he was seen in person by more people than any other human being in history. This, plus his command of the modern media, made him one of the most widely recognised figures of the 20th century.</para>
<para>All people of goodwill, whether Catholic or not, will recognise Karol Wojtyla as a tireless advocate for world peace. In troubled times the world needs peacemakers. There is no doubt that John Paul was such a person. As a young man in Poland he witnessed first hand the ravages of Nazism and Communism. It was probably for his role in the downfall of the latter evil that he will most obviously be remembered. It was John Paul’s instinctive support for the cause of freedom embodied by Lech Walesa and the Solidarity movement which was instrumental in the downfall of Communism in Poland. This set off waves that were felt across Europe.</para>
<para>In later years and at great personal risk during the height of the Balkans war he visited Sarajevo, with its divided orthodox and Muslim communities. In February 2000 he reached out to Jews and Muslims with a hugely important visit to the Holy Land. In days following the September 11 terrorist attacks, he again ignored concerns for his safety by travelling to Kazakhstan.</para>
<para>There is no doubt that Pope John Paul II was a controversial figure to many. But, whatever judgments people may make about individual positions taken by the Pope, few could fail to acknowledge the grandeur of his life story, the courage of his convictions, the strength and humility of his personality and the compassion of his ministry. All people of goodwill will be saddened by the passing of a man who was one of the giants of the 20th century. I commend the motion to the Senate.</para>

<para>—On behalf of the opposition I support the condolence motion moved by Senator Hill following the death of Pope John Paul II. John Paul was loved by millions of Catholics around the world and here in Australia. His loss was felt deeply by many and his contribution to the Catholic Church will continue to bear fruit in the years to come. I would also like to welcome the election of Pope Benedict XVI, formerly Joseph, Cardinal Ratzinger of Germany. I am sure he will continue the good work done by his predecessor and set his own mark on the life of the Catholic Church.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>John Paul II was born in 1920 in Wadowice, Poland, and named Karol Jozef Wojtyla. His father had been in the military and his mother, who died when Karol was eight years old, encouraged him into the church from a very early age. He was also passionately interested in theatre and sports. By accident of birth, John Paul was born into perhaps the most turbulent period in European history. The Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 was the start of a reign of terror directed against the Polish population in general and Polish Jewry in particular. The wholesale destruction of the Polish nation was an aim of the occupation.</para>
<para>Recently we remembered the 60th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe and the liberation of the Nazi death camps. It is hard, 60 years on, to fully comprehend the scale of savagery that was inflicted on the Poles and other nations and peoples by the Nazis. John Paul was a survivor of these terrible times. During the war John Paul was involved with underground theatre in Krakow, an activity that put him at some personal risk. He was arrested by Nazi officials at one point but was freed due to the fact that he was a labourer in a quarry.</para>
<para>After the war he began his training for the priesthood. He served as a parish priest and later a professor of ethics at the Catholic University of Lubin. He was created Archbishop of Krakow in 1964 and a cardinal in 1967. John Paul’s election to the papacy in 1978 was quite unexpected. He was the first non-Italian pope in many hundreds of years. Although it has been suggested that he was seen as a compromise candidate, his papacy has been recognised as one of the most significant. His early actions set the tone of his period in office. He refused a papal coronation and was instead installed in a papal mass. In his first year as pontiff he travelled to more than 100 countries, a trend which he was to maintain for the rest of his life. He visited Australia for the Eucharistic Congress in 1973 and later as pontiff in 1986 and 1995.</para>
<para>He is, of course, remembered for his impact on Polish national sentiment during the early period of his office. Through his visits to his homeland he raised the Polish spirit and was an inspiration to many Poles during another traumatic period of Polish history. Throughout his papacy he would continue to travel widely and communicate the Catholic message, both to the faithful and in ecumenical terms, building links with other denominations and faiths. Many people around the world were captivated by his personal charisma and his efforts to reach out to the poor, the powerless and the oppressed.</para>
<para>He was outspoken in his criticism of both communism and capitalism while taking a somewhat conservative line in his repudiation of liberation theology. For the limits he placed upon political action by the church he was criticised by some, as he was for his views on certain moral concerns, the place of women in the church and other issues. At the same time he recognised the past failings of the church. In the year 2000 he made an apology and a plea for forgiveness for the wrongs done by the Catholic Church over its 2,000-year history.</para>
<para>It is a testament to the power of his work and his message that his papacy saw a huge growth in the Catholic Church internationally from 750 million believers to more than one billion today. The growth was in large part a result of his evangelism in the developing world as well as his more formal work within the church and in the wider world. John Paul II was a figure whom many felt they could come to know personally.</para>
<para>He came close to death following an assassination attempt in Saint Peter’s Square in 1981 by Mehmet Ali Agca, a member of the far right Turkish Grey Wolves. Following John Paul II’s death, there were many television tributes to the pontiff. There was a particularly touching scene of his visit to Agca in prison following the assassination attempt, where he offered him his forgiveness and an embrace. You can see on John Paul’s face the depth of emotion and pain that he is experiencing in his reconciliation with his would-be assassin. It was truly an inspiring display. In later years he kept in contact with the Agca family and met Mehmet Ali Agca’s mother in 1987.</para>
<para>Just as we came to know him through his travels and the response to the attempt on his life, so too did many people share the experiences of his ill health in old age. He fought Parkinson’s disease publicly and stoically. Even in his final days he continued, as far as possible, his public work. I think his ability to share that part of himself with the world endeared him to many both within and outside the church.</para>
<para>His passing was a time of great sadness to members of the Catholic faith and to many outside it. He will be remembered not only for his contribution to the church but for his deeply personal story so closely tied to the turmoil of the 20th century. He will be remembered for both and also, at a very human level, as a man. In closing, I would like to refer back to some footage that was shown following his death. In early days John Paul had been a passionate skier. In one documentary he was shown in his later years, dressed in white papal robes, walking across the snow covered slopes of the Italian alps, beneath clear, clean blue skies. He stops and looks around him at the snow and the sky. His joy in life is apparent, as he marvels at the purity and freshness of that amazing landscape. On behalf of the opposition, I offer our sincere condolences on his passing.</para>

<para>—I too would like to speak to the condolence motion moved by Senator Hill on behalf the government and spoken to by Senator Ludwig on behalf of the opposition. The Polish 263rd successor of Saint Peter died on 3 April this year aged 84, leaving his mark on the world as one of the most influential popes in the church’s 2,000-year history and opening up the church to people all over the world. He is the most travelled pontiff in history, visiting around 100 countries in his first year alone. He encountered more individuals than any other pope, as he spread the word of God.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Many things to many people, Karol Jozef Wojtyla commenced his spiritual journey from a humble quarry worker, poet and actor to a much-lauded pontiff. He was the first pope to travel to England, the first to preach in a Lutheran Church and the first to enter a mosque. Revered as an heroic visionary and attacked as a remnant of a bygone era, the Pope remained true to the opinions he held since his youth. His faith and deep spirituality was shaped by the loss early in his life of his mother and brother and later by that of his father and strengthened during the Nazi occupation, when he became aware of his call to the priesthood. He is credited as giving the Polish people hope and direction after decades of communist rule, inspiring the Solidarity movement which would eventually lead Poland to abandon communism and establish its own identity away from the Soviet Union. Ordained after the war in 1946, he pursued studies in philosophy and theology before being nominated Archbishop of Krakow in the early 1960s and a cardinal in 1967.</para>
<para>His pontificate started in 1978 when, after eight rounds of voting in a secret concave, the cardinals chose the first non-Italian pope since the 16th century. It is reported that during his reign the number of Catholics in the world has risen to about 1.1 billion. As a conservative pope, John Paul II held the line against trendy Catholicism and firmly stood his ground on issues such as women’s ordination, stem cell research and abortion. He became known as an opponent of communism, a champion of human rights and liberty, a powerful preacher and a sophisticated intellectual. He warned of the dangers of secularism, materialism and selfishness, urging people to be tolerant and to help the less fortunate. He was committed to bringing together the churches and faiths of the world, with his theme of forgiveness and harmony.</para>
<para>Such was his faith and character that following an attempt on his life by a Turk in 1981 the Pope famously visited him in prison, offering his forgiveness. In 1984 the Pope approved the first revision in Catholic canon law to make the church more accessible by increasing the power of the bishops, widening the role of laypeople and expanding the role of women in the church. Despite several health scares during the 1990s, his travel and writing continued, culminating in a publication in 1995 in which he spoke of the modern world as a ‘culture of death’, citing violence, poverty, murder, suicide, human suffering, abortion and euthanasia. In 1998, the Vatican made a step towards repairing the relationship between Jews and the Vatican by apologising for the church’s past positions regarding Jews and anti-Semitism.</para>
<para>In his later years, the Pope’s tremendous spiritual strength overcame the limitations of his ailing body, until last month when he returned to his maker. An inspirational leader, he has touched the lives and hearts of many millions of people. This was demonstrated by the many tributes to him from people from all walks of life, following his passing. He will be sadly missed.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I place on the record my support for this motion in recognition of the work and the life of Pope John Paul II. It is appropriate to acknowledge his contribution as not just a leader of his church but also, in the real sense of the word, a world leader. He was not just a head of state—albeit the state is a fairly unusual one, being very small—but a world figure in terms of the broader things he spoke about. In that sense, it is appropriate to consider and acknowledge his contribution, despite many members of the chamber not being of the Catholic faith. In the same way, for example, the Dalai Lama makes a significant impact as a world figure and many of us speak of the importance of that, even though, as far as I know, many of us are not practising Tibetan Buddhists.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Speaking personally, I do not think it is for me to comment at all on the debates within the Catholic Church about the rights and wrongs of the approach of the Pope on a whole range of issues. That should be very much an issue for those who see themselves as part of that church. I was brought up a Catholic and went to a Christian Brothers school, but I am not part of that faith anymore. I am an interested observer. Certainly, if people want to sign up to that faith, they can have those debates within that organisation, the same as you can have them within a political party or anything else. It is not for me to particularly comment on that.</para>
<para>In the sense that the Pope was a world leader—a role much wider than simply his role within his own church—he clearly had a very significant impact on the world, much more than most other people have had. It is hard to think of too many other people who have had such an impact on the globe over the last quarter of a century. It is easy to overstate things and say that he was the sole person responsible or the primary person responsible for the disintegration of the communist bloc and the Iron Curtain, but there is no doubt that he played a significant role. To have played a significant role in the collapse of a totalitarian regime as comprehensive and far-reaching as the communist regime was, is a contribution that is not too shabby at all. I think you would have to be pretty pleased with that.</para>
<para>It is important to acknowledge the Pope’s consistent voice, standing up against not only human rights abuses in what might be termed the left of the communist regime but all human rights abuses regardless of the political flavour of the nation. Unlike many people in the US who like to see themselves as religious crusaders for the right to life, for example, he was anti-abortion and anti-capital punishment—a system which has logical consistencies which do not seem to apply to many others in the religious right in the US. It is that consistency that I admired. Even when I strongly disagree with their views, I admire people who follow a consistent line of argument rather than just tilt it to suit the particular political or ideological needs of the moment.</para>
<para>The Pope spoke out consistently and strongly against the injustices of capitalism. I hope that all those coalition members who today are speaking about the wisdom and strength of Pope John Paul II look at the comments in the encyclical he made on the 90th anniversary of <inline font-style="italic">Rerum Novarum</inline> when he spoke about the rights and dignity of workers. When we are looking at industrial relations legislation over the next six to 12 months, we should look at some of the words he said there. He spoke strongly about some of the injustices of capitalism as well as communism. He spoke strongly against the evil of poverty and he spoke consistently and strongly against war—including of course the decision to go to war in Iraq. He worked to build bridges with other religions. All those actions must be strongly acknowledged.</para>
<para>I have spoken publicly on my personal views about areas where I think the Pope did not do so well. Some of those are issues more for the church to decide. I think the role of women within the church, for example, is pretty poor, but it is not my church so it is not my business. But I do think that there are broader issues, because of the role that he played as a world leader and an influential leader, where his failures should be acknowledged. In the same way as he was a straight-talking person, I think it is appropriate to note those failures here. I also believe it is important that there is action on those failures.</para>
<para>None of those failures was stronger than the failure to act on the widespread abuse of young people by Catholic priests and people holding Catholic ministry. That was a significant failure and it sent a very bad signal not only within the church. It is obviously an issue much wider than within the church, and that failure must be tackled because it sends an appalling signal across the wider community. I have spoken on this before—as have others—because I believe it is such an important issue. It is an issue nobody can afford to turn a blind eye to, however uncomfortable it can be to confront those types of issues. There is no doubt that there were significant failures in that regard, and there is still a challenge for the church. It is appropriate for people outside the church to point to that failure.</para>
<para>In the same way, I should note that the church specifically sees for itself a role of speaking beyond those who adhere to the Catholic faith. The area where I do have concerns for the broader social impact, wider than just those people who choose to be part of the Catholic faith, is the church’s statements and attitudes towards homosexual people. One of the documents—it was not a full encyclical—put out by the Pope during his reign was <inline font-style="italic">Considerations regarding proposals to give legal recognition to unions between homosexual persons</inline>. That document specifically said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the arguments that follow are addressed not only to those who believe in Christ, but to all persons committed to promoting and defending the common good of society.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">If they seek to engage with the wider society about those issues, that is fine, but they should be open to critique on the impact of those views. That document specifically directed Catholic politicians to vote against particular laws, which I think is going a bit far, frankly. It said that Catholic politicians are obliged to oppose specific legislation regarding homosexual unions.</para>
<para>The plea I make—a plea I have made before in this place—is that we acknowledge the damage that language coming from people in major leadership positions can have on human beings when their innate sense of their own humanity is spoken about in a way that fundamentally devalues it at its core. I know that people have different views about that—theological, philosophical, social and the like—but I am simply talking about the impact I know that sort of language has on some people. Given the Pope’s own words about how his views and statements go beyond those who are Catholics or even those who believe in Christ, I think that, in making such statements, there should be an acknowledgment of the impact those statements have on people.</para>
<para>Having said that—because I believe it needed to be said in a debate such as this—clearly, this was a man who had an enormous impact on the world. Anybody who is in a position where they have such an enormous impact—even if they are a saint, which for all I know he may well be deemed to be in some years time—will have failings and areas where they fall short, but that does not negate the significant impact that the Pope had or the appropriateness of acknowledging his contribution.</para>
<para>It was interesting to examine the way in which he carried on in the face of his very debilitating illness over the last period of his life, and it has been commented on. The Pope set an interesting example by going through that in the way that he did and staying in the position as he did. Being Pope is a bit different to being in other leadership positions, that is for sure; it has a certain unique character. There is too much talk here at the moment about how long people should stay in certain leadership positions, and that is not what I am talking about; I am simply talking about the example that he set. His display of that aspect of the ministry set an interesting example and one that is worth people reflecting on further when they look at some of the very difficult debates that we have about illness, old age, infirmity and disability and how we react to people in those circumstances. The simple reality is that despite their infirmities people can still be enormously effective. They can be effective in different ways, perhaps—obviously, he was not as good at certain things as he was in his younger days, but he could still be very effective at sending messages and playing a role. In some ways, that was because of the infirmities that he had and the illnesses that he was going through. That certainly provides a cause for reflection.</para>
<para>Overall, I wish to indicate support for the motion. As always with these motions, that should not be seen as blanket approval for every action, statement or inaction by the person concerned but rather as recognition of their significant contribution as well as an indication of what I believe are some legitimate issues that his successor should consider tackling. The document I quoted from earlier regarding homosexuality was issued through the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which was headed by the now Pope Benedict XVI. Obviously, he has been intimately involved in some of those issues which I think need a rethink. I would certainly urge those of you that are engaged in the church to get onto that Pope of yours and tell him what he should do next time you get a chance! More seriously, I urge people to contribute to that debate within the church. I know there are difficult issues, but they do have an impact in society more widely and they are issues that need to be given some stronger thought.</para>

<para>—I rise to support the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. In doing so, I want to focus briefly on some words that Pope John Paul II wrote in a couple of encyclicals. Before doing so, it is important to acknowledge that he was a man of great social justice. If one just observed him casually from the outside, as I have—I have no intimate knowledge of the man—it was obvious that he was meek, humble, very caring, very peace loving and very peacemaking. He was a man of determination, energy and endurance. That was encapsulated in the way he lived his life both publicly and privately, although we knew of the latter to a lesser extent.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>One of the things that probably stood out the most for me was the impact that he had on the situation in Poland with the rising of Solidarnosc, the Solidarity union. At the time of the emergence of Solidarity, my union in Australia, the SDA—the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association—was one of many international unions that were supporting Solidarity and its emergence within Poland in response to the regime that was governing Poland at that time. Pope John Paul II was a man who in his own mild-mannered way influenced world events far beyond even his anticipation and expectation of what could be achieved. Others have referred to that here today. I suppose I gained some appreciation of the man and the influence that he had over people through my association with that movement at that time. It is interesting that the word they chose to use for that union—‘solidarity’—just so happened to be used in some of his encyclicals, and quite pointedly at that.</para>
<para>As a member of parliament I was proud to be part of a delegation presented to him at a public audience on a bilateral visit to Italy in 1999. One could see the effects, even at that time, of the very rigorous program that he obviously set himself. But, nonetheless, he was always giving of his time and only too pleased to meet with the young, the old, the infirm, those who were poor, those who were advantaged and those who were disadvantaged. He was a man of the people.</para>
<para>I think the real nature of the person could be summed up if one looked at his funeral. He lay outside on the stairs of the basilica in a coffin that was not ornate—it was very simple in nature—and I think it reflected the simplicity of the man himself. The service itself was simple. Of course, even though it was a simple service with a simple coffin, the person who was being acknowledged during the funeral was a man of great stature and a man who was certainly admired by many throughout the world, including those who had congregated to say their farewell to him.</para>
<para>He left a legacy to us all, in my view. Some of that legacy will be ignored by some, some will be unnoticed and some will be cherished, depending on one’s view of the man and the way in which he pursued his papacy. He no doubt had a caring, selfless nature and that, in my view, was reflected in the encyclicals that he put out during his 25-plus years as Pope. Some of those encyclicals of course were controversial and some were very thought-provoking, but I have no doubt that the man himself had great intellectual rigour in his approach to the proclamations that he brought forward.</para>
<para>I do not want his passing to go by in the Parliament of Australia without recording some of the views he had on issues that are close to my heart and the hearts of a number of the Australian public. I will refer to two of his encyclicals. The first is <inline font-style="italic">Laborem Exercens</inline>, which is on human work and was promulgated on 14 September 1981. He reflected on the 90th anniversary of that great encyclical of Leo XIII’s <inline font-style="italic">Rerum Novarum</inline>. The second I am going to look briefly at is <inline font-style="italic">Sollicitudo Rei Socialis</inline> on social concerns that was promulgated on 30 December 1987. Whilst that was promulgated some substantial time ago, his words in one sense are as true today as ever and I think reflect the forward-looking nature of the man. In ‘Laborem exercens’ he referred to the priority of labour and said at page 49:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In view of this situation we must first of all recall a principle that has always been taught by the Church: the principle of the priority of labour over capital. This principle directly concerns the process of production: in this process labour is always a primary efficient cause, while capital, the whole collection of means of production, remains a mere instrument or instrumental cause.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Those words of course ring as true today as when they were promulgated back in 1981. He went further in ‘Laborem exercens’ at page 81 to refer to the importance of unions, again a much maligned group of people by some people in our society today. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">All these rights, together with the need for the workers themselves to secure them, give rise to yet another right: the right of association, that is to form associations for the purpose of defending the vital interests of those employed in the various professions.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Interestingly enough in the same encyclical he then gave a mini historical version of the evolution of the trade union movement. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In a sense, unions go back to the mediaeval guilds of artisans, insofar as those organizations brought together people belonging to the same craft and thus on the basis of their work. However, unions differ from the guilds on this essential point: the modern unions grew up from the struggle of the workers—workers in general but especially the industrial workers—to protect their ... rights vis-a-vis the entrepreneurs and the owners of the means of production.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Prophetic words indeed. He said in the same section:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The experience of history teaches that organizations of this type are an indispensable element of social life, especially in modern industrialized societies.</para>
<para class="block">                         …                   …                   …</para>
<para class="block">They are indeed a mouthpiece for the struggle for social justice, for the just rights of working people in accordance with their individual professions.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He did not particularise the professions or the nature of the work undertaken there, but he gave a very detailed analysis of human work, the problems associated with human work and even referred in some parts to the issue of peace itself.</para>
<para>In the encyclical on social concerns one sees some of his ability to provoke thought and provoke discussion. On page 32 of that encyclical he talked about other forms of poverty and he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We should add here that in today’s world there are many other forms of poverty. For are there not certain privations or deprivations which deserve this name? The denial or the limitation of human rights—as for example the right to religious freedom, the right to share in the building of society, the freedom to organize and to form unions, or to take initiatives in economic matters—do these not impoverish the human person as much as, if not more than, the deprivation of material goods? And is development which does not take into account the full affirmation of these rights really development on the human level?</para>
<para class="block">In brief, modern underdevelopment is not only economic but also cultural, political and simply human ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In the encyclical he challenges our society. He does not challenge just those who claim to be of the Catholic persuasion; he is challenging society. Later in the encyclical, at page 85, he comes to the issue of solidarity—not that it has not been mentioned previously in the encyclical, but I particularly want to mention this reference, where he says:</para>
<quote>
<para>
<inline font-style="italic">Solidarity</inline> helps us to see the “other”—whether a <inline font-style="italic">person</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">people</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">nation</inline>—not just as some kind of instrument, with a work capacity and physical strength to be exploited at low cost and then discarded when no longer useful, but as our “neighbour”, a “helper” ... to be made a sharer, on a par with ourselves, in the banquet of life to which all are equally invited by God.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I think that is very telling of the nature of the person and the way in which he perceived the world. Last, but not least, I refer to page 93. If anyone reads my first speech—and they are not generally read over and over—they will find that I made reference to a preferential option for the poor, and that is the basis on which my life has been founded fairly much. It was probably through this encyclical that he tied that issue up for me and put it all into perspective. He talks about his teachings in recent years, and goes on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para>Here I would like to indicate one of them: the <inline font-style="italic">option</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">love of preference</inline> for the poor. This is an option, or a <inline font-style="italic">special form</inline> of primacy in the exercise of Christian charity, to which the whole tradition of the Church bears witness.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is something we should all bear in mind in our daily lives. There is no doubt that Pope John Paul had a profound effect on our society. You did not have to be a Catholic or a Christian to embrace the thrust of his philosophy or even to listen to the points of view that he was expressing, not only through the many encyclicals that he released but also through the various media outlets that published his works.</para>
<para>He challenged the community and—whilst not everyone might have agreed with the words he challenged us with—he did so in a humble way. As I said, he did it with determination, he did it with sincerity and he did it with a love of his fellow human beings. I trust that his great concern for the poor, the weak, the oppressed, the lonely and the sick will not be lost in the turmoil of our society today and that an opportunity such as speaking in this condolence motion will place on record the work, energy, effort and love that he has shown for his fellow human beings.</para>

<para>—On a late July afternoon in 1982, I stood on the platform of the central railway station in Cracow. To this day, I remember being struck by the thought that four years earlier, in June 1978, the Cardinal Archbishop of that city, Karol Wojtyla, had embarked from that very place to attend, for the second time in only a few weeks, the conclave of cardinals—little expecting, no doubt, that he would not return. His departure was, I dare say, little noticed. It was certainly unremarked by the world’s media. Yet it was the beginning of a journey which would change the world forever.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Over the 26 years that followed, Karol Wojtyla became, as Pope John Paul II, one of the undeniably greatest figures of the 20th century. In a century in which most of the titanic figures had been monsters—Lenin, Hitler, Stalin, Mao Tse Tung—we can take some comfort from the fact that the last of the titanic figures of the century was a man of overpowering goodness and simple virtue.</para>
<para>Pope John Paul II was, obviously, a great religious leader: the third-longest serving head of the church whose adherents comprise most of Christianity. He was also an important political leader. Yet when the news of the Pope’s death broke in Australia on the morning of Sunday, 3 April, the common theme of so many of the tributes which flowed was that John Paul had been a great moral leader. His life and work so transcended even his role as the leader of the world’s 1.1 billion Catholics that people of all faiths—and of no faith—felt a sense of loss. His passing was lamented with sincere regret by political leaders of every sort. It united leaders of the democratic world with political figures as diverse as Fidel Castro, Hu Jintao and Vladimir Putin.</para>
<para>Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union—that inhuman political system which John Paul did so much to bring to ruins—called him ‘the No. 1 humanist on the planet’. Many of the tributes evoked the bond of family. Thus, to Lech Walesa, Poland had ‘lost its mother’, while President Ciampi of Italy said that Italians were ‘mourning the loss of a father’. By the time he died, one can fairly claim that John Paul II had become the most respected figure on the planet, with a moral authority which transcended that of any other global leader—political, religious or otherwise.</para>
<para>On 7 April, the Archbishop of Brisbane, John Bathersby, led a concelebrated memorial mass at St Stephen’s Cathedral. In his homily, Archbishop Bathersby described Pope John Paul in these words:</para>
<para>‘He had a deep relationship with God where life and religion mingled easily ... There was his total detachment from the material things of life, and his deep love of the poor. There was a discipline of life that he expected equally of others. But above all there was his genuine love of people, especially young people, his sheer enjoyment of life, and his mischievous sense of humour, not always as apparent in later years, as he grappled with the ... demands of world and Church, and the slow, debilitating pain of sickness.</para>
<para>... he was driven utterly by his love of God and life, from which he learned to love people in all their incredible variety. ... He had a ... remarkable intellect ... linguistic brilliance ... mystic faith and ... remarkable capacity to endure discomfort and suffering. ... With an unshakeable faith and trust in God, inherited from his own parents, his Church, his culture, his study and his experience of life, he reached out to all people. ...</para>
<para>His mission drove the Pope beyond the previous narrow boundaries of Roman Catholicism to embrace all Christians, all religions, and all peoples, an action not always greeted with enthusiasm by certain sections of the Catholic Church. His Christian ecumenism, sprung from a love of God, was based upon the supreme importance and dignity of each and every person, underpinned by an exalted vision of the importance of human life in Jesus Christ. ... More than others he spoke with authority, not the authority of Christ which is utterly unique, but with an authority built upon years of prayer, study and experience, and forged in a furnace of suffering.</para>
<para>              …         …         …</para>
<para>... he preached the dignity and freedom of the human person with such strength and vitality that his voice was eventually ... heard by every citizen and leader on this planet. The message is strong, simple, and powerful. Respect the human person because the human person is made in the image of God. Preach the gospel so that this may become a reality for all.’</para>
<para>Theologians tell us that John Paul II made a profound doctrinal impact upon the Catholic Church. I am in no position to comment on that. But I do want to spend a few moments to reflect on the Pope as an historical figure—for there is simply no doubt that, but for the moral and political influence of this one man, the events which resulted in the liberation of eastern Europe and the collapse of the Soviet leviathan would not have occurred as they did. No doubt it would have happened one day, but it happened when it did and how it did because of the extraordinary conjunction of events which placed the moral leader of the Polish people in a position of unique authority at one of history’s authentic turning points, and so gave an emphatic answer to Stalin’s famous jibe, ‘How many divisions has the Pope?’</para>
<para>I remember travelling in Poland in that northern summer of 1982, about six months after martial law had been declared by the military dictator, General Jaruzelski. There were military helicopters in the skies and armed militias on the street corners. There was much talk of an imminent Soviet military occupation—not, like Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968, to dislodge a liberalising regime, but to prop up a decaying one. I remember, in particular, a conversation I had with some Polish students in Warsaw. I asked one of them what they had done when martial law had been declared. He replied, ‘We all went to the cathedral,’ and he described a scene of thousands upon thousands of Poles converging upon the cathedrals and churches of their cities and towns, apprehensive and afraid, and instinctively recognising the church as their place of refuge, of comfort, of solidarity and of strength.</para>
<para>The events which began in Poland in 1981 framed a world-changing confrontation between the military power of the state and the moral power of the church, between ideology and religious faith, between what another great Pole, Czeslaw Milosz, called the captive mind and the free conscience, between the transient and the everlasting, between the secular and the spiritual.</para>
<para>There is no doubt about the centrality of Pope John Paul II in the resolution of that apocalyptic conflict. This single man, whose childhood was forged in the furnace of one of the most evil regimes of the 20th century—Nazism—who grew to manhood in southern Poland literally a few miles from Auschwitz, whose middle years were spent in confrontation with the other of the most evil tyrannies of the twentieth century—communism—came at the culmination of his life and work to be the principal agent by which that tyranny was brought crashing down. Religious people will see God’s hand in Karol Wojtyla’s life and work. Others, taking a more secular view, will see him as a great nationalist and a great liberator. He was, in my view, a man whose role and place in history was of such a mighty scale that he transcends easy classification. As Archbishop Bathersby said in his homily:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Neither conservative nor liberal, Pope John Paul II defies simple definition or shallow analysis.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">On any view, he was a very great man—perhaps the greatest we will see in our lifetimes.</para>

<para>—I would like to join in speaking to the condolence motion this evening on Pope John Paul II. I normally go to mass at 7.30 on Sunday mornings at St Finbar’s in Glenbrook in the lower Blue Mountains. Normally, the church is probably about half full because of the hour and, I suppose, it reflects the population in that area. As we know, around 6 o’clock the ABC news bulletin was broadcasting the fact that Pope John Paul II had finally passed away. When I went to my usual mass at 7.30 the church was packed out. In the space of that 1½ hours from the announcement of His Holiness’s death, people—who no doubt were born and raised Catholics, probably not practising—went to mass that day, probably for the first time in some time to join in the widespread grief and sadness that was enveloping the world at his passing.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Indeed, it is probably for historians to come up with some analysis of why in the week or so after his death there was that widespread grief and sadness at his passing. In fact, one of the last communist dictatorships in the world, headed by Fidel Castro, announced that there would be three days of mourning in Cuba. As a number of the previous speakers have said, a number of world leaders commented on the passing of this colossal man. As I said, it will be for historians and others to come up with the final analysis of the impact that this man had on our world in our lifetime.</para>
<para>Plenty has already been written about His Holiness and about his contribution to the 20th century, to Catholicism and Christianity. If you look up ‘John Paul II’ on Google, as I did today, there are 73,800,000 references to him. I did not seek to look up anybody else or any other pope, but I thought he had made a tremendous contribution to have himself so regularly mentioned. Not all mentions were favourable, I might add, but many of them were. When we look back on the contribution this man made to the church and to the 20th century, as Senator Brandis has said, there are significant aspects of his life that stand out.</para>
<para>He lived through the seeing off of two forms of totalitarianism—one on the right, when he was a young man and lived through it in Poland, and one on the left, where he was a significant key in its downfall in his support of the independent trade union movement in Poland known as ‘Solidarity’. A number of trade union leaders were imprisoned and they were able to have priests visit them. The priests used to secretly smuggle messages of support and encouragement to those independent trade union leaders, while they were being persecuted by the communist regime. In fact, when Pope John Paul II visited his home country after he was made Pope in 1978, he addressed a crowd of over one million people. He exalted them and reminded his fellow Poles:</para>
<para>
<inline font-size="9.5pt">You are men. You have dignity. Don’t crawl on your bellies</inline>.</para>
<para class="block">And that is what he stood for most of his life. An American cardinal said of the Pope that his great hope was to awaken the entire world to the dignity and the responsibility of defending human rights, and that is what John Paul II sought to do throughout his whole life. It never worried him to go and pursue dictatorships, whether of the left or the right. He was very active in criticising the dictatorships of Stroessner in Paraguay, Pinochet in Chile and Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines. But, as I said, his greatest support was for solidarity, which has been mentioned in the last few contributions.</para>
<para>He was not afraid at all either of commenting on what he saw as the other great evil in our time—that is, materialism. On his first visit to the United States he warned the Americans of the dangers of materialism, selfishness and secularism, and that warning was not welcomed by the Americans at that stage and probably still would not be. But he told them that that was what he stood for and that was what he saw as a danger.</para>
<para>He was the one Pope who said that it is up to priests to look after the spiritual side of their flock, not necessarily to get involved in spreading guns and revolution throughout Latin America. He said that the so-called liberation theology had to end. He supported the Palestinians in their quest for a homeland. But his greatest fear, as I said earlier, was the denigration of the dignity of human rights.</para>
<para>Senator Hogg has mentioned a number of encyclicals that John Paul II promoted in the areas of unions, the workplace, poverty and social justice. I add briefly some of the things that Pope John Paul II said in those encyclicals. In the first one that Senator Hogg mentioned, <inline font-style="italic">Laborem Exercens</inline>, Pope John Paul II said that governments must legislate to block shameful forms of exploitation, especially to the disadvantage of the most vulnerable workers. He railed against considering work as a form of merchandise, according to economic theory, to which the price of labour could be applied. He also said, ‘As work is the expression of human potential, then solidarity’—once again, that word—‘is the expression of how humans collectively realise that potential.’</para>
<para>He believed that we should confirm our conviction of the priority of human labour over what we have grown accustomed to calling capital and noted that all capital was the product of human work at one stage or another. In every case he said that ‘a just wage is the concrete means of verifying the justice of the whole socioeconomic system—it is the key means’ and ‘unions are an indispensable element of social life’. They are not part of ‘a struggle against others’.</para>
<para>In another encyclical, <inline font-style="italic">Solicitudo Rei Socialis</inline>, he talked of the denial of human freedom and potential as a form of poverty and commented on the need once again to form free trade unions. He said the state must ensure suitable employment for all who are capable of working and act against unemployment. In his 1991 encyclical, <inline font-style="italic">Centesimus Annus</inline>, he commented on how society and the state must ensure wage levels are adequate for the maintenance of the worker and his family, including a certain amount of savings.</para>
<para>He was a man who was consumed by the view of social justice and that it must be progressed. He commented on the need for Christians to take decisive and honest stands on the issues of social justice, especially in response to the intrusion of the market into public life. Once again he talked about the principle of solidarity by defending the weakest by placing certain limits on the autonomy of the parties that determine working conditions.</para>
<para>It is with great sadness that I comment on the passing of such a great historical figure. Already there are moves within the Catholic Church to canonise Pope John Paul II. He canonised a number of people. In fact, I think he canonised more people in his period as Pope than all the popes put together. He saw the need for us to have heroes. I hope that, with his passing and with his life to be reflected on in time, we will have again, as we knew when we buried him, a great hero and a hero for our people in the future.</para>

<para>—Pope John Paul II died having run his race fair to the line. He was a good example to all who cared to look at the dignity and worth of man to his last breath. It was said that his last word was ‘amen’—probably the most powerful word in the Christian lexicon. It is a single word, yet full of prayer and meaning. By this he used his last second on earth to reaffirm his faith and acknowledge the end of his mission.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>John Paul was destined to be Pope. He was marked even beyond his own comprehension. The story was even told that the previous Pope, John Paul I, whose time as pontiff lasted some 30 days, told his closest advisers that they had chosen the wrong man—‘They should have chosen the man across from me.’ The conclave seating confirmed that that was Cardinal Wojtyla from Poland. His life’s experiences prepared him comprehensively for the physical and spiritual rigours and judgments needed to follow in the footsteps of the Fisherman. Like any of us, he could never have anticipated or comprehended why certain extreme events in his life were pitched at him as he grew up in Poland but, as we can all see now, his life in Poland was to shape his life as the pontiff and it gave him the talents to carry out his mission.</para>
<para>Born in 1920, he lost his mother at an early age and brother and father later. By the age of 21 he was alone in the world. It was a hole in his heart forever. He was a very physical and athletic man. He loved the theatre and acting, and that is how he lived his life, virtually until he joined to train for the priesthood in 1942. From his priestly training days to his cardinalship, he was a noteworthy and relied upon intellect of the church. As is well known, incredibly he lived under the two most brutal, merciless and atheistic regimes in the 20th century, if not history. Firstly, in 1940 there was Poland’s occupation by the Nazis and, secondly, Poland’s occupation by the communists. This was the character chosen to be the church’s 264th Pope, and this is what made up the character of the 264th Pope.</para>
<para>It was this character who visited over 130 separate countries at breakneck pace. He visited some of those countries two or three times—Poland nine times and Australia twice. This was the man who took three bullets at point-blank range from a trained assassin, yet lived, but what is less known is that the wounds plagued him all his life with constant pain. It is also interesting to note that the assassin, who is now repentant, of course, was bewildered at how he could possibly have missed what he had in his sights. This was the man who, as a pope, bridged relationships with his brothers, being the first pope to visit a mosque and a synagogue. This was the pope who had audiences of sometimes two million people—one million regularly, and that was a small crowd—and held their respect to his death, where many millions attended and watched his funeral. As a young actor fielding the small audiences in Poland, how could he have known that the world stage awaited him? He played it well, like a pro.</para>
<para>This is the man history acknowledges as the key turner to bringing down communism without firing a shot. Well may the communists’ worst, Stalin, once mockingly have asked, ‘How many legions has the Pope?’ The story is told that when it first started to look like an uprising was occurring in Poland, the United States government, the then Reagan government, dispatched a somewhat secretive delegation to the Vatican—I think Alexander Haig was party to that delegation—to meet Vatican officials and the Pope. They wanted to know how they could help Poland, via the Vatican. The rather stony reply that met them was: ‘Nothing. Leave it to us. We’ve been doing this for thousands of years.’ It has never been doubted by any historian that the Vatican brought down what no-one believed could collapse, let alone saw coming. Each country within the new map of Europe owes its freedom to what happened in Poland in the early eighties.</para>
<para>This is the man who, as Pope, wrote encyclical after encyclical and publication after publication reaffirming the teachings and direction of his church, cementing the faith for generations to come. Yet through his reign anyone and everyone who knew him deemed him humble. John Paul II was a man for the times. In a church that looks at time in centuries, not years or even decades, his time will be known as great.</para>

<para>—In supporting this condolence motion I thank the previous speakers for their contributions today to honour this very holy man. We have heard reflections this afternoon on a very different perspective of the Pope from that which has been expressed in other venues and at other opportunities. I think a very important record has been established here this afternoon.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In honouring the life of the Holy Father, Pope John Paul II, can I say that his papacy was marked by his steadfast faith in the human spirit and its ultimate capacity to do good. Our most recent images of him as a frail and suffering man at the end of his life reminded us of his belief in the value of every life, especially the elderly and the infirm. He carried on, enduring his afflictions, as Senator McGauran said, not asking for relief because he believed that:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is suffering, more than anything else, which clears the way for the grace which transforms human souls.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He also said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In suffering, a man discovers himself—his own humanity, his own dignity, his own mission.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Certainly John Paul II did that.</para>
<para>His concern with the dignity of man was behind his unswerving advocacy of social justice—and we have heard about that this afternoon—and his support for oppressed people everywhere. His strength of character was evident throughout his life. As many speakers have said this afternoon, he faced the Nazi occupation in Poland and later challenged the communist regime. In June 1979, less than a year after his election as Pope, he travelled to Poland, as Senator Hutchins reflected, telling his countrymen and countrywomen not to be afraid, triggering a wave of resistance to communism and having a decisive and material impact on the end of the Cold War. His promotion of democratic hopes extended well beyond eastern Europe. We have heard how he influenced the democratic transitions in the Philippines, Chile, Argentina and Central America.</para>
<para>As the spiritual leader of 1.1 billion followers, Pope John Paul II spoke out forcefully on issues of war and peace, claiming that ‘in our time every war is unjust’. In January 2003 he gave an address to the Vatican, stating:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I say: No to war! War is not always inevitable. It is always a defeat for humanity.</para>
<para class="block">                         …           …             …</para>
<para class="block">faced with the constant degeneration of the crisis in the Middle East, I say to you that the solution will never be imposed by recourse to terrorism or armed conflict, as if military victories could be the solution.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Such was his unstinting condemnation of war that no nation could automatically rely on his approval, whatever their political or religious allegiances. As a man of peace, he established diplomatic relations with Israel but he also supported the aspirations of the Palestinian people to statehood.</para>
<para>Through his experience of Catholicism, as well as his intellectual grasp of world history, he understood what it meant to be a victim of prejudice and discrimination. One of the important things Pope John Paul II will be remembered for is his commitment to Catholic-Jewish reconciliation. We heard several senators speak about that this afternoon. He was, as Senator McGauran reminded us, the first pope since apostolic times to visit a synagogue and the first ever to visit a mosque. His apology for evils done in the name of the church broke new ground as he begged forgiveness for Catholic anti-Semitism down the ages.</para>
<para>In his 2001 apostolic letter, entitled <inline font-style="italic">At the Beginning of the New Millennium</inline>, Pope John Paul II described a world entering a new era burdened by contradictions, where the affluent few enjoyed immense possibilities while millions of others lived on the margins of progress. His conviction that we pursued our attachment to material things to the detriment of our spiritual nourishment caused discomfort, debate and even, at times, outright ridicule. But Pope John Paul II was completely unafraid of controversy and truly had the courage of his convictions, never wavering or flinching in his struggle for what he believed was good and right.</para>
<para>We have heard today of the Holy Father’s compassion, his intellect and his absolute commitment to human dignity and all humanity. But I would like to speak this afternoon about his commitment to the environment and his call for an ecological conversion. Pope John Paul II was highly educated. He had two doctorates and he was a university professor. So it is not surprising that he loved ideas and intellectual argument. He was particularly interested in philosophy, including the philosophy of science. Because of his unflinching integrity, his public image sometimes suggested a conservative, even closed, mind but his thinking was much more complex and layered than that image would ever suggest.</para>
<para>Many people would be surprised to know that he agreed with most modern scientific thinking on the big bang and the expansion of the universe, the age of the earth and Darwinian evolution. And he was convinced of the interrelationship of all living things. In 1990, he observed:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... we cannot interfere in one area of the ecosystem without paying due attention both to the consequences of such interference in other areas and to the well-being of future generations.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">A decade later, he was still preoccupied with that theme. He wrote:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... if one casts a gaze over the regions of our planet, one notices immediately that humanity has not fulfilled the divine expectation ... Especially in our times, man has devastated without hesitation plains and wooded valleys, polluted the waters, deformed the earth’s habitats, made the air unbreathable, disturbed the hydro-geological and atmospheric systems [and] turned green spaces into deserts ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He went on to argue that the people of the world need to undergo an ‘ecological conversion’ to protect the environment and to make the earth a place where all life is valued and can grow in harmony.</para>
<para>Of course, he understood the undeniable benefits that recent discoveries have brought to humanity. What made him remarkable was the way his thinking moved beyond that realisation to the idea that such discoveries actually demonstrate the nobility of the human vocation to participate responsibly in God’s creative action in the world. It was in the light of this idea that he argued:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... ecological awareness ... ought to be encouraged to develop into concrete programs and initiatives.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">One of Pope John Paul II’s convictions was that the domination which, according to Genesis, human beings were given over creation is one not of exploitation but of service and ministry—a responsibility to continue, as he said, ‘the work of the Creator, a work of life and of peace’. His ideas had a contagious effect on those who read his scholarly and provocative works. He was a prolific writer, an extraordinary thinker, and he stimulated intellectual debate both within and beyond the Catholic hierarchy. He worked to bring the world closer to God’s ‘vision of beauty and harmony’, and his life as a man of extraordinary faith, intellect, kindness and courage remains an inspiration to us all. May he rest in peace.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate record its deep regret at the death, on 23 April 2005, of the Honourable Albert (Al) Jaime Grassby, AM, former federal minister and member for Riverina, and places on record its appreciation of his long public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">Al Grassby was born on 12 July 1926 in Brisbane, Queensland, leaving Australia in the 1930s and travelling with his parents while his father took construction work in the Sudan, Italy, France, Spain and England. Mr Grassby went on to serve with the British Army in the Infantry and the Intelligence Corps from 1945 to 1946. Returning to Australia in 1948, he was employed first by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture and then the CSIRO as an information officer and editor of publications, having trained in journalism. Mr Grassby eventually moved to Griffith, where he met and married Ellnor Louez in February 1962.</para>
<para>A member of the Australian Labor Party since 1951, Mr Grassby was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Murrumbidgee in 1965, holding the seat until his resignation in 1969. He was then elected to the House of Representatives as the member for Riverina in 1969 and again in 1972, eventually losing his seat in the 1974 general elections.</para>
<para>In his first speech to the House, Mr Grassby conveyed his love of the land and rural Australia, although it was his appreciation of the richness and diversity of cultures which helped him make his mark with his commitment to multiculturalism during and after his time in federal parliament. Al Grassby was appointed as the Minister for Immigration in December 1972. He was a key player in implementing the then government’s multicultural policies, introducing reforms in the areas of immigration, citizenship and human rights. Among his more significant reforms were improvements to migrant welfare services.</para>
<para>During his time as minister he represented Australia on a number of official visits overseas, including visits to South-East Asia, Japan, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Italy. After leaving parliament Mr Grassby was appointed as Commissioner for Community Relations, a position he held until 1982. In this role he worked to educate the community against racism and discrimination and was a strong supporter of ethnic radio and television. In the 1985 Australia Day honours list, Mr Grassby was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia for services to community relations. He will be well remembered as a man with great passion for Australia and for the diversity of its people. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife Ellnor, to his daughter Gabriella and to other family members and friends our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.</para>

</talker>
<para>—This is the ninth speech on the continuing issue of child abuse that I have made in this place since I entered the Senate in November 2002. Child abuse in all of its forms is a pervasive and sickening presence in our national life. Its reduction must be a constant focus of governments at all levels in this country. To achieve this, we need to ensure a sharp focus is kept on it. In some measure, part of the problem lies in the fact that we have yet to achieve an effective division of responsibilities in our federal system—and that is another topic I keep talking about—that ensures that effort expended results in desired outcomes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Of course, in the area of child abuse, we are often dealing with subjective points of view as well as subjects. We are talking about the children concerned, who may not for all sorts of reasons, among them very young age, be the most reliable of witnesses to their own abuse. We must also deal with the increased incidence of reporting of abuse, which, unless analysed carefully and understood completely, can lead to claims that the epidemic—and it is an epidemic—is getting sharply worse. Even a single instance of child abuse, sexual or otherwise, is appalling. That must surely be the starting point of every attack on the problem.</para>
<para>Some figures that came to hand earlier this year show that nationally the number of suspected cases of child abuse, neglect or harm referred to authorities had more than doubled in the previous five years. In spite of the many advances made in recent times in relation to better managing the prevention of child abuse in Queensland—and it is important to recognise those advances and applaud them, even though they are horribly belated—it is plain that many problems remain. Only very recently it was revealed that child safety resources in the Ipswich and Toowoomba regions were not keeping pace with notifications. This was revealed in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> newspaper. That article, which was published on 26 April, also reported that the Queensland Minister for Child Safety had asked his department for an urgent review of resources in Toowoomba. Yet again we see the Queensland government, flusher than ever with discretionary spending dollars from the state’s GST allocations, failing at the administrative level.</para>
<para>We need to recognise that case loads are increasing in terms of the number of notifications. To some extent, this increased workload will represent cases that would not perhaps have been notified in earlier times. But the fundamentally important point is to get on top of the case load. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline>, the number of abuse notifications awaiting investigation in Toowoomba has doubled in four months. It is reported that, as of mid-April, the Toowoomba child safety centre had 432 unallocated initial assessments awaiting action. Last November the reported figure was 220. In Ipswich, the five-person child safety office team is reported to have 100 new notifications a month. In April there were 376 cases backed up, with 137 not even allocated to an officer. Apparently, five of these unallocated cases were priority 1 cases. Priority 1 covers cases where the child or children are considered to be at extremely high risk of sexual or violent abuse, torture or suicide. Nineteen were so-called ‘high 2’ cases—those needing urgent attention. Under the rules, priority 1 cases must be dealt with within 24 hours. The Queensland government admits that, in one recent week in Toowoomba, two such cases were not dealt with in that time frame.</para>
<para>This is the very nub of the problem: the inability of the child safety infrastructure to deliver because of lack of resources to actually do the jobs required. This is something the Queensland government must look at very seriously and very urgently. What the Queensland government must do—and it must do; no more excuses—is make a substantial allocation for more staff in child safety in the 2005-06 state budget, which will be brought down on 7 June. As I said at the beginning of this address, it certainly has a lot of GST money to apply to that task. The Beattie Labor government must make a definitive commitment to sufficient funding and recruiting to achieve the staffing levels at the sharp end in child safety that are clearly required.</para>
<para>The Beattie government simply must deliver in this area. The minister says that staffing levels are being addressed and that by 2007 the number of child safety officers in Toowoomba will have doubled. He says that, by that year, staff in the Ipswich office will have increased by 65 per cent. I have a message for that minister: ‘You’ll have to work a lot faster than that.’ In relation to Ipswich, he is obviously talking about full-time equivalent staff, since increasing a staff of five by 65 per cent will give them 3¼ new people.</para>
<para>There have been many announcements from the state government of strategies and plans to deal with Queensland’s child abuse and child safety problems. We certainly need to recognise that extra resources have been allocated in the past to combat child abuse and secure child safety in Queensland. And it is not only the Queensland system that is failing to work adequately; it is a national issue. At the same time, it is on Queensland that a large measure of the focus should lie, since the Beattie Labor government’s management and budgetary allocation record was plainly inadequate for far too long. It knew there were horrendous problems as far back as 1999, when the Forde commission reported. But it effectively swept it all under the carpet until 2003, when it was forced by further evidence of burgeoning child abuse notifications to do something more than just talk about things.</para>
<para>We remember with profound distaste that following further inquiries by the Crime and Misconduct Commission in 2003—it reported in January 2004—Premier Beattie made the empty claim that the February 2004 state election campaign he then immediately called was ‘for the kids’. Nearly 18 months later, many of those kids are still waiting. That is simply not good enough. Part of the problem seems to be that the projected expansion of calls on the system on which the Crime and Misconduct Commission based its recommendations has substantially outstripped the 15 per cent growth rate on which future staffing requirements were based. In fact, there was a 39 per cent increase in notifications and a 43 per cent increase in the number of children coming into contact with the Department of Child Safety between December 2003 and December 2004. Yet again, we see the triumph of illusion over substance that is the hallmark of the Beattie state government in Queensland.</para>
<para>We hear the rhetoric. We see the sound and light show. The Premier performs his Houdini tricks for the crowd. And, once he has everyone’s attention focused on the frippery, he steals away and no-one derives any benefit, or precious little. It is the same situation in relation to child labour laws as they relate to children under 13, which the state Liberals have been pressing the Beattie Labor government to enact since 1999, when it repealed the existing provisions. Last November the state Liberals introduced private legislation into the Queensland parliament to protect children from workplace and sexual exploitation. It is only now, as state Liberal health spokesman Bruce Flegg pointed out last week, that the state government is finally moving to produce a child labour law for Queensland, after leaving loopholes open for six years that allowed children to work in adult entertainment and risk suffering workplace exploitation. The scope and extent of Labor’s proposed laws are unclear at present. But it is certainly the case that they should not be used to unreasonably interfere with the working hours of older teenagers in part-time employment. The goal is protection of children from potential harm, not to proscribe individual initiative or to disadvantage employers.</para>
<para>Doing the right thing is important in relation to child safety nationally and doing the right thing by adult victims of abuse as children is also vital. We need to send a strong message that child abuse in any of its terrible forms will not be tolerated in our society. That is the message of White Balloon Day, which is held each year to focus community attention on an ongoing problem of the most concerning dimensions. This year it was held in April. It is a valuable occasion, and it is pleasing that it sprang from the initiative of a group of Queenslanders in 1999 and has gone from strength to strength ever since.</para>

<para>—Tonight I rise to comment in response to Senator McGauran’s St Patrick’s Day speech earlier this year, which I believe was intemperate, ill-judged and ill-timed coming on St Patrick’s Day—a day of celebration when Irish people should be reaching out to each other. In his speech Senator McGauran fell into the hate trap—the hate trap that has created the vicious circle that has at times torn the Irish people apart, bringing with it great misery and suffering for Irish people and their families and communities. By making this speech, Senator McGauran became part of the problem, not the solution.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>His outrageous and unfounded accusations which included the head in the sand approach that supported Australia officially turning its back on Mr Adams and, worse, associating him by clear implication with involvement ‘in the $63 million robbery at an Australian-owned bank and the brutal murder of Catholic man Robert McCartney outside a Belfast pub’. And later he implicated Mr Adams by association with people who run arms and train terrorists and are involved in drug cartels. Senator McGauran also claims:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The truth is that he—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Adams—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">and his IRA association have held up peace for at least the last three decades.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">These scurrilous allegations were put forward without the slightest bit of evidence. Senator McGauran, as a person who admits to being of pure Irish origin, should know better. Where has Senator McGauran been this last decade? This sort of sectarian approach, distortion, propagandising and mindless slander is the problem. It is the nub of the problem—the mindless hate cycle.</para>
<para>How does Senator McGauran’s dismissal of Gerry Adams and Sinn Fein fit with the recent elections, where Sinn Fein clearly held their ground and continued to be supported as an important political force that have to be reckoned with, and negotiated with, for a peaceful future for Ireland? Sinn Fein are now the largest pro-agreement party. That status has been confirmed by the recent election. The simple point is that the situation in Ireland socially and economically has improved only because there has been genuine discussion and negotiation between the main parties, including Sinn Fein and the unionists, amongst others.</para>
<para>The recent elections were crucially important. They were about the future and the type of Ireland people want to build in the 21st century. They were about the peace process and its success or failure. They were also about leadership—about who is best able to give the kind of leadership that can end conflict, build equality and make this century different from all those which have preceded it for the Irish people. So, when Sinn Fein said that real and lasting peace was the most important issue facing people in the election, I believe they meant that. When Sinn Fein say that republicans have to take risks and tough decisions, Sinn Fein mean that. When Sinn Fein say that making peace and building prosperity and a different and better future needs republicans and unionists working together, Sinn Fein mean that also.</para>
<para>The challenge—and it is a hard one—is to put the failures of the past behind us. This does not mean forgetting what happened; it means learning from those mistakes and doing our best not to repeat them. The focus has to be to build a new future in which difference and diversity enriches, rather than divides, society. The peace process provides, for the first time, an alternative way forward. It is an alternative through which issues of difference can be addressed and resolved through purely political and democratic methods.</para>
<para>On 6 April Gerry Adams made an appeal to the IRA to commit itself to purely political and democratic activity. Both the SDLP and DUP have dismissed this as a confidence trick. But, for those who have been listening to what Gerry Adams has been saying, it is clear that he has been emphasising the need for such a development for a long time now. The initiative taken by Gerry Adams on 6 April was quite deliberately aimed at leapfrogging all the obstacles. It was intended to clear the decks and to create the conditions for proper engagements between the parties and the governments after the summer. It was about taking the next step in securing a peaceful Ireland. That much was obvious to everyone—except, it seems, to Senator McGauran.</para>
<para>The optimism of recent years appears at the moment to have dissipated. At the moment, not many hold a lot of hope for more progress. The danger of further stagnation or worse is there for all to see. But there is a clear willingness amongst Sinn Fein to go forward—and, significantly, the peace process can only go forward with Sinn Fein’s involvement and the involvement of other parties. Of course, there are also those who have genuinely-held concerns about the IRA. The Gerry Adams initiative is an honest attempt to deal definitively with all these issues and concerns.</para>
<para>This presents a huge challenge to the IRA. But it is also a huge challenge to the other participants in the process of facing up to their responsibilities, facing the past and creating a better future for Irish people. It is a challenge to the British and Irish governments to face up to the many issues within their control. Of course, it is also a challenge to unionism. But these parties have faced these challenges in the immediate past and progress has been made. Further progress can be made. Further progress has to been made.</para>
<para>In my opinion, there is now an unprecedented opportunity to make progress, to finally and conclusively deal with outstanding issues and to see the Good Friday agreement realised in full. There is a collective responsibility on all political leaders to seize this opportunity, to build on the enormous potential that exists and to make politics work for all Irish people—nationalist, unionist and everyone else. This includes a responsibility of Australian Irish politicians, such as Senator McGauran, to embrace the politics of engagement and to reject the politics of hatred and division. It should be instructive for Senator McGauran—and it is a great sign of hope for the future—that staunch republican groups of Irish Australians, such as the Casement Group, are tirelessly working toward furthering the Irish peace process from this corner of the world.</para>
<para>After this election there will be a return to the negotiating table. Sinn Fein will go into these negotiations positively and determined to consolidate the significant progress that has been made over the last 10 years—and I am sure of that. The task is not an impossible one. The task is achievable, but it will only be achievable with goodwill and positive attitudes, not the sorts of attitudes that Senator McGauran was espousing. Together with all parties involved the Irish people need to keep moving in the right direction. The stakes are very high. Big decisions have to be taken. Yet again there are hurdles and obstacles to get over. This peace process is a hard road.</para>
<para>Gerry Adams has mapped out the necessary next steps in the process and the central role, the historic role, that republicans have to play. It is important that people support and endorse the Sinn Fein leadership and their intention to use whatever influence they can to bring as many republicans as possible along the road signposted by Gerry Adams. Gerry Adams should be welcomed in Australia to promote this path. The die is cast. The challenge now is for Sinn Fein to bring as many people as possible with them. Irish republicanism is at a defining point. The peace process is at a defining point. Beyond the politics of the peace process there are other big issues, such as job creation and addressing the education and health needs of Irish people. All of these affect every Irish citizen and every Irish family—unionist, nationalist or republican.</para>
<para>Sinn Fein went into the recent election seeking an endorsement of the peace strategy and, in particular, of the initiative to get the process back on track. Despite months of disgraceful, dishonest and negative campaigning for cheap political advantage in the election—campaigning that set back the peace process and set back the settling of the major issue that has caused so much grief in Ireland—174,530 people came out and endorsed Sinn Fein’s strategy. And, yes, Sinn Fein support has increased across the north.</para>
<para>The message is clear: people want to see progress and they want to see Sinn Fein leading and part of that change. There is a huge responsibility on Sinn Fein but there is also a huge responsibility on the DUP and on the two governments. The opportunity for progress must now be seized. Everyone wants to see a return to the talks as quickly as possible to get the Good Friday agreement implemented and the political institutions restored—everyone except perhaps Senator McGauran.</para>

</talker>
<para>—Last month, Queensland’s longest-serving Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, died aged 94. Sir Joh became Premier of my home state when I was three and reigned until I was 22. To him I owe the credit for the political environment in which I grew up and my determination to fight government hypocrisy, corruption and mismanagement. Indeed, my first major political act was organising a protest against my university’s decision toward him an honorary doctorate in 1986. There has been much written on Sir Joh in recent months. The ABC in Queensland has dedicated hundreds of hours of air time to Joh’s achievements and detractors, even delaying <inline font-style="italic">Play School</inline> to broadcast his funeral live. I must confess that given a choice I would have preferred to watch <inline font-style="italic">Play School</inline>.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>At the outset, however, I state that I supported the decision of the Queensland government to hold a state funeral for Sir Joh—an honour appropriate for a former Premier. I also supported the decision of 16 of the 18 cabinet ministers and former Premier Wayne Goss to not attend funeral and the decision by several hundred opponents of his regime to peacefully protest Joh’s policies on that day. Ironically, protesting was something which was not allowed very much during Joh’s era. I still remember his ban on street marches and picketing and his constant harassment of unions and other opponents. During the height of the SEQEB dispute Sir Joh, despite his claim to Christian piety, allowed his police to ban the whistling of hymns on picket lines as a provocative political protest. My father-in-law, Neville Jones, who was involved with a group called the Concerned Christians, got caught up in the madness over the issue of a home-made fold-up cross. The cross was made to fold up so that the Concerned Christians group could move on quickly when the police found their prayers to be provocative acts. However, the police confiscated Mr Jones’s cross, arguing that it was an offensive weapon. A bevy of lawyers were soon clamouring over themselves, desperate to take on the case to get the cross back. In the end, some more senior official in the police department realised that a PR disaster was looming and the offensive weapon—the home-made folding cross—was returned to its owner.</para>
<para>The use of the power of the state against individuals was part of the darker side of the Bjelke-Petersen regime. Who can forget the hounding of school teacher John Sinclair over his campaigning to stop sand mining on Fraser Island? Who can forget Justice Douglas, passed over for a well-deserved judicial promotion because of a rumour he might have once voted Labor? And we should not forget Ray Whitrod, the reforming police commissioner with the odd view that the police should uphold the law, quietly removed in favour of the corrupt Terry Lewis. Phil Dickie, the Walkley award-winning journalist whose expose of police corruption helped usher in the Fitzgerald inquiry and the downfall of the Bjelke-Petersen regime, wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on Anzac Day that the legacy of the Bjelke-Petersen regime still lives on in Queensland:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Even after a series of Labor governments, the state still lags significantly behind the best and much of the rest of Australia in the provision of social as opposed to physical infrastructure. Consumers, public health and the environment continue to have all the protection of legislation full of loopholes that is rarely enforced.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">                   …        …         …</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Even premiers who had their political start marching against Bjelke-Petersen seem to have never really accepted that parliament may have a role beyond passing the government’s legislation, that the citizenry may have a right to information or that communities may legitimately object to the government’s plans for them.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Some of the recent actions of the Beattie government, while lacking the scale of rank corruption of the Bjelke-Petersen, certainly approach him in terms of hypocrisy. The rise and fall of the former Queensland Information Commissioner and his deputy, the watchdogs of freedom of information in Queensland, are a case in point. Last year, the former Information Commissioner, David Bevan, acting in accordance with his act, overruled the Premier’s refusal to release details of the contracts on tens of millions of dollars of public subsidies paid to the Berri fruit juice company. The Premier responded by saying that he would change the law. A few months later, the Information Commissioner, David Bevan, was quietly removed from his position.</para>
<para>His replacement, Ms Cathi Taylor, is a former ALP member, a former employee of the Premier, the partner of a department director-general and personal friend of the chair of the selection panel, the Premier’s own director-general. Her first act as Information Commissioner was to sack Mr Bevan’s long-standing and respected independently minded deputy, Greg Sorensen. No, Sir Joh would have been proud of that.</para>
<para>Of course, the Bjelke-Petersen regime survived as long as it did courtesy of its gerrymander—its electoral weighting of country electorates. Unfortunately, I can report to the Senate that gerrymanders are still alive and well in Australia. Take Western Australia, for example. Western Australia has the worst electoral weighting in Australia, with country voters bunched in electorates as little as a quarter of the size of larger city electorates. Last month, thanks to a former Liberal upper house member, Alan Cadby, it appeared that this was going to change. For the West Australian lower house there appears to have been a deal done so that there will be electoral parity, albeit with an electoral allowance for very large seats in remote Western Australia.</para>
<para>But for the upper house it looks like the electoral weighting will continue, thanks to the self-interest of the Green MPs in the West Australian parliament. Seventy-four per cent of Western Australia’s population live in the metropolitan area, yet the 26 per cent who live outside the metropolitan area currently elect half of the members of the upper house, with an upper house MP for every 19,200 voters compared to 55,150 voters for every metropolitan MP. Yet in a bizarre decision the Greens are now insisting that this be entrenched—in fact that it should be made worse. The current allowance for five members for the largest region in each zone compared with five for smaller regions is now being attacked by the Greens, who want to have the same number in every zone regardless of the number of the voters. Their spokesperson, Dr Chrissy Sharp, is calling for six regions, each electing six members as the first stage towards the Greens shift towards bioregions as a basis for government. This will apparently will be good for the environment. I quote from her press release:</para>
<quote>
<para>We realise that without adequate political representation, the wide environment of WA and the people responsible for managing it, will be neglected.</para>
<para>That is why we support continued malapportionment in the Upper House: to provide for a Parliament that is better grounded in natural resource management.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I do not now how the number of votes allocated to sheep in far Western Australia is going to determine how good the natural resource management is, but that is her rationale. What absolute and utter twaddle! The truth is that the Greens believe they have a chance of winning back the two country seats they narrowly lost in this year’s election if the quota is reduced. Dee Margetts, a former senator, and Robin Chapple, managed to fluke seats with votes of around 4.4 per cent in 2001 but fell short in 2005. With a lower quota they will probably return to the parliament at the next election.</para>
<para>To dress up naked self-interest as being good for the environment is the sort of self-serving twaddle that the Bjelke-Petersen regime would have been proud of. It is worth noting, of course, that the Greens and the National Party in Western Australia managed to exchange preferences. Indeed, the last Green, Dr Chrissy Sharp’s successor, was actually elected by National Party preferences ahead of a Christian Democrat candidate. Hypocrisy in politics is something which all of us should seek to ensure is not put ahead of good public policy.</para>
<para>I will finish today with a quote from another colleague of mine in the Democrats, Liz Willis, who wrote to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on Anzac Day, again thanking Joh Bjelke-Petersen for her political education. She said:</para>
<quote>
<para>Joh Bjelke-Petersen was a hard-working and driven man and he made those of us who were on the other side of his political fence work even harder, unwittingly steeling and skilling up his political opponents.</para>
<para>The Queensland political scene is now populated by many who may never have been driven to politics had they not encountered the effects of the strongarm politics of his government in their jobs in law, community services, media and education or in their daily grind as foot soldiers in the army of the unemployed.</para>
<para>I am not angry we were denied the rich, varied and comparatively relaxed life that young Queenslanders now enjoy. I am proud to have lived through that time and also proud that Brisbane and Queensland emerged from being national jokes to be the desirable locations they are today.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I do wish to pass on my condolences to the Bjelke-Petersen family at this stage. I think that is appropriate. It is very sad to lose a father, a grandfather and a great-grandfather. I also wish to add my condolences to the many victims of the Bjelke-Petersen regime over the last two decades in Queensland. They are still alive and living with their pain in Queensland today—the SEQEB workers, including one of my cousins, who lost all of their superannuation months from retirement because of a political act of the Bjelke-Petersen regime. They are the victims and they should not be forgotten. Certainly at this time we should note what was bad about the regime and make sure it does not come into our public life, whether it be gerrymanders in Western Australia, accountability mechanisms in Queensland or shameless pork-barrelling, as we saw in the last federal election.</para>

<para>—This afternoon the Senate debated a condolence motion for Mr Al Grassby, the former member for Riverina. I wish to continue the topic; however, the subject I wish to speak on is not the late Al Grassby the man, whom I met but twice and briefly, but the legacy he was supposed to have left the Australian society as the father of multiculturalism, as some of his admirers eulogised. While there can be little doubt that Al Grassby was the first Australian political figure to actively identify himself with multiculturalism—though in fact Hubert Opperman as Harold Holt’s immigration minister in 1966 was the first Australian political leader to make an actual move to implement a non-racially based immigration policy; a fact which is not often recognised—whether Al Grassby was entitled to that accolade is questionable, especially of the dynamic and inclusive multiculturalism that is the hallmark of contemporary Australia, which is a far cry from the simple demand for tolerance of differences that characterised the multiculturalism of the Grassby era.</para>

I note that by 1978 not only was Al Grassby long gone from political power but so was Gough Whitlam, his patron. The Galbally report first recognised the requirement for all government services and programs to specifically address the needs of migrants. The subsequent introduction of the Charter of Public Service in a Culturally Diverse Society was supposed to provide a nationally consistent set of principles which ensure culturally responsive service planning delivery and evaluation. Since then, to say that the access and equity program introduced by the Hawke government, now in its 20th year, has not had a vigorous enforcement is to put it at best. It is a matter of historic record that at various times it had been used to gain electoral support amongst migrant communities, leading to the emergence of the multicultural industry as a political tool. So, at worst, it offered the prospect of separately developing communities.</para>
<para>This was a far cry from the multiculturalism we practise today. Today we recognise that one of the enduring strengths of Australian society is our linguistic, cultural and religious diversity. Today we recognise that we have benefited enormously from our ability to accept and embrace people from different backgrounds, whose skills and hard work contribute immeasurably to Australia’s social, cultural and economic development. This success is too often taken for granted. In truth, it has required ongoing attention from the government and the broader community. We need to continually respond to changing circumstances, both domestically and internationally.</para>
<para>The whole purpose of our multicultural policy is to maximise the benefits of our diversity—in other words, to build on Australia’s achievements as a prosperous and peaceful nation and to never take that for granted. Multiculturalism in Australia isn’t something that we add on to our daily lives, such as attending a weekend festival, rather it is an intrinsic part of who we are and how we live our everyday lives. The challenge is to make it work for everybody. There is no benefit in separate development or one sector of the community benefiting at another’s expense. Australians of all backgrounds must prosper together if we are to thrive as a nation.</para>
<para>Inclusiveness is the foundation stone of Australia’s multiculturalism. In order to do this we have to continue to adapt and evolve to the changing face of Australia’s migrant communities. Therefore, the successful settlement of new migrants must be a focal point of our multicultural policy objectives. For migrants to succeed in Australia we must make sure they feel a sense of belonging and are given opportunities to achieve their goals and develop a commitment to Australia. It is also important for us to have in place policies that encourage community cohesion and harmony. After all, expanding cultural diversity, like all change, can create resistance.</para>
<para>Overseas events too have undeniably caused tension in our society, with many people feeling vulnerable to the potential of conflicts being imported into Australia. Our best response is to continue to build on the significant community harmony we enjoy today. To ensure this community harmony we must: make it clear that there is no place for racism in Australia; positively address any pockets of racism or intolerance that exist; reinforce and emphasise our shared values, focusing on what unites us as Australians, while still respecting our differences; and build upon the community harmony and cohesiveness already underpinning Australian society.</para>
<para>I am pleased to say that the Howard government has also been working towards changing the culture of the Public Service to make sure it responds to the cultural and linguistic diversity of the Australian population it serves. The Howard government has been committed to maximising the benefits of cultural diversity and changing and enhancing community harmony. I am pleased to be part of that. Most importantly, today multiculturalism in Australia means that every Australian will have equality of access and opportunity to make the most of their individual circumstances, regardless of whether Australia is their country of birth or of choice.</para>
<para>In retrospect, I have to conclude that the multiculturalism that Al Grassby championed was not the productive and harmonious one that has grown and developed to what we know today. But this is not to deny Al Grassby credit. Because of the very visible presence that he had, we might better say that rather than being the father of multiculturalism, he was the godfather.</para>
<para>Let us look forward: the future will bring increased movement of people, the opening of markets and advances in communications, presenting Australians with opportunities not to be missed. Australia’s cultural diversity gives us a competitive advantage, helping us to trade and compete with other parts of the world. We know that 23 per cent of the Australian population was born overseas and that Australians speak over 200 languages. Tellingly, 27 per cent use a second language at home and on other occasions on a regular basis. Twenty-five per cent of the work force was born overseas, with 15 per cent coming from non-English-speaking countries, and nearly one-third of the total number of small businesses in Australia are owned or run by people born overseas.</para>
<para>Our cultural diversity provides us with market intelligence, insight and opportunity that would be the envy of many other countries. We must take full advantage of this edge to assure our economic growth and ongoing competitiveness. Operating in the international marketplace means that Australian companies will be faced with numerous challenges, including languages, customs, beliefs, social systems, ideologies and business practices. Expertise in overseas business protocols and local contacts provide a competitive edge that no business can afford to ignore. Importantly, this knowledge is available to businesses here in Australia. Let us make use of this.</para>
<para>In case anyone in the chamber thinks that my comments are merely the ramblings of my private wish list, let me say that much of what I have said was paraphrased from a speech given by the Hon. Peter McGauran to the transformations conference co-sponsored by UNESCO and the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia on 8 February 2005. To use a colloquialism: it was ‘no bull’.</para>

<para>However, I can reinstate a permanent resident visa that has been cancelled under subsection 501(3) or 501A(3).  These are decisions that can only be taken by the Minister personally.  Under subsection 501C(3), I am required to invite a person whose visa has been cancelled under these provisions to make representations about the revocation of the decision. </para>
<para>        Under subsection 501C(4), I may revoke the original decision if the person makes representations in response to my invitation and the person satisfies me that they pass the character test.</para>
<para>        Under subsection 501C(5) the power under subsection (4) may only be exercised by me personally.  I have not exercised my power under this legislation.</para>
<para>        Section 200 of the Migration Act 1958 is concerned with the ‘Deportation of certain non-citizens.’  Section 200 provides for the making of a deportation order in respect of non-citizens with criminal records.  Such an order can be revoked under section 33(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 until such time as the order is executed and the person deported.  Records show that for the period 2002 to date, the Ministerial power to revoke a deportation order under section 200 of the Act has not been exercised.</para>

<para> asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 17 November 2004:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>With reference to a claim made by the Prime Minister before the war that only the threat of force by the United States of America (US) allowed the United Nations Monitoring Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) weapons inspectors back into Iraq, and given that it was the threat of force by Washington which pulled the weapons inspectors out of Iraq in March 2003 before they could complete their work (as in December 1998), does the Prime Minister now concede that the threat of force failed again to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>What is the Government’s response to the claim of the Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC, Dr Blix, that the US was guilty of ‘fabricating’ evidence against Iraq to justify the war, and his belief that the discovery of weapons of mass destruction had been replaced by the main objective of the US of toppling Saddam Hussein (The Guardian, 12 April 2003).</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>With reference to claims made by the Prime Minister before the war that there was no doubt that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and that that this was the primary reason for Australia’s participation in the ‘coalition of the willing’, what is the Prime Minister’s position now that, even after the collapse of the regime in Baghdad, no weapons of mass destruction have been found despite United States Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld’s claim to know where they are.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>Given the Prime Minister’s statements that ‘regime change’ was only a secondary concern for Australia, does the Government agree that the primary justification for the war may prove to be a lie.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>If, as the Prime Minister repeatedly claimed, Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and Saddam Hussein could not be contained or deterred, what is the Government’s analysis of why they were not used in the regime’s terminal hours against the invading US, United Kingdom and Australian forces.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>With reference to the Prime Minister’s argument that stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction was a primary motive for Australia’s participation in a war against Iraq: (a) is the Government concerned that one of the direct effects of the war may be the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to third parties, including other so called ‘rogue states’ and possibly terrorist groups, and (b) what analysis has the Government done of this likelihood, and (c) can details be provided.</para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>Does the Prime Minister now regret saying just before the war (at the National Press Club and elsewhere) that Saddam Hussein could stay on in power providing he got rid of his weapons of mass destruction, thus allowing him to continue the repression of Iraqis; if so, what circumstances altered the Prime Minister’s view.</para>

<para>The point I made with respect to the return of inspectors to Iraq was that it was widely acknowledged - including by UN Secretary-General Annan - that without the pressure provided by the US military presence in the region inspections would not have resumed in Iraq.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>There have been various media reports of statements attributed to Dr Blix.  It is notable that in other media reports (eg. Sydney Morning Herald, 23 April 2003) Dr Blix was quoted as saying he “would not dream of accusing American and British intelligence agents of fabricating reports…”.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The Iraq Survey Group reported on 6 October 2004 that Saddam had intended to reconstitute Iraq’s WMD programs once UN sanctions were lifted. Saddam retained aspirations to develop a nuclear capability, but initially planned to focus on ballistic missile and chemical warfare capabilities. The findings echo earlier reports by David Kay, Charles Duelfer and the Butler Review, which made clear that Saddam had not abandoned his WMD ambitions.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>No. Moreover, it remains the case that, if the advice of the ALP had been taken on the issue of Iraq, Saddam Hussein would still be in power.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>While the Iraq Survey Group found no evidence of WMD stockpiles or post-1991 WMD production activity, it did find that Saddam had intended to reconstitute Iraq’s WMD programs once UN sanctions were lifted.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>Concern at the possibility of any leakage of Iraqi WMD materials or expertise to other rogue countries or terrorists was one reason for the government’s participation in the coalition action against Iraq. This concern also underlined the government’s decision to contribute expert and other assistance to the Iraq Survey Group.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">3. Between 1996 and 2003, the number of unfair dismissal applications made in the NSW State jurisdiction increased substantially and the number of applications in NSW in the federal jurisdiction declined substantially. These shifts may be attributed to: the fact that applications in 1996 were made under the more expansive unfair dismissal provisions in the Industrial Relations Act 1988 rather than the more limited scheme in the Workplace Relations Act 1996, which did not come into effect until 31 December 1996; and the expansion in the NSW jurisdiction effected by the Industrial Relations Amendment (Federal Award Employees) Act 1998 (NSW).</para>

<item label="(4)">
<para>The Australian Industrial Registry (AIR) asks employers who are nominated as respondents in federal termination of employment matters a question relating to the size of their business. Around one third of such employers have responded to the AIR’s question . The information collected by the AIR relates only to unfair dismissal applications under the federal Workplace Relations Act 1996, and has only been collected since 1 December 1997. As far as the Federal Government is aware, no state or territory is able to provide reliable data on the number of small businesses involved in unfair dismissal applications for the 1996 or 2003 calendar years. Therefore, it is not possible to provide tables for all small business unfair dismissal applications for the 1996 calendar year, small business unfair dismissal applications under federal and state law for the 2003 calendar year, or changes in the number of small business unfair dismissal applications between 1996 and 2003, as requested.</para>
<para>        The following table provides information on federal unfair dismissal applications, broken down by the state and territory in which the application was lodged, for the 2003 calendar year. As not all employers involved in federal unfair dismissal matters responded to the AIR’s request for information on employer size, the information in the table is considered indicative only. The number of employer respondents who provided information on employer size is included in the table.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">3. Between 1996 and 2003, the number of unfair dismissal applications made in the NSW State jurisdiction increased substantially and the number of applications in NSW in the federal jurisdiction declined substantially. These shifts may be attributed to: the fact that applications in 1996 were made under the more expansive unfair dismissal provisions in the Industrial Relations Act 1988 rather than the more limited scheme in the Workplace Relations Act 1996, which did not come into effect until 31 December 1996; and the expansion in the NSW jurisdiction effected by the Industrial Relations Amendment (Federal Award Employees) Act 1998 (NSW).</para>

<item label="(4)">
<para>The Australian Industrial Registry (AIR) asks employers who are nominated as respondents in federal termination of employment matters a question relating to the size of their business. Around one third of such employers have responded to the AIR’s question . The information collected by the AIR relates only to unfair dismissal applications under the federal Workplace Relations Act 1996, and has only been collected since 1 December 1997. As far as the Federal Government is aware, no state or territory is able to provide reliable data on the number of small businesses involved in unfair dismissal applications for the 1996 or 2003 calendar years. Therefore, it is not possible to provide tables for all small business unfair dismissal applications for the 1996 calendar year, small business unfair dismissal applications under federal and state law for the 2003 calendar year, or changes in the number of small business unfair dismissal applications between 1996 and 2003, as requested.</para>
<para>        The following table provides information on federal unfair dismissal applications, broken down by the state and territory in which the application was lodged, for the 2003 calendar year. As not all employers involved in federal unfair dismissal matters responded to the AIR’s request for information on employer size, the information in the table is considered indicative only. The number of employer respondents who provided information on employer size is included in the table.</para>

An additional allocation was sourced from unspent funds from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) community awareness campaign.  This was on the basis that the Strengthening Medicare campaign conveyed further messages about the PBS as part of Medicare.  This was consistent with the purpose for which the PBS funds were originally appropriated (Annual Appropriation administered item 1 in the 2002-03 Budget measure Sustaining the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme – Reinforcing the Commitment to Evidence-based Medicine). (b) The appropriation for both was in 2003-04. (c) The appropriations relate to departmental and administered items. (d) With regard to the A Fairer Medicare appropriation, the relevant parts in the 2003-04 Portfolio Budget Statements are page 26, Table C.1; Appropriations and other revenue, departmental items, Outcomes 2 and 4 and page 152, measure description for  A Fairer Medicare - Information for the Public and Medical Professionals.</para>
<para>        With regard to the Sustaining the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme appropriation, the relevant line item in the 2002-03 Portfolio Budget Statement is under Outcome 2: Access to Medicare, a component of ‘Sustaining the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme - Reinforcing the Commitment to Evidence-based Medicine’ measure.</para>

</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Australia’s approach to UN consideration of this issue aimed to achieve, as quickly as possible, an outcome consistent with Australian domestic policy.  At an early stage the Belgian proposal appeared to meet this aim. Australia never co‑sponsored the Belgian proposal, although in 2003 we indicated a disposition to support it.  It subsequently became clear that the Belgian proposal would not achieve consensus.  A decision to support the Costa Rican proposal was made in late 2003 and a decision to co‑sponsor it in 2004.  On 19 November 2004, the UN General Assembly’s Sixth Committee decided to establish a working group to finalise the text of a declaration on human cloning.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Australian Government decided on 18 February 2005 to support the proposed UN General Assembly declaration on cloning prepared by the working group’s Chair and put forward by Honduras. The declaration, which was reaffirmed in the plenary of the General Assembly on 8 March 2005, called on States to ‘prohibit all forms of human cloning inasmuch as they are incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life’.  Australia voted in favour as the text was consistent with the Prohibition of Cloning Act 2002 and therefore achieved our objective.</para>

<para>It is noted that the statement in the department’s annual report for 2003-04 presents an ambiguity.  As set out in the table immediately preceding this text on page 93 of the annual report, expenditure on the Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme in 2003-04 was higher than the original budget estimate in 2003-04 ($30.8 million), but 11.9% less than the revised estimate contained in the 2003-04 Additional Estimates ($39.0 million).</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The Scheme is demand driven and the 2003-04 Additional Estimates were largely formulated on the basis of forecasts by TT-Line, the major Bass Strait passenger/vehicle transport operator.  TT-Line’s forecasts did not fully eventuate with the final level of claim activity during 2003-04 lower than anticipated for both TT-Line’s new Sydney – Devonport service and its Melbourne-Devonport service.  TT-Line has attributed this in part to the greater availability of low cost airfares to and from Tasmanian, and increased interest in overseas travel from Australia, due to the relative strength of the Australian dollar.</para>

<para>As noted in (1), the cost of the scheme was not above final expectations expressed in the Additional Estimates.</para>

<item label="(1)">
<para>In the case of Olympic Dam uranium mine, my Department has been advised by Western Mining Corporation Limited (WMC), that over the period 1997 to 2003, the average annual number of bird deaths reported was 23.  From the beginning of 2004, deaths were 128 in the March quarter, 43 in the June quarter and 19 in the September quarter.  No statistics are yet available for the December quarter.</para>
<para>        During the period 2003 to 2004, WMC environmental monitoring in the region recorded an unusually high level of bird activity due to higher than average rainfall and some regional flooding.  It is unclear at this time whether the number of deaths have been influenced by the high numbers of birds or by other seasonal and climatic factors.</para>
<para>        WMC has reported that species included in deaths were from the following families: anatidae (ducks); podicipedidae (grebes); phalacrocoracidae (cormorants); ardeidae (herons and egrets); accipitridae (raptors); falconidae (falcons); rallidae (moorhens); scolopacidae (waders and snipes); charadriidae (waders); glareolidae (pratinoles); laridae (gulls and terns); meliphagidae (honeyeaters); corvidae (currawong and crows); hundinidae (swallows and martins).  No other animal deaths have been reported to state or federal regulatory authorities.</para>

<para>—The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>There is no single authoritative or complete data source on terminations of pregnancies in Australia.  This means that it is not possible to give a precise number of terminations each year.</para>
<para>        It is possible however to combine data from a number of sources to provide an estimate of the number of terminations each year.</para>
<para>        Based on data available to the Department of Health and Ageing, it is estimated that approximately 90,000 terminations of pregnancy procedures were carried out in Australia in 2003-04.</para>
<para>        The tables at Attachment A break down the number and geographic distribution of estimated terminations for the years 1994-95 to 2003-04 across all states and territories.  Data for each state and territory is reported on the basis of the state or territory in which the procedure was performed. </para>
<para>        The data at Attachment A separately identifies activity occurring within each state and territory in public and private hospitals as well as Medicare funded services provided outside hospital.  Detailed information on the source of this data follows.</para>
<para>        National Morbidity Casemix Data Set (NMDS)</para>
<para>        The Australian Government receives unit record data from the states and territories on public and private hospital utilisation including information about admitted patient procedures.  This data is provided under the Australian Health Care Agreements and forms the National Morbidity Casemix Data Set.  This data includes information against a number of codes which together indicate the number of terminations occurring in public and private hospitals. These codes comprise: medical abortion; unspecified abortion; failed attempted abortion; other abortion <inline font-variant="superscript" font-size="9.5pt">1</inline>.</para>
<para>        The quality of the source data reported through the NMDS is a matter for states and territories.  The Department has written to each state and territory jurisdiction to seek their comments on the data held by the Australian Government against the codes specified above. A summary of jurisdictions’ comments are at Attachment B.</para>
<para>        By writing to individual jurisdictions, the Department has made every endeavour to verify the accuracy of the data with the states and territories.  However, the Department is not able to independently verify it.  Ultimately, the accuracy of the data relies on coding standards and issues of completeness which cannot be ascertained by this Department.</para>
<para>        Medicare Benefits Schedule</para>
<para>        Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data provides a further source of information on terminations each year, as it identifies procedures which occurred outside hospital for which a Medicare claim was made.  Two MBS items are of relevance:</para>
</item>
<item label="(a)">
<list type="unadorned">
<item label="">
<para>MBS item 35643 (6469) – evacuation of the contents of the gravid uterus by curettage or suction curettage.  This item covers terminations but will also apply to those situations where there is a missed abortion (the foetus has died but not been expelled) and trophoblastic disease which is an abnormality of the placenta and in some cases is cancerous.  The MBS item should not include those situations where the woman has had a miscarriage or where the woman is not pregnant such as scraping the lining of the womb to try to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding.</para>
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<list type="unadorned">
<item label="">
<para>MBS item 16525 – management of second trimester labour, with or without induction, for intrauterine foetal death, gross foetal abnormality or life threatening maternal disease.</para>
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item label="(2) (a)">
<para>and (b)  The Department does not have access to reliable information on the percentage of pregnancies that end in abortion in Australia.  However, it is possible to construct an estimate of the total number of pregnancies each year and express the estimated number of abortions as a percentage of that total number.</para>
<para>        The total number of pregnancies has been derived from the sum of live births, pregnancies that have not proceeded to a live birth but where there has been a medical intervention (reported miscarriages, ectopic pregnancy and foetal death), and terminations.  In addition there is a proportion of pregnancies which do not proceed to a live birth but which are not able to be identified through available data sets as no medical intervention has occurred.  This will encompass early miscarriage, in some instances before the pregnancy is known or confirmed.  Estimates vary widely on the number of pregnancies that fall into this category.  The publication Gynaecology (1997) reviews a number of studies which estimate the frequency of early pregnancy loss.  On the basis of the evidence available at that time, the authors conclude that in the order of 22% of all pregnancies each year is a reasonable estimate<inline font-variant="superscript" font-size="9.5pt">2</inline> of the proportion of pregnancies that end in early miscarriage without a medical intervention being recorded.</para>
<para>        Table 1 builds an estimate of the total number of pregnancies each year based on the most recent available data (using the methodology described above) and identifies the data source, drawing on latest available data for each category.  Using this methodology, it is estimated that around 19% of all pregnancies each year may end in a termination.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">#Terminations conducted in Victoria have been excluded from 2003-2004 data, as the Victorian Department of Human Services has raised concerns about the accuracy of the data. In a letter to the Department of Health and Ageing dated 17 March 2005, the Victorian Department of Human Services states that ‘…particularly in relation to late terminations of pregnancy, the data for 2003-04 appears to seriously overestimate the numbers performed. This may be due to coding ambiguities in the data resulting in the inclusion of all procedures resulting in birth, such as inductions for maternal conditions (such as severe eclampsia) and for intra-uterine foetal death’.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Victorian Department of Human Services cited calendar year data produced by the Victorian Consultative Council for Obstetric and Paediatric Mortality and Morbidity on the number of late terminations of pregnancy as follows: 2001 – 151; 2002 – 163; 2003 – 219. Victoria has advised that data in respect of late terminations for 2004 will be published in July 2005.</para>

<para>, (b) and (c)  The World Health Organization issued a Fact Sheet in June 2000 which states that results from epidemiological studies are reassuring in that they show no consistent effect of first trimester induced abortion upon a woman’s risk of breast cancer later in life (Attachment C).</para>
<para>        A study was published in The Lancet in 2004 which reviewed the link between abortion and breast cancer.  The results of this study show that the risk of breast cancer developing after a spontaneous or an induced abortion is not increased in comparison with the risk in women with no history of abortion.  Further, the risk of breast cancer does not increase in women who have had two or more abortions, or abortions at a younger age, or before the birth of a first child (Attachment D).</para>
<para>        There have been calls in the past to use BreastScreen Australia Screening and Assessment Services to study a possible relationship between reproductive history and breast cancer.  These proposals were considered by the then National Advisory Committee to BreastScreen Australia at its meeting of 1 June 2000.  The Committee determined that it could not endorse the collection of reproductive history from women attending BreastScreen Australia services. Members agreed that it would be unacceptable in terms of the Privacy Principles which govern collection of personal information to gather information on risk factors other than family history in which there is an evidence based link to an increased risk of breast cancer.</para>
<para>        A preliminary review of the medical/scientific literature includes research that indicates higher rates of some mental health disorders, such as depression, in women following abortion.  However, there is controversy over the epidemiological validity and interpretation of the studies.  The literature shows there is no strong evidence for a causal association between abortion and mental health disorders, but there may be common underlying risk factors for both.</para>
<para>        The Australian Government is not specifically investigating the link between abortions and mental illness.  However the Government is providing $2.8 million over 2 years for the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health.  Researchers involved in this initiative are collecting and analysing data on a variety of topics, including the following:</para>

<item label="">
<para>(10) (a) and (b)  The Australian Government provides program funding which aims to support a balanced approach to differing family planning service models.  These aim to promote responsible sexual and reproductive behaviours, rather than focussing on one particular strategy or program.  This aims to increase choices for women who wish to seek advice from different perspectives.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>In 2004-05 the Australian Government has committed to provide funding of $16.78 million to a range of sexual and reproductive health services under the Family Planning Program.  This comprises $15.4 million through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs) between the Commonwealth and individual states and territories and $1.378 million to non-government organisations.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>The Australian Government does not fund abortion advocacy services.  Prior to 2004-05, the Australian Government funded six state and territory-based family planning organisations directly, and only two through the PHOFAs.  During 2004-05, all jurisdictions will receive funding for family planning through the PHOFAs. </para>

<para>(15) Based on the number of abortions performed in 2003-04, the average cost to Medicare of including an ultrasound as part of the counselling process would be around $5 million per annum.  This assumes that around 95% of terminations occur in the first trimester with the average cost to Medicare of an ultrasound being $55.</para>

<para>Currently it is not known how many women seek counselling in regard to a pregnancy and consider abortion but then decide to either continue with the pregnancy or miscarry.  As many women also have dating ultrasounds as part of the diagnosis of the pregnancy, the number of additional ultrasounds related to counselling may be small and substitute for ultrasounds that are already performed as part of medical management of pregnancy.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">#Terminations conducted in Victoria have been excluded from 2003-2004 data, as the Victorian Department of Human Services has raised concerns about the accuracy of the data. In a letter to the Department of Health and Ageing dated 17 March 2005, the Victorian Department of Human Services states that ‘…particularly in relation to late terminations of pregnancy, the data for 2003-04 appears to seriously overestimate the numbers performed. This may be due to coding ambiguities in the data resulting in the inclusion of all procedures resulting in birth, such as inductions for maternal conditions (such as severe eclampsia) and for intra-uterine foetal death’.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Victorian Department of Human Services cited calendar year data produced by the Victorian Consultative Council for Obstetric and Paediatric Mortality and Morbidity on the number of late terminations of pregnancy as follows: 2001 – 151; 2002 – 163; 2003 – 219. Victoria has advised that data in respect of late terminations for 2004 will be published in July 2005.</para>

<para>, (b) and (c)  The World Health Organization issued a Fact Sheet in June 2000 which states that results from epidemiological studies are reassuring in that they show no consistent effect of first trimester induced abortion upon a woman’s risk of breast cancer later in life (Attachment C).</para>
<para>        A study was published in The Lancet in 2004 which reviewed the link between abortion and breast cancer.  The results of this study show that the risk of breast cancer developing after a spontaneous or an induced abortion is not increased in comparison with the risk in women with no history of abortion.  Further, the risk of breast cancer does not increase in women who have had two or more abortions, or abortions at a younger age, or before the birth of a first child (Attachment D).</para>
<para>        There have been calls in the past to use BreastScreen Australia Screening and Assessment Services to study a possible relationship between reproductive history and breast cancer.  These proposals were considered by the then National Advisory Committee to BreastScreen Australia at its meeting of 1 June 2000.  The Committee determined that it could not endorse the collection of reproductive history from women attending BreastScreen Australia services. Members agreed that it would be unacceptable in terms of the Privacy Principles which govern collection of personal information to gather information on risk factors other than family history in which there is an evidence based link to an increased risk of breast cancer.</para>
<para>        A preliminary review of the medical/scientific literature includes research that indicates higher rates of some mental health disorders, such as depression, in women following abortion.  However, there is controversy over the epidemiological validity and interpretation of the studies.  The literature shows there is no strong evidence for a causal association between abortion and mental health disorders, but there may be common underlying risk factors for both.</para>
<para>        The Australian Government is not specifically investigating the link between abortions and mental illness.  However the Government is providing $2.8 million over 2 years for the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health.  Researchers involved in this initiative are collecting and analysing data on a variety of topics, including the following:</para>

<item label="">
<para>(10) (a) and (b)  The Australian Government provides program funding which aims to support a balanced approach to differing family planning service models.  These aim to promote responsible sexual and reproductive behaviours, rather than focussing on one particular strategy or program.  This aims to increase choices for women who wish to seek advice from different perspectives.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>In 2004-05 the Australian Government has committed to provide funding of $16.78 million to a range of sexual and reproductive health services under the Family Planning Program.  This comprises $15.4 million through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs) between the Commonwealth and individual states and territories and $1.378 million to non-government organisations.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>The Australian Government does not fund abortion advocacy services.  Prior to 2004-05, the Australian Government funded six state and territory-based family planning organisations directly, and only two through the PHOFAs.  During 2004-05, all jurisdictions will receive funding for family planning through the PHOFAs. </para>

<para>(15) Based on the number of abortions performed in 2003-04, the average cost to Medicare of including an ultrasound as part of the counselling process would be around $5 million per annum.  This assumes that around 95% of terminations occur in the first trimester with the average cost to Medicare of an ultrasound being $55.</para>

<para>Currently it is not known how many women seek counselling in regard to a pregnancy and consider abortion but then decide to either continue with the pregnancy or miscarry.  As many women also have dating ultrasounds as part of the diagnosis of the pregnancy, the number of additional ultrasounds related to counselling may be small and substitute for ultrasounds that are already performed as part of medical management of pregnancy.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">#Terminations conducted in Victoria have been excluded from 2003-2004 data, as the Victorian Department of Human Services has raised concerns about the accuracy of the data. In a letter to the Department of Health and Ageing dated 17 March 2005, the Victorian Department of Human Services states that ‘…particularly in relation to late terminations of pregnancy, the data for 2003-04 appears to seriously overestimate the numbers performed. This may be due to coding ambiguities in the data resulting in the inclusion of all procedures resulting in birth, such as inductions for maternal conditions (such as severe eclampsia) and for intra-uterine foetal death’.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Victorian Department of Human Services cited calendar year data produced by the Victorian Consultative Council for Obstetric and Paediatric Mortality and Morbidity on the number of late terminations of pregnancy as follows: 2001 – 151; 2002 – 163; 2003 – 219. Victoria has advised that data in respect of late terminations for 2004 will be published in July 2005.</para>

<para>, (b) and (c)  The World Health Organization issued a Fact Sheet in June 2000 which states that results from epidemiological studies are reassuring in that they show no consistent effect of first trimester induced abortion upon a woman’s risk of breast cancer later in life (Attachment C).</para>
<para>        A study was published in The Lancet in 2004 which reviewed the link between abortion and breast cancer.  The results of this study show that the risk of breast cancer developing after a spontaneous or an induced abortion is not increased in comparison with the risk in women with no history of abortion.  Further, the risk of breast cancer does not increase in women who have had two or more abortions, or abortions at a younger age, or before the birth of a first child (Attachment D).</para>
<para>        There have been calls in the past to use BreastScreen Australia Screening and Assessment Services to study a possible relationship between reproductive history and breast cancer.  These proposals were considered by the then National Advisory Committee to BreastScreen Australia at its meeting of 1 June 2000.  The Committee determined that it could not endorse the collection of reproductive history from women attending BreastScreen Australia services. Members agreed that it would be unacceptable in terms of the Privacy Principles which govern collection of personal information to gather information on risk factors other than family history in which there is an evidence based link to an increased risk of breast cancer.</para>
<para>        A preliminary review of the medical/scientific literature includes research that indicates higher rates of some mental health disorders, such as depression, in women following abortion.  However, there is controversy over the epidemiological validity and interpretation of the studies.  The literature shows there is no strong evidence for a causal association between abortion and mental health disorders, but there may be common underlying risk factors for both.</para>
<para>        The Australian Government is not specifically investigating the link between abortions and mental illness.  However the Government is providing $2.8 million over 2 years for the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health.  Researchers involved in this initiative are collecting and analysing data on a variety of topics, including the following:</para>

<item label="">
<para>(10) (a) and (b)  The Australian Government provides program funding which aims to support a balanced approach to differing family planning service models.  These aim to promote responsible sexual and reproductive behaviours, rather than focussing on one particular strategy or program.  This aims to increase choices for women who wish to seek advice from different perspectives.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>In 2004-05 the Australian Government has committed to provide funding of $16.78 million to a range of sexual and reproductive health services under the Family Planning Program.  This comprises $15.4 million through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs) between the Commonwealth and individual states and territories and $1.378 million to non-government organisations.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>The Australian Government does not fund abortion advocacy services.  Prior to 2004-05, the Australian Government funded six state and territory-based family planning organisations directly, and only two through the PHOFAs.  During 2004-05, all jurisdictions will receive funding for family planning through the PHOFAs. </para>

<para>(15) Based on the number of abortions performed in 2003-04, the average cost to Medicare of including an ultrasound as part of the counselling process would be around $5 million per annum.  This assumes that around 95% of terminations occur in the first trimester with the average cost to Medicare of an ultrasound being $55.</para>

<para>Currently it is not known how many women seek counselling in regard to a pregnancy and consider abortion but then decide to either continue with the pregnancy or miscarry.  As many women also have dating ultrasounds as part of the diagnosis of the pregnancy, the number of additional ultrasounds related to counselling may be small and substitute for ultrasounds that are already performed as part of medical management of pregnancy.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">#Terminations conducted in Victoria have been excluded from 2003-2004 data, as the Victorian Department of Human Services has raised concerns about the accuracy of the data. In a letter to the Department of Health and Ageing dated 17 March 2005, the Victorian Department of Human Services states that ‘…particularly in relation to late terminations of pregnancy, the data for 2003-04 appears to seriously overestimate the numbers performed. This may be due to coding ambiguities in the data resulting in the inclusion of all procedures resulting in birth, such as inductions for maternal conditions (such as severe eclampsia) and for intra-uterine foetal death’.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Victorian Department of Human Services cited calendar year data produced by the Victorian Consultative Council for Obstetric and Paediatric Mortality and Morbidity on the number of late terminations of pregnancy as follows: 2001 – 151; 2002 – 163; 2003 – 219. Victoria has advised that data in respect of late terminations for 2004 will be published in July 2005.</para>

<para>, (b) and (c)  The World Health Organization issued a Fact Sheet in June 2000 which states that results from epidemiological studies are reassuring in that they show no consistent effect of first trimester induced abortion upon a woman’s risk of breast cancer later in life (Attachment C).</para>
<para>        A study was published in The Lancet in 2004 which reviewed the link between abortion and breast cancer.  The results of this study show that the risk of breast cancer developing after a spontaneous or an induced abortion is not increased in comparison with the risk in women with no history of abortion.  Further, the risk of breast cancer does not increase in women who have had two or more abortions, or abortions at a younger age, or before the birth of a first child (Attachment D).</para>
<para>        There have been calls in the past to use BreastScreen Australia Screening and Assessment Services to study a possible relationship between reproductive history and breast cancer.  These proposals were considered by the then National Advisory Committee to BreastScreen Australia at its meeting of 1 June 2000.  The Committee determined that it could not endorse the collection of reproductive history from women attending BreastScreen Australia services. Members agreed that it would be unacceptable in terms of the Privacy Principles which govern collection of personal information to gather information on risk factors other than family history in which there is an evidence based link to an increased risk of breast cancer.</para>
<para>        A preliminary review of the medical/scientific literature includes research that indicates higher rates of some mental health disorders, such as depression, in women following abortion.  However, there is controversy over the epidemiological validity and interpretation of the studies.  The literature shows there is no strong evidence for a causal association between abortion and mental health disorders, but there may be common underlying risk factors for both.</para>
<para>        The Australian Government is not specifically investigating the link between abortions and mental illness.  However the Government is providing $2.8 million over 2 years for the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health.  Researchers involved in this initiative are collecting and analysing data on a variety of topics, including the following:</para>

<item label="">
<para>(10) (a) and (b)  The Australian Government provides program funding which aims to support a balanced approach to differing family planning service models.  These aim to promote responsible sexual and reproductive behaviours, rather than focussing on one particular strategy or program.  This aims to increase choices for women who wish to seek advice from different perspectives.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>In 2004-05 the Australian Government has committed to provide funding of $16.78 million to a range of sexual and reproductive health services under the Family Planning Program.  This comprises $15.4 million through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs) between the Commonwealth and individual states and territories and $1.378 million to non-government organisations.</para>

<para>The Australian Government does not fund abortion advocacy services.  Prior to 2004-05, the Australian Government funded six state and territory-based family planning organisations directly, and only two through the PHOFAs.  During 2004-05, all jurisdictions will receive funding for family planning through the PHOFAs. </para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Victoria: “Victoria has serious concerns regarding the validity of some of the data that could lead to erroneous assumptions regarding trends in the State.  Firstly with reference to the total number of terminations carried out in Victoria, data from private hospitals prior to 2002-03 is likely to have seriously underestimated the number of terminations due to compliance problems.  Further, particularly in relation to late terminations of pregnancy, the data for 2003-04 appears to seriously overestimate the numbers performed.”</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">#Terminations conducted in Victoria have been excluded from 2003-2004 data, as the Victorian Department of Human Services has raised concerns about the accuracy of the data. In a letter to the Department of Health and Ageing dated 17 March 2005, the Victorian Department of Human Services states that ‘…particularly in relation to late terminations of pregnancy, the data for 2003-04 appears to seriously overestimate the numbers performed. This may be due to coding ambiguities in the data resulting in the inclusion of all procedures resulting in birth, such as inductions for maternal conditions (such as severe eclampsia) and for intra-uterine foetal death’.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Victorian Department of Human Services cited calendar year data produced by the Victorian Consultative Council for Obstetric and Paediatric Mortality and Morbidity on the number of late terminations of pregnancy as follows: 2001 – 151; 2002 – 163; 2003 – 219. Victoria has advised that data in respect of late terminations for 2004 will be published in July 2005.</para>

<para>, (b) and (c)  The World Health Organization issued a Fact Sheet in June 2000 which states that results from epidemiological studies are reassuring in that they show no consistent effect of first trimester induced abortion upon a woman’s risk of breast cancer later in life (Attachment C).</para>
<para>        A study was published in The Lancet in 2004 which reviewed the link between abortion and breast cancer.  The results of this study show that the risk of breast cancer developing after a spontaneous or an induced abortion is not increased in comparison with the risk in women with no history of abortion.  Further, the risk of breast cancer does not increase in women who have had two or more abortions, or abortions at a younger age, or before the birth of a first child (Attachment D).</para>
<para>        There have been calls in the past to use BreastScreen Australia Screening and Assessment Services to study a possible relationship between reproductive history and breast cancer.  These proposals were considered by the then National Advisory Committee to BreastScreen Australia at its meeting of 1 June 2000.  The Committee determined that it could not endorse the collection of reproductive history from women attending BreastScreen Australia services. Members agreed that it would be unacceptable in terms of the Privacy Principles which govern collection of personal information to gather information on risk factors other than family history in which there is an evidence based link to an increased risk of breast cancer.</para>
<para>        A preliminary review of the medical/scientific literature includes research that indicates higher rates of some mental health disorders, such as depression, in women following abortion.  However, there is controversy over the epidemiological validity and interpretation of the studies.  The literature shows there is no strong evidence for a causal association between abortion and mental health disorders, but there may be common underlying risk factors for both.</para>
<para>        The Australian Government is not specifically investigating the link between abortions and mental illness.  However the Government is providing $2.8 million over 2 years for the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health.  Researchers involved in this initiative are collecting and analysing data on a variety of topics, including the following:</para>

<item label="">
<para>(10) (a) and (b)  The Australian Government provides program funding which aims to support a balanced approach to differing family planning service models.  These aim to promote responsible sexual and reproductive behaviours, rather than focussing on one particular strategy or program.  This aims to increase choices for women who wish to seek advice from different perspectives.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>In 2004-05 the Australian Government has committed to provide funding of $16.78 million to a range of sexual and reproductive health services under the Family Planning Program.  This comprises $15.4 million through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs) between the Commonwealth and individual states and territories and $1.378 million to non-government organisations.</para>

<para>The Australian Government does not fund abortion advocacy services.  Prior to 2004-05, the Australian Government funded six state and territory-based family planning organisations directly, and only two through the PHOFAs.  During 2004-05, all jurisdictions will receive funding for family planning through the PHOFAs. </para>

<para>(15) Based on the number of abortions performed in 2003-04, the average cost to Medicare of including an ultrasound as part of the counselling process would be around $5 million per annum.  This assumes that around 95% of terminations occur in the first trimester with the average cost to Medicare of an ultrasound being $55.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">#Terminations conducted in Victoria have been excluded from 2003-2004 data, as the Victorian Department of Human Services has raised concerns about the accuracy of the data. In a letter to the Department of Health and Ageing dated 17 March 2005, the Victorian Department of Human Services states that ‘…particularly in relation to late terminations of pregnancy, the data for 2003-04 appears to seriously overestimate the numbers performed. This may be due to coding ambiguities in the data resulting in the inclusion of all procedures resulting in birth, such as inductions for maternal conditions (such as severe eclampsia) and for intra-uterine foetal death’.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Victorian Department of Human Services cited calendar year data produced by the Victorian Consultative Council for Obstetric and Paediatric Mortality and Morbidity on the number of late terminations of pregnancy as follows: 2001 – 151; 2002 – 163; 2003 – 219. Victoria has advised that data in respect of late terminations for 2004 will be published in July 2005.</para>

<para>        A study was published in The Lancet in 2004 which reviewed the link between abortion and breast cancer.  The results of this study show that the risk of breast cancer developing after a spontaneous or an induced abortion is not increased in comparison with the risk in women with no history of abortion.  Further, the risk of breast cancer does not increase in women who have had two or more abortions, or abortions at a younger age, or before the birth of a first child (Attachment D).</para>
<para>        There have been calls in the past to use BreastScreen Australia Screening and Assessment Services to study a possible relationship between reproductive history and breast cancer.  These proposals were considered by the then National Advisory Committee to BreastScreen Australia at its meeting of 1 June 2000.  The Committee determined that it could not endorse the collection of reproductive history from women attending BreastScreen Australia services. Members agreed that it would be unacceptable in terms of the Privacy Principles which govern collection of personal information to gather information on risk factors other than family history in which there is an evidence based link to an increased risk of breast cancer.</para>
<para>        A preliminary review of the medical/scientific literature includes research that indicates higher rates of some mental health disorders, such as depression, in women following abortion.  However, there is controversy over the epidemiological validity and interpretation of the studies.  The literature shows there is no strong evidence for a causal association between abortion and mental health disorders, but there may be common underlying risk factors for both.</para>
<para>        The Australian Government is not specifically investigating the link between abortions and mental illness.  However the Government is providing $2.8 million over 2 years for the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health.  Researchers involved in this initiative are collecting and analysing data on a variety of topics, including the following:</para>

<para>(10) (a) and (b)  The Australian Government provides program funding which aims to support a balanced approach to differing family planning service models.  These aim to promote responsible sexual and reproductive behaviours, rather than focussing on one particular strategy or program.  This aims to increase choices for women who wish to seek advice from different perspectives.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>In 2004-05 the Australian Government has committed to provide funding of $16.78 million to a range of sexual and reproductive health services under the Family Planning Program.  This comprises $15.4 million through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs) between the Commonwealth and individual states and territories and $1.378 million to non-government organisations.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>The Australian Government does not fund abortion advocacy services.  Prior to 2004-05, the Australian Government funded six state and territory-based family planning organisations directly, and only two through the PHOFAs.  During 2004-05, all jurisdictions will receive funding for family planning through the PHOFAs. </para>

<para>, (b) and (c)  The World Health Organization issued a Fact Sheet in June 2000 which states that results from epidemiological studies are reassuring in that they show no consistent effect of first trimester induced abortion upon a woman’s risk of breast cancer later in life (Attachment C).</para>
<para>        A study was published in The Lancet in 2004 which reviewed the link between abortion and breast cancer.  The results of this study show that the risk of breast cancer developing after a spontaneous or an induced abortion is not increased in comparison with the risk in women with no history of abortion.  Further, the risk of breast cancer does not increase in women who have had two or more abortions, or abortions at a younger age, or before the birth of a first child (Attachment D).</para>
<para>        There have been calls in the past to use BreastScreen Australia Screening and Assessment Services to study a possible relationship between reproductive history and breast cancer.  These proposals were considered by the then National Advisory Committee to BreastScreen Australia at its meeting of 1 June 2000.  The Committee determined that it could not endorse the collection of reproductive history from women attending BreastScreen Australia services. Members agreed that it would be unacceptable in terms of the Privacy Principles which govern collection of personal information to gather information on risk factors other than family history in which there is an evidence based link to an increased risk of breast cancer.</para>
<para>        A preliminary review of the medical/scientific literature includes research that indicates higher rates of some mental health disorders, such as depression, in women following abortion.  However, there is controversy over the epidemiological validity and interpretation of the studies.  The literature shows there is no strong evidence for a causal association between abortion and mental health disorders, but there may be common underlying risk factors for both.</para>
<para>        The Australian Government is not specifically investigating the link between abortions and mental illness.  However the Government is providing $2.8 million over 2 years for the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health.  Researchers involved in this initiative are collecting and analysing data on a variety of topics, including the following:</para>

<item label="">
<para>(10) (a) and (b)  The Australian Government provides program funding which aims to support a balanced approach to differing family planning service models.  These aim to promote responsible sexual and reproductive behaviours, rather than focussing on one particular strategy or program.  This aims to increase choices for women who wish to seek advice from different perspectives.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>In 2004-05 the Australian Government has committed to provide funding of $16.78 million to a range of sexual and reproductive health services under the Family Planning Program.  This comprises $15.4 million through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs) between the Commonwealth and individual states and territories and $1.378 million to non-government organisations.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>The Australian Government does not fund abortion advocacy services.  Prior to 2004-05, the Australian Government funded six state and territory-based family planning organisations directly, and only two through the PHOFAs.  During 2004-05, all jurisdictions will receive funding for family planning through the PHOFAs. </para>

<para>(14) There is no Australian Government requirement for data of this type to be gathered by organisations or providers in respect of termination of pregnancy.  The Department is not aware whether data of this type is held by organisations nor is it aware of the nature of the counselling which may be provided.</para>

<item label="">
<para>(15) Based on the number of abortions performed in 2003-04, the average cost to Medicare of including an ultrasound as part of the counselling process would be around $5 million per annum.  This assumes that around 95% of terminations occur in the first trimester with the average cost to Medicare of an ultrasound being $55.</para>

<item label="">
<para>Currently it is not known how many women seek counselling in regard to a pregnancy and consider abortion but then decide to either continue with the pregnancy or miscarry.  As many women also have dating ultrasounds as part of the diagnosis of the pregnancy, the number of additional ultrasounds related to counselling may be small and substitute for ultrasounds that are already performed as part of medical management of pregnancy.</para>

<para>(16) (a) and (b)  The Department does not budget for individual MBS items.  Estimates for expenditure under the MBS are derived from an estimates model which is based on long term trends in per capita services utilisation and average benefits at the ‘broad type of service’ level.  There are 16 ‘broad type of service levels’ that include attendances, operations, anaesthetics, obstetrics, pathology and diagnostic imaging.  The final estimates are aggregated across the whole of the Medicare Benefits Schedule.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Queensland: “The increase in terminations for private hospitals in 2001-02 and 2002-03 is due to the inclusion of data from private clinics. Due to a change in legislation, private clinics must now be registered as private hospitals and supply data on activity to Queensland Health. These private clinics were registered at various times throughout the 2001-02 period and have only supplied data from date of registration.”</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Victoria: “Victoria has serious concerns regarding the validity of some of the data that could lead to erroneous assumptions regarding trends in the State.  Firstly with reference to the total number of terminations carried out in Victoria, data from private hospitals prior to 2002-03 is likely to have seriously underestimated the number of terminations due to compliance problems.  Further, particularly in relation to late terminations of pregnancy, the data for 2003-04 appears to seriously overestimate the numbers performed.”</para>

<para>, (b) and (c)  The World Health Organization issued a Fact Sheet in June 2000 which states that results from epidemiological studies are reassuring in that they show no consistent effect of first trimester induced abortion upon a woman’s risk of breast cancer later in life (Attachment C).</para>
<para>        A study was published in The Lancet in 2004 which reviewed the link between abortion and breast cancer.  The results of this study show that the risk of breast cancer developing after a spontaneous or an induced abortion is not increased in comparison with the risk in women with no history of abortion.  Further, the risk of breast cancer does not increase in women who have had two or more abortions, or abortions at a younger age, or before the birth of a first child (Attachment D).</para>
<para>        There have been calls in the past to use BreastScreen Australia Screening and Assessment Services to study a possible relationship between reproductive history and breast cancer.  These proposals were considered by the then National Advisory Committee to BreastScreen Australia at its meeting of 1 June 2000.  The Committee determined that it could not endorse the collection of reproductive history from women attending BreastScreen Australia services. Members agreed that it would be unacceptable in terms of the Privacy Principles which govern collection of personal information to gather information on risk factors other than family history in which there is an evidence based link to an increased risk of breast cancer.</para>
<para>        A preliminary review of the medical/scientific literature includes research that indicates higher rates of some mental health disorders, such as depression, in women following abortion.  However, there is controversy over the epidemiological validity and interpretation of the studies.  The literature shows there is no strong evidence for a causal association between abortion and mental health disorders, but there may be common underlying risk factors for both.</para>
<para>        The Australian Government is not specifically investigating the link between abortions and mental illness.  However the Government is providing $2.8 million over 2 years for the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health.  Researchers involved in this initiative are collecting and analysing data on a variety of topics, including the following:</para>

<para>(10) (a) and (b)  The Australian Government provides program funding which aims to support a balanced approach to differing family planning service models.  These aim to promote responsible sexual and reproductive behaviours, rather than focussing on one particular strategy or program.  This aims to increase choices for women who wish to seek advice from different perspectives.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>In 2004-05 the Australian Government has committed to provide funding of $16.78 million to a range of sexual and reproductive health services under the Family Planning Program.  This comprises $15.4 million through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs) between the Commonwealth and individual states and territories and $1.378 million to non-government organisations.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Queensland: “The increase in terminations for private hospitals in 2001-02 and 2002-03 is due to the inclusion of data from private clinics. Due to a change in legislation, private clinics must now be registered as private hospitals and supply data on activity to Queensland Health. These private clinics were registered at various times throughout the 2001-02 period and have only supplied data from date of registration.”</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Victoria: “Victoria has serious concerns regarding the validity of some of the data that could lead to erroneous assumptions regarding trends in the State.  Firstly with reference to the total number of terminations carried out in Victoria, data from private hospitals prior to 2002-03 is likely to have seriously underestimated the number of terminations due to compliance problems.  Further, particularly in relation to late terminations of pregnancy, the data for 2003-04 appears to seriously overestimate the numbers performed.”</para>

<para>There will also be a number of women who consider having an abortion but do not.  We are unable to estimate how many women would fall into this category.</para>

<para>(14) There is no Australian Government requirement for data of this type to be gathered by organisations or providers in respect of termination of pregnancy.  The Department is not aware whether data of this type is held by organisations nor is it aware of the nature of the counselling which may be provided.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>(15) Based on the number of abortions performed in 2003-04, the average cost to Medicare of including an ultrasound as part of the counselling process would be around $5 million per annum.  This assumes that around 95% of terminations occur in the first trimester with the average cost to Medicare of an ultrasound being $55.</para>

<item label="">
<para>Currently it is not known how many women seek counselling in regard to a pregnancy and consider abortion but then decide to either continue with the pregnancy or miscarry.  As many women also have dating ultrasounds as part of the diagnosis of the pregnancy, the number of additional ultrasounds related to counselling may be small and substitute for ultrasounds that are already performed as part of medical management of pregnancy.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>(16) (a) and (b)  The Department does not budget for individual MBS items.  Estimates for expenditure under the MBS are derived from an estimates model which is based on long term trends in per capita services utilisation and average benefits at the ‘broad type of service’ level.  There are 16 ‘broad type of service levels’ that include attendances, operations, anaesthetics, obstetrics, pathology and diagnostic imaging.  The final estimates are aggregated across the whole of the Medicare Benefits Schedule.</para>

<para>It is not possible to identify what part of the cost of abortions is paid for by the Australian Government through the Australian Health Care Agreements.</para>

<item label="">
<para>The 2003-08 Australian Health Care Agreements are five year bilateral agreements between the Australian Government and each state and territory.  Under the Agreements, the Australian Government provides financial assistance to the states and territories to assist with the cost of providing public hospital services in accordance with principles specified in the Agreements.  These principles are that public hospital services must be provided free of charge to public patients on the basis of clinical need and within a clinically appropriate period, regardless of geographic location.</para>

<para>The overall level of funding available to the public hospital system and how those funds are allocated are matters for each state and territory government to determine, according to their priorities and within the scope of their responsibilities for the planning and provision of public hospital services.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Queensland: “The increase in terminations for private hospitals in 2001-02 and 2002-03 is due to the inclusion of data from private clinics. Due to a change in legislation, private clinics must now be registered as private hospitals and supply data on activity to Queensland Health. These private clinics were registered at various times throughout the 2001-02 period and have only supplied data from date of registration.”</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Victoria: “Victoria has serious concerns regarding the validity of some of the data that could lead to erroneous assumptions regarding trends in the State.  Firstly with reference to the total number of terminations carried out in Victoria, data from private hospitals prior to 2002-03 is likely to have seriously underestimated the number of terminations due to compliance problems.  Further, particularly in relation to late terminations of pregnancy, the data for 2003-04 appears to seriously overestimate the numbers performed.”</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Slight differences were also identified in data on late terminations of pregnancy. As these were minor (no more than 10 in any one year) and the number of late terminations recorded are quite low, the differences identified in this data have not been provided for privacy reasons.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">NSW identified several reasons for the variations between the Australian Government and NSW data, namely:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>Timing of the submission of the data: data is updated locally to add previously incomplete records or to correct errors, and this data is not resubmitted to the Australian Department of Health and Ageing;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Differences in editing processes: The Department of Health and Ageing undertakes a series of data edits once data is received from the states which may not the same as data edits applied locally.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The NSW Department also noted that the methodology used to extract the data did not use termination procedures in addition to diagnoses. The NSW Department advised that using termination procedures as well as diagnoses may provide greater accuracy. If this were included, it estimates that around 600 fewer cases may be identified each year.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Victoria</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Victoria expressed serious concerns regarding the validity of some of the data, noting that it could lead to erroneous assumptions regarding trends in the State, in particular regarding:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>Underestimation of private hospital activity before 2002-03 due to compliance issues;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Overestimation of late terminations in 2003-04 due to coding ambiguities such that inductions for maternal conditions such as severe eclampsia and for intra-uterine foetal death may have been included.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Victoria drew attention to data on terminations after 20 weeks of gestation in that State produced by the Consultative Council for Obstetric and Paediatric Mortality and Morbidity which provides calendar year data. The data on the number of late terminations of pregnancy in Victoria for the years 2001, 2002, and 2003 cited in reports of the Council were 151, 163 and 219 respectively.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In regard to late terminations of pregnancy, Victoria noted that these may be conducted either for congenital malformation of the foetus or for psychosocial indications in the mother. It was also noted that half of women seeking terminations in Victoria for psychosocial indications are from interstate.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">A further letter was sent to Victoria on 30 March 2005, seeking updated data on late terminations of pregnancy for 2003-04 together with extraction criteria and data sources. Victoria advised in response that data on the number of late terminations of pregnancy for 2004 would be published by the Council for Obstetric and Paediatric Mortality and Morbidity in July 2005 and would not be available until that time.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Queensland</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Queensland indicated that they were able to match the data in the NMDS, except for two cases:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>For public hospitals in 1998-99, 1 more termination was recorded by Queensland</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>For public hospitals in 1995-96, 3 more terminations were recorded by Queensland.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Queensland asked that the following caveat be included in the Queensland data.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">“The increase in terminations for private hospitals in 2001-02 and 2002-03 is due to the inclusion of data from private clinics. Due to a change in legislation, private clinics must now be registered as private hospitals and supply data on activity to Queensland Health. These private clinics were registered at various times throughout the 2001-02 period and have only supplied data from date of registration.”</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Queensland expressed concern at two of the codes used to identify terminations in the NMDS, in particular:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>the ‘unspecified abortion’ code, which they believed were generally ‘spontaneous’ rather than medical abortions, and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>failed attempted abortions.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Comment by the Australian Department of Health and Ageing</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The two codes referred to in the Queensland correspondence do not represent a large number of terminations. In 2003-04, there were 77 terminations coded to these two items in Queensland (out of a total number of 13,011 in hospital terminations). Across Australia in the same year, there were 823 terminations coded to these two items, out of a total of 51,910 terminations in hospital (excludes Victorian late term data). As removing these data would only have a marginal impact on the estimate of terminations, and this matter was raised in only one jurisdiction, it was decided to take no further action.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">South Australia</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">South Australia indicated that the data had been reviewed and could be released in its current form. However, they also advised of a more accurate collection of information in their ‘Abortions’ collection derived from statutory notifications of termination of pregnancy in that state. Tables 10 and 11 report the data provided by South Australia.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Slight differences were also identified in data on late terminations of pregnancy. As these were minor (no more than 10 in any one year) and the number of late terminations recorded are quite low, the differences identified in this data have not been provided for privacy reasons.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">NSW identified several reasons for the variations between the Australian Government and NSW data, namely:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>Timing of the submission of the data: data is updated locally to add previously incomplete records or to correct errors, and this data is not resubmitted to the Australian Department of Health and Ageing;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Differences in editing processes: The Department of Health and Ageing undertakes a series of data edits once data is received from the states which may not the same as data edits applied locally.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The NSW Department also noted that the methodology used to extract the data did not use termination procedures in addition to diagnoses. The NSW Department advised that using termination procedures as well as diagnoses may provide greater accuracy. If this were included, it estimates that around 600 fewer cases may be identified each year.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Victoria</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Victoria expressed serious concerns regarding the validity of some of the data, noting that it could lead to erroneous assumptions regarding trends in the State, in particular regarding:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>Underestimation of private hospital activity before 2002-03 due to compliance issues;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Overestimation of late terminations in 2003-04 due to coding ambiguities such that inductions for maternal conditions such as severe eclampsia and for intra-uterine foetal death may have been included.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Victoria drew attention to data on terminations after 20 weeks of gestation in that State produced by the Consultative Council for Obstetric and Paediatric Mortality and Morbidity which provides calendar year data. The data on the number of late terminations of pregnancy in Victoria for the years 2001, 2002, and 2003 cited in reports of the Council were 151, 163 and 219 respectively.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In regard to late terminations of pregnancy, Victoria noted that these may be conducted either for congenital malformation of the foetus or for psychosocial indications in the mother. It was also noted that half of women seeking terminations in Victoria for psychosocial indications are from interstate.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">A further letter was sent to Victoria on 30 March 2005, seeking updated data on late terminations of pregnancy for 2003-04 together with extraction criteria and data sources. Victoria advised in response that data on the number of late terminations of pregnancy for 2004 would be published by the Council for Obstetric and Paediatric Mortality and Morbidity in July 2005 and would not be available until that time.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Queensland</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Queensland indicated that they were able to match the data in the NMDS, except for two cases:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>For public hospitals in 1998-99, 1 more termination was recorded by Queensland</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>For public hospitals in 1995-96, 3 more terminations were recorded by Queensland.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Queensland asked that the following caveat be included in the Queensland data.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">“The increase in terminations for private hospitals in 2001-02 and 2002-03 is due to the inclusion of data from private clinics. Due to a change in legislation, private clinics must now be registered as private hospitals and supply data on activity to Queensland Health. These private clinics were registered at various times throughout the 2001-02 period and have only supplied data from date of registration.”</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Queensland expressed concern at two of the codes used to identify terminations in the NMDS, in particular:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>the ‘unspecified abortion’ code, which they believed were generally ‘spontaneous’ rather than medical abortions, and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>failed attempted abortions.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Comment by the Australian Department of Health and Ageing</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The two codes referred to in the Queensland correspondence do not represent a large number of terminations. In 2003-04, there were 77 terminations coded to these two items in Queensland (out of a total number of 13,011 in hospital terminations). Across Australia in the same year, there were 823 terminations coded to these two items, out of a total of 51,910 terminations in hospital (excludes Victorian late term data). As removing these data would only have a marginal impact on the estimate of terminations, and this matter was raised in only one jurisdiction, it was decided to take no further action.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">South Australia</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">South Australia indicated that the data had been reviewed and could be released in its current form.

In 2003-04, of the terminations of pregnancy across Australia recorded in the National Morbidity Dataset, 98.2% were for ‘medical abortion’, 1.5% were for ‘unspecified abortion’, 0.1% were for ‘failed attempted abortion’, and 0.2% were for ‘other abortion’.</para>

<para>—The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>Presently babies receive three injections at 2 months, three injections at 4 months and two injections at 6 months.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Since the commencement of the National Childhood Pneumococcal Vaccination Program, babies at 2, 4 and 6 months of age have received an additional injection at these time points.  Prior to 1 January 2005, babies had received two injections at 2 months, two injections at 4 months and one injection at 6 months.  This number of injections has been given since 2000.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>Data from the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR) is collected using parameters such as child’s age, vaccine received, state/territory, postcode and local government area.  This enables the specific identification of coverage rates for children in all areas of Australia.  ACIR data on coverage rates across Australia do not indicate an immunisation trend between urban areas and rural and remote areas.  Areas of higher and lower coverage rates are similarly shown in urban, rural and remote localities.  There is a trend for lower reported coverage rates in inner-urban localities.  States and territories are responsible for the administration of vaccination programs in their jurisdictions.  They receive ACIR data on localities showing lower than average coverage rates, and this enables them to target areas and improve coverage rates in their jurisdictions.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>There is no data yet on whether the additional injection at 2, 4 and 6 months of age is having an impact on the likelihood of parents having their babies immunised.  Since the introduction of meningococcal C vaccination at 12 months of age, toddlers at this age receive three injections.  Present indications show that most parents are still getting their children immunised with all vaccines given at this age.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>Yes.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>Many of the vaccines currently funded currently under the National Immunisation Program are combination vaccines (for example, diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough (DTPa) vaccine and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine).  States and territories are constantly aiming to improve cold chain monitoring to ensure delivery of viable vaccine to all parts of Australia.  In June 2004, a National Cold Chain Management Workshop was held in Brisbane to explore issues regarding cold chain.</para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>The Department is unaware of any evidence that unemployment and low income are associated with low immunisation coverage in rural areas.  ACIR data on coverage rates across Australia do not indicate any immunisation trends between urban areas and rural and remote areas.  However, there are significantly-lower reported coverage rates in several of Australia’s inner-urban localities.  From 1 November 2005 all vaccines listed on the recommended vaccination schedule will be funded. </para>
<para>(8)   (a) and (b) On 7 March 2005, the Minister for Health and Ageing announced funding for both the replacement of oral polio vaccine with inactivated polio vaccine (injectable polio combination vaccines) and the introduction of a childhood varicella vaccination program under the National Immunisation Program.  Both programs will commence on 1 November 2005.</para>

<para>Companies were not provided with ERFs until after they had registered as tenderers and the last tenderer registered in October 2004.  On 17 August, all registered tenderers were sent, by registered mail, a CD containing the main ERFs.  Tenderers that registered subsequently were sent the ERFs CD by registered mail immediately after Coastwatch had completed the registration process.  On 22 September 2004, all tenderers registered at that time were advised by email of a requirement for a small amount of additional information to be provided by the ERFs.  Tenderers that registered later were provided with an ERFs CD that incorporated that additional requirement.</para>

<item label="(7)">
<para>Two complaints were received relating to delays in receipt of the ERFs.  The first was received on 29 September 2004 and the second was on 4 November 2004. (a) The period of delay in provision of the ERFs was 8 days. (b) Delays in provision of ERFs were caused due to the ERFs taking longer to prepare than had originally been expected.</para>

<para>The initial tender close date was extended from 28 October 2004 to 11 November 2004.  Although the ERF, as an electronic record of the tenderer’s response, could not be completed during the early stage of the tender preparation period, the extension was granted to remove any doubt about whether the delay in providing the ERFs may have affected the ability of tenderers to respond in the time available.</para>

<para>—The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The previous contractual arrangements have been in place since 1998.  Since that time the environment in which data can be sourced has changed.  Given that alternative data sources are now available, automatic renewal of the previous contractual arrangements could not be justified under the new Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines which took effect on 1 January 2005.  More broadly, it is appropriate to periodically review the need for services and how they are obtained to ensure effectiveness of supply and value for public funds.</para>
<para>(2)   (a)&amp;(b) It is not possible to calculate the net cost benefit.  Ordering of BEACH reports by the Department of Health and Ageing varies from year to year.  The cost of reports from BEACH and other data sources differs depending on the complexity and the specific data requirements and level of analysis required to meet the request.  Block pre-purchase arrangements, at least at historical levels, did not offer optimal value for money as actual demand could be below that purchased.</para>

</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>As at 29 March 2005, payments for BEACH data via the contractual arrangement with the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare totalled $2,080,000 for the six years from 1998-99 to 2003‑04. </para>
<para>        Payment for data for the period after 1 July 2004 has been agreed separately.</para>
<para>        The BEACH program has also received payments from the Department through separate purchase arrangements and specific purpose grants.  Detailed and comprehensive information on these payments cannot be provided in the time allowed.  However, preliminary indications are that additional payments outside of the contractual arrangement amounted to at least $120,000. </para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The Department has not investigated the impact that the move from a fixed contractual arrangement to a demand driven arrangement will have on BEACH.  Payments may be reduced or increased, depending on BEACH’s ability to meet the Department’s needs in competition with other suppliers. </para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>BEACH supplies data on a commercial basis, in competition with other data suppliers, and is subject to the same risks as other suppliers in that environment.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>The data available through BEACH is generally also available via other suppliers in the market.  The Department is confident that moving to a different commercially based arrangement will not compromise its ability to obtain the required data. </para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>Changes to the contractual arrangement between the Department and the AIHW for the purchase of BEACH data was an internal procurement decision.  External bodies were therefore not consulted.</para>
</item>
<item label="(8)">
<para>No.  General practice professional groups are able to purchase reports and shares directly from BEACH or any other supplier if they choose.</para>
<para>(9)   (a) to (d)  The BEACH project is collaboration between the University of Sydney and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.  The distribution of BEACH information and data to the public is a decision for these organisations. </para>

<item label="(11)">
<para>Policy and practice decisions within the Department of Health and Ageing generally rely on a number of inputs.  It is not practically possible to assemble information on projects where BEACH data may have been used, and the extent to which that data informed decisions.</para>
</item>
<item label="(12)">
<para>No.  It is unlikely that BEACH data was the deciding factor in any particular decision that resulted in savings, as policy decisions usually rely on a number of inputs.</para>
</item>
<item label="(13)">
<para>BEACH data was used in Weighted Average Monthly Treatment Cost (WAMTC) reviews on one occasion during this period (for statin group of drugs only).  WAMTC reviews which lead to changes in the prices of PBS drugs result in savings to the PBS. BEACH data per se does not directly contribute to PBS savings.  There were no savings of around $100 million for the statin group of drugs listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) in 2003-04. </para>
</item>
<item label="(14)">
<para>(a) BEACH data will be used for WAMTC reviews for the following groups of drugs for the next three years: calcium channel blockers, ace inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.  Pharmaceutical companies have agreed to submit BEACH data as part of these reviews.  If BEACH data is not available, other data sources can be used.</para>
<para>        The Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority (PBPA) has not identified any data set chosen for annual review processes as ‘the most reliable data source’.  The PBPA selects a data source based upon objective criteria which have been agreed with the industry. (b)  The impact of changes to the purchasing arrangements for BEACH data is a matter for the AIHW and the University of Sydney.  If BEACH data is not available, other data sources can be used.</para>
</item>
<item label="(15)">
<para>Decisions regarding the future development of BEACH will continue to be made by the University of Sydney and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.  How responsive they choose to be to their customer base will be a matter for them.</para>

</item>
<item label="(19)">
<para>The Department is able to access Medicare data through systems already in place.  Costing of all other data sources would have to be undertaken on a case by case basis, as different levels of customisation may be required from each source to meet the Department’s needs.</para>
</item>
<item label="(20)">
<para>The Government is aware that each data source, including BEACH, has strengths and weaknesses.  In selecting data sources, the Department will continue to consider the quality, reliability, value for money, and suitability for the intended use.</para>
