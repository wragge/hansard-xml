<para>—At this stage we are faced with a very large number of amendments. It is obvious that not all the amendments are going to be dealt with before the guillotine is applied. There will be different priorities regarding the amendments, and I am concerned that, if we now move seriatim into these, we will only get through a small proportion of them and the rest will not be debated at all. Thus, with the committee’s concurrence, we will make general contributions about the amendments that the various parties are bringing before this committee before moving to the specifics.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We only need to reiterate what a farce this committee faces. We have 3½ hours to debate not just extremely important amendments coming from the opposition and crossbenches but scores of amendments from the government itself, and they simply cannot be debated. So the Committee of the Whole is going to vote on amendments and, indeed, the legislation itself without having debated them. That is all the more poignant in view of the fact that we are talking about legislation which is to improve the security of this country and, according to the government, to balance the democratic values of this country with the right of people to have security.</para>
<para>That is not going to be balanced here. There is going to be no balance; there is going to be no adequate debate. What we have is the executive truncating the time for discussion in a way that is unprecedented in this parliament on a bill like this in the last 10 years. Moreover, the outcome of the debate is known before we get under way because every government member is going to support it and, what is more remarkable, the opposition is going to support it. The amendments will not get up. The final vote will be as the government has ordained it. That is the nature of the Senate in 2005.</para>
<para>Very early in the piece, the Greens will move an amendment to incorporate the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights into this legislation as the measure by which courts might determine the fate of anybody brought forward for infringing this new security legislation. That is, Australia has ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Prime Minister, amongst others, has said, ‘This legislation does not infringe on it.’ The Greens are saying, ‘Then let the court take note of that by having the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights incorporated into the legislation as a de facto bill of rights, and let’s also have the covenants which Australia has ratified or signed on the rights of the child and against torture brought into this legislation as well.’</para>
<para>Then there can be no doubt when a court is looking at the rights of somebody who, for example, is detained without charge over a prolonged period of time, and there is a challenge to that by lawyers who say the Australian norm has always been that a person is charged, and that a person has an opportunity to defend themselves and cannot be held for a prolonged period of time unless the charge that is made is warranted. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights makes it clear that people cannot be detained without knowing why they are being detained and without having an ability to defend themselves. The bill of rights in all countries which have bills of rights—and most countries similar to Australia do—outlines similar safeguards for citizens, but we do not have that in Australia.</para>
<para>The question to the minister is: what is the government’s objection to having the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights referred to in the legislation as a measure by which the rest of the legislation may be adjudicated? What is the problem with having the international convention against torture and cruel and unusual treatment of citizens who are held referred to in this legislation so that courts may make sure we do not infringe that obligation under that international treaty? What is the problem for the government in citing in this legislation the rights of children, internationally adhered to? If the government has no intention of allowing, and does not want, this legislation to be inconsistent with that international obligation then the test for that, whatever the argument, will be the government agreeing or disagreeing with the Green amendment.</para>
<para>What is going to happen here, however, is that the government is going to vote against the international covenants which uphold the rights of all citizens in Australia. They are a bottom line in civilised society. The government is going to vote against those being incorporated in this legislation because the Howard government knows that this legislation infringes civil and political rights by national standards let alone international standards.</para>
<para>Dr Watchirs, who upholds this measure in the ACT, which is the only jurisdiction in Australia with a bill of rights, said this to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee:</para>
<quote>
<para>The bill does not comply with the ICCPR in two main respects—the right to a fair trial and the right to liberty. Control orders may impinge on other rights, but I will concentrate on these ones. The fact that the person who is subject to a control order or preventative detention order does not have full access to the information means that they are not given a fair trial. The time frame for an ex parte control order not being limited, like seven days in the UK, but being up to a period of 12 months, depending on when the court confirms it, is also a breach of the right to a fair trial. The problem of confidentiality between a lawyer and a client in preventative detention is also a problem in relation to a fair trial. And, lastly, the lack of ability to communicate to third parties where the person is detained and the fact that they are detained under this act, goes much further than the UK act. I think the five-year penalty for breach of disclosure provisions and breach of control orders is grossly disproportionate. They are civil offences and a civil administrative process, particularly in preventative detention, and to have a criminal offence of five years is not proportionate.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What Dr Watchirs said was echoed by many other representatives coming before the committee, and we saw the advertisement from the Law Council of Australia yesterday.</para>
<para>This legislation breaches Australia’s international commitments, and the government knows it. The Prime Minister knows it. That is why the government will vote against the Green amendment to have the international covenants protecting the rights of Australians written into this legislation so that courts can make the decision about whether a person brought before the court is being treated in accordance with international conventions and a century of developing civilising law here in Australia. There is no doubt this is a reversal, an infringement, of international conventions and there is no doubt the government knows it. What is more extraordinary is that the opposition is going to support, at the end of the day, legislation which excludes reference to these conventions at the same time. That is extraordinary.</para>
<para>The remarkable fact is that we are going to get more of this further down the line. My colleague Senator Nettle will no doubt be drawing the committee’s attention to other matters. But let me say this: what a farce this Senate has been turned into by the Howard government. What a farce that we should be here today going through a process of a few hours debate on some of the most critical issues about how our democracy is defended. Australian citizens’ liberties, their freedom of speech and their right not to be detained without charge are to be stripped away without any guarantee that it is going to help defend us from terrorism. There is no guarantee at all; never has the government been able to cogently argue that this legislation is going to defend us from terrorism. Sure, it makes the bald statement but nowhere is the reasoned, logical argument that should come with that statement.</para>
<para>This legislation is a political document much more than a defence of Australians’ security document. A very dangerous slide to McCarthyism is involved in this legislation being slammed and sledgehammered through the Senate today. We are in a new period of McCarthyism and we need to know that and understand it, and to worry that this time it will not be turned around.</para>
<para>Using a law like this, citizens will be brought before courts for political reasons rather than security reasons. The reach of this law is not defined by and constricted to security. This law’s ability to truncate free speech is not defined by this legislation. We know that inherently this legislation, at the minimum, will lead to self-censorship in this country. Brains far more concentrated on this matter than the Prime Minister’s have made that abundantly clear in the public debate leading to this farce of a debate in the Senate.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister has turned this Senate into a rubber stamp—it is a Star Chamber as far as this legislation is concerned. The rights that we hold dear have been found convicted of infringing on security, as far as the Prime Minister is concerned. Australians’ ability for free-ranging and free speech has to be cut back, the Prime Minister has judged. We are now supposed to be debating whether that is a good thing or not, but the real fact of the matter is that the numbers are with the Prime Minister. What is more, he and this government claim that this is what the people of Australia want. That is not so, but it does not prevent the government from claiming that the people of Australia want their rights stripped back on trust, because there is no argument that in some way or other it is going to increase their security. We maintain that it does the reverse: it erodes the security of the Australian democracy. And we are particularly fearful of what is coming further down the line. This process has not stopped. Attorney-General Ruddock and Prime Minister Howard have more erosions of freedom coming down the line.</para>
<para>Freedom of speech, for goodness sake, is about to be taken away. And the Labor Party, which disagrees with the antisedition components, is going to vote for it. That is how manipulated this process is. I say to the Labor Party: change your mind. This is too important to signal to the government that the opposition is onside. What is more remarkable to me is that it seems that debate in the media has been shut down. Labor is onside; the government wants it—end of debate. We may well come to rue the day.</para>
<para>As far as the Greens are concerned, it is very important that people looking back on this moment know that the opposition caved in, to a government with a one-seat majority, to taking away Australians’ rights without any return defined in terms of security and to eroding those rights unnecessarily—in particular, the right to free speech and the right not to be held without charge, trial or the ability to have a defence. These are very serious matters, but this debate has been turned into a nothing, a farce and a joke. Where are the government defenders? The chamber is almost empty. I think there must be a great deal of a shame factor on the government side about the whole process. Whatever it is—</para>

</talker>
<para>—What we have today is clearly a truncated debate for the committee stage. I have been in the Senate for six years, and this is the most obscene thing I have seen this government do. To truncate an important bill such as the antiterrorism bill in such a way is to allow only a farcical way of dealing with it in the committee stage. It would have been preferable, and within the government’s ability, to ensure that we could deal in seriatim with the various amendments, go through them, put the arguments, have the debate about the issue and not about the people or the party and then move forward. That is what we have always done in this place. That is what the strength of the Senate has always been.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Instead, the government yesterday put a guillotine motion in place, which effectively cut the second reading debate short and truncated the committee stage to ensure that we would have to, on the run, come up with a way of dealing with the hundreds of amendments that are now before us. We have almost half a book from the government to deal with. As well, there are new explanatory memoranda that they have put out. There are new amendments—at the last count I think there were 74. Some of those require reasonable consideration and explanation by this government, but we are not going to get that. We are going to have to rely on the explanatory memoranda to understand what the government’s position is. Or, hopefully, in the short time available to us, Senator Ellison can run through, as quickly as he can, the way those amendments will operate. That would provide us with an opportunity—only an opportunity—to deal with some of the more substantive issues that have come through.</para>
<para>The difficulty is that, by complaining about the process, I am eating into the time available to me to talk about the substantive matters. That is the difficulty we always face, especially with a government that is so arrogant and out of touch. It is bordering on an un-Australian way of dealing with the Senate that the government has chosen to use its numbers to both guillotine and gag its way through an antiterrorism bill. It is not acceptable. It should not be done. The government has the ability to ensure that there is proper debate but has chosen not to.</para>
<para>Let us look at the major issues that came out and see what the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee found. Let us deal with them. We will look at the major issues and some of the minor issues as well. One of the major issues that the committee found was the sunset clause. This government has said that the period is 10 years. Ten years is a lifetime in politics, let me tell you. It is a farce to suggest that 10 years is a position that is going to be acceptable. The Labor Party have said—and we will move amendments to that effect, if we get the opportunity, but I will foreshadow them in any event—that a five-year sunset clause with a five-year review is a better outcome. It provides at least some certainty that (1) the legislation will be reviewed and (2) five years down the track we can look at the legislation and see whether it is still an appropriate, adapted and proportionate response to the security environment we then find ourselves in.</para>
<para>The second issue is in relation to sedition. The Labor Party have said right from day one that we oppose schedule 7. It should not be part of this process. Right from day one we have said that, in terms of the Anti-Terrorism Bill, we do recognise that there is a new security environment. We do think, unlike the Greens, that you have to take the fight to terrorists. You cannot take a backward step. You have to make sure that the people we entrust with our system to protect us and preserve our way of life have the necessary powers to ensure that they can root out these evildoers and put them behind bars and can prevent a terrorist attack so that we can have some measure of security and safety in Australia.</para>
<para>In relation to sedition we say that it was not part of COAG; it was not part of the original agreement. I suspect it is one of those things that Mr Ruddock has been kicking along, like a favourite football, rolling it along the paddock and thinking, ‘This is something that I would like to pick up and run with,’ and he has. He has flicked it up, put it under his arms at the available opportunity and decided to run with it. Well, it is not on. It should not be a part of this system, it should not be a part of this bill and Labor oppose it. We have said that from day one. We are fortified that the committee recommendations equally supported Labor’s position of saying, ‘That should not be here.’ Let us look at some of the comments that were made in the committee report. For example:</para>
<quote>
<para>Mr Laurence Maher submitted that he had in the past advocated the repeal of the existing sedition provisions under the Crimes Act because they are:</para>
<para class="block">… archaic and unnecessary and, more importantly, contrary to contemporary modern democratic principle as an unjustifiable burden on freedom of expression and freedom of association.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I think that sums it up in a very neat passage. The committee took cognisance of that and recommended that. I heard that some backbenchers got a bit divided about this issue, but at the end of the day they stuck with the government; they stuck with the line.</para>
<para>The committee did recommend an alternative, faced with the view that the government may not remove sedition. Let me make it plain: it was not an alternative in an equal sense. The first position recommended that schedule 7—sedition—be removed. The alternative was to ensure that it at least had some measure of support from the government’s own backbench. And that is what that was: a comfort recommendation for the backbench that they could slide back to, and that is in fact where they went. It was not a surprise to me to see the alternative. It is not an equal alternative. It is a backslide for the Liberal backbench who knew they would not be able to stare down Mr Ruddock. Mr Turnbull and Senator George Brandis knew they were not going to be able to stare down Mr Ruddock. They decided that the only way out was to ensure that they had a backslide position to give them a fig leaf of protection. They do not have to do that; they can take the first position. It is a much better position to adopt. Sedition is not necessary as part of this bill and should be removed.</para>
<para>The other areas that Labor has sought to amend and improve upon are not only the review and sunset provisions but also areas that I suspect Senator Bob Brown was talking about in part. He went to the issue of the ICCPR, the international obligations we have. The Labor Party takes those obligations very seriously. They exist as guiding principles to ensure that we act in a decent way. That is what they are there for. I was a participating member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and it was very pleased to hear from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, who also take very seriously those principles and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. What they said is instructive. In relation to issues regarding the right to liberty and the requirement of proportionality, they indicated:</para>
<quote>
<para>A number of commentators  have suggested that the scheme for granting PDOs—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is, preventative detention orders—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">violates the rights conferred by article 9(1) of the ICCPR, which provides ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I will not go into the quote; most people will be familiar with it. It goes to the issue of arbitrary arrest or detention. They then went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para>It is important to understand that article 9(1) does permit detention for security purposes. However, such detention must not be ‘arbitrary’. The term ‘arbitrary’ has been interpreted as requiring more than mere compliance with domestic law.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">HREOC said that the best way to deal with that particular issue was in the recommendation they made. They did not recommend in their submission to the committee that we incorporate the UN convention. In recommendation 1 of their submission—and Labor has incorporated it into its amendments because it was a committee recommendation as well—they said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Commission therefore recommends that the Bill include additional sub-clauses (in s105.4(4) and (6)), which require the issuing authority to be satisfied that the purpose for which the order is made cannot be achieved by a less restrictive means.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Liberal-National coalition have not picked that up. It is something that should be picked up. It is an amendment that we have sought, and I foreshadow that, if we get the opportunity, we will move it. It is one of those areas that provide a test of proportionality. It provides a way of ensuring that, in enacting this legislation and dealing with it, the government’s actions are proportional, appropriate and adapted to the purpose. That is what that clause does. It is one that Labor supports and will move in this committee stage. It is one that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee adopted and suggested that the Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, should pick up.</para>
<para>He has not picked it up. He has not seen fit to include it in the legislation. That is a great pity, I must say. Obviously, there would have been an improvement to the legislation if Mr Ruddock had picked up all of the committee recommendations. At the end of the day he would have been able to say that he took on board the committee recommendations, was cognisant of the committee’s work and had ensured that there were safeguards and review and oversight arrangements contained within the bill. That is not something that the Attorney-General has decided to do. However—and sometimes in the heat of these debates we miss pointing this out—he did pick up a substantive number of the amendments that the committee recommended. A significant number of amendments have been incorporated into the legislation.</para>
<para>The legislation started from the Stanhope draft—if I can call it that—where this government took an extreme position. The government then removed the shoot to kill legislation. It provided a better and much improved version than that horrible piece of drafting that we originally saw. We then moved to the position where the committee had an opportunity to hear from submitters about the new draft of the bill. The position now is that there are another 74 amendments which will move the bill further along that continuum to ensure that it is appropriate and proportionate. They will ensure that there are some safeguards.</para>
<para>Right from day one Labor have been in a position to say that we support the antiterrorism laws. We wanted to then find out how we could work to improve them to ensure that they were not going to reduce people’s liberties or impinge upon their freedom of political communication. We wanted to ensure that this type of law would not be used arbitrarily. After the committee hearing, after the government and the backbench of the Liberal Party caved in, we have arrived at a position where we have a bill that is much improved.</para>
<para>There is still more work to be done. Of the issues that Labor has said right from day one still need improvement is that there should be greater scrutiny in this place of how these laws will operate. A fundamental difficulty that always besets us is not that the law may offend but that the way it may operate or be used may offend civil liberties, freedom of political communication and UN conventions. That is why Labor has said that the antiterrorism laws should be subject to greater review in this house. We should be told every three months how they are operating. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee recommended a six-monthly report. The government have stuck to a 12-monthly report. They still have an opportunity to accept further Labor amendments, but I doubt that they will. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I take on board the comments that have been made by my colleagues. When Mr Deputy President was in the chair he asked us some process questions. I suggest that we attempt to move through the running sheet as we normally would for a debate of this kind. Before my colleagues, particularly those on the crossbenches, ask why I am doing this, let me say that it is because this bill should be subject to the usual debate, scrutiny and analysis to which we would subject any bill in the committee stage.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We have a vast array of amendments. That is undoubted. Some of those amendments are more substantial or indeed more controversial than others. I look at my own amendments, many of which were circulated last week, including the Democrat amendment seeking to attach international conventions such as the ICCPR to this legislation. These amendments are in some cases quite broad ranging. Some are in depth and some are more simple than others, but all are constructive. In many cases we have sought not merely to oppose a section or a provision in this legislation but to constructively amend that section in a way that ameliorates the worst aspects of this legislation and, hopefully, provides some safeguards, particularly in line with some of those international treaties and conventions to which my colleagues have referred.</para>
<para>My suggested process—that is, the normal one—may actually mean that we do not get to a number of amendments. I think that that is the inevitability of any truncated, gagged or guillotined debate, as this is. I am really quite content—I am not really happy about it—for the process to be exposed. This process is a farce; it is a joke. There is no point in our being here. We have circulated amendments that are sincere and serious and have a constructive impact on the bill. We are not talking about minimal legislation here. We are talking about arguably one of the most fundamental—and, without a doubt, most serious—pieces of legislation that many of us will debate in our time in the Senate. Senator Ludwig pointed out, quite rightly, that in his six years in this place this has been one of the more offensive processes that he has been involved in. I would like to say that in my 10 years in this place this is without doubt—</para>

<para>—I acknowledge that there are a couple of senators sitting on that side, including Senator Ferguson, who have been here longer. Indeed, the minister has a few years on all of us, and I am certainly not going into the question of how much longer some of us will be here, Senator Ferguson. We will wait and see what the Australian people decide, but I will tell you that they are not happy with this process. This process is a farce. This is a shameful week. Indeed, I suggest that the process that has been put forward by government—gagging debate; truncating debate; circulating amendments at the last moment; explanatory memoranda that do or do not turn up, depending on which bill you are referring to; speeches in the second reading debate for those who are lucky enough to get into the top three, four or five, the rest having to rely on the goodness of the Senate to incorporate their contributions—is positively seditious. This process is guilty of overturning fundamental principles on which the operation of our democracy and parliament rely—that is, having adequate time for debate and analysis.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The house of review is prevented from doing its job, so let us proceed as we would normally proceed: we have our debate in the committee stage and we go through a running sheet. Again, I have not seen the updated running sheet. I acknowledge that the Labor Party have circulated their amendments, but we have a considerable number of amendments that we should go through. I indicate that I had no intention of denying leave to Minister Ellison, on behalf of the government, to move his amendments in relation to clause 2. The Democrats will be supporting those amendments, as we will be supporting a number of other amendments that the government has put forward. But let us not fool ourselves. The changes that have been circulated by the government are not substantial; they are tinkering. The government has tinkered with this bill to deal with some of the dissent, rebellion and division on the back benches. I acknowledge that it is not sufficient rebellion to see people cross the floor on this issue. So the die is cast.</para>
<para>The Labor Party indicated last night how they would vote for this legislation at the second reading stage—that is, unamended legislation in terms of the sedition provisions. But I hear Senator Ludwig’s comments about schedule 7, which are supported by the Australian Democrats. We will seek to oppose—in fact, to delete—that schedule. We acknowledge that the sedition provisions are unnecessary and archaic. We do not support this dead-letter law and we will not be allowing that part of the bill to stay. Certainly the numbers are agin us, but I am glad to hear the Labor Party’s reiterated position. I know, and I am confident therefore, that that means they will oppose this legislation if that offensive schedule remains. If they do not, I have heard their justification for that too.</para>
<para>I want to put something on record, because this is a serious point and one that I am really sick and tired of having to debate. Every time someone on the crossbenches, in the Australian Democrats or elsewhere, offers a criticism of legislation such as this before us because it might involve an unprecedented or extraordinary expansion of intelligence and police powers, a challenge to a traditional legal principle, a contravention of our international human rights obligations or a contravention of, say, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, or we dare to question the role of lawyers in dealing with clients—the list goes on—the response seems to be that we are not specifically questioning the terrorist threat. We are almost accused—in fact, in some cases we are downright accused—of practically supporting terrorism.</para>
<para>Even the comments today about people not taking the terror threat seriously are offensive, because one can argue for necessary powers, proportionate powers, to deal with that evil that confronts us—an evil of which all of us are aware, if not familiar with—but that does not mean that we cannot argue for proportionality in a bill such as this, including safeguards to protect legal principles, human rights and, yes, civil liberties. Being a civil libertarian in this place is apparently bad now. I am very proud to be a civil libertarian, but I have always recognised that certain rights—privacy rights, for example—have to be balanced. They are not absolute. Of course they are not absolute; very few rights are. It is all about balance. This bill does not have balance, but our attempts to try and balance it are a waste of time today.</para>
<para>I am quite happy for us to move through the schedule, and when the whistle blows the whistle blows and we will be through merely—I do not know; does anyone want to take a guess—half-a-dozen or a few amendments. There are amendments that deserve hours of debate. I am not joking about that. I am not talking about filibustering debate; I am talking about serious debate. If we get to two, three, 10 or 20 amendments, let the record show—let the legacy of this place reveal it—that this legislation was not subject to proper debate and scrutiny, just like the other legislation that will be dealt with in this black week of the Australian Senate. The first lot of Democrat amendments will deal with the sunset provision to which Senator Ludwig has already referred. I acknowledge that Labor’s amendment, or the proposal of the committee, to halve a sunset provision—remember, it is a sunset provision that does not refer to everything in this bill—from 10 years to five years is a good start, but I do not think it goes far enough.</para>
<para>To pick up Senator Ludwig’s point about the six years he has been in parliament, I want to make a point—and I do so quite seriously—about how many of us would still be here, judging by what has happened in the past, if we did review this legislation in 10 years. In the last 10 years, certainly since I came into this place, 63 people have come in—not all have stayed—and some have gone. That gives you an idea of the incredibly high turnover in this place. I am not suggesting that it necessarily has to be the same senators reviewing legislation all the time, but doesn’t that give us an idea of some of the issues dealing with consistency and knowledge of legislation? I would have thought that gives us a very clear idea that 10 years is just stratospheric. It is just a ridiculous time frame, and the government knows it. The Senate committee knew it too, and that is why we recommend differently.</para>
<para>The Democrat amendments that come up immediately after the clause 2 amendments proposed by the government deal with the sunset clauses and what we think is a more moderate and appropriate proposal, and that is within the life of the parliament—essentially, a three-year time frame. That time frame deals with control orders, with preventative detention orders and with stop, search and question powers as well. Three years is a much more appropriate time frame, not just given the issues of consistency but given the extraordinary and unprecedented powers that we are talking about in this bill.</para>
<para>Remember, this bill deals with a 10-year sunset clause that will only apply to preventative detention orders, control orders and police stop, search and question powers. A decade is too long a period to deal with these issues, especially for such intrusive and controversial law. It must not be allowed to continue for 10 years without appropriate analysis, review and reflection. But we will seek through our amendments to see that all schedules of the bills cease to have an effect in three years, with the exception, of course, of schedule 7, which, as we know, has a separate review sunset clause provision.</para>
<para>The next set of Democrat amendments will relate to the human rights obligations. As my colleagues in the committee process heard, I was particularly interested in recommendations from organisations like PIAC and HREOC in relation to attaching international covenants and conventions such as the ICCPR, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. I would like to attach those three particular conventions to this bill, as I said in my second reading debate comments yesterday, not because I think it would be necessarily a restraining force on government, because it does not have any impact. It does not necessarily stop the government undermining human rights or civil liberties, but it reminds the government of what they are doing. It is one way for us to at least assess this legislation and any rights that are potentially breached or are being abrogated through this bill. It makes clear, against that international framework, what is going wrong and what is taking place.</para>
<para>Those were some of the Democrat amendments in this early stage of the legislation. I do suggest that the idea of us having to accommodate the guillotine, while necessary, is offensive. I do not think we should pretend that we are going to try and discuss all the controversial stuff and get it over and done with because the government have truncated the debate. I want us to do this properly. And if the government stop this debate then let the record show that. I do not see any willingness from the government to seriously consider these changes. I do not think they have really given us time to seriously consider their own changes to the legislation—the government amendments that are before us. There are wads of amendments and explanatory memoranda. Yes, most of us are involved in the committee stage, but the process is a joke. I say that with no humour—I think it is a really sad day. I ask the minister: how is that response to the Law Council going? Have they got a response yet to their letter? I was just wondering if the government would like to outline some of their response to that particular letter. The full-page advertisement that appeared yesterday from the Law Council makes very clear not only the problems with the process but with policy. What is the government’s response?<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para class="block">In view of Senator Stott Despoja’s exhortations to get on with the amendments, I think we should. We have heard much debate in relation to the lack of time and we have seen some 50 minutes used for general comments. I had thought Senator Brown was going to offer something useful in relation to how we might deal with amendments in the committee stage, but no assistance was forthcoming, and I am quite accustomed to that from Senator Brown. His remarks were disingenuous in that he showed that he was not interested in effectively dealing with these amendments. Senator Ludwig at least put forward Labor’s view of where they thought the important issues lay and he addressed different aspects of the amendments. That was of some assistance to the committee stage; Senator Brown’s contribution, alas, was of none.</para>
<para>Senator Stott Despoja said that we should get on with dealing with the amendments and told us that repeatedly. Can I say at the outset that the government is appreciative of the great work done by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and that, of its recommendations—in excess of 50—in excess of 20 were accepted in full or in part. Of course there are proposed amendments by the government, and I want to correct something that Senator Stott Despoja said. Those amendments by the government were circulated yesterday—it is not as if they have just been circulated now. They were circulated yesterday, which has given senators adequate time to address them. In fact, they were circulated well before some others which have been circulated in the chamber today.

<para>The Attorney-General has agreed to implement many of the Senate recommendations for direct reference in the explanatory memorandum which is accompanying this bill. One of these recommendations is that body searches be carried out by police officers of the same sex as the person being searched. While the reference to body searches is misleading insomuch as the type of searches permitted under this bill are simple frisk searches, the Attorney-General has agreed to implement this recommendation through a legislative amendment at the next available opportunity. The purpose of the amendment will be to make this provision consistent with similar search provisions in other legislation. That is a matter that was raised by Senator Ludwig, I think, and I just want to place that on the record.</para>
<para>In relation to government amendments (1) and (2), as I started to say earlier, these amend the commencement table in clause 2 of the bill for those provisions in proposed schedule 9 that deal with the inclusion of customer information with international funds transfer instructions and the registration of remittance service providers. To ensure sufficient time before the commencement of the amendments to items 5 and 10 of proposed schedule 9 of the bill, recommendation 50 of the Senate committee was that the commencement provision of the bill be amended to provide that those amendments can commence on a date to be proclaimed. It is not usual to leave the commencement date completely open. The commencement, however, has been extended from proclamation or six months to proclamation or 12 months. Those provisions will commence either on proclamation or, if this does not occur within 12 months of royal assent, they will commence the day after the expiry of this 12-month period. I believe that is in accordance with what the Senate committee recommended. I commend those two amendments to the committee and look forward to dealing with the other amendments in an expeditious manner without debate which, can I say, has been extraneous to this point from some of the speakers we have heard previously.</para>

<para>—Three hours before this legislation is guillotined through the Senate, I thank you for giving me the call. As one of the 13 senators who was involved in this Senate inquiry, I did not have the opportunity yesterday to give a speech in the second reading debate on this legislation because the government has gagged and guillotined this legislation through the parliament. We had the second reading vote, which was, of course, supported by the opposition. So I will take this opportunity now, in the 15 minutes that I have got, to make my contribution. Because I know that we will not have the opportunity to fully debate and discuss all of the over 100 amendments in this committee stage, I will choose to spend the 15 minutes that I have got discussing the crux of this legislation—that is, detention without trial or charge.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I will not get to discuss or debate proposed schedule 4 of the bill and a Greens amendment later on, so I will speak now about the fact that this legislation, for the very first time in Australia’s criminal law, will allow people to be detained without trial or charge. We have already got that in immigration detention. People are locked up in immigration detention without being taken before a court, without being charged. In our immigration law, this government allows detention without trial and detention without charge. We have all seen the scandals that have been created by allowing this to occur. People are locked up and maybe some questions are asked; maybe they get the opportunity to go before a court on very limited grounds down the track. That is what is being proposed for the very first time in criminal law.</para>
<para>It is a massive, monumental and significant step that this government is taking. Because it is so significant, we have seen a full-page advertisement in Australian newspapers from the Law Council representing lawyers across this country. It says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Law Council particularly objects to the introduction of control orders and preventative detention orders.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is, detention without trial. When the president of the Law Council was asked on ABC radio yesterday what concerns him most about this legislation, he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The control orders and preventative detention which allow Australians to be taken off the street and held for up to 14 days and have their liberty curtailed for up to a year without charge. In other words, there is insufficient evidence to charge them and that makes a class of people unknown to the Australian law.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He goes on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We are most concerned because it is going to take abuse and misabuse of these laws by the police forces, and/or spy agencies, before people realise what rights they have allowed this government to take, with the opposition right behind the government. They will notice only when something goes wrong.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is the president of the Law Council expressing his concerns on the detention without charge or trial that is being introduced for the first time ever into our criminal law.</para>
<para>I have spoken on this in here before. In fact, I had to incorporate my speech in the second reading debate which talked about the Magna Carta and the 800 years in which our legal system and legal systems around the world have been based on the concept that people should only have their liberty taken away from them if they are charged and brought before a court and a jury. I quoted from the Law Council advertisement in yesterday’s newspapers in the chamber yesterday and I will read it out again. I have three quotes. One of them is by Winston Churchill. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The power of the executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to the law, and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers, is in the highest degree odious and is the foundation of all totalitarian governments whether Nazi or Communist.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is exactly what this legislation does. It allows for people to be locked up without charge, without the opportunity to go before their peers for 14 days, or for their liberty to be curtailed for 12 months.</para>
<para>This legislation for the very first time brings into Australian law concepts such as house arrest. Australians are not very familiar with the concept of house arrest. I spoke at a rally to mark the more than 10 years that Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the democracy movement in Burma, has been held under house arrest by the military dictatorship. Members of the Burmese community who are now living in Australia came up and talked to me about this legislation because they understand well the impact of house arrest. This legislation allows for somebody—whomever it may be—to experience over 10 years of house arrest. It says that people can be locked up under house arrest for 12 months under these control orders. Then, when that control order lapses, another one can come into force, and another and another. That is what the military dictatorship in Burma has done to the leader of the democracy movement, whose party won the elections in 1990, and that is what this legislation gives the Australian government the power to do now or in the future.</para>
<para>During the Senate inquiry process there were government senators who support this legislation who asked: ‘Why do you keep focusing on the negatives? Why do you keep focusing on the fact that people can be detained for 12 months under house arrest?’ The reason we keep focusing on that is that it is in the legislation. I am not saying that the first time the government use this legislation they are going to lock up a democracy activist for 10 years. But I know, because it is written there in black letter law, that the government have the power to do that. That is what this legislation does, and that is why we have heard, time and time again, how concerned lawyers across this country are about this legislation.</para>
<para>A mother will come to one of these lawyers and say, ‘I want you to represent my son, who has been locked up under one of these orders.’ That lawyer will not be allowed in there for the first 48 hours of this person being arrested. They will not be able to be there when they start the process of questioning, which they may well do. That lawyer will not be able to get the reasons and rationale for why their client has been detained, and that lawyer’s argument against their client being locked up will be significantly restricted in any court that they are able to go to. Effectively, all that is left for that lawyer to do is to go to a court and say, ‘My client has been locked up.’ The judge will ask, ‘Why is that?’ The lawyer will reply: ‘I don’t know. They won’t tell me. They say he is a terrorist risk. I can’t get any information about it.’ How can a lawyer take a case of somebody being deprived of their liberty or locked up away from any contact with family and friends if they do not even know why this is being done? It is similar to the case of Scott Parkin. His lawyers were not given the information about why he was deported from this country because there are already in place, supported by both the major parties, laws that mean that lawyers cannot access the information and the reason that their client is being deported or locked up.</para>
<para>That is what exists right now. That is what happened to Scott Parkin. He left this country and his lawyers did not know why. That is what this legislation will do. It will say people can be locked up, people can have their liberties taken away, their lawyers cannot know why and their lawyers cannot go before the full range of courts to argue the case against them. No wonder lawyers in this country are upset. They know that they are going to have to represent their clients without the full weight of the law or all the tools of legal profession because this legislation will restrict them. It will take away their capacity to go to particular courts; it will take away their capacity to find out what has happened to their clients; it will take away their capacity to argue their client’s case in court. No wonder the lawyers are upset. When we see them printing these advertisements and talking about people being locked away and not getting to come before a court, we cannot help but think of other Australians who face these same dilemmas—people like David Hicks who are taken away, who are not brought before a court and who are not able to have their lawyers represent them. These are the kinds of powers in this legislation and that is why the lawyers are concerned. That is why they flagged the concerns of Robert Menzies, Winston Churchill and others.</para>
<para>I will quote again from John North, the president of the Law Council. He was asked yesterday on ABC radio about whether the world had changed in the past five years and, when it comes to conflicts, whether some rights have to be suspended for the greater good. Here is the answer from John North. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Look, the world goes through periodic changes where we have greater and lesser threats. Look at the quotes there—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He is referring to the quotes from Winston Churchill and Robert Menzies in the advertisement—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">from those people, who have lived through far, far greater threats to humanity than we face at the moment with terrorism, and they all recognise the need to hang on to your fundamental laws and to rely on a robust criminal justice system that is operating.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They are not my words; they are the words of the president of the Law Council of Australia. That is why it is important that the chamber today supports the Australian Greens amendment, which is No. 3 on the list of amendments. I let the committee know now that we will be dividing on that amendment. We will be dividing on the issue of whether or not this Senate believes that, for the very first time in Australia’s history, we should bring into our criminal law the capacity to detain people without charge or trial and to take away the rights of their lawyers to defend them in those circumstances. For the Australian Greens, that is one of our most significant amendments, and we will be asking the chamber to support us when we get to the guillotine vote on that amendment. I indicate that the Australian Greens will call for the Senate to divide on amendment No. 3 on Greens sheet 4755 because we want to ask the chamber, ‘Do you support detention without trial?’</para>
<para>We know that the government and the opposition support detention without trial of asylum seekers, because that is what operates in this country. We want to ask the Senate, ‘Do you support detention without trial and the taking away of the right to a lawyer?’ I take this opportunity, because it is the only one I have had in this debate, to indicate that the Senate will be dividing on that amendment and the Greens will be holding strong to a principle that has existed for over 800 years in the Magna Carta and around the globe. The basis of our legal system, the Magna Carta, is just upstairs on the second level of this building if anyone wants to go and have a look at it. That is what our legal system is based on. We do not want to see that ripped up. We want to support and uphold it. That is why we are moving this amendment—because we do not support detention without trial.</para>

<para>—Since September 11, 2001, catapulted us into a new era of global terrorism, the opposition has worked tirelessly to make sure that Australia has both the laws to protect human life and the safeguards to protect civil liberties. In the last parliament we were determined to make sure that any legislation that became law would get the balance right. When the government presented slapdash, poorly drafted legislation, we helped them out. We sought the views of experts. We consulted the community. We corrected the government’s mistakes. We amended and improved their proposed legislation. In this parliament, however, the government has complete control. No longer can the Senate or the Senate’s committee system clean up the government’s mess. The Howard government is still presenting slapdash, poorly drafted legislation, but the Senate is powerless to correct it. The Australian people are going to be faced with the consequences.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The <inline ref="R2469">Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline> contains extraordinary measures. The government’s failure to adequately justify or defend those measures is also extraordinary. Under international conventions, which Australia has signed, there must be an actual or imminent emergency threatening the life of the nation to justify measures this extreme. Suspending basic rights such as freedom from arbitrary detention demands a very high bar of justification. The Howard government has not even come close. The terrorism alert level has been set at medium since 2001. It has never been set at high or extreme.</para>
<para>Nor has the government made any case proving the inadequacy of our existing laws. It is to the contrary. After the recent raids and arrests in Sydney and Melbourne—conducted with the existing legislative framework, of course—AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty appeared on <inline font-style="italic">The 7.30 Report</inline>. This was on 8 November last month—less than a month ago. In response to Kerry O’Brien’s question:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... does it demonstrate that current powers are adequate?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Commissioner Keelty said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Well, I think they are ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">On 19 May this year at the hearing into the operation of ASIO’s existing powers, Dennis Richardson, then Director-General of ASIO, was asked by Senator Robert Ray:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... are you arguing for any increased powers in the existing legislation ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Richardson’s answer was quite unambiguous: ‘No,’ he said. Then Senator Ray asked him:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Director-General, you are satisfied that the existing powers equip you to do the job you need to do?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Again, Mr Richardson’s answer was quite clear and unambiguous: ‘Yes,’ he said. I am not surprised that Mr Richardson was satisfied with the existing powers. After all, ASIO have reported that they have not even needed to use the existing detention powers. If ASIO are not using the detention powers they have, why is the government creating new, unprecedented powers and new, unprecedented offences? The government has made no case for a new extraordinary danger and no case for the inadequacy of existing laws and measures?</para>
<para>The Howard government cannot or will not give the Australian people a good enough reason that this bill should contain extreme measures such as the new sedition provisions. I will tell you one obvious reason why we are here today debating these laws that will strip Australians’ hard-won and precious civil liberties and freedoms. That obvious reason is the government’s enthusiastic participation in the invasion and occupation of Iraq. I have said before, and I want to say again in today’s debate, that Australia’s involvement in the Iraq war has made our country less safe. Australia’s involvement in Iraq has increased the risk that Australians at home and abroad face. It has increased the risk that Australians at home and abroad will be the targets of politically motivated violence.</para>
<para>Don’t take my word for it. Take the word of Dennis Richardson, former Director-General of ASIO; of AFP Commissioner, Mick Keelty; of Dr Rohan Gunaratna, head of terrorism research at Singapore’s Institute for Defence and Strategic Studies; of New South Wales Police Commissioner, Ken Moroney; of Victoria’s Deputy Commissioner, Operations, Bill Kelly; of Clive Williams, Director of Terrorism Studies, ANU; of ONA and ASIO reports; of the former chief of the Defence Force, the late Admiral Alan Beaumont; of another former CDF, General Peter Gration; of Richard Woolcott, former Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; of Admiral Mike Hudson, former Chief of the Navy; of Vice-Admiral Sir Richard Peek, former Chief of the Navy; of Air Marshal Ray Funnell, former Chief of the Air Force; of Major-General Alan Stretton, former Director-General of the National Disaster Organisation; and of Paul Barratt, former Secretary of the Department of Defence. All these people have said in the past two years that Australia’s involvement in the Iraq war has increased the terrorist risk to our nation and our people.</para>
<para>John Howard refuses to acknowledge this. He refuses to acknowledge this self-evident truth. John Howard, the man wholly and solely responsible for Australia being in Iraq, will not level with the Australian people and tell them what the consequences of our involvement in Iraq are. What makes this whole fiasco worse is that the involvement which has put Australians at greater risk was based on a lie. The government’s response is the deeply flawed and poorly conceived legislation before us today.</para>
<para>A government has a responsibility to maintain order and uphold the law. A government has a responsibility to protect the lives and property of its citizens. And a government has an obligation to respect the human rights and civil liberties of its citizens. This dual duty to protect and to respect is not some novel creation of the post September 11 age. The struggle to restrain the power of the state with laws that safeguard the rights of citizens is a long one and it has been fought through times darker and more dangerous than our own. Time and time again our history has shown that when a government is allowed to ignore its citizens’ liberties in the pursuit of public safety then that government itself ultimately threatens both liberty and safety.</para>
<para>This slipshod legislation makes only the briefest and most cynical gestures towards fulfilling the duty to protect and to respect. Too busy chasing a brief advantage they find in the politics of fear, the Howard government has barely pretended to try to get the legislation and the balance right. In the past the Senate has done that job for them, but no longer. Now John Howard has complete control in the Senate there is no check on his cynicism. There is no check on his arrogance. Hard-won and much-prized civil liberties will be the price.</para>

<para class="block">In particular, I recognise that many in the community have a deep and abiding concern for the implications of the bill.</para>
<para class="block">And rightly so.</para>
<para class="block">The provisions of the bill give powers to our state and federal police services and intelligence agencies that have few precedents in Australian legal history.</para>
<para class="block">Detention Orders, control orders and expanded stop, question and search powers and the restrictions that surround them are not usually part of our criminal justice system.</para>
<para class="block">I agree that these represent significant intrusions on our liberties as Australian citizens.</para>
<para class="block">They curtail rights of movement, association, speech and legal process that we in this democracy have taken for granted ever since responsible government in the 19th century.</para>
<para class="block">Because these liberties are our birthright, and they are the very foundation of our democracy we should not quickly, easily or carelessly give them up.</para>
<para class="block">To stand in this great chamber of democracy and pass laws that clearly restrict the liberty of the citizen is something I do only very reluctantly.</para>
<para class="block">Indeed, it is my view that we could only justify doing so if we satisfy two tests.</para>
<para class="block">First, that adequate safeguards have been put in place to ensure that there are no abuses of the extraordinary powers given to the police and other agencies, and</para>
<para class="block">Second, that there is a compelling and justifiable reason to give up our rights.</para>
<para class="block">I am persuaded that these conditions have been met in relation to the bill.</para>
<para class="block">With regards to safeguards the bill is immeasurably improved from the time it first came to my attention.</para>
<para class="block">Over the last two months my Coalition party colleagues and senators from all sides of the chamber have done a remarkable job to improve the bill.</para>
<para class="block">I won’t go into the detail Mr President, but judicial and administrative processes, rights to legal representation, conditions of control and detention, oversight by the Ombudsman and the Inspector General for Intelligence and Security, opportunities for review and oversight, defences to the sedition provisions and more.</para>
<para class="block">I know some will argue that the safeguards do not go far enough.</para>
<para class="block">That the balance struck between the preservation of rights and the need for new and invasive powers leans too far in the direction of invasion. And consequentially the cost is too great.</para>
<para class="block">Certainly the sedition provisions need further attention. I am delighted the Attorney-General has agreed to review them and trust it will be speedy.</para>
<para class="block">But the bill has to been seen as a package and as such I believe that overall it strikes the right balance.</para>
<para class="block">The second issue, Mr President is the threat. Do we face so serious a challenge to our national security as to justify the compromises we are being forced to make with our rights and liberties?</para>
<para class="block">Well no doubt men and women of goodwill could disagree on this subject, but to my mind the answer is clear.</para>
<para class="block">We now live in an era of growing insecurity. There are of course many sources of this insecurity but one of the most visible and dangerous is undoubtedly the al Qaeda network with its bloody commitment to the use of terrorism to achieve its goals.</para>
<para class="block">Al Qaeda confronts us with a threat unlike any in our recent history.</para>
<para class="block">It presents us with the modern face of international terrorism</para>
<para class="block">Earlier this year, the US State Department’s National Counter-terrorism Centre reported that in 2005 651 significant terrorism incidents. Resulted in 9000 injuries and 651 deaths.</para>
<para class="block">No doubt 2005 will be an equally bloody year in this grim record.</para>
<para class="block">Some of the places where the attacks have occurred in recent years are very familiar to us:—London, Madrid, Jakarta and Bali.</para>
<para class="block">Others are less so: the Yemen, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia to name but a few.</para>
<para class="block">Whether near or far, the names remind us that terrorism is a global phenomenon and if the terrorists decide to strike, few places are immune from their reach.</para>
<para class="block">The source of this threat is the same everywhere.</para>
<para class="block">It is Osama bin Laden’s al Qaeda’s global network of Islamic fundamentalists whose radical jihadist agenda would see the world transformed to its own image.</para>
<para class="block">But the al Qaeda network of today is very different from that perpetrated the 9/11 attacks in the US.</para>
<para class="block">That al Qaeda was a hierarchical unitary organisation. It had a clear centre of gravity in Afghanistan and all the hallmarks of a rather lumbering bureaucracy.</para>
<para class="block">Much of that organisation has now been destroyed.</para>
<para class="block">Leaders killed capture or arrested Training Bases discovered and destroyed Weapons seized along with manuals, tapes and great deal of propaganda material.</para>
<para class="block">All testifying to bin Laden’s murderous intentions.</para>
<para class="block">The threat we face today is very different.</para>
<para class="block">Bin Laden and his henchmen have engineered a remarkable transformation of their organisation.</para>
<para class="block">Shown themselves to be frighteningly resilient, flexible and adaptable.</para>
<para class="block">As a result they still represent a very formidable threat.</para>
<para class="block">It is not a threat that we face alone. It is threat that confronts many states.</para>
<para class="block">Hoffman in evidence before US congress recently argued that the al Qaeda movement had now reconstituted itself into four distinct elements</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>Al Qaeda Central: the remnants of the pre 9/11 al Qaeda organisation. It is believed this hardcore remains centred in and around Pakistan and continues to exert some coordination in mounting attacks, collecting intelligence, planning operations and approving their execution.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Al Qaeda Affiliates and Associates: these are the formally established insurgent groups who have benefited from bin Laden’s largesse or spiritual guidance and received training, arms and money: Groups like Abu Masab al Zarqawi’s force ion Iraq, Jemaah Islamiya in Southeast Asia and Laskar-e-Tayyiba.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Al Qaeda locals: an amorphous group of al Qaeda adherents likely to have some previous terrorism experience in places like Chechnya and Algeria and therefore some direct connection with al Qaeda.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Al Qaeda Network: these are the home grown Islamic radicals who have no direct connection with al Qaeda, but are nevertheless willing to carry out terrorist attacks in solidarity with or support of al Qaeda radical agenda.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">The last of these categories is the newest of al Qaeda’s incarnations. It adds a fresh and very worrying dimension to the terrorist threat.</para>
<para class="block">It was terrorism in this group that helped conduct the Madrid bombings, who killed Theo Van Gough in the Netherlands in November 2004 and perpetrated the London attacks in July this year.</para>
<para class="block">As Hoffman remarks, they are identified by a deep commitment to their faith -admiration of bin Laden and the cathartic blow he struck against the US on 9/11, a shared sense of enmity and grievance towards the United States and a profoundly shared sense of alienation from their host nations.</para>
<para class="block">It is easy to suggest that all of this remote from Australia and its interests.</para>
<para class="block">Of course Bali, London and Jakarta tell us otherwise –Australians were casualties.</para>
<para class="block">Beyond those attacks though, we have declarations from the al Qaeda itself stating that Australia is a target.</para>
<para class="block">On 22 May 2003, Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden’s top lieutenant, calls on Muslims to ‘burn the ground under the feet’ of Western crusaders and urges Muslims to attack the embassies and commercial interests of the US, Britain, Australia and Norway.</para>
<para class="block">On 10 August 2005, an English speaking man with an apparent Australian accent, appears in a videotaped message calling for war on the West.</para>
<para class="block">The threat may not be imminent, and it maybe a low priority. But on the basis of these statements we would utterly foolish if we did not regard it as is real and credible.</para>
<para class="block">Faced with this threat, I am very aware that some of the 300,000 Muslims who now live in Australia feel apprehensive and uneasy. Indeed some, I believe have been subject to disgraceful racial abuse.</para>
<para class="block">There can be no excuse for this behaviour.</para>
<para class="block">There is precious little evidence that Muslims in Australia feel the kind of disaffection and alienation from society that exists among some Muslims groups in countries in western Europe</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>We are fortunate that overwhelmingly Muslims in Australia are anything but disaffected.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>They make a significant contribution to Australian society.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Overwhelmingly, they are decent law abiding citizens who are rightly appalled by the monstrous acts of terror committed in the name of Islam.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>I suspect that many would wish to have removed from among their ranks, the people who so disgracefully bring Islam into disrepute.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">But we have to be realistic and acknowledge that there may be some whatever their faith who sympathise with al Qaeda and would be happy to act as agents of terror.</para>
<para class="block">What is a government to do? Ignore the danger? Neglect the threat? Hope that it might go way?</para>
<para class="block">None of those things. It does what any responsible government must do and pursue policies that will help protect its citizens by offering us some chance of preventing an attack before it materialises.</para>
<para class="block">That is the intent of this bill.</para>
<para class="block">I will be the first to acknowledge that this alone or by itself is not an adequate counter terrorism strategy. It doesn’t come any where near it.</para>
<para class="block">It is only a small part of what we will have to do before al Qaeda is defeated and the scourge of terrorism brought to an end.</para>
<para class="block">Not least any strategy must address the factors that cause the despair and destructive visions that cause people to embrace rather than reject al Qaeda and its bloody strategy.</para>
<para class="block">This bill is part of the strategy</para>
<para class="block">Like all senators, I hope the powers it gives to the government will only ever need to be used sparingly, better still, let us hope that they will never shave to be used.</para>
<para class="block">Though on present evidence that seems unlikely.</para>
<para class="block">But if the powers are never used we will all be relieved and grateful.</para>
<para class="block">Let us hope that is the case.</para>
<para class="block">In the meantime, let us make sure we are prepared.</para>
<para class="block">Let us do everything that is reasonably acceptable in our democracy to avoid the spectacle of a terrorist attack on our own soil.</para>
<para class="block">I commend the bill to the senate.</para>

<para>—I would like to flag at the outset that I would like the government, before this committee is finished, to follow up on the asservation by Mr McDonald from Attorney-General’s during the committee hearings that a request was made by the Director of Public Prosecutions to the government on 30 March this year to change the word ‘the’ to ‘a’, and that that request was repeated after the London bombings in July. It is extremely important for a government that says that it is essential that we have new laws, and that the old ones are not good enough, to tell us—and I would like the minister to do so before the day is out—why it took until last month for that change to be made. That was done at a time when it was hazardous, to say the least, and compromising, to say the obvious, to police operations and surveillance for this highly publicised change of ‘the’ to ‘a’, requiring the recall of the Senate, to be made through the Prime Minister’s request. It is a very serious matter. It comes out of the inquiry. I want to know why, when the request was made by the DPP last March, the government did not take action through any of the changes to the Crimes Act that have been made since then to make the simple change of ‘the’ to ‘a’ without compromising the police action in the way we saw last month.</para>

</amendments>
<para class="block">In my second reading contribution and my first contribution in this committee debate, I touched on the issue of the sunset provisions. I am conscious of the recommendations of the Senate committee and indeed of the comments that have been made by Senator Ludwig on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, but the amendments that I am moving on behalf of the Democrats effectively amend the operation of the sunset clauses in the legislation. We believe, as I have stated previously, that the sunset clauses as they currently stand are entirely inadequate.</para>
<para>The bill currently contains a 10-year sunset clause that will deal with only preventative detention orders, control orders and police stop, search and question powers. The Australian Democrats believe that 10 years is far too long a period of time. We believe that for a number of reasons. Specifically, because this legislation is so broad ranging, because it has such deleterious impacts on human rights and civil liberties, including some fundamental freedoms and legal principles that we have come to accept in a democracy and in our country in particular, because it has an intrusive nature, and because of the controversial nature of these provisions and the bill as a whole, we believe that 10 years is far too long a period of time for this legislation to operate without due consideration, without reflection and without some kind of review by the parliament.</para>
<para>Instead of the sunset clauses that have been proposed by the government in this legislation, the Democrats are seeking to amend the legislation so that all schedules of the bill will cease to have effect in three years time. That is the equivalent of the life of a parliament, so we believe that it is not an unreasonable or inappropriate period of time for a sunset clause to operate. I put again on record the obvious exception, and that relates to schedule 7. The Australian Democrats recognise that that has a separate sunset clause or review provision. Indeed, it is a schedule that we oppose in general anyway.</para>
<para>The first amendment seeks to amend section 104.3(2) of the bill to decrease the sunset clause that applies to control orders from 10 years to three years. The amendment dealing with preventative detention amends section 105.5(3) and seeks to reduce the 10-year sunset clause there to three years. In relation to the sunset clause on the stop, question and search powers, we seek to amend section 3UK so that that sunset clause changes from 10 years to three years. We have made clear a number of times why the bill deserves reflection, examination and analysis in at most three years, which is pretty comparable to the life of a parliament. We commend those amendments to the Senate and hope that they will have support from at least the crossbenches and the other non-government parties, even though we recognise the numbers in this place and that the amendments do not have the support of the coalition.</para>

<para>—One of the issues that Senator Stott Despoja mentioned was dealing with the amendments in seriatim, but because we are in the Committee of the Whole we can move to the amendments that we want to deal with. That is partly why I went to what I consider to be the most serious amendments that Labor are moving in the opportunity that I had to address the Senate during the committee stage. Those amendments are those that we want to put to the government and have them blink over—although we suspect and know that they will not.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The other amendments are still equally important, and if we have an opportunity to argue those in due course, we will. But I did not want to be in the position of not being able to put these serious issues before the Senate. I wanted to put them so that the public will be aware upon reflection somewhere down the track that the Labor Party moved substantive amendments to ameliorate the effects of this legislation, in line with the committee report, in addition to those that the government moved, and that we argued for those here, notwithstanding the government’s truncated committee stage.</para>
<para>In respect of the amendments that Senator Stott Despoja has moved, we have taken the view of the joint committee. The committee arrived at a reasonable review period. They did not arrive at that without some consideration of the issues involved. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD and the Sheller review both came to the view that there should be a five-year review, with a sunset clause, for that legislation. There is a view that five years will allow sufficient time for these matters to be worked through to see whether they fail or work and whether there are deficiencies. I have no doubt that the government will rectify any serious matters that are deficient in any event.</para>

<para>—Yes. I am perhaps a bit more confident about that than you might be. I am talking about serious procedural flaws that may not allow the legislation to operate as intended. We already have government amendments which address that in part. The government have sought to put amendments that look like they correct an oversight of theirs, and I will deal with that later. When you look at this legislation, the five-year review that the Labor Party have sought is a better position. We will hopefully move amendments to that effect. We think those amendments will allow the legislation to operate as intended. If there are serious flaws, they will come to light.</para>

<para>—My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. I refer the minister to her comments in question time yesterday, when she indicated that she would make further inquiries about Mr Oday Adnan al-Tekriti—in particular the issue of whether he had been involved in war crimes in Iraq, as has been suggested in the media. Is the minister now able to provide any additional information to the Senate about the status of these claims or any other claims against Mr al-Tekriti? Can the minister also indicate whether either she or her department have any continuing concerns about the decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that allowed Mr al-Tekriti to remain in Australia?</para>

</talker>
<para>—I thank the senator for the question. In particular, I thank the senator for pointing out in her question that what Mr al-Tekriti is accused of is as reported or suggested in the media. I take it that the senator, with her background in law, is making it very clear that she does not accept at face value allegations made through the media—nor, for that matter, does the government. The senator has asked me whether I have any more information on that matter. As at today, no. Any more information that I might be able to get in relation to that matter will of course take some time to obtain. If I had it today, it would imply that I had it yesterday or the day before.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The situation in relation to Mr al-Tekriti is, as was explained here yesterday and has been explained by the Prime Minister in the other place, namely that the immigration department did have some concerns. They are not properly reported as being ‘Immigration found that he had perpetrated crimes against humanity’. The immigration department is not charged with the task of making such a finding. As the senator would know, that is the province of courts, not immigration departments—and, in particular, not individual officials within immigration departments.</para>
<para>Nonetheless, it is fair to say that the decision maker had concerns and refused a visa. The refusal was then taken to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. As was indicated yesterday, we were not happy with that and did in fact lodge an appeal, but after a period of time—and I am not sure how long that period was at this point—it became clear, as a consequence of legal advice, that that appeal would not succeed. It may well be a matter that goes to points of law rather than issues of fact. Nonetheless, it is fair to say that the department’s decision was overturned. There will be further inquiries in relation to this matter. Mr al-Tekriti now has a temporary protection visa.</para>
<para>There were many who criticised temporary protection visas, but I imagine at this point they are quite happy that we have them, because at the expiration of the term of his temporary protection visa or at any such time prior to that, should we come into possession of information which would enable us to successfully cancel the visa, we would probably be able to do it. I say ‘probably’, Senator Kirk, because some of your colleagues, before launching this campaign, did not turn their minds to the non-refoulement obligations in relation to people who seek refugee protection. What I mean by that is that it may well be by the hand of people involved in publicising this that, whether or not such information is found, it may be very difficult to return Mr al-Tekriti.</para>

<para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Does the minister have and has she sought at any time to use any powers under the Migration Act or involve herself in any other way in the handling of the al-Tekriti case? Given that the minister has in the past used her discretion to deport Australian residents, can she indicate whether, in her informed opinion, Mr al-Tekriti should be deported? Or is the minister now powerless to decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come here?</para>

<para>—I think whichever genius wrote that question—and I am sure the senator would not fall into this trap—would rather be a journalist than in parliament, such is the glib reference to the government’s policy. The government do have the capacity to decide who comes here and the circumstances in which they come. We have a system that does that. That system properly involves checks and balances, and the check in this case was a review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. We and others might not like the outcome, but that is the outcome that has been arrived at through proper process. Nonetheless, the process is still open, and I refer you to the remarks I made in my original answer—that, should further information become available, it would still be in the province of the minister to cancel the temporary protection visa or, for that matter, a permanent visa, if it were later given. This government have shown a willingness to cancel visas where it is appropriate. I wish the opposition supported the government when they did. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I thank Senator Trood for his excellent question. I have seen reports from a number of organisations that seem to hold quite bizarre and contradictory views. They say on the one hand that the current welfare system has not eased poverty, yet they oppose our reforms and say that we should keep the current system going. Organisations like the Brotherhood of St Laurence and ACOSS like to lecture us but their proposals are no different from Labor’s: just keep doing the same thing, hand out more money and hope for the best. It is a road to nowhere.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Major welfare reform is needed in Australia, and I ask those opposite whether they agree with this summary:</para>
<quote>
<para>There can only be two purposes to the public provision of welfare: to move people back into work and to develop their skills and self-esteem—offering incentives for an active life, lifelong learning, personal savings and the social status of work while also demanding individual responsibility in return. Welfare dependency can kill a society, suffocate self-esteem and the stability of a normal life.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Do you know who said that? None other than their would-be Prime Minister, Mr Mark Latham. He then went on to say,</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is the perpetual dilemma of centre left parties supporting the active role of government but not knowing when to stop.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There are currently 700,000 children growing up in households in Australia where no parent has a job. These welfare kids are much more likely to leave school early, become unemployed or teenage parents and end up on welfare themselves. We say the children of Australia deserve better. Families where no parent is working are more likely to have mental health issues, lower rates of immunisation and greater risk of juvenile delinquency. Contrast this with research that shows that young people whose parents work, even in a low-paid or casual job, have the benefit of positive role models in their lives and subsequently fare much better. But Labor refuses to see this, preferring the sit-down money mentality and culture. Indeed, Ms Macklin once notoriously declared that it was better to have no job than a casual job—and under Labor she would be the Deputy Prime Minister.</para>
<para>I wonder who said this? Listen to this very carefully: ‘We also believe that the best form of welfare is a job for people to move out of that cycle of poverty.’ A bit tough? It was Mat Rowell, the CEO of the Tasmanian arm of ACOSS, on ABC radio in Tasmania this morning. It shows that some people understand the need to get people from welfare and into work.</para>
<para>Those opposite continually attack us without advising us what their alternative policy is. I urge those on the other side to put away their negative carping and come forward with a policy that embraces the principles so rightly enunciated by their former leader, Mr Latham.

<para>—My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. In light of public concern about the decision to allow Mr al-Tekriti to remain in Australia, will the minister now revisit the government’s earlier decision not to appeal the findings of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which allowed this apparently to happen? Will the minister advise when the case was first brought to her attention and whether she was involved in the decision not to pursue the matter before the AAT—in other words, to drop the appeal? If the government’s concern about Mr al-Tekriti was serious enough to try to deny him a visa in 1999, why couldn’t the minister, it seemed, be bothered with proceeding with an appeal against the decision which allowed him to remain in Australia? Doesn’t the government’s refusal to at least appeal the AAT’s decision, which could allow Mr al-Tekriti, where there were serious concerns, to remain in Australia, seriously undermine the integrity of Australia’s immigration system?</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Ludwig for the question. The answer to the question is no. The decision to refuse him a visa was made in around 1999-2000, but in any event the refusal was in 2001, I think. I am sorry—let me take that back. Without being specific on dates, I can say that the decision to lodge an appeal and the decision, in particular, to withdraw from the appeal was a decision made in October 2003 and was signed off by the then minister at the time. So the short answer to your question is no, I was not involved.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am not at all sure that it would now be possible to launch an appeal on something that was that long ago but, in any event, Senator, the point that I made was that advice from counsel to the previous minister was that the appeal would not be successful. It would be folly, for the purposes of some media circus, to have an appeal that you did not think would be successful. In fact, I would argue that that would be an abuse of process. What I have said is that the government is certainly interested in any further information, and not just on Mr al-Tekriti but on anybody living in Australia who may or may not have committed such crimes as would warrant their current visa being cancelled. That applies not just from today. It has always applied and it will apply from today on and in particular in relation to Mr al-Tekriti.</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Payne for her interest and her question. Last week I was pleased to announce that the Howard government will provide $4 million over two years in supplementary funding for disability business services in rural and remote areas. This will increase their funding from $700,000 in the past 18 months to a projected $2.4 million in the coming year. That is an increase in funding from $38,000 a month in the past 18 months to $200,000 a month over the next year, which is a fivefold increase. It is part of a support package aimed at helping to maintain the future viability of services located in rural and remote Australia, which face unique challenges due to their location. Every single one of the estimated 120 business services located in rural and remote areas will benefit from the funding. This will see services receiving between $15,000 and $60,000 more per year. The first payments will be made before Christmas.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The package also includes grants of up to $75,000—and I would appreciate it if senators could promote this in their areas—to help business services build new alliances with other services in their regions. I was in Armidale last week, on Wednesday, and saw a number of business services in that area which are working together to drive and promote themselves and to make themselves known in their region. Grants of up to $2,000 are also available to help services attend events, such as industry and trade days, where they can show their wares, show people what they do and show that they are competitive and deliver high-quality goods and services.</para>
<para>This package is in addition to the estimated $200 million the Howard government is committing to support the disability business sector across Australia in 2005-06. It will further provide services with long-term assurance. However, the efforts of the Howard government to assist disabled members of our community do not end there. A major part of the government’s Welfare to Work agenda is to support people into paid work who would otherwise be left languishing by Labor. As I said yesterday, I am impressed by people with disabilities who have gone out and participated in employment to prove their critics wrong. Those people have shown that it is ability, not disability, that counts.</para>
<para>One of those people is Dean Clifford, who works at Ken Mills Toyota in Queensland. Dean has a very serious genetic skin disorder called epidermolysis bullosa, or EB, and was given a five-year life expectancy at birth. Dean is now 25 years old. He spoke at the Prime Minister’s Employer of the Year Awards. I think that any of us who were there could not help being moved by his story. He spoke about the barriers he had to overcome in life. He also spoke about the sense of fulfilment that his job provides him with. He told us how he has to spend four hours every morning having his skin bandaged before he goes to work. Dean is part of the business and marketing at Ken Mills Toyota and is also a motivational speaker who travels the country telling his inspirational story. Dean has the support of Ken Mills Toyota, and Toyota Australia also sponsors Dean’s activities as a motivational speaker. He has spoken at many conferences, including the annual conference of the Association of Competitive Employment, ACE, the peak body for open employment services. Their goal of open employment means regular work in the real world, with award based wages and conditions, alongside people without a disability. This government will continue to support people with disabilities who are able to work and will not leave them on the scrapheap, as some of those opposite did and would do. The government applauds the efforts of the many thousands like Dean, who are an inspiration to us all.</para>

<para>—In any event, on a more serious note, I can only repeat what I said last week, that I supported the decision, as did all South Australians and, indeed, the whole cabinet. The decision was a unanimous decision to appoint Mr Gerard to the board. The fact is that we did support the proposition that the Reserve Bank board would be enhanced by having a leading manufacturer on the board and by having someone outside the Sydney-Canberra-Melbourne triangle. To have a South Australian on that board probably for the first time was something we all welcomed. There was unanimous agreement that Mr Gerard was a fit and proper person to appoint to that board. We note with regret his decision to resign from the board in the face of the publicity surrounding this matter and, of course, he has now been replaced by Mr Roger Corbett, who will bring considerable skills to that position.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I thank Senator Fierravanti-Wells for a serious question on serious matters pertaining to the health of the Australian economy—a much more important question than the questions we get from those opposite. I am pleased to report that last week the Bureau of Statistics published its figures on new capital expenditure for Australia for the September quarter, which showed a very remarkable growth of 2.9 per cent in real terms. What is particularly impressive is that that substantial growth came on top of a 10.6 per cent real growth in the previous June quarter. We in this country are seeing a sustained and continuous boom in capital investment. In fact, in the year to September new capital investment overall grew by no less than 23 per cent in real terms. There was 32 per cent growth in buildings and structures and 19 per cent growth in equipment, plant and machinery.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is well known that the Australian mining industry has been investing very heavily in response to the extraordinary demand for our products, particularly from China. In the September quarter, the mining industry saw a rise in overall investment of some 11 per cent in one quarter. What I think is particularly pleasing, particularly for those of us who come from the manufacturing states of South Australia and Victoria, is that the manufacturing industry saw new capital expenditure up 15.6 per cent in the quarter and 42.6 per cent for the year—up nearly half, which was extraordinary. Investment in manufacturing continues to exceed investment in the mining sector, which may come as a surprise to many Australians.</para>
<para>Those strong investment figures help explain some of the trade figures. I note from the trade figures released today that there was a rise of 6.6 per cent, or an increase of $197 million, in capital goods imports in October, while consumption goods decreased by 2.5 per cent. So that does help explain some of the trade figures that we are seeing with this strong investment. Indeed, since we came to office nearly 10 years ago, private new capital expenditure has more than doubled in real terms in Australia, which does underline the level of business confidence which we have been able to generate under our government. With strong corporate profitability and good balance sheets, what is going on in investment is not financed by excessive corporate debt.</para>
<para>The reason these figures are good is twofold. This new capital investment is a major contributor to current GDP growth, and that will no doubt be reinforced tomorrow with the national accounts figures. It does represent a major long-term expansion in the productive capacity of this country. This investment does allow our economy to grow faster in the future and produce more output per unit of labour and therefore be in a better position to export to the world. It is no good just sitting around hoping that this investment will occur of its own volition. It does not. You have to create the right economic climate for these sorts of investment figures and with settings that do underline business confidence.</para>
<para>We do need to continue with our program to continuously improve the performance of the Australian economy. That is where our workplace relations reforms are just so important, together with the agenda for reform that we are negotiating with state and territory governments under the auspices of COAG. We also have to maintain a very stable macroeconomic climate with this growth necessitating continuing budget surpluses, low debt and low inflation so that we have stable interest rates and therefore underline that business confidence. Those very strong investment figures are very good news for everyone interested in strong growth and strong growth in real wages and employment. That shows what is possible if we do maintain our efforts to make the Australian economy more productive, more innovative and more internationally competitive.</para>

<para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I invite the minister to read the article. Perhaps he could also explain why we would need to cut parenting payments when the government also claims that the new IR legislation will create jobs for the most disadvantaged. Minister, the government is likely to post a surplus of $12 billion to $14 billion, we understand, in 2006. Do you not think that some of that money could be used to solve the problem of half a million children under 18 who are estimated to be living in poverty? Will you acknowledge the Brotherhood of St Laurence’s report, which is out today, that shows almost no improvement in the level of poverty in Australia since 1996? Just what are you going to do about these children?</para>

<para>—The Democrats fail to understand that the best thing any government can do about poverty is to maximise the opportunity for jobs to be created in this country. That is what we are focused upon. That is what our whole reform agenda is focused upon: ensuring that this economy remains productive and competitive to maximise the number of children who can live in families with parents who are in the work force and are able to generate higher living standards for their children. I am advised that we have actually halved the number of children living in jobless families in Australia. So we are getting on with the job. There remain problems, and I refute the accusation from Senator Allison that the Treasurer suggested cutting payments. He is simply saying that in families where the parents are not exercising appropriate responsibilities that is a problem that society and the government need to address.</para>

<para>—I thank the senator for her question. Obviously, she is particularly interested in agricultural areas and the problems that they have in bringing the harvest in. I have announced before that the Australian government now offers a second 12-month working holiday-maker visa to those working holiday-makers who have done at least three months seasonal harvest work in regional Australia. The expansion of that program is a new step under the Working Holiday Program which allows international visitors aged between 19 and 30—still young and fit enough to swing from the rafters, no doubt—to supplement their travel funds through incidental employment on a reciprocal basis with many other countries.</para>

<para>—You do have to be pretty fit to go picking fruit. Ripened fruit has proven to be a good meal ticket for at least 500 visitors who have applied for this second working holiday-maker visa since its introduction only four weeks ago. We can be sure from the response received in just over four weeks that this is going to make a significant difference to rural areas, where farm labour is so important. It represents about half of the overall operational cost for horticultural businesses. It is a critical factor in ensuring the smooth running of the field preparation, the planting, the maintenance and the harvesting and packing activities on the farm. The changes to the visa do provide, I think, a significant incentive to people to get out there and help us bring the crops in. That in turn will provide farmers with a wealth of fit, mobile and enthusiastic workers when they are most needed for farm labour.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>It also gives a boost to the tourism industry, because the working holiday-makers who stay longer may or may not choose to do more fruit-picking in that second year but they will at least be available for a whole range of jobs, in particular in the tourism industry that relies so heavily on working holiday-makers. We bring working holiday-makers from places as diverse as Korea, Japan, Estonia and Sweden. As a result, the horticultural industry has boosted its numbers in recent years. It has found difficulty in the past bringing the crops in. The National Farmers Federation and Growcom, the peak horticultural industry body, have welcomed the expansion of this visa.</para>
<para>It is under the coalition that the Working Holiday Program has doubled. Labor did not have the brains to see what could be done with the working holiday-maker program. We came into government and doubled it. That has made a significant difference to those people who have a labour shortage in bringing in their crops. We have taken a strategic approach to immigration across the board. We have quite deliberately and dramatically increased the skill component of our migration without particularly reducing the family component. That, combined with what we are doing in the working holiday area, is clear evidence of our strategic approach as opposed to Labor’s simply laissez faire attitude. We have 19 reciprocal working holiday agreements. We had an 11 per cent increase in the number of people seeking these visas in the last year. All in all, Senator Nash, it is a tremendous success.</para>

I refer the minister to his answer in question time yesterday, when he asserted that people will not be worse off as a result of the Howard government’s policy on changing the welfare system. Is the minister not aware of advice from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations indicating that 60,000 people with a disability and 77,000 single parents will be on lower welfare payments as a result of the government’s policy?

What we have is the welfare payment, the $3.6 billion investment and the new taper rates, and those new taper rates will enable people to earn more income without impacting on their social welfare payments. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Isn’t it the case that, as well as being worse off because of lower payments, many people who actually find work under the government’s policy will be financially worse off than they would have been on welfare? Isn’t it the case that, after they have given back 75c of every dollar they earn to the Howard government, many Australians will end up paying to work?

<para>—Once again, the honourable senator has unfortunately got it wrong. She had a string of questions and I think the answers were no, no and no. I would invite her to also look at the new taper rate which makes it more advantageous for people to engage in employment—even in casual employment, which those on the other side say is worse than no work at all. We on this side say casual employment is better than no employment. That is the great divide in this chamber and in this country. We actually have a Welfare to Work policy, whereas those opposite have a welfare to nowhere policy—something that Mr Latham lamented five years ago and, lamentably, it is still the case today.</para>

That is why we now have a $555 million program to do exactly that for the benefit of disabled people. Mr President, you and I know an outstanding example of somebody who has significant disabilities, who is an inspiration to many people and who has in fact gained himself employment. I of course speak of Erick Pastoor, the former Liberal candidate for Denison. We as a government are willing to engage with those people to assist them into work.

<para>Under the Welfare to Work program, for the first time we as a government will be concentrating on people’s abilities rather than their disabilities. That is a very important change in relation to that which has existed in the past. You can say to people: ‘You’re disabled; you’re on welfare,’ and draw the line on them. We as a government say that is not good enough. What we have got to do with them is concentrate on them as individuals and ask the question: are they able to work 15 hours or more per week?

<para>—Mr President, if this male Greens party leader had any respect for his female colleague he would allow an answer to be given to her question without him trying to dominate the show for his own personal glory. Why the numbers in the Prime Minister and Cabinet office might be lower than before I do not know. It may well be that the employment opportunities are now such that people are willing to engage in employment without necessarily registering themselves as disabled. The raw figures of themselves do not necessarily indicate a lot, other than for us as a government to reaffirm and reconfirm to the Australian people that we are concerned to ensure that people with disabilities get a fair go. That is why we have got a $555 million package to assist them.</para>

<para>—My question is to Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I refer the minister to his comments in question time yesterday where he incorrectly asserted that the government’s policy was to improve the Newstart taper rate to make work more financially rewarding for single parents and people with a disability? Isn’t the minister being deliberately misleading by comparing the old and new taper rates for Newstart allowance rather than comparing the Newstart taper rate with the taper rate for the disability support pension and parenting payment single? Doesn’t the government’s policy of putting people on Newstart rather than the pension mean that work will be less financially rewarding for these people even after the new Newstart taper rate is taken into account?</para>

<para>—In relation to the new taper rates for Newstart, the following is the situation. The income test free area of $62 remains. From $63 to $250, it is going to be tapered at the rate of 50c in the dollar. Previously it was from $63 to $142. In other words, that is now going to be extended out to $250. Then, above $250, 60c in the dollar is going to be the adjustment, whereas previously it was 70c for each dollar above $143. Therefore, those facts speak for themselves and, as a result, Senator Webber’s assertion is once again incorrect.</para>

<para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The minister obviously does not understand. He is comparing Newstart taper rates with Newstart taper rates, not disability support pension taper rates with Newstart taper rates when you make people change benefits. Under the government’s policy, if a single mother works part-time while receiving parenting payment single, not Newstart, doesn’t she end up working for less reward when she is dumped onto the dole on the day of her child’s eighth birthday? Is that not because, under the government’s policy, the taper rate is worse for part-time workers on Newstart than it is for workers who are getting parenting payment single, and so the government takes back more of the single mother’s earnings?</para>

We have indicated to this place on a number of occasions that there is going to be a shortage of 195,000 people to fill jobs over the next five years. There is a labour shortage in this country. We need people available to fill those jobs. As a result, getting more people off welfare into work is not only going to be of benefit to the individual and the kids in those family units but also, of course, to society at large.</para>

<para>—I thank Senator McGauran for the question and for his interest in the issue. I know that senators on this side of the chamber would be pleased to know that, to date, the government has provided targeted funding of more than $150 million to improve mobile phone coverage in regional and rural areas. Coverage will extend to more than 98 per cent of the population and around 18 per cent of the land mass will have mobile phone coverage. The government has now allocated a further $30 million under the Mobile Connect package to extend mobile coverage even further; in particular, to smaller, regional communities which attract tourists or seasonal workers along highways. These programs are making a significant difference, transforming the face of telecommunications in Australia and nowhere is this more apparent than in rural and regional areas.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The quality of services in regional areas will be transformed once again as Telstra rolls out its new 3G network throughout Australia to replace the existing CDMA network. Telstra’s 3G network will provide equivalent or better coverage to the existing CDMA network, using the same spectrum. An added bonus is that the new network will provide a wireless broadband service to people living within the existing CDMA coverage area. No longer will GSM users be frustrated when they travel to rural areas and cannot get coverage because they do not have a CDMA phone. Telstra has given a commitment to continue operating the CDMA network until the new network is providing either equivalent or better coverage. Where the government has funded CDMA mobile phone towers, Telstra is under contract to maintain coverage at the same level for at least 10 years. The government will ensure that Telstra meets its legal obligations and its commitments for equivalent or better coverage. So, as well as vastly improved mobile coverage, under this government, consumers will now enjoy a new, faster network, wireless broadband across the network and compatibility with city phone users.</para>
<para>Senator McGauran asked me whether I was aware of any other arrangements. One might ask how it compares with the kind of treatment rural mobile phone users received under the last Labor government. We all know Labor’s legacy in rural and regional Australia is characterised by neglect and indifference.</para>

He does not believe that rural and regional Australians have a right to decent services irrespective of where they live. It is about time the Labor Party stop sitting on the fence and stand up for something they believe in. It is about time that they had something to say about rural and regional services. This government will continue to be committed to those in rural and regional areas and will deliver fair services irrespective of where people live.</para>

<para>—My question is directed to Senator Patterson, the Minister for Family and Community Services. Is the minister aware of a recent Audit Office report which found that significant problems exist in the administration of the seven million health care cards issued by the government each year? Didn’t this report find that in July and August 2004 alone, there were over 655,000 invalid uses of health care cards at a cost to taxpayers of $78 million? Given the scale of the problem and the cost to the taxpayer, why has the government made the new PBS Online initiative optional for pharmacists? Didn’t the Audit Office note that the PBS Online initiative, which would allow pharmacists to electronically verify concession cards at the point of use, would strengthen the arrangements for health care cards and that no equivalent alternative existed for pharmacists who chose not to use the system?</para>

<para>—The changes of the way in which the government was structured were in order to bring together all the services that the government delivers through payments through Centrelink, through the Health Insurance Commission and through payments to pharmacists into one portfolio, and to address them in a holistic way. When we came into government we found the ramshackle state in which some of those services were left, the way in which social security was run and the lack of consideration and failure of consideration of privacy issues. I can go back through <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> after <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the way in which that was run.

Mr Hockey is addressing major changes to ensure that we deliver those services as efficiently and effectively as possible to reduce the likelihood of fraud and to ensure that those people with entitlements get their entitlements and that those who are not entitled do not.</para>

The honourable senator on the other side should have a look at what has been going on, rather than make an assumption that something is not happening. We are constantly reducing the likelihood of people using any system fraudulently, unlike Labor.

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked by Senators Kirk and Ludwig today relating to Mr Oday Adnan al-Tekriti.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">What we have clearly heard today in question time is that the government has said that it will investigate the case of an Iraqi man who is a former bodyguard of Saddam Hussein and who has been granted a visa to stay in Australia. This man unlawfully arrived in Australia about six years ago. The facts of that as reported are that it was through Indonesia, on a boat and with a false passport.</para>
<para>As the reports show, DIMIA originally rejected Mr al-Tekriti’s attempts to gain a protection visa, stating that they had serious reasons to believe that he may have committed certain acts in his former role in Iraq. That is where the story gets a bit hazy. The reports are also unclear. But it is clear that there is an onus on this government to come clean and explain to the Senate and the Australian people what in fact occurred, how it occurred, what they knew, whether there has been any investigation by the Australian Federal Police, whether there was any investigation at the time of his arrival of any criminal record, whether there was anything available to ascertain who he was and whether there were any outstanding allegations that needed to be met other than serious concerns. It is clear that what occurred post his arrival was that, in 2001, this matter came before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal where the person exercised his right to appeal. There is nothing untoward about that in itself. We know that he was then granted a protection visa, although it was in June this year. So there is the gap.</para>
<para>This is an immigration department that prides itself on getting it right, although its record, quite frankly, is abysmal. It has not got it right on many occasions. What it has also said in estimates to the opposition many times is that it does appeal these matters. It takes matters to the Federal Court and often to the High Court because it wants to make sure that it is right. In this instance, by October 2003, after the Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision in 2001, it seems that the matter was not progressed. We have some insight there. Senator Vanstone did not say that the department did not pursue the matter but that it was under Mr Ruddock’s ministership that it was not pursued. That is really a slight hospital pass to Mr Ruddock from Senator Vanstone. She says: ‘It’s not my fault. I didn’t do it. I wasn’t there. It was Mr Ruddock.’ But, of course, this is a department that has a bad record. As I think the newspaper reports show—and Premier Rann in South Australia has also commented on this matter—it does smell. It does require an explanation. There is something strange about the set of circumstances which has led to the newspaper reports that we see.</para>
<para>I should have prefaced my remarks by pointing out that in Australia Mr al-Tekriti is entitled, as he would be in other countries, to the presumption of innocence. But it does demand a clear explanation from this government as to what happened. When you look at ministerial oversight of this department by both Mr Ruddock and Senator Vanstone, you will see that we have had Cornelia Rau locked up for 10 months, we have had Vivian Solon deported, we have had people transported in vans from Woomera in South Australia for lengthy periods without proper rests and we have had reports into the problems that beset DIMIA. Here we have another one. There seems to be something strange about this case that requires or demands further and better particulars. That is what we do not have from the government. We have obfuscation again. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>—The opposition is drawing a very long bow in trying to suggest that there is anything improper, wrong or unfair about the way this particular individual has been treated. In seeking to draw comparisons with the Alvarez and Rau cases I think Senator Ludwig is wide of the mark. We all know that Australia is a signatory to the United Nations convention on human rights, which was signed way back in the 1950s. We do offer people who have a genuine fear of persecution refuge in this country. I must say that we have a very fine record in that regard. Of the nations of the world, Australia has one of the highest percentages of refugees as a percentage of our migration intake. In fact, Australia takes around 13,000 refugees per year. Australia is consistently, in fact, ranked in the top three, along with the United States and Canada, for offering refugee resettlement. We work closely with the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees to determine the priority for resettlement. We do take care to ensure that we are fair in the way we operate our refugee program.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In this case, from what I can gather, Mr al-Tekriti came from Iraq to this country and was considered for a protection visa. People have raised some objections because it has been alleged that this individual was part of the protection detail or guard of Saddam Hussein. Nevertheless, he came to Australia and was assessed under the United Nations convention rules and against the requirement that he have a well-founded fear of persecution. He was found, in fact, to be a genuine case. As I understand it, this case was considered extensively by the Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal. He was not to be excluded from refugee protection. This conclusion is binding on the department of immigration. I think that we should remember that Australia is a country in which the rule of law prevails. We conduct our affairs under the rule of law. This man has the protection of Australian law and has been found to have a right as a refugee to claim a protection visa.</para>
<para>In this matter, I think the Labor Party are rushing judgment somewhat and being unfair to this individual because of the alleged connection that he has had with the regime of Saddam Hussein. I venture to speculate that even though persons who worked for the government of Saddam Hussein might have all been seen as fellow travellers of Saddam Hussein, many of them in fact disagreed with the policies of the Saddam Hussein government and probably lived in fear of their lives and were looking for ways to get away from the country. I read a story quite recently about the pilot of Saddam’s personal aircraft. He was in exactly that kind of situation, and he eventually absconded with the aircraft from Baghdad to a European airport and sought refugee status. So I would urge the ALP to be a little more open-minded about this, to accept the findings of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and to respect our laws that have given this man refugee status.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise this afternoon to take note of answers given to questions asked of Senator Vanstone in question time today. Senator Ludwig and I asked the minister questions in relation to Mr Oday al-Tekriti concerning his status here on a temporary protection visa. This is a matter that has received a great deal of attention in the last couple of days in the media. There have been concerns as to his activities prior to him coming to this country. He was previously a citizen of Iraq and he came here to this country in 1999 and now holds a temporary protection visa here.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Mr al-Tekriti fled Iraq in 1999. His father had been murdered for speaking out against the regime of Saddam Hussein. Mr al-Tekriti arrived here in Australia in 1999 on a boat from Indonesia. When he first arrived he sought a protection visa but this visa was refused because at the time there were ‘serious reasons for considering that he had committed war crimes or crimes against humanity’. So at the initial stage his protection visa was refused by the department. He appealed to the AAT, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, against this decision and the decision was overturned in June 2001. The reason for it being overturned was that the AAT found that there was in fact no evidence that he had been involved in crimes against humanity. It is for this reason that he holds a temporary protection visa today.</para>
<para>In the last few days concerns have come to light that perhaps the decision made by the AAT may not have been the correct decision, and that is the reason this matter is being raised in the Senate today and in the newspapers. The reason it has been raised in the Senate and questions are being asked of Senator Vanstone is to see whether Senator Vanstone has been making inquiries in relation to this matter. That was the nature of the questioning here today: whether she had made any further inquiries of the department or whether she has any continuing concerns in relation to Mr al-Tekriti.</para>
<para>We are told that an appeal was lodged against the decision of the AAT but that it was withdrawn. This is where the concerns of the opposition lie. We would like to know the reasons for the withdrawal of the appeal. The problem we have is that this matter has not received the attention of the public. This information has not been released into the public domain. This is a matter which has been kept quiet and it is not something that the minister has made public. Assuming, of course, that it is something that is not going to breach the privacy of Mr al-Tekriti himself, this is something that ought to allay the concerns that there are in the community. Our shadow minister, Mr Burke, and the Premier of South Australia have said that this is a matter that should be made public. This is what we in the Labor opposition have also said. We believe that this is a matter that requires further investigation.</para>
<para>We are not saying at this stage that there is any suggestion that Mr al-Tekriti’s temporary protection visa ought to be cancelled. All we are suggesting is that it requires further investigation and that the reasons for the decision of the AAT ought to be further investigated and made public. This also has to be seen in the broader context. Coming from South Australia where individuals and groups such as the Bakhtiyaris were deported in circumstances where there seemed to be very little investigation, we would like to see this matter handled much more sensitively.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I stand to take note of the answers given by Senator Vanstone to the questions from the opposition which related to Mr al-Tekriti, who is from Iraq and who is now living in Australia. The answers also related to allegations made by the Labor Party about the government’s response to the Cornelia Rau case and the Vivian Alvarez case, and the role of DIMIA in those two particular matters. I wish to address both of the allegations made by the Labor Party, because they are potentially what you would call in politics ‘cheap shots’. These are matters which need very circumspect consideration.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Firstly, with respect to the al-Tekriti matter, this was a matter that was considered by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal at the Commonwealth level. The tribunal found that he was not excluded from refugee protection. That particular finding is binding on the Commonwealth and on the department of immigration. He was assessed as a person who had a well-founded fear of persecution—that is very important. In terms of the evidence put to the AAT, this was found to be justifiable; it was substantiated. The decisions made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, albeit that it is not a judicial body—as you would know, it is an administrative body—are taken objectively and are based on the facts put before the tribunal. In this case, the decision was made that he was entitled to the protection visa.</para>
<para>Senator Ludwig and Senator Kirk have asked why the minister or the government do not release further and better particulars and why they do not release more information. Let us be circumspect about this. We are talking about a protection visa for a man who is from Iraq and who has a well-founded fear of persecution. Where is he from? Iraq. Where is his family from? Iraq. Let us think of the potential concerns that could be facing his family in Iraq if those further and better particulars were made public. What sorts of concerns would they be facing? We in this chamber do not know. You want to make public and spray about all this information about this man’s family when he is under threat and has a well-founded fear of persecution. Releasing matters private to him and his family is entirely inappropriate.</para>
<para>In my view, the minister’s answers were entirely appropriate and proper. They put due consideration of family members first. This is an issue that the Labor opposition simply refuse to acknowledge. Those family members may be at home in Iraq and at risk of persecution. I do not know, but this is a matter that the minister needs to take into account. That is the point.</para>

<para>—No. You do not know the situation in Iraq. You do not know the details. I had a briefing on Monday of last week with a very senior military official from Iraq and I can assure you that his family’s position in that country—and that of many others—remains very much at risk and is of great concern. These are the issues that the Labor opposition ignore when they ask these questions. There is the possibility that this is a cheap shot. Maybe it is simply that they have gone overboard in wanting more information. The response has been given by the minister, and the minister’s response was appropriate.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In response to the opposition’s views with respect to Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez, the government has provided an apology to both those people. Are they trying to stir the pot again and make false and misleading allegations against the minister? The minister responded with an apology on 6 October. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The real issue at stake in the debate today regarding the answers from Senator Vanstone is the fact that we do not have a minister who is in control of her department and who takes responsibility for her department’s actions. As we get to the end of the year, if we had to do a report card on the performance of this minister and her oversight of the department, we would only have to go and look back at the litany of press releases and press comments throughout the year. This department’s performance has been a litany of errors. There is example after example of mishaps, cover-ups and inconsistencies, and this is yet another example.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Back in July, we had the headline ‘Vanstone pressed to explain latest bungle’ in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> over the Hwang children and the requirement to place them in a detention centre. If you remember, they were snatched from school. In July in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, Mike Steketee wrote,  ‘Something rotten in Immigration’. Then in October in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>, Michelle Grattan wrote, ‘No contrition from a joking Vanstone’. ‘Immigration reform reaches a dead end’ was a headline in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> in October. The list goes on and on. And today we have critical comments about cultural problems in the department of immigration in a commentary about the state of the Public Service, and we have another comment in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> about this minister and the way in which this department is being managed and handled badly.</para>
<para>There is a litany of evidence that shows us that this minister is not on top of the issues in her department and that she does not have a handle on the mishaps, mistakes and inconsistencies that come before the press on almost a weekly basis. This is a minister who presides over a department that has no consistent checks and balances. This is a minister who presides over a department that has systemic failures in its processes and procedures. The department has an inhumane culture, is resistant to scrutiny and resists any evidence or truth about matters being aired or made public. It has a culture of cover-up.</para>
<para>This is a department that has an attitude of indifference to human rights issues, and it is a department that has poor communication within the department, between the department and the minister’s office, and, more particularly, from the minister’s office down through the department levels. This is a minister who presides over a department that lacks integrity and accountability—a department where processes are ineffective, to the point where this department is now becoming incompetent. As Kim Beazley said and is reported as saying in the media today:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The immigration department is a turnstile of incompetence. There is just one event after the other.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What is the issue here today that we want to ask the minister about but she refuses to give us answers for? The bodyguard of Saddam Hussein entered this country and was denied a temporary protection visa in 2000—probably quite rightly so from the evidence that has come before the public in the last 48 hours. That decision was overturned by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in 2001. We want to know why. On what basis was it overturned? Was there political interference in that decision? Were they directed to overturn that denial of a visa? Is it linked to any relationship with a particular person in the Liberal Party in this country? And why was there a decision to pull out of the appeal?</para>
<para>We are after some real answers to some questions. When we asked questions in relation to the Vivian Solon and Cornelia Rau cases, we got an international embarrassment. The answers highlighted international mismanagement regarding the way in which this minister cannot properly manage her department and is not on top of the issues. We want some more answers about this. We want to further expose and continue to expose a minister who is not competent in managing a department—a minister who refuses to take responsibility and accept responsibility for the continual mishaps, mistakes and cover-ups that this department presides over, and this is just one more example of that.</para>

<para>—It is probably a noteworthy thing I am about to say—one that the sharp-eared media reporters in the gallery might listen to. I would like to defend Minister Vanstone in regard to this matter. That is not something I do terribly often in regard to visa controversies, but I have found some of the coverage of this particular issue in some of the press a bit confusing. That is not because I do not understand the issues—I think there is no area I know better than this area—but because the different concerns that are raised are almost conflicting. We can see that in the quite strange scenario we have had in the last 20 minutes or so.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We have had the quite unusual situation of conservative members of the government standing up and saying: ‘We can’t send people back to Iraq—it is too dangerous. We have a duty to protect people from refoulement and from being sent back to places where they mightn’t be safe.’ I could not agree more, but I wish I had heard it for the many other cases and examples where this department seems to have gone out of its way to ignore that very serious obligation just because the people they are sending back are a bit inconvenient.</para>
<para>I have no doubt that the issues surrounding this person who has got a lot of coverage are inconvenient, but, from the facts that I am aware of and that are on the public record, it is a case where the system seems to have worked. A person had allegations against them in regard to their activities in Iraq, and those allegations were deemed to be of some substance by the immigration department and were such that he was not granted a visa. He appealed that to the independent tribunal, as is his right—and, I would very strongly argue, as is absolutely essential—and that tribunal, in considering all the evidence independently, found that the evidence did not stack up and that the case was not such that he should be denied a visa under the exclusion provisions of the refugee convention. I argue that that is a sign of the system working well: the department do not like somebody because they are possibly a bit suss and there are some allegations around that do not sound good, but when the allegations are actually tested by an independent tribunal they have found that the evidence does not stack up.</para>
<para>I would contrast this case to—interestingly, a little curiously and slightly paradoxically, in that the same journalists who revealed this case in the Fairfax papers also revealed today this case—the case of Mr Noori, who has been in Villawood for the last six years and whom I have spoken of in this chamber a couple of times and written about on my web site. He was also denied a visa for the same sorts of reasons—allegations of inappropriate activities that meant he would be excluded from protection under article 1F of the refugee convention. That was on the basis of anonymous allegations made about his alleged involvement in a unit of the former communist Afghan government. The big problem with that was that, when he went to the AAT to appeal that, he was not given the opportunity to find out what those allegations were, to counter them or to defend himself.</para>
<para>It has taken six years, all the way up to the full bench of the Federal Court and back down to the AAT again—because the court found that he was denied natural justice—for him to now get the chance to answer the allegations and clearly demonstrate that he is not the person who allegedly committed the activities. The bizarre thing is that, despite that decision of the AAT, I think nearly two months ago, he is still in detention. His wife and his two or three children have been out in the community for six years. They are now Australian citizens. They have grown up without him. And he is still jailed nearly two months after the AAT found that he did not have a case to answer. My understanding is that that is because it is only now that ASIO has decided to do the character and security checks, when it has had the last six years to do that.</para>
<para>However, that is an example of what happens when the system goes wrong. I do not personally know this person who has had the coverage in the last day or two. I know a few people who do know him and vouch for him in terms of how he has behaved in Australia. I do not think any of us are in a position to judge one way or the other the full details of what he may or may not have done back in Iraq, but the fact is that those decisions about what he may or may not have done have to be based on solid evidence, not just hearsay or fearmongering. He has the right, the same as anybody else, to have that evidence tested independently in a tribunal. I would be very concerned if those sorts of rulings were undermined or potentially overturned because of political pressure about allegations that are proved not to stack up once they have been independently assessed. I also emphasise that, in the test under the refugee convention, the threshold for being suspected of being associated with a group of people who may have committed a war crime is much lower than the threshold under the Crimes Act for being personally responsible for committing one. It is a much lower threshold, and despite that this person has not reached it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:</para>
</talk.start>
<motion>
<para>That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion no. 343.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I move this motion for the suspension of standing orders because the substantive motion is a straightforward motion which abhors the hanging of Van Nguyen in Singapore last Friday and reiterates the opposition of the Senate to the death penalty wherever in the world it may be invoked. I know the government has some difficulty with that wording, but I simply do not understand that. There can be no doubt from the debate that I have previously heard in this chamber that there is abhorrence on all sides at the hanging of Van Nguyen in Singapore in Changi Prison at 6 am, their time, last Friday. It was a cruel and unnecessary judicial murder and abhorrence of it has been expressed by many people in government as well as in opposition and in the community.</para>
<para>I know that the Attorney-General described the prospective hanging, as it was last week, as barbaric. Barbaric it was; barbaric the mandatory death penalty is. And it is very important that we say so. We will not change this barbarism if we do not call a spade a spade and do not express to our neighbours—particularly those who believe that a debate of this sort ends at borders and call for sovereignty to be respected—that we feel this way. And if the High Commissioner for Singapore thinks we should respect Singaporean sovereignty in the matter then so the Singaporean government should respect our sovereignty. In our sovereignty we, unlike Singapore, have a robust freedom of speech in this country. We respect oppositional politics but we respect the right of everybody to say what they think about the behaviour of government. Singapore does not do that but Australia does.</para>
<para>The second component of this motion is that the Senate reiterates its opposition to the death penalty wherever in the world it is invoked. Last week, we passed a motion, which I had originally cast in terms of ‘abhorring’ the death penalty, but which the government successfully changed to ‘opposing’ the death penalty. I do not know whether the government’s opposition is because of the extra words ‘wherever in the world it is invoked’. Obviously that includes countries like China, Indonesia and the United States of America, but opposition to the death penalty cannot be selective. It is a matter of morality that does not end at borders. It is a universal feeling that the death penalty should not be countenanced. That is written into international law, and Australia was a very early signatory to that law.</para>
<para>Australia has done away with the death penalty for many decades. I know that people think that it is a prerogative of Western countries, certainly of rich countries, to have done so. That is not so. Costa Rica, for example, did away with the death penalty a long time before Australia did. Costa Rica is a proudly democratic country, surrounded in the past by some very cruel dictatorships, which has held on to its democratic principle and the abolition of the death penalty for almost a century now. The United States has recently killed the 1,000th person since the suspension of the death penalty two decades ago. We must abhor that. On the figures I have heard, up to one-tenth of those people might have been innocent. It is a dreadful, unnecessary and pointless punishment, which does not bring people back. I commend this motion and I do not understand the government’s quarrel with it.</para>

<para>—We are now, as Senator Brown has rightly pointed out, entertaining another debate, which is unseemly, given the nature of this issue. I do not understand the government’s position of not granting leave and dealing with the motion, as it did last week. The motion is relatively unsurprising in its plain words. It is a matter that the opposition supports. This debate is not about that motion, though. This is a motion and debate about whether or not we should suspend standing orders. If people wish to speak in this debate, depending on whether the government decides to gag it or not, they will have five minutes apiece for the next 30 minutes. At that point, we will lose the debate, having gone through the issue. But that is not appropriate. The government, if it did not agree with the wording of the motion, could have voted it down—granted Senator Brown formality and proceeded with it—and not otherwise taken up time to deal with it. What we now see displayed is a very unseemly position that the government has put us in. The government put us in the same position last week, prior to the hanging of Mr Nguyen. It seems to me that the government is stuck about how to deal with this issue.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let me reiterate Labor’s position: we are totally opposed to the death penalty. We said that last week and we will say that this week. There is nothing surprising about the wording in Senator Brown’s motion in that he wishes to move that the Senate abhors the hanging of the Australian citizen Mr Nguyen in Singapore last Friday and reiterates its opposition to the death penalty. That is not something that I can see a problem with in any way. It is a statement of fact.</para>
<para>Maybe, Senator Bob Brown, it is the words ‘wherever in the world it is invoked’ that the government objects to, but of course 50 countries have signed up to the UN convention and oppose the death penalty. As we know, some countries do not oppose it, but that is not unsurprising in the international arena. Perhaps it is the government’s inability, from Mr Downer’s perspective, to gain an upper hand in the debate, unfortunately. Mr Rudd has led the debate; Mr Downer has followed the debate. Mr Rudd has iterated our position on these types of issues quite clearly and articulately in Australia and, I suspect, on the international stage. It is something that seems quite plain to us on this side of politics. It seems to be causing some grief on that side of politics. I am unsure why. It is certainly not a matter that we should be playing politics with. I find it very disappointing that we are now dealing with it in this way. I do not intend to take up the five minutes. It is not necessary; I have capsulated Labor’s position. I do not think that we should be entertaining this debate in this way.</para>

<para>—The government outlined its position on this very clearly the other day. We see no reason to be debating this yet again. This motion is really quite redundant in view of the motion which was passed the other day. The government did put to Senator Bob Brown’s office an amendment that the word ‘abhors’ could be substituted with the word ‘regrets’, the execution now having passed, but I understand that Senator Bob Brown rejected that. The Australian government has made very clear its opposition to the death penalty. Also, in relation to its position where Australian citizens face the possibility of the death penalty, it has made it very clear that we do everything possible to avoid that being carried out, and we will continue to do that. But we do believe that, in this current environment, emotion and words such as ‘abhor’ and other words which have different connotations should not be used in the debate on this issue.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is a very serious issue. We have declared our opposition as such, enunciating our position very clearly in a dispassionate manner. But Australia will continue to make its views known internationally. Whether it is the United States, Singapore or any other country, we make it very clear that we will not extradite someone to a country where they will face possible execution. Under our mutual assistance treaties, we will not give criminal mutual assistance where the death penalty could be carried out unless there is an undertaking not to. Our position is even-handed. It is across the board, no matter whom we deal with in relation to that.</para>
<para>We really see no merit in this issue being raised again. The Senate dealt with it last week. Certainly it is the government’s position that it regrets the fact that the execution in Singapore was carried out last Friday. We are continuing to work in relation to other Australians citizens who face the prospect of the death penalty. We do believe that this motion, in view of the one that was passed last week, takes the matter no further. I move:</para>

<para class="block">This report is the 45th in a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be accorded to persons who claim to have been adversely affected by being referred to either by name or in such a way as to be readily identified in the Senate. On 29 November 2005, the President received a submission from Professor David Peetz, Department of Industrial Relations, Griffith University, relating to remarks made by Senator Abetz during question time in the Senate on 8 November 2005. The President referred the submission to the committee under privilege resolution 5. The committee considered the submission on 1 December 2005 and recommends that Professor Peetz’s proposed response be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para>
<para>The committee reminds the Senate that, in matters of this nature, it does not judge the truth or otherwise of statements made by honourable senators or the persons referred to; rather, it ensures that these persons’ submissions and, ultimately, the responses it recommends accord with the criteria set out in privilege resolution 5. I commend the report to the Senate.</para>
<para class="italic">The response read as follows—</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">RESPONSE BY PROFESSOR DAVID PEETZ</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 5(7)(B) OF THE SENATE OF 25 FEBRUARY 1988</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">On 8 November 2005, in question time, Senator Abetz in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations made a number of claims regarding me. These included that I was engaged in ‘moral equivocation about terrorism’, that I am therefore one of the ‘extreme people’ in public debate and that I ‘will have no compunction whatsoever about deliberately misrepresenting’ government policy. These allegations about my attitude to terrorism were made in response to a question from Senator Brandis about government proposals regarding unfair dismissals. In turn, this question and the subsequent reply were prompted by an interview with me on <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> the preceding week concerning the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill.</para>
<para class="block">The Minister’s allegations were based on a selective and misleading quotation from a poem I wrote four years ago, while living in Quebec City, and which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 17 September 2001. The poem was called “The President and the Terrorist”, although the Herald amended the title to simply read “The Terrorist”. The message of the poem was simple and tragically prophetic: that responses to terrorism that kill innocent people will only lead to more violence and advance the terrorists’ cause. A reading of the poem demonstrates this:</para>
<para class="block">The President and the Terrorist.</para>
<para class="block">The President opened the door, and saw inside his room.</para>
<para class="block">A ghostly apparition, with face of blood and doom.</para>
<para class="block">‘Twas the Terrorist he looked upon, at first he could but stare.</para>
<para class="block">Then flew at him with fists enraged...they merely sailed through air.</para>
<para class="block">He picked himself up off the ground, and turned to face the ghoul.</para>
<para class="block">“You murdered untold innocents! There’s none have been so cruel!</para>
<para class="block">You’re working with the Devil! All evils, rolled in one!</para>
<para class="block">Good will overcome evil, and justice must be done!"</para>
<para class="block">The Terrorist replied “With some of that, I must agree.</para>
<para class="block">Yes, evil will be overcome by good, but sir, you see.</para>
<para class="block">I know you are the evil one, and good is on my side!</para>
<para class="block">You are the force of Satan, and that is why I died”</para>
<para class="block">The president spat out the words “You shattered countless lives!</para>
<para class="block">I’ll wipe out all of you so not a single one survives!”</para>
<para class="block">“But just how will you do that?” the Terrorist then asked</para>
<para class="block">“You don’t know where we are, you cannot see behind our masks!”</para>
<para class="block">“We’ll send in troops, and bombers too” the President replied.</para>
<para class="block">“Destroy all your headquarters, you can’t forever hide!”</para>
<para class="block">“We’ve done it pretty well this far, so I can call your bluff.</para>
<para class="block">You may get one or two of us, but that is not enough!”</para>
<para class="block">“We’ll bomb all those who harbour you, destroy your evil friends</para>
<para class="block">We will not stop our torment till your reign of terror ends!”</para>
<para class="block">The Terrorist was pleased at this, the outcome he could guess,</para>
<para class="block">“And untold innocents, they will be caught up in this, yes?”</para>
<para class="block">The President’s blood pressure rose, his face went vivid red.</para>
<para class="block">“We won’t be satisfied till every one of you is dead!</para>
<para class="block">This is a war we’re in now, and your sort will rue this day!</para>
<para class="block">It can’t be helped if some civilians die along the way.</para>
<para class="block">We must put an end to terrorists! We’ll crush you in the ground!”</para>
<para class="block">At this, the Terrorist leapt up and gave a gleeful sound.</para>
<para class="block">“Yes!” he yelled, “You must ensure you blast us into sand!</para>
<para class="block">You must attack with every ounce of force you have at hand!”</para>
<para class="block">The President was yelling too, his voice was almost shrill</para>
<para class="block">“We’ll squash the flames of hatred in you men who live to kill”</para>
<para class="block">The Terrorist was joyful, “yes, blood it must be spilled!</para>
<para class="block">You must fan the flames of hatred that keep us growing still”</para>
<para class="block">The President, though, couldn’t hear, above his own loud voice</para>
<para class="block">As both screamed out, in unison, “it’s war! There is no choice!”</para>
<para class="block">At this the Terrorist saw no need to discuss things more</para>
<para class="block">Pleased with his work, this ghoulish monster faded through a wall</para>
<para class="block">His whole game plan was playing out now, right before his eyes</para>
<para class="block">As he settled down and waited for the body count to rise</para>
<para class="block">There is no ambiguity about terrorism in this poem – the terrorist is a ‘ghoulish monster’ who is ‘waiting for the body count to rise’. The message of the poem was obvious to those who read it. For example, an Iranian living in Quebec City wrote to me on 15 September 2001:</para>
<para class="block">I got goose bumps as I was reading what u wrote. I think and feel the same way. Since the day it happened I’ve been watching news and hoping that I wouldn’t hear the attack is being linked to Iran because I grew up in Iran and I’m so afraid that something like this will bring more blood and misery to people who have been stroked by war and revolution and sanctions.</para>
<para class="block">Arcadia Flynn, who ran a poetry web site, wrote on 18 September 2001</para>
<para class="block">‘The President and the Terrorist’ is indeed a powerful poem (and how true!). With your agreement, I’d like to email it to some friends.</para>
<para class="block">The poem has been unquestionably been misrepresented by the Minister. The use of phrases like ‘moral equivocation about terrorism’, ‘extreme’ and ‘no compunction whatsoever about deliberately misrepresenting’ are designed to discredit me and dissuade me from participating in public debate on industrial relations. Equally, the attack is aimed at dissuading the Australian Broadcasting Corporation from broadcasting any of my analyses on industrial relations, as the Minister also claimed that ‘The ABC does itself and the Australian people no service by presenting someone like David Peetz as a “respected academic”’.</para>
<para class="block">It is necessary here to briefly outline my qualifications to speak on industrial relations matters. I am professor of industrial relations at Griffith University, have several years experience working in the Senior Executive Service of the then federal Department of Industrial Relations, have undertaken a number of projects for the International Labour Organisation, and am currently president of the Association of Industrial Relations Academics of Australia and New Zealand. None of this was acknowledged by the Minister. In referring to me as ‘Mr Peetz’ the Minister even sought to ignore my standing as a professor.</para>
<para class="block">Instead, the Minister asserted that I did ‘research sponsored by the ACTU’. He failed to mention that this research was funded by the Commonwealth Government through the Australian Research Council, and was approved by the then Minister for Education, Dr Kemp. Nor did he mention that I have done research and consultancy work for such employers as Brisbane City Council, Redland City Council and Queensland Rail, and for the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business under a Liberal Minister. He asserted that I was ‘reported as being a singer in a trade union choir’, failing to mention that I left the Brisbane Combined Unions Choir, after a short period, in 2000. He asserted that I wrote ‘poetry for the Workers Online web site, which calls him its “resident bard”’, failing to point out that my poems (uncensored by that publication) satirised both sides of politics, that I wrote as many articles for the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> as I wrote poems for Workers Online in 2005, that I have also written pieces for the employers’ magazine <inline font-style="italic">HR Monthly</inline>, have been interviewed by or had my research quoted in such outlets as <inline font-style="italic">Business Review Weekly</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Management Now</inline>, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Business Queensland</inline>, and a large number of newspapers, or that I have also been published in major national and international journals such as <inline font-style="italic">Industrial Relations, International Journal of Human Resource Management, Journal of Industrial Relations,</inline> <inline font-style="italic">International Journal of Manpower, Relations Industrielles, Australian Journal of Labour Economics, International Journal of Employment Studies, Economic and Labour Relations Review, Labour and Industry, Australian Bulletin of Labour</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Asia-Pacific Journal of Human Resources</inline> and by reputable publishers such as Allen and Unwin and Cambridge University Press<inline font-style="italic">.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">While I am deeply concerned by these attempts to portray me as an extremist and terrorist sympathiser, I will not be dissuaded from speaking on industrial relations matters in public. However, my deeper concern is for the impact that such attempts at character assassination have on discouraging informed debate in Australia today.</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">In speaking to the Committee’s report, I want to concentrate on three key issues: the backdrop to the inquiry, the recent advertising campaign for the Government’s WorkChoices reforms and the Committee’s recommendations for reform of this contentious area of government expenditure.</para>
<para class="block">Concern has been expressed at various times by members and Senators on all sides of politics about government advertising campaigns. This inquiry arose out of concern about the escalating costs of Commonwealth government advertising since 1996, and about the political nature of particular advertising campaigns.</para>
<para class="block">Expenditure on Commonwealth government advertising has climbed steadily since 1991-92. Between 1991-92 and 1995-96, the average yearly advertising expenditure through the Central Advertising System was $85.6 million. Between 1996-97 and 2003-04, the average yearly expenditure on advertising rose to $126.75 million – an increase of 48%.</para>
<para class="block">The median expenditure over the whole period from 1991-92 to 2003-04 was $97 million. Expenditure by the Howard government since 1996-97 averages $29.75 million more than the median. By contrast, expenditure by the Keating Labor government prior to 1996-97 averaged $11.4 million less than the median.</para>
<para class="block">If the bi-partisan advertising campaigns for Defence Force Recruitment are excluded, the next nine most expensive advertising campaigns since 1991 have all been conducted by the Howard Government.</para>
<para class="block">These cold hard facts demolish the claims of the minister, Senator Abetz, that the Howard government’s spending on advertising since 1996 is comparable to, if not restrained, by the standards of state and previous federal governments. On the contrary, the expenditure figures clearly show that current Commonwealth government spending on advertising is excessive and that the costs to taxpayers of such expenditure are steadily increasing.</para>
<para class="block">Nowhere are these disturbing trends more apparent than in relation to the government’s recent WorkChoices campaign. The first glaring problem with the WorkChoices campaign is that it was conducted before the legislation was even introduced into the parliament. Advertisements were published and broadcast in July 2005 and October 2005. The relevant legislation was not introduced into Parliament until 2 November 2005.</para>
<para class="block">Not a shred of detail about the legislation was included in these advertisements. They said nothing to inform employers or employees about how the proposed reforms will operate or affect them. Rather than information, the advertisements amounted to little more than opinion, assertions and slogans.</para>
<para class="block">There is a word for such a campaign and that word is: propaganda.</para>
<para class="block">The WorkChoices campaign also highlights concerns about the profligacy of current government advertising. The total cost of the campaign is now estimated to be $55 million, well up from earlier estimates. The advertising costs alone are estimated to be between $38.3 million and $44.3 million.</para>
<para class="block">Six million information booklets were printed for distribution but only 178,000 have been dispatched. 458,000 were pulped so the word ‘fairer’ could be inserted into the title at the expense of $152,944. This wastefulness is outrageous.</para>
<para class="block">The recent High Court judgement on the WorkChoices campaign has also served to expose two further matters of concern.</para>
<para class="block">First, the judgement makes plain that under the financial management framework erected since 1997, the Parliament has limited ability to determine how much money is available for particular purposes or the purposes for which money is to be spent. The Committee considers that this is a significant issue that should concern the whole Parliament. Accordingly, it recommends that the question of the impact of outcome budgeting for appropriations on the accountability of, and Parliamentary control over, government expenditure should be referred to a Senate Committee for inquiry and report.</para>
<para class="block">The second implication of the High Court’s judgement is that because of the government’s freedom in relation to the expenditure of its appropriations, there is almost nothing in the appropriations process itself that will provide any restraint on government expenditure on politically contentious advertising activities.</para>
<para class="block">In the Committee’s view, there are two major mechanisms required to deal with these concerns about government advertising. The Committee has made a number of recommendations in relation to both mechanisms.</para>
<para class="block">In terms of transparency, the current disclosure arrangements make it virtually impossible to calculate the total expenditure on government advertising over any one financial year. There is no single reference that reports total annual expenditure on government advertising. The PM&amp;C annual report provides only the cost of buying media time and space to place advertisements. Other costs are not easily found as they are scattered throughout the annual reports of other individual departments responsible for individual campaigns, and even then these costs are not reported consistently.</para>
<para class="block">The timeliness of the provision of information is almost as important for accountability purposes as the availability of information. In this regard, I draw the Senate’s attention to the fact that the minister and departments had still not provided answers to questions on notice, despite a number of requests, at the time of finalising the report.</para>
<para class="block">To address these shortcomings, the Committee recommends a series of measures to substantially increase the disclosure of information about government advertising activities and expenditure. The Committee considers that the Australian government should take as a model the new Canadian system of disclosure of information about government advertising. The Committee recommends that the Government Communications Unit within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet publish a detailed annual report on government advertising from 2005-06 onwards.</para>
<para class="block">Major improvements to the guidelines for government information activities are also recommended. The current guidelines are ten years old and were written in a very different context. Further, the guidelines as they currently stand, are not being met by the government. The guidelines were not designed to address the major question before this inquiry namely the potential for the misuse of government advertising for political advantage.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee considers that the guidelines proposed in a recent report by the JCPAA, which combine both the essential elements of the 1995 guidelines as well as improvements suggested by the Auditor-General, provide a comprehensive set of principles and guidelines for government advertising. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the Government update the current guidelines as a matter of urgency and adopt the guidelines proposed by the Joint Committee on Public Accounts and Audit, with two amendments as specified in the report.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee considers that a measure is required to ensure independent scrutiny of advertising campaign content. This scrutiny needs to address the potential impact of government advertising campaigns in content as well as fiscal terms.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee recommends that once the creative content of an advertising campaign valued at $250,000 or more has been finalised, the advertisements must be submitted to the Auditor-General for assessment. The Auditor-General would be required to report back to the department incurring the advertising expenditure and the relevant portfolio minister whether the campaign complies with the guidelines on government advertising, and the extent of any non-compliance.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee has also recommended that every six months, the Auditor-General must table a report in the Parliament which details his or her assessment against the guidelines of the advertising campaigns that have been implemented during that six-month period.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee also notes that this proposal does not require that government advertising campaigns are approved by the Auditor-General before they can be run, nor that the Auditor-General may direct the withdrawal of an advertising campaign. Rather, government advertising campaigns are simply certified as complying with the guidelines or not, and a report on the extent of any non-compliance made available to the Parliament and the public. This counters the objection that the proposal would politicise the office of the Auditor General.</para>
<para class="block">In concluding, I should note the Committee’s concern at the personal attacks made during the inquiry by the Minister, Senator Abetz, on other witnesses, particularly the Clerk of the Senate. These attacks were unwarranted and involved factual errors and serious misrepresentations.</para>
<para class="block">Finally, I particularly thank my Committee colleagues for all their hard effort and work on not only this inquiry but also the other major inquiries the Committee has conducted during the year. It has been a busy year and we have handed down a number of important reports. On the Committee’s behalf, I also thank the secretariat—Alistair Sands, Matt Keele, Alex Hodgson and especially Sarah Bachelard—for all their help and effort.</para>
<para class="block">I commend the report to the Senate.</para>

<para>—I would like to read the final paragraph. I particularly thank my committee colleagues for all their hard effort and work on not only this inquiry but also the other major inquiries the committee has conducted during the year. It has been a busy year and we have handed down a number of important reports. On the committee’s behalf, I also thank the secretariat—Alistair Sands, Matt Keele, Alex Hodgson and especially Sarah Bachelard, who worked intensively on this report—for all their help and effort during the year.</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">I stand to speak to the tabling of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee Report into Government Advertising and Accountability with a sense of great regret.</para>
<para class="block">This report lays bare the aggressive misuse of money by the Coalition Government.</para>
<para class="block">It lays bare its defiance of proper accountability mechanisms.</para>
<para class="block">It lays bare the failure and powerlessness of the Parliament in controlling or restraining government spending on politically contentious advertising activities.</para>
<para class="block">It lays bare how the appropriations process has been perverted to permit almost ‘anything goes’ in spending this area.</para>
<para class="block">The report must now form the foundation of a strong, consistent, political and public campaign to try to implement water-tight accountability mechanisms for government advertising.</para>
<para class="block">The Report must become the catalyst for political accountability activism involving elected parliamentarians, the media, the community and all citizens.</para>
<para class="block">This issue concerns all Australians because it affects all Australians. Because the tens of millions of dollars that are poured into partisan television and radio commercials, newspaper ads, flashy booklets and flyers are diverted from funding essentials services and infrastructure.</para>
<para class="block">If we want more money for health, if we want more money for education, if we want more money for the environment and our roads then we have to demand that the Coalition Government reign in its spending on improper government advertising.</para>
<para class="block">The committee found that</para>
<para class="block">“expenditure on Commonwealth government advertising has climbed steadily since 1991-92. Between 1991-92 and 1995-96, the average yearly expenditure through the Central Advertising System was $85.6 million. Between 1996-97 and 2003-04, the average yearly expenditure was $126.75 million.”</para>
<para class="block">The committee also found that</para>
<para class="block">“excluding the bi-partisan advertising campaigns for Defence Force Recruitment, the next nine most expensive advertising campaigns since 1991 have been conducted by the Howard Government.”</para>
<para class="block">It is critical to note that the Committee determined that</para>
<para class="block">“the expenditure figures clearly show that the current Commonwealth Government spending on advertising is excessive and that the cost to taxpayers of such expenditure is steadily increasing. The recent advertising campaign on the government’s proposed workplace reforms, the WorkChoices campaign, provides a clear example of this government’s wasteful expenditure and politically partisan advertising”.</para>
<para class="block">I consider the WorkChoices campaign to be the most flagrant, and aggressive abuse of executive authority in advertising thus far by the Coalition Government. Consider the facts:</para>
<para class="block">The campaign is estimated to have cost as much as the total government advertising expenditure for 1996-97. The cash register is still tallying purchases, but so far it looks like about $55 million.</para>
<para class="block">The campaign involved published and broadcast advertisements in July 2005 and from 9 October to 30 October 2005 – months before the legislation was introduced into the parliament.</para>
<para class="block">The campaign advertisements stated opinion as facts.</para>
<para class="block">The campaign provided no evidence to support the Coalition Government assertions.</para>
<para class="block">The campaign provided no information about when the legislation was to be introduced or what effects it would have on individuals.</para>
<para class="block">Lets refresh our memory about the WorkChoices ‘pulping’ incident. The ‘pulping’ incident sounds horrific because it is horrific.</para>
<para class="block">The simple facts are these:</para>
<para class="block">“Six million information booklets were printed for distribution. At 3 November 2005, 157,500 of the six million booklets had been ordered and just over 178,000 had been dispatched. This meant that about 5.8 million booklets were left in the warehouse.</para>
<para class="block">A further 458,000 booklets were pulped at a cost of $152,944. The pulping of the booklets occurred as a result of a government decision, so that the word ‘fairer’ could be inserted into the title, ‘A simpler, fairer, national Workplace Relations System for Australia’.”</para>
<para class="block">I put to the Senate that there is nothing fair about such a blatant abuse of taxpayer money and that this demonstrated blatant disregard for the principles of accountability and stewardship in government spending must stop.</para>
<para class="block">I am proud of the fact that the Australian Democrats have long championed the need for greater controls and accountability in government advertising.</para>
<para class="block">I am proud of the role our party has played in working to ensure this abuse of power became a major political issue that needed to be examined.</para>
<para class="block">In October 2003 the Democrats successfully moved a joint Senate notice of motion with Labor support enforcing an order for tougher controls on government advertising. However, the Coalition Government has simply refused to comply with the order. The repeated abuse of the order is an affront to the Senate, an affront to accountability and an affront to our democracy.</para>
<para class="block">Today the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee challenges the Coalition Government to clean-up its act.</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Democrats support its 13 recommendations in full.</para>
<para class="block">I applaud the Committee for again reinforcing the significance of the Democrats joint notice of motion by recommending the “government comply with the Senate Order of 29 October 2003 relating to agency advertising and public information projects”.</para>
<para class="block">And I again commend the Senate Order to the Coalition Government.</para>
<para class="block">But it is just one measure. The additional 12 Committee recommendations must now be implemented by the Coalition Government.</para>
<para class="block">Briefly, the Coalition Government should conduct or commission a qualitative evaluation of key facets of any campaign, such as value for money, response of target audience and campaign concept and report the evaluation results to the Ministerial Committee on Government Communication. This is just common sense. This is just good business practice.</para>
<para class="block">It is critical that the government implement, as a matter of urgency, a mechanism to monitor and enforce compliance with the guidelines on government advertising activity. This is an essential accountability test.</para>
<para class="block">It just makes sense that every six months the Auditor-General should table a report in the Parliament which details his or her assessment against the guidelines of the advertising campaigns. There must be checks and balances. There must be accountability. There must be protection from abuse.</para>
<para class="block">On 1 July the Government gained control of the Senate. It saddens me greatly that the Senate has been transformed from a legitimate House of Review to a chamber that is manipulated to suit the Coalition Government’s political agenda. The guillotine and gag provisions are now routinely employed on significant bills. Committee references are shortened or truncated. Our democracy is diminished.</para>
<para class="block">In November 2004, the Senate referred the issue of government advertising and accountability to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee for inquiry. Today the Committee reports to the Senate.</para>
<para class="block">The Chair, Senator Forshaw and the Secretariat deserve our thanks for a thorough effort.</para>
<para class="block">I have stood in this Chamber for more than 9 years periodically arguing this case, and I consider this report to be an important milestone.</para>
<para class="block">It is a landmark attempt to try to improve government accountability.</para>
<para class="block">It is a landmark attempt to quantify government abuse of taxpayer money.</para>
<para class="block">It is a landmark attempt to send a message to the government that people are watching and they do not like what they see.</para>
<para class="block">It warrants attention and action for many reasons of efficiency, probity, accountability and integrity. It also warrants remembering because it is perhaps, the last report of its kind that will be tabled in the Senate for many years of Coalition dominance to come.</para>
<para class="block">The Senate is not as it was. Our democracy is not as it was.</para>

<para class="italic">The speech read as follows—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I wish to first congratulate the committee staff on their tireless assistance and advice, namely Alastair Sands and Sarah Bachelard, and committee deputy chair Senator Watson.</para>
<para class="block">When referred by the Senate on 23 June 2004 the terms of reference of the inquiry were worded to examine all government spending since 1996. In the current parliament, the Opposition-dominated committee subsequently restricted the terms of reference to only Commonwealth advertising, presumably to protect the Labor states from scrutiny. As a result, the majority report tabled today is partisan. A skewed set of terms leading to a skewed report.</para>
<para class="block">As an aside, Commonwealth advertising between 1996 and 2003 amounted to approximately $929 million. State Government advertising campaigns over the same period cost taxpayers more than $2.15 billion. I note that the Bracks Government has just embarked upon a re-election advertising spree.</para>
<para class="block">This inquiry did not receive the flood of public interest the Opposition predicted. Indeed only 13 organisations and individuals made submissions, and three of those were the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Special Minister of State and the Clerk of the Senate.</para>
<para class="block">The Clerk made five written submissions and contributed oral testimony, which I will touch on shortly.</para>
<para class="block">Senator Watson and I address the four main issues arising from the inquiry in the minority report.</para>
<para class="block">Firstly, the government is justified in its government advertising expenditure. Ad spend can not be fully addressed in terms of quantum of expenditure. Governments have an obligation to inform citizens of their rights and responsibilities, of their entitlement to benefits or of changes to government policy that will impact upon their lives.</para>
<para class="block">Immunisation, healthy eating or cancer screening awareness campaigns do not promote one side of politics or the other. Similarly defence force recruitment campaigns do not reflect partisan policy.</para>
<para class="block">Government advertising can result in net savings. The ‘Keeping the System Fair’ education campaign announced in the 2004/2005 Budget and which commenced recently is estimated to save taxpayers $214.9 million over four years by improving compliance among welfare recipients.</para>
<para class="block">As Senator Watson and I have emphasised in the minority report, government advertising can not be measured by the quantum of expenditure.</para>
<para class="block">Our second point is that suggestions for independent review of all government advertising have some merit, but arguments against these proposals outweigh the benefits.</para>
<para class="block">Independent review assumes that the basis of criticism of a campaign lies with the nature of the advertising, rather than the policy content of the advertising. The two are inseparable.</para>
<para class="block">The Opposition’s outrage at the WorkChoices advertising campaign is matched only by its anger over the changes we are making to free up the antiquated industrial relations system.</para>
<para class="block">The High Court bench ruled in the Government’s favour – against the ACTU and the Opposition – that the WorkChoices campaign was legitimate.</para>
<para class="block">Justice Dyson Heydon noted on 29 July that the ACTU case was:</para>
<para class="block">really a political dispute. Courts tend to be reluctant to interfere in political disputes.</para>
<para class="block">Another problem with independent review is that to date no one – no public servant, no MP, no witness to committee hearings – was able to devise a clear, objective statement of what constitutes political or non-political advertising. The lines are blurry and open to interpretation, and invariably coloured by the political or professional persuasion of the interpreter.</para>
<para class="block">A lesser problem is the cost of independent scrutiny prior to every government advertising commencing. Funding would be required for an oversight body and departments would carry increased compliance costs and additional staff.</para>
<para class="block">Opposition Senators on the committee have not provided any evidence to suggest that any of the campaigns run since 1996 would not have proceeded had they been subject to independent review.</para>
<para class="block">This proposal is fine in theory, but is unworkable, impractical and I do not believe there is sufficient cause to adopt it as policy.</para>
<para class="block">The third point raised in some submissions to the inquiry is that government advertising campaigns are illegitimate without a legislative base. This was largely raised in response to the WorkChoices campaign, which commenced before the draft legislation was finalised.</para>
<para class="block">Witnesses who advocated this change to advertising policy had not considered the majority of government campaigns – AIDS awareness, health promotion, anti-domestic violence, anti-smoking, Australian citizenship, Defence Force recruitment – none of which have a legislative basis.</para>
<para class="block">The final and most disappointing aspect of the inquiry was the nature of evidence by the Clerk of the Senate.</para>
<para class="block">The Clerk made several submissions to the inquiry, in the course of which he deviated from his role as an independent procedural adviser to the Senate, to present highly contentious policy advice. Odgers Australian Senate Practice, edited by the Clerk, nominates the functions of the Clerk:</para>
<para class="block">The Clerk of the Senate is the principal adviser in relation to proceedings of the Senate to the President, the Deputy President and Chair of Committees, and senators generally... the departmental head of the Department of the Senate... [and] secretary and adviser to the Procedure Committee.</para>
<para class="block">The Clerk is an administrator and technical adviser in relation to the procedures and prerogatives of the Senate. His role does not extend to advice on the relative merits of public policy.</para>
<para class="block">The Clerk’s expertise and experience is vital to the stability and integrity of the legislative process. It is therefore a very serious matter when the Clerk raises allegations of government corruption which he can not substantiate. In particular, Government Senators were concerned about the following remarks made by the Clerk:</para>
<para class="block">The other problem which has been perceived in government advertising is the cross-subsidising of party political advertising. It is suspected that advertising firms accept lower fees for advertisements paid for by the party in power with an assurance that more lucrative government advertising contracts will fall their way. In effect, the expenditure on the government advertising projects subsidises the party political advertising of the government party. This is tantamount to corruption.</para>
<para class="block">In oral and written evidence to the Committee, the Clerk claimed that in referring to these perceptions and suspicions he was not himself supporting these allegations, but merely reflecting concerns that had been raised in the Senate chamber. The Clerk did not provide references in his written submissions to support the claim that he was merely repeating assertions made in the Senate. Nor was the material to hand:</para>
<para class="block">Mr Evans - We could go through an exercise of assembling all the references in the literature to support that statement. I hope you do not ask me to do that, but I could.</para>
<para class="block">Upon request the Clerk did submit Hansard references in support of his assertions. He referred the committee to 25 speeches made in the Senate. All were by Labor Senators: ten from Labor Senator Robert Ray, nine from Labor Senator John Faulkner, and the remaining six from other Labor Senators. Despite the partisan nature of the evidence, the Clerk denied this was an issue.</para>
<para class="block">The Clerk who provided his own constitutional advice as to whether monies for the WorkChoices campaign were legally appropriated. The High Court has subsequently rejected, by a 5-2 majority, the Clerk’s interpretation.</para>
<para class="block">Government Senators respect the role of the Clerk as a procedural adviser to the Senate and Senators. They do not believe there is a role for the Clerk as an adviser on either policy or public administration.</para>
<para class="block">Government Senators consider that the intervention of the Clerk in relation to these matters was unwise, outside his remit and needlessly opened the Office of the Clerk to allegations of political partiality.</para>
<para class="block">In tabling the minority report into this inquiry, I restate my disappointment with the outcome of the inquiry and once again thank the committee and secretariat staff for their co-operation and assistance.</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">This is a timely and important report.</para>
<para class="block">Notwithstanding the best efforts of the Special Minister of State to intimidate and denigrate witnesses, on balance the evidence confirms that the Inquiry’s recommendations are valid and should be implemented without delay.</para>
<para class="block">My colleague Senator Forshaw has outlined those recommendations, and so I will not canvas them again in detail.</para>
<para class="block">Suffice it to say that the emphasis of these recommendations on providing a transparent and accountable method of monitoring and auditing government advertising is entirely warranted and overdue.</para>
<para class="block">Despite the efforts of the Special Minister of State, obviously a minister in denial, to claim that such regulation and monitoring is not possible, it is now clear from international precedents that not only is such action on the part of government possible but it can also be highly effective.</para>
<para class="block">Senator Forshaw, speaking for the majority of the Committee has already made a cogent case for the implementation of this Inquiry’s recommendations.</para>
<para class="block">I would like to dwell, for a moment, on some of the impediments that the government sought to place in the way of this inquiry.</para>
<para class="block">I will conclude by referring to evidence to the Committee that was delayed but is of singular importance nevertheless.</para>
<para class="block">During the course of this inquiry Government denigration of witnesses reached new heights.</para>
<para class="block">While the Special Minister of State’s gratuitous attacks on the Clerk of the Senate for daring to make a submission that did not echo the Government’s own position on advertising has attracted most publicity, his intervention did not stop there.</para>
<para class="block">One of his additional submissions proved to be nothing more than a serial attack on every submission or possible witness who did not agree with his own particular view that this government should be free to spend as much public money as it likes on promoting itself.</para>
<para class="block">This sort of serial harassment of witnesses by a minister is most unedifying, and has been deservedly condemned.</para>
<para class="block">When he was not abusing witnesses, the Special Minister of State went to considerable pains to reassure all concerned that the two key Coalition media managers, the Government Communications Unit (GCU) and the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications (MCGC) were nothing more than coordinating bodies, there to assist Departments with the efficient delivery of advertising campaigns developed within the departments themselves.</para>
<para class="block">Senator Abetz would have us believe that these are rubber stamps; that the responsibility for the content and timing of advertising campaigns rests with individual departments.</para>
<para class="block">Of course, he has to adopt this position for to accept anything else is to acknowledge that these two bodies have a directly political role and their significance in dictating the content and timing of the political advertising campaigns run by the Coalition.</para>
<para class="block">These two bodies are not politically neutral: are not simple administrative offices.</para>
<para class="block">Instead, they are political operations, charged with the effective delivery of party propaganda: of Coalition propaganda.</para>
<para class="block">So we had the ludicrous situation where Senator Abetz was trying to convince an incredulous public that the $55 million spent recently on the failed IR campaign showed that it was “just another campaign”!</para>
<para class="block">Just like James packer in recent court hearings, during the course of the Inquiry Senator Abetz and his principal advisors often seemed to have difficulty recalling particular meetings or decisions.</para>
<para class="block">Many important questions were taken on notice.</para>
<para class="block">Given this Government’s record of obstructionism, it is hardly surprising that many replies were not received until shortly before the Committee was due to report.</para>
<para class="block">However, documents obtained on notice and under F0I now comprehensively demonstrate the true role of the GCU and the MCGC.</para>
<para class="block">In terms of the recent IR campaign, a key MCGC meeting took place on the 5th July this year. This was one of those meetings that the witnesses from the prime ministers department could not recall.</para>
<para class="block">That is really quite surprising, because documents now to hand show that that meeting considered detailed costings for the program and a much more coordinated campaign than has previously been admitted.</para>
<para class="block">By the time of that meeting, not only had control of this campaign been taken out of the hands of the department of employment and Workplace relations, but that department was being told by the GCU what to do, who to speak to and what costs would be incurred.</para>
<para class="block">The media politicians in the GCU were pulling the strings, not the Department.</para>
<para class="block">So much for Senator Abetz’ claims that the GCU did not initiate advertising strategy or dictate the terms of advertising campaigns.</para>
<para class="block">These documents also make it clear that the timing and duration of the IR campaign was a highly political decision.</para>
<para class="block">Planning was being done for both a one week advertising blitz and a sustained campaign.</para>
<para class="block">It is clear that the Government’s media advisors were planning a political strategy.</para>
<para class="block">If a one week knock out worked, well and good. If not, then contingency plans were ready for a protracted campaign to try and impose the Government’s perverse IR principles on the public.</para>
<para class="block">As I have already argued, these documents shed more light on the operations of the government’s media hit squad, the GCU.</para>
<para class="block">Senator Abetz has repeatedly argued that the GCU was there to assist departments in coordinating their advertising campaigns.</para>
<para class="block">In other words, initiative lay with individual departments and not with the GCU.</para>
<para class="block">Nothing could be further from the truth.</para>
<para class="block">We now know that the GCU is first and foremost an instrument of government propaganda.</para>
<para class="block">It doesn’t advise departments, it tells them what to do.</para>
<para class="block">It doesn’t simply provide shortlists of potential consultants, it indicates who it wants to be chosen.</para>
<para class="block">The GCU acts as a bridge between the government and its network of media and marketing mates (such as Ted Horton and Mark Pearson.)</para>
<para class="block">How do we know this?</para>
<para class="block">The documents now publicly available reveal that detailed information on media, PR and research costs and a preference for particular media placements for the IR campaign were requested by the GCU and NOT by DEWR.</para>
<para class="block">In other words, it was GCU dictating placements to maximise the propaganda value for the government.</para>
<para class="block">These documents demonstrate that the GCU was even dictating who from within shortlisted firms could pitch for the work.</para>
<para class="block">So, on 15 July the GCU Director of Government Advertising was instructing DEWR, and I quote:</para>
<para class="block">“With Young and Rubicam, we have suggested you contact the CEO who is based in Sydney but you will need to explain that that you want the Melbourne Branch of the agency to pitch for the work].”</para>
<para class="block">Why?</para>
<para class="block">Because Liberal Party mate Ted Horton’s home turf and only office location is in that firm’s Melbourne office.</para>
<para class="block">GCU were leaving nothing to chance!</para>
<para class="block">Finally, we now have evidence that the GCU uses the hint of political favours to ensure compliance and support for its propaganda campaigns.</para>
<para class="block">On 15 July again, that same Director of government Advertising emailed a contact in HMA Blaze, a firm responsible for the media booking of “ INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS campaign radio commercials.</para>
<para class="block">In thanking him for their efforts, she continued:</para>
<para class="block"> “This support is noted and appreciated in all the right quarters.”</para>
<para class="block">Fifty three minutes later she sent the same email to what she so quaintly refers to as “the right quarters”.</para>
<para class="block">Who did it go to?</para>
<para class="block">To none other that Greg Williams, a senior staffer in the Prime Minister’s Department.</para>
<para class="block">The Prime Minister’s Department is deeply involved in shaping these campaigns and sharing out the political favours.</para>
<para class="block">Not only is Mr Williams deeply involved in his capacity as head of the Communications Unit but these emails also show that Mr Tony Nutt, the Prime Minister’s principal private secretary was also involved directly involved in the campaign, seeking, and receiving, detailed information on campaign costs and media placements.</para>
<para class="block">We are watching the operations of a highly-centralised, powerful propaganda unit, established to maximise party</para>

<para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I rise today in my capacity as deputy chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration to speak on the committee’s report on detention centre contracts tabled just now. The Joint Standing Committee on Migration was given the task of reviewing an audit undertaken by the Australian National Audit Office. This audit assessed DIMIA’s management of its contract with Global Solutions Ltd, known as GSL. Senators will not be surprised to learn that the Australian National Audit Office uncovered myriad problems in the way the contract had been drafted and managed by GSL.</para>
<para>It has not been a very good year for DIMIA or the minister. I expect that Senator Vanstone will look back at the end of this year and declare 2005 to be her annus horribilis. DIMIA has come in for extensive and warranted criticism. In August, I stood here in the Senate and spoken about the Palmer report, which reviewed, as we know, the circumstances of the detention of Australian citizen Cornelia Rau. Mr Palmer revealed systemic departmental and administrative failures within DIMIA. He said that DIMIA needed a complete cultural shake-up. He accused the department of developing policy, procedures and enabling structures ‘on the run’. If this were not bad enough, shortly afterwards we saw the release of the Comrie report into the deportation of Vivian Solon. Mr Comrie backed up many of Mr Palmer’s findings. He described DIMIA’s management of the Solon case as ‘catastrophic’, saying that her removal was:</para>

<para class="block">We all know that Cornelia Rau and Vivian Solon were not isolated cases. Today I intend to speak on the findings of the report that was tabled today. The contract between DIMIA and Global Solutions was signed in August 2003. It is a four-year contract with an option to extend for up to three years. The annual cost of the contract is approximately $90 million, excluding overheads and administrative costs. GSL is contracted to operate all of Australia’s immigration detention centres as well as what are called immigration reception and processing centres. The ANAO’s audit into DIMIA’s management of detention centres was conducted in three stages. The audit report that I am referring to today is part B.</para>
<para>I am aware of the fact that there is a guillotine which is going to cut in in just two minutes time. I have a great deal that I wish to say in relation to this matter. It was a most comprehensive report that the committee undertook. We spent a considerable amount of time looking over the contract that DIMIA entered into with GSL, identifying the problems that exist in the contract. But we are in the situation here today where the guillotine is going to cut in and we are simply not going to be able to examine what I think is a very important matter. One thing that has really been highlighted this year, if I may say so, is the total failure, the incompetence of DIMIA—</para>

However, I do want to highlight the fact that it seems to me a most unfortunate circumstance that, at a time such as this, we are being cut short and that essentially we are being gagged. I am aware that two of my other colleagues from the committee—Senator Parry and another senator—did wish to speak on this matter, but I am aware of the fact that there is now half a minute remaining and those senators are not going to be able to speak on this matter. I think it is just another example of the time constraints that we as senators and the Senate have been placed under during this week as a consequence of the way this government has managed this Senate.

<para class="block">The second audit report, the one covered by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration review that I am talking about today, was released by the Australian National Audit Office on 7th July 2005.</para>
<para class="block">The Australian National Audit Office expects to produce a third audit, covering the tender process, before the end of this year.</para>
<para class="block">The audit report, and from now on I will refer to it as ANAO Audit Report No 1. Part B, found several problems, for example:</para>
<para class="block">The contract does not establish clear benchmarks</para>
<para class="block">There are no clear mechanisms to protect the Commonwealth’s interests, and</para>
<para class="block">There is not enough information about the quality of services and costs to allow a value-for-money calculation</para>
<para class="block">In his report, Mr Palmer also slammed the contract. His findings were included in ANAO Audit Report No 1. Part B.</para>
<para class="block">Quoting from the Palmer Report:</para>
<para class="block">“The current detention services contract with GSL is flawed and does not allow for delivery of the immigration detention policy outcomes that are expected by the Government.</para>
<para class="block">It is onerous in its application, lacks focus in its performance audit and monitoring arrangements, and transfers the risk to the service provider.</para>
<para class="block">Service requirements and quality standards are poorly defined, performance measures are largely quantitative and of doubtful value. The contract leaves the Commonwealth exposed to the risks inherent in the operation of immigration detention facilities”</para>
<para class="block">“The lack of any focused mechanism for external accountability and professional review of standards and arrangements for the delivery of health services is a significant omission.”</para>
<para class="block">As well as problems including a lack of performance measures; and a reliance on the reporting of so-called ‘Incidents’ to determine when standards are not being met, the audit uncovered a very disturbing lack of control over subcontracting arrangements.</para>
<para class="block">Food, maintenance, health and psychological services are delivered through subcontractors. These are essential services. They are central to detainees’ health and welfare. But under current arrangements, DIMIA has very little control over the subcontractors who provide these services.</para>
<para class="block">To give an example, in 2004 DIMIA had to seek GSL’s agreement to engage the Australian Government Solicitor to review the subcontracts!</para>
<para class="block">The ANAO audit stresses that DIMIA has responsibility for service delivery and if the subcontractor does something untoward, the department is still accountable.</para>
<para class="block">DIMIA has been strongly criticised for poor provision of healthcare and mental healthcare to detainees. This needs urgent attention, and as I have already mentioned, when the Migration Inquiry is complete, I will have more to say on this topic.</para>
<para class="block">The audit also found significant problems with duty of care. DIMIA has a duty of care towards all detainees, to ensure their safety and welfare. However, the contract does not clearly indicate GSL’s responsibilities and accountabilities in meeting detainees’ day to day needs, and it was concerned that duty of care its obligations were not being met.</para>
<para class="block">This carefully worded finding is exposed by the Palmer Report which does not beat around the bush, and says that Cornelia Rau’s incarceration revealed, and I quote, a “manifest failure of DIMIA’s duty of care”.</para>
<para class="block">ANAO Audit Report No I . Part B uncovered four other areas that need attention:</para>
<para class="block">The insurance, liability and indemnity aspects of the contract The planning, performance information and monitoring arrangements The financial reporting of the detention function, and Management of Commonwealth assets, specifically the development of an asset register</para>
<para class="block">(The Committee’s Review)</para>
<para class="block">(The Palmer Implementation Plan (PIP))</para>
<para class="block">At the Committee’s hearing DIMIA advised that the Palmer Implementation Plan – which some people are apparently referring to as the PIP!—is being progressed and includes action to address recommendations in ANAO Audit Report No. 1-PartB.</para>
<para class="block">As part of the Implementation Plan, a three-month review is currently underway, by independent consultant, Mr Mike Roche, into the functions and operations of detention and compliance activities and the detention services contract. This review will consider the issues I have already mentioned, and many of the issues identified by the ANAO in its report.</para>
<para class="block">I am also advised that DIMIA has engaged a consultant to review the detention services contract and work out how to fix the problems raised by Palmer and by ANAO Audit Report No. 1- Part B.</para>
<para class="block">However, both I and the committee are concerned that the three-month period allocated for the review is too short. Mr Roche has a huge task. He needs more time.</para>
<para class="block">We do however look forward to seeing how Mr Roche and the so-called PIP plan to clean up yet another mess created by Ruddock and Vanstone – Dimmer and DIMIA.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee will continue to monitor developments in DIMIA’s management of its detention function, and has recommended that once the progress report on the Palmer Implementation Plan initiatives is released in September 2006, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs refer the progress report to the Committee for examination.</para>

<para>—Just for the record, the position of the government is that it opposes the Democrat amendments. It does so on the basis that the Council of Australian Governments agreed that the provisions agreed to in that forum would see a sunset after 10 years and, of course, the bill as introduced by the government delivers on that commitment. In addition, in relation to schedule 7, the Attorney-General has agreed to refer a review of the sedition provisions to the Australian Law Reform Commission, as recommended by the Senate committee. On that basis, it is inappropriate that the government agree to these amendments and the government therefore opposes the amendments.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government is committed to reinforcing the role of the Commonwealth Ombudsman in providing comprehensive oversight of the Australian Federal Police and the government’s expectation is that this extends to the Australian Federal Police’s use of the proposed stop, question, detain, search and seizure powers. That was an issue which, I think, has been raised and I want to give that assurance to the Senate. Furthermore, notices to produce will seek relevant documents otherwise available under search warrant. The benefit of a notice to produce is that it allows businesses to provide documents rather than interrupting their place of business to permit law enforcement officers to seize relevant material. That was another issue that we agreed to canvass in this debate. Furthermore, the Prime Minister is seeking the agreement of his colleagues for the COAG review of the legislation to be informed by a Sheller-type review.</para>
<para>I might also add that we note improvements to the sedition offences, and further note that, in any event, the departmental review will put matters that remain of concern beyond doubt. I summarise those very briefly as a result of discussions and concerns which were expressed earlier, and that fulfils the government’s obligation.</para>

</amendments>
<para class="block">These amendments follow the committee’s recommendations for ensuring that there are sunset provisions. The bill, as it currently stands, provides for a sunset clause of 10 years. No-one, other than the government, could think that that is sensible. It is, as I think I have said, a lifetime in politics. I have not even been in this Senate that long, and I do know that during that time the security environment has changed, this place has changed and the issues that confront us have changed.</para>
<para>The committee made five separate recommendations—(18), (26), (38), (43) and (48)—calling for five-year sunset clauses for different schedules of the bill. However, none of these recommendations have been taken up by the amendments tabled, but as yet unmoved, by the government. Again, it really does, I think, represent another backdown by the Liberal backbench. I called it a backslide earlier; it still is. They moved the recommendations; it is a majority committee report. In days gone past it would have taken a cogent argument from the government to convince us as to why we should not continue with that recommendation and, by and large, it would have been moved and generally supported in this place. But now the government has got the numbers in this place it treats these things less seriously than it used to.</para>
<para>The position, of course, is that they could not stare down Mr Ruddock. Mr Ruddock stared them down and said, ‘I am going to stick to my original position.’ Mind you, in fairness to Mr Ruddock, given the number of amendments that he has agreed to, and given the position of where the Stanhope amendment has moved to, it is perhaps his last fig leaf too—to stand his ground on some of these issues such as the sunset provision and perhaps sedition as well. But there is no justification for it. Clearly there is not. There is no justification for this type of review. There is the ability under Labor’s proposed amendment to ensure that there is accountability and proper scrutiny and that these sorts of provisions should not extend beyond five years.</para>
<para>These amendments provide for a proper sunset clause of five years. This length of time is appropriate to ensure that there is enough time for the legislation to work its way through and to see whether it has any unintended consequences. Above all else, there is the issue, which I think Senator Bob Brown went to, of ensuring that the government does not use these powers in a way which has the potential for abuse, especially where it could cut across a UN convention. Whether or not the government uses the powers appropriately and proportionately is the issue that may arise. If it does arise, why wait 10 years to deal with it? Five years is a more sensible time to ensure that these things can be dealt with.</para>
<para>I also note that reviews of a similar nature, such as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD inquiry into ASIO’s questioning and detention powers, have also called for similar sunset clauses. So the Liberal backbenchers on that committee also think a sunset clause in the questioning and detention powers is appropriate, and I would not be surprised if, in the Liberal Party back room, that they also think that this is appropriate but are not game to stand up and say so out here. That inquiry also recommended a five-year sunset clause for parts of the ASIO Act. Page 108 of the inquiry’s report recommended that the section under review be maintained but amended to allow for a five-year sunset clause.</para>
<para>It would seem that also provides a justification for where the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee also ended up. There were two independent committees. One was a joint committee between the House and the Senate and the other was a Senate committee looking into the legislation. They independently came to the same position, that a sunset provision of five years would much better serve the parliament and, I think, better serve the government. The government has not supported that recommendation, but I ask the minor parties to support it.</para>

<para>—The Australian Democrats will support the opposition amendments. You heard my arguments earlier on behalf of the Democrats. We prefer a shorter time frame for the sunset clause of a three-year period—that is, the life of a parliament. This is exemplified in the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquiry report. We acknowledge that this is a reasonable compromise. It is not our preferred time frame but is a reasonable compromise. As a back-up amendment, we will support it. I hope that the government will at least follow the direction of the Senate committee’s recommendations in this regard, and I indicate our support.</para>

<para>—No, the government have not sought derogation in relation to the covenant mentioned by Senator Nettle. We have not done so because we believe that our legislation accords with that International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I think that also answers a question that Senator Bob Brown posed earlier.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>While I am on my feet, I will answer Senator Brown’s question, which he put on notice earlier, in relation to testimony by Mr Geoff McDonald. The quote from Senator Brown was a selective one in relation to the testimony given by Mr Geoff McDonald, Assistant Secretary, Security Law Branch, at the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquiry into the provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005 on 18 November this year. The particular amendment that was referred to was raised by the DPP with the department on 30 March 2005. However, Mr McDonald, in his answers to the committee, discussed why this amendment was not progressed at that time. That was, firstly, because there was concern not to pre-empt the statutory review required by section 4 of the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act, the Sheller review and, secondly, because the DPP were more focused on giving priority to proposed video-link legislation.</para>
<para>Setting legislative priorities is a balancing act, which can be rapidly modified by changing events. The London bombing on 7 July this year was such an event. After the bombing, there was an opportunity to bring amendments forward as part of the antiterrorism bill and, later, it was given even greater priority in a separate bill because of emerging operational concerns. I will not go into those, because we have seen activity since. Mr McDonald’s full answer is found at pages 10, 12 and 13 of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquiry <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 18 November 2005 in answer to questions asked by Senators Brown, Crossin and Ludwig.</para>

<para>—I thank the minister for that answer. I want to follow on from the comment that the minister made to determine if there is a 10-year sunset clause because the government thinks that this state of emergency or increased rationale for increased security powers will exist for 10 years. People deal differently with the ICCPR question. There is either the issue that you do not believe you have derogated so you have never asked for an exception or you think that an extraordinary emergency or imminent threat is the reason why you need to have legislation and put in place the sunset clause. It has been done differently in different bills. That was the argument around the ASIO legislation, which had a three-year sunset clause. I wonder if there is a government rationale such as: ‘There is an emergency situation we believe will last for 10 years. That is why there is a 10-year sunset clause.’ I would like to hear from the government on that.</para>

<para>—When this matter was discussed by COAG, I think it is fair to say that the leaders of Australian state, territory and Commonwealth governments were of a view that, unfortunately, the situation we find ourselves in in relation to the war on terrorism is not one which is going to go away overnight; it is going to be around for some time to come. I think that was a major reason for the 10-year sunset clause. It was a matter which was discussed and agreed to by COAG, and I think underpinning that was a view that this involves Australia’s national security and the war on terrorism, which will be around for a long time. It was not envisaged that these provisions would be used every day or frequently. Nonetheless, they are powers and measures which are needed in the armoury in the fight against terrorism. That is a brief summation of the discussion which took place between the Prime Minister and the premiers and chief ministers.</para>

</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">Expiry clauses of ten years’ duration do not qualify as genuine sunset clauses. The nature and extent of the terrorist threat cannot possibly be predicted over the forthcoming ten year period, and the government has not presented evidence to suggest that the threat to Australia will be remain constant or will increase over that period. The uncertainty and speculation involved in such predictions point to the need for sunset clauses of reasonably short periods.</para>

<para class="subsection">         (1)    This Act must be read and given effect to in a way which is consistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</para>
<para class="subsection">         (2)    If in any proceedings regarding any matter in relation to this Act a court is satisfied that a provision of the Act is inconsistent with a right arising under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the Convention on the Rights of the Child or the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the court may make a declaration of that inconsistency and the provision of the Act shall be of no effect to the extent of that inconsistency.</para>
</amendment>
</amendments>
<para>Note:   The text of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment is set out in Australian Treaty Series.</para>
<para class="block">This Greens’ amendment says, in good faith with the Prime Minister’s assurances that this legislation is not in contradiction with those crucial international covenants and conventions that Australia has signed, that we empower the court when making a consideration to make sure that is so and that, if there is any inconsistency with this antiterror legislation and our international obligations, the court may find so, make a declaration and ignore this legislation insofar as that inconsistency is concerned. This is, in rough terms, how the ACT’s bill of rights works and it is how legislation overseas works. Most famously, of course, freedom of speech in the United States is always tested before the courts when new legislation is brought down and, as we know, if there is a contradiction with the constitutional rights in America, the courts will find so and will not concede that legislation will be able to override the constitution.</para>
<para>Our Constitution is not clear, not explicit, on these matters. We do not have a bill of rights, but we are signed up to these international conventions and, what is more, the Prime Minister and the government—and I am sure the minister will assure us of this—are certain that this legislation does not interfere with those international commitments to rights that Australians enjoy, in particular civil and political rights, the rights of children and the rights of Australians not to be subject to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It is very clear that the government should be supporting this amendment, and so should all of us. I point to the thoughts of the elder statesman of the Liberal Party, Malcolm Fraser, former Prime Minister, on this legislation. I refer to a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 30 November, in which it is reported:</para>
<quote>
<para>In a scathing attack on his former party, Mr Fraser accused the Liberals of trampling upon democracy in their haste to introduce sweeping new anti-terror laws.</para>
<para>He said Australia had entered a “darker age” in which the once-fundamental human rights of liberty and freedom were being seriously eroded by trumped-up fears of terrorism.</para>
<para>“The departures from the principles underlining the (Menzies) Liberal Party are substantial and serious,” Mr Fraser said in a speech on human rights at the University of Melbourne.</para>
<para>“The party has become a party of fear and reaction.</para>
<para>“It is conservative, not liberal. It has not led in positive directions, it has allowed and, some would say, promoted race and religion to be part of today’s agenda. I find it unrecognisable as liberal.”</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Fraser went on to say, on the issue of terrorism:</para>
<quote>
<para>... “fear and deception have become the order of the day”. He also accused the Government of failing to provide adequate reason for its tough anti-terror laws.</para>
<para>“The Government is really saying on these issues, ‘trust us’, but no part of the history of the coalition’s invasion or occupation of Iraq or of the incident involving children overboard gives any member of that coalition the right to say on these issues, ‘trust us’ ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para>“After the Tampa, after the children overboard, the experience and treatment of asylum seekers, the abandonment of ... Hicks, all suggest that any right to trust has long been destroyed.</para>
<para>“The Government knows that in relation to terrorism that the public is concerned, even fearful and can be made more fearful.”</para>
<para>Mr Fraser said the Howard Government had “long abandoned the middle ground” and had set aside the rule of law and “due process” in its haste to combat terrorism.</para>
<para>“The Government and the Labor Party have both assumed that we cannot fight terrorism and adhere to the basic principles of justice and democracy and the rule of law,” ...</para>
<para>Mr Fraser said the best way to defend a free society was through “adherence to our own principles”.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This Greens amendment is about adherence to our own principles and the bottom line as laid down in international law. Australia has prided itself on being way ahead of international law in protecting political and civil rights. We were fundamentally involved in the establishment of the United Nations, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the measures that are central to this amendment. We say to the government: let the amendment stand or you are indicating directly that you fear and you know that this legislation breaches international conventions to which Australia is a signatory.</para>

<para>—The Australian Democrats support this amendment. That comes as no surprise, given that we moved and circulated a comparable amendment last week and given that our supplementary comments to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee call for the attachment of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention on the Rights of the Child to the legislation. We have made a recommendation in our report that those conventions be incorporated into the bill to allow for them to be regarded in relation to the bill’s operation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Given those of us who were involved in the committee process, some criticisms of this type of amendment have been that it will not necessarily have an impact. We recognise that attachment or incorporation of these conventions into the legislation will not necessarily change the dynamic of the bill or prevent this legislation from potentially breaching human rights obligations contained in those conventions. But what it does do is provide a salient reminder to the legislators of the day, to the government, of what our human rights responsibilities are.</para>
<para>As we all know, and have heard again during these debates, we do not have a bill of rights in this country—and, recognising that this is a separate but I think increasingly related argument, we need one. If this legislation does not put the case for a bill of rights and legislation—obviously talking through a statutory reform process—or a charter of freedoms and rights or a human rights act, then nothing else will. As we have already pointed out, this legislation potentially breaches a number of human rights standards and obligations that we have as a signatory to those conventions to which I referred.</para>
<para>During the committee process, as honourable colleagues would know, I put a series of questions about these issues to a number of witnesses—beginning with the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, PIAC. I asked them about the relationship of the bill to human rights law. In response to questions on that, Ms Jane Stratton, representing PIAC, stated that the bill in its current form has the potential to allow for human rights breaches. In order to ‘get a very clear perspective on the issue of enshrining or making reference to the international laws and conventions in the bill’, I posed the following questions:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">You have given us a list in your submission of rights and freedoms that are potentially affected or could be breached as a consequence of this legislation. What are you seeking to do? How do we ensure proportionality in this bill?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Ms Stratton responded by stating that explicit acknowledgment of international instruments in the bill would be necessary for this purpose. Ms Stratton also raised what the Democrats believe is quite a salient point. She said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If the government is confident that upon its advice there are no human rights problems then why not give the undertaking and give people the assurance that people in every other comparable jurisdiction have by virtue of an independent constitutionally entrenched charter of rights? If we are not to have that, then why not give the assurance in the bill?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Similarly, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, HREOC, ‘endorses the incorporation of international human rights norms into domestic law’.</para>
<para>The Democrats believe that the absence of a bill of rights, a charter of rights or a human rights act in this country places a very clear obligation on the government to incorporate within this bill a consideration for the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. The Democrats feel very strongly about this particular amendment because we believe in the principles and the responsibility enshrined in those covenants—the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We feel very strongly about this amendment and we will be supporting divisions on this amendment and, if need be, a following amendment that will be moved in my name on behalf of the Australian Democrats.</para>
<para>I think Senator Brown is right to quote former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. Certainly his comments on this issue have been quite pertinent. When he says that he is ‘ashamed of the path that this government is leading his party and the nation down’ and when he says ‘this is the sort of law that you would find in tyrannical countries, implemented by what has become a party of fear and reaction’, I think we should take note. As it is out of the mouth of a former conservative Prime Minister, I think we should be paying some heed to his particular concerns in addition to our own.</para>
<para>We will support this amendment and we have one of our own. This reflects our recommendation and indeed our questions and concerns as raised through the Senate committee process. To make clear where people stand, we will support a division on this amendment and, if necessary, a subsequent amendment to be moved on behalf of the Australian Democrats.</para>

<para>—The Labor Party will not be supporting Greens amendment (1) to the <inline ref="R2469">Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline> which has been moved by Senator Brown. One of the things that we have stated in this debate is that, in terms of supporting amendments, the government has moved or will move many amendments that derive from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The opposition will seek to move the remainder of amendments that the government has not sought to pick up. Hopefully we will get an opportunity to move those. That will depend on the time available. We have also looked at this amendment in that light. It is not one of the amendments that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee sought to adopt.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The committee dealt with it in a slightly different way, which is also consistent with the bill and with the amendments proposed by Labor and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. There are, of course, many ways this type of mechanism or convention could be incorporated into domestic law. This is but one mechanism. The difficulty with the mechanism that is proposed in this amendment is that, firstly, it is not one that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee recommended. The committee did not see its way clear to adopt the particular amendment that Senator Brown has moved. Secondly, it has not been tested in the sense of how it would operate. With respect to the way the amendment is intended to work, section 5(2) says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… may make a declaration of that inconsistency and the provision of the Act shall be of no effect to the extent of that inconsistency.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is similar to a states versus federal argument—or section 109 of the Constitution. But that it is a mechanism that is not particularly familiar to domestic judges as to how it would operate, nor is it supported by any reasonable discussion. Before we start to move down a track of adopting that style of incorporation, there should be a greater debate as to whether that is the best mechanism or whether there are other ways to bring about the same effect.</para>
<para>During the committee process, HREOC looked at that as an issue, but they came up with two things. First, they congratulated the government—or at least recognised, if they did not congratulate them—on ensuring that there was a proportionality test within the use of preventative detention orders and how those powers would operate. HREOC sought to strengthen that, which was recommendation 1 in their submission. That was adopted by the committee, which recommended that the bill include additional subclauses in section 105.4 (4) and (6) to require the issuing authority to be satisfied that the purpose for which the order is made cannot be made by less restrictive means. HREOC’s recommendation 17, at page 24 of their submission, states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The issuing Court should be specifically required to consider whether there are less restrictive means of achieving the relevant purpose (protecting the public from a terrorist act).</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is a proportionality test that HREOC sought to include. HREOC did not make a recommendation on the incorporation mechanism that Senator Brown has put forward. That is one other mechanism. HREOC seems to say that this test, the test of proportionality, strengthening the existing test within the legislation, is a better way to go. That is not to say that we should not have the debate about the type of incorporation that Senator Brown proposes today, but it is not something that I think we should simply adopt without a proper and full debate about what other types of mechanisms are available and what other ways we could achieve that purpose—especially when we already have a clear guiding principle from HREOC. That principle says that HREOC do not support the type of mechanism that Senator Brown has proposed and that the test of proportionality could be achieved by recommendations 1 and 17 of their submission—which were picked up by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee.</para>
<para>However, as disappointing as that is, it was not a matter that the government picked up, so the opposition have sought to move that to ensure that there is a proper test. The test is at the point of the operation of the law itself, which concerns the Labor Party, as to how the government will use these powers and whether they will be proportionate, appropriate and adapted to the purpose. They clearly do fall within laws that this government can make. There was significant discussion during the Senate committee hearings and, I suspect, outside it and within it, about these laws. Ultimately, though, when you look at HREOC’s submission to the committee—which I think is a reasonable position from a reasonable commission which is charged with looking after these matters—you could come to the conclusion that this was the appropriate mechanism to use to strengthen the existing bill.</para>
<para>On those grounds alone, the test that Senator Bob Brown is proposing, which has not had that scrutiny, cannot be supported. But as I have said, I think it is something that, as the law develops over time, should not be discarded either. We should continue to revisit that type of mechanism and examine other mechanisms to ensure that our laws are consistent with UN conventions—to ensure that we do follow the principles and do not abandon them, that we do not step over the line but use responsibly those conventions and principles that we have signed up to.</para>
<para>The other thing that might create difficulties is that our judges are not, in that sense, used to using these types of mechanisms of incorporation. It is not a matter that they, as I understand it, have turned their minds to. It is not a test that currently exists or is used in Australian law. So that would be another step that we would have to take to ensure that, if it was to be used, it was used well and appropriately. Therefore, for those reasons, Labor are not of a mind to support the Greens amendment, but we do understand the principle upon which Senator Brown proposes it. We understand that the overarching reason Senator Brown is pursuing it is to ensure that these laws are appropriate, they are proportional and they are adapted to the purpose.</para>

<para>—The government’s view is that the legislation, including the measures relating to preventative detention, control orders and sedition, is consistent with Australia’s obligations under international law, including international human rights law. The government further believes, as do other jurisdictions within Australia, I might point out, that the practice is rather to ensure that the legislation is consistent with those obligations without the need for an express qualification. That is, the inclusion of references to various international instruments is not the chosen method of the Australian government for implementing international obligations. It has done that consistently over a period of time and I believe that other jurisdictions in Australia do the same thing. The government is satisfied that not only are the measures consistent with those obligations but also the legislation contains sufficient safeguards to ensure that its implementation in individual cases will also be consistent.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In keeping with the government’s view that enhancing national security is consistent with protecting human rights, the bill has been developed so that it is consistent with Australia’s international human rights obligations as well as with the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. The government acknowledges that it is important to protect the community from acts of terrorism and it is also important to protect the rights of the individual, and it has taken great care to achieve a balance in this legislation. For those reasons, the government is opposed to the amendment moved by the Greens. The government believes that the legislation is consistent with our international obligations.</para>
<para>While I am on my feet, I just want to correct a matter which was raised by Senator Faulkner in relation to the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Mr Keelty. Senator Faulkner referred to an interview on 8 November, saying Mr Keelty had said that he thought the current powers were sufficient. That was in the context of questioning by Kerry O’Brien about the shoot-to-kill powers, and I think it is important that people realise this: the prior questioning had been about the shoot-to-kill powers. That was the context of the commissioner’s comment. It was not in an all-encompassing way that he said the current powers were sufficient. The Australian Federal Police have made it very clear that they believe that the provisions in this bill are essential and are much needed.</para>
<para>Dennis Richardson, former director of ASIO, also commented on powers, which I think Senator Faulkner mentioned. There are two comments I would make here. Firstly, Mr Richardson made those comments before the London bombing and, secondly, with this bill we are aiming to direct further capacity to the Australian Federal Police and not ASIO. What we are talking about here are measures which can be employed by the Australian Federal Police, not ASIO, and therefore I do not believe Mr Richardson’s comments are relevant.</para>
<para>Finally, I notice that others in the chamber cited comments by Malcolm Fraser with approval. I note for the record that Senator Ludwig was not one of them. But they might also cite with approval Mr Fraser’s use of the armed forces in the 1970s when he was Prime Minister, after the Hilton bombing. I think Mr Fraser as the then Prime Minister was rather zealous in his application to looking out for matters of national security in that case and in calling out the Australian defence forces. Those who cite him with approval might also cite his actions with approval or perhaps try to distinguish them.</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">Isn’t that so telling? Australia is eroding its position to talk about and defend human rights, including freedom of speech, in the rest of the world. Not only that, the opposition is doing it. I am astonished that Labor is voting against the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights being upheld in this chamber. I am astonished that Labor is voting against the rights of the child, as in international law being upheld and reiterated in this chamber. I am astonished that Labor is saying, ‘We won’t uphold writing an international covenant into the legislation ensuring that citizens are not subjected to torture or cruel and inhuman punishment.’ ‘We’ll take the word of the government,’ says Senator Ludwig, who is now talking to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, in ignorance of this debate. This is a very serious matter. Where is this nation, when the government, with forked tongue, says that on the one hand this legislation does not cut across these fundamental rights of human beings in our country but on the other hand says that it will not allow that to be tested by the insertion, mention and reference to these covenants in a meaningful way in this legislation?</para>
<para>That is astounding enough. Mr Fraser summed it up by saying that Australia is entering a ‘darker’ period. Notwithstanding the cynical contribution from Minister Ellison a moment ago, let me say there is a thing called the wisdom of the elders, and it ought to be taken note of. After a long life, all of us can reflect on the human condition with a wisdom that we did not have when we may have been exercising the power. It is notable that admirals of the fleet, whether from the US, Russia or elsewhere in Europe, who retire will then say, ‘We’ve got to do something about the threat of nuclear weapons.’ That is a very clear example of a later reflection.</para>

Does the government really think these matters are for frivolous intervention when we are under guillotine and wanting to concentrate our minds on matters that are hugely important to Australia? If that is the measure of the government’s contribution today, we certainly are in a darker period. We certainly are in a period of concern. And when the Labor Party says, ‘We’re not going to support this,’ we have to be doubly concerned. There is no alternative amongst the old parties on this matter.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>What is more, the Labor Party is going to support the whole of this legislation when the guillotine falls in about one hour from now. This is a tawdry exercise in taking democracy out of this place. There is a duplicity abroad here from the Howard government, which is manifest in this opposition to this amendment. Of course, if it were dinkum, honest, if its word could be valued and had meaning and if it had integrity, the government would accept this amendment so that the rights of Australians, as written into international law and backed up by ratification of those laws by this nation, shall not be infringed upon by legislation brought through like this. The Prime Minister says they will not be. Then let that be tested in the courts. But, come the test now, that same Prime Minister says, ‘No, I won’t have a court test my word on this.’ Do you know why? It is because the Prime Minister’s word would be found not to be trusted in this matter. It would be found wanting. And he knows that, if this amendment were to go forward to test his word, for the first time we would have an independent arbiter. We would have the courts of this country determine who is right—whether it would be the Prime Minister’s word or our assertion, and the assertions of the legal community in this country, that this law abrogates, erodes, cuts into, the rights as written in international law. ‘Let us have it tested by the court,’ we say. ‘No,’ says the Prime Minister, ‘I cannot withstand that test. I am not prepared to have an independent arbiter. I do not accept that the courts of Australia should judge me in this fashion because they will find me guilty of not upholding international law here.’</para>
<para>The Prime Minister refuses to accept the charge and the challenge because the Prime Minister knows he is guilty of shredding important international conventions with this legislation. What is more, we have found that in the last 10 minutes Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, says the same. He does not want this legislation to have this amendment either, and that is truly astonishing. That is the abrogation of opposition if ever I saw it. That is the failure of opposition and the defence of the rights of the people of Australia.</para>

<para>—I want to pick up on some comments Senator Ludwig just made in the chamber in relation to this amendment. He made some comments to suggest that the opposition would not be supporting this Greens amendment to ensure that this law is consistent with our rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The sentiment of what I understood he was saying was that we had not looked at other ways in which it could be done.

<para>The way in which the Labour Party in the United Kingdom seek to ensure that they comply with international law as it relates to human rights is that they use the same procedure to say, ‘This should be read as being consistent with our international obligations under human rights law.’ Where it is not, the court can make a declaration to say that the law is inconsistent with international treaties and human rights laws. So that is the system that the Labour Party in the United Kingdom choose to operate under.</para>
<para>As others have said, it is disappointing—the mildest way to put it—that the opposition in here has chosen not to take that position. This comment was made today by the president of the Law Council, Mr John North:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Unlike the Labor Party, we’ve put up a decent fight.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Those words ring true for me when I think of the effort put in by the lawyers of this country through their representative body, the Law Council of Australia, to speak up for human rights and to speak out against the detention without trial proposals that are in this legislation. Unlike the Labor Party, the lawyers of this country have at the very least put up a fight, and that is obviously something that the Greens will continue to do.</para>
<para>The other comment I want to make in relation to this particular amendment is that during the committee process we heard from the only person in Australia whose job it is to determine whether or not legislation complies with a human rights act or a bill of rights—that is, Dr Helen Watchirs, who is employed as, I think it is called, the ACT human rights commissioner. Her view—let me just remind you: she is the only person employed to make such a determination in this country—was that this bill does not comply with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in two main respects: the right to a fair trial and the right to liberty.</para>
<para>We have heard from the government that they have a different view. We also know that they have not been prepared to provide any legal advice as to whether or not it complies with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We have had 209 submissions to the Senate inquiry, many of which mention the variety of different ways in which those lawyers—it was predominantly lawyers making submissions—believe that this law did not comply with Australia’s obligations under international human rights law. So the Greens have put forward this amendment which gives the government the opportunity, if they truly believe it complies with international law, to support an amendment which says so. Our amendment says: read this law as though it is consistent with international human rights law. If it is not, the court can say it is not, just as the Human Rights Act operates in the United Kingdom. The Greens amendment says: do we want to ensure that we are consistent with our international human rights obligations? The Greens say that is something we should do. This is the opportunity for the Senate to determine whether or not senators want to ensure that our laws comply with international rights standards, and I ask the Senate to do so.</para>

<para>—It is interesting to hear that from Senator Nettle. Let me say this on behalf of Labor: if you go back and look at the original Stanhope draft, Labor came out swinging. We came out swinging federally to improve upon that bill. We came out with the states to ensure that the Stanhope draft was not going to be the legislation that we now are faced with. That is clear. We put the proportionality back into this legislation—not the Greens, not the Democrats: Labor. Labor came out with this very early and very hard and, as a consequence, we are not faced with the same bill that would have been foisted on us which the Greens would not have been able to protect or stop. It would have been the Stanhope draft if it were not for Labor, and we continue to fight.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>If you look at the amendments that have been moved by the government, the government did not decide to roll over and play ‘tickle my tummy’ because it thought it needed to. It was pushed, shoved and cajoled to ensure that there was fairness and proportionality in the bill before us. If you look at the legislation committee report, you can see that Labor fought for much better outcomes and sought recommendations. Labor have not only been able to encourage the government to pick up the recommendations made by the committee to make sure the bill is fairer, proportional, appropriate and adapted to the purpose for which it is to be used but also those recommendations that the government did not pick up Labor has put on the table for the government to pick up.</para>
<para>We are not going to stop there. The Greens might walk away from this argument saying, ‘We moved our amendment. We didn’t get it to succeed and we have walked away.’ Labor has said that there are some fundamental principles that we are going to continue to bat on with. We are not going to stop here. We know the reality. We know the reasons for this law, and that is why we support it. We know that it can be better but we are not going to stop at this point. We are going to continue even after this law is made to argue how it can be improved. We have said that time and again.</para>
<para>There should be better scrutiny. There should be better parliamentary oversight. There should be three-monthly reviews. The committee only recommended six months. That is the recommendation on which we will move an amendment here today. We will not move the three months. But that is not to say that we will abandon that. We will continue to push that. We will continue to say that there should be a sunset provision. We will continue to say that there should be a review. We said that when we saw the Stanhope draft and we have continued to say that. We will continue to argue for it. I have no doubt at all that our shadow Attorney-General will continue to progress these arguments to ensure that this government understands that it should have picked up all our amendments. It should have made this bill better. It certainly has moved a fair way from the Stanhope draft and there is still further to go. We are not going to abandon those issues.</para>

<para>—The Australian Democrats do not see the proportionality in this bill. It is not there. Learned lawyers, human rights organisations, Muslim representative groups and community groups have made it very clear that they do not see proportionality evident in this legislation. It ain’t there. It does not matter how many criticisms or barbs are thrown at the crossbenches in this debate, by either of the major parties, to be quite frank. In fact, I am not going to pretend that this is comfortable for Labor. I have seen the squirming. I would be squirming too. To suggest, ‘Hey, we’ve put the P into proportionality,’ is a joke. No-one who has looked at this legislation is going to believe it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Because of the truncated time for debate, a number of serious amendments that highlight the lack of proportionality in this bill, and indeed amendments that attempt to inject proportionality and/or provide safeguards or at least ameliorate some of the worst aspects of this legislation, are not going to be debated. Some of them include the treatment of children. The Democrats are on the record as having explained and outlined our concerns when it comes to the treatment of children aged 16 to 18.</para>
<para>This relates to potential breaches of our international obligations, particularly and specifically in relation to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. During the committee and since, we have heard evidence from a range of organisations that suggest that the Convention on the Rights of the Child would be breached by the proposals under this bill. The Democrats have made it clear from day one that we oppose the application of this bill for children—that is, minors 16 to 18 years of age. We believe that, as it stands, there are potential breaches. There is the possibility of breaches of the Convention on the Rights of the Child under this legislation, most notably, of course, article 37, which provides:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">States Parties shall ensure that:</para>
</quote>
<para class="centre">                  …         …           …</para>
<quote>
<para class="block"> (b) No child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily. The arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time;</para>
<para class="block">(c) Every child deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, and in a manner which takes into account the needs of persons of his or her age. In particular, every child deprived of liberty shall be separated from adults unless it is considered in the child’s best interest not to do so and shall have the right to maintain contact with his or her family through correspondence and visits, save in exceptional circumstances;</para>
<para class="block">(d) Every child deprived of his or her liberty shall have the right to prompt access to legal and other appropriate assistance, as well as the right to challenge the legality of the deprivation of his or her liberty before a court or other competent, independent and impartial authority, and to a prompt decision on any such action.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They are the key areas. I want to know from the minister what makes the government think that they have not breached, or there is not the potential to breach, the Convention on the Rights of the Child. And if they are so convinced that they are not breaching these international human rights, these standards, these obligations, these responsibilities, then let us be honest: this is not a tough amendment. As much as I think some in this place—myself included—would like this amendment to ensure that there is conformity, it does not ensure conformity with the law, nor does the Democrat amendment on this same issue. It attaches, it makes clear, it exposes, it allows people to assess how this legislation deals with our international obligations in light of those particular conventions and those rights. So, if the government is so sure, that should not be a threatening amendment. It should not be a threatening amendment for the opposition either.</para>
<para>Amnesty International has said that the control order provisions in this bill potentially breach article 40 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Article 40, as we know, provides that a child is presumed innocent until proven guilty; yet the operation of control orders imposes a penalty without charge or the opportunity to answer a charge. So there is a potential breach there. Protection against threats to these rights can be guarded against, or at least could be exposed, by enshrining, as this amendment attempts to do, this convention and others in the legislation. I might add, because, again, I do not think we will get the chance when these amendments are subject to specific debate, that the Democrats have put on record in our committee report the comments of the Northern Beaches Civil Rights Forum in relation to the issue of child advocates:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Child advocates should be provided for children subject to preventative detention orders and control orders; and for those affected by proximity to other individuals subject to such orders.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I was going to move an amendment on this but I can tell that in the interests of time it is not going to be debated and it is probably not going to be voted on in terms of a division, so there is probably little point in pursuing that matter. But I just want to make this very clear: we and other people believe that this bill allows for the transgression of specific rights as they are afforded to children. We believe that children are affected in a deleterious, retrograde way by this bill. I want to know why the government are so convinced that their legislation is in conformity with our international obligations. If they are, what is the threat of this amendment? It should not really be a threatening amendment. But I particularly want to know how children are going to be protected under this bill and I want it on the record.</para>

<para>—Can I make it very clear that we do not believe that the provisions offend any international obligation that Australia has—as I have said previously. A preventative detention order will only be able to be made against a person aged between 16 and 18 where the issuing authority is satisfied that the order will substantially assist in preventing an imminent terrorist attack occurring or to preserve evidence of a recent terrorist attack. Article 37(b) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child states:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">No child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily. The ... detention ... of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time;</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The test to ensure the detention is not arbitrary is whether it is reasonable, necessary, proportionate, appropriate and justifiable in all the circumstances. The government is satisfied that the preventative detention regime in the legislation meets Australia’s obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child in that the detention will not be arbitrary, will only be available in relation to an imminent or recent terrorist attack and will be for the shortest appropriate time. Clause 105.39 provides that a detainee over 16 but under 18 can also have contact of two hours at a time with his or her parents or guardians, unless one of those people is subject to a prohibited contact order.</para>
<para>We believe that for those reasons those provisions do not offend the rights of the child, and we are confident that this legislation is constitutional and abides by our international obligations.</para>

</amendment>
</amendments>
<para class="block">This amendment relates to the review mechanism. This was an issue that was highlighted by the Senate report. Recommendations 17, 25, 28, 30, 39, 44 and 49 of the committee report all sought to ensure that there were review mechanisms. As part of its recommendations, the committee indicated that it wanted wide-ranging reviews of the effect and impact of the bill, particularly in relation to the more contentious provisions—in particular, sedition, preventative detention orders and control orders. The government has indicated that it will hold a review of the sedition provisions of the bill after the passage of the legislation through here.</para>
<para>I would like to put aside the question of why the government are not simply holding the review first. It would seem logical to do it first. It does make more sense, but we do not seem to expect that from the government anymore, since they now have the numbers. Before introducing the sedition provisions, the government must also commit to a review of the provisions of schedule 4 of the bill, which relates to control orders and preventative detention. The Labor Party has moved amendments to ensure that a full public inquiry is held into the operation of that division after five years. It is a matter that the government have started to move towards. If you look at the Sheller report, the government are starting to understand that, with any legislation that they have passed since the original terrorist legislation back in 2001-02, there is a need to continue to be vigilant and to review the legislation to make sure that it is still relevant and appropriate and that there are not any unintended consequences. We also then learn from any operational issues that may arise as well. There are two sides to that coin. One might be the unintended consequences, and the second might be improvements that are necessary or that come to light as the legislation operates.</para>
<para>Given the controversial nature of these provisions, the review is necessary both to allay fears and to ensure that, after a period of time, there is a proper examination of the effectiveness and appropriateness of this schedule. There is much more that I could say about this provision but I do understand there are a couple of other matters that we want to deal with in the remaining half an hour or so that we have. It is a recognition that we are not going to get through all of the amendments of Labor, the Liberals, the Democrats or the Greens. That is a great pity. But, having said that, I will finish my contribution at this point and see if I can gain support if not from the government then at least from their backbenchers or the minor parties.</para>

<para class="subsection">         (3)    The amendments made by Schedule 7 are to be reviewed by the Australian Law Reform Commission.</para>
<para class="subsection">         (4)    A copy of the report of the review required by subsection (3) is to be given to the Attorney-General one year after this Act receives the Royal Assent and the Attorney-General must cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 5 sitting days after the Attorney-General receives the copy of the report.</para>
<para class="subsection">         (5)    If a copy of the report required by subsection (3) is not laid before each House of the Parliament in accordance with subsection (4), Schedule 7 ceases to have effect the day after the day on which a copy of the report is required by subsection (4).</para>
</amendment>
</amendments>
<para class="block">This amendment relates to the review of the sedition provision. The proposal is for a review after one year. As you would know, Mr Temporary Chair, and as honourable senators would be aware, the Australian Democrats are on record as vehemently opposing schedule 7—that is, the sedition provisions—as they are currently in this legislation. I want to make that very clear, because I am moving this review in that context. We understand, given the numbers in this place, that it does not look like those offending provisions in schedule 7 will be removed. Nonetheless, as you will see on your running sheet, the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and others, including, I think, the Greens, have identical amendments to get rid of that provision. But we recognise that we may not be successful.</para>
<para>In light of that, and in light of an announced review by the government, we have moved to amend schedule 7. This amendment involves the expiration of schedule 7 after one year, in the event that a report of a review by the Australian Law Reform Commission has not been completed and laid before each house of parliament by the Attorney-General. So the amendment provides that the commission will give a copy of the review to the Attorney-General, who must cause a copy of the report to be laid before each house of parliament. If the report is not tabled, the schedule will cease to have effect the day after the day on which a copy of the report was required to be tabled.</para>
<para>I think the intent of this provision is clear. If members—particularly members of the Liberal Party who have expressed quite publicly, and otherwise, their concerns with sedition—are relying on the fact that a review is proposed and will take place and if those members of the Senate committee who put forward recommendations relating to reviews of those provisions are feeling safe because of the Attorney-General’s comments and the minor, tinkering changes to the legislation, this just gives added certainty.</para>
<para>This should not be a scary proposal or a scary review. It just makes sure that the government gets back to this chamber within a year. I know how long reviews by governments can take; I know how long governments can take to respond to reviews. Obviously, it is our preference, and it is the preference of many others, that the Australian Law Reform Commission looks into this issue, examines this issue and reports. I certainly do not want to see another repeat of an example I have, I know, often cited in this place. But the Australian Law Reform Commission’s report—essentially yours—that inquiry into genetic privacy, which reported in March 2003, has yet to get a response from government. I know it is under way, and I do not mean to deflect from this debate, but I just want to make it very clear: we propose a one-year review. I know this amendment has support in the chamber. I know it has support from members of the government. I hope they vote for it.</para>

<para>—I will not take up too much time on this amendment. It is one of these difficulties where the principle is clear: Labor has said that this schedule 7 should go to the Australian Law Reform Commission. The Attorney-General should make that reference. He should provide a term of reference which is broad enough to include what those issues are, and it should be dealt with there. That is not the case—and I think this is one of the difficulties we get into where the mechanism is not in accordance with what the committee recommended. Therefore it will not gain our support.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In principle it is something that Labor has said should happen. But it is a matter that Mr Ruddock has backed away from. He has indicated that it will be reviewed. It should be reviewed before it is passed here. I doubt, Senator Stott Despoja, that you will get any backbench support. They have found their fig leaf, in the alternative to the committee recommendations dealing with sedition, and they are going to hide behind it. That is all it is. We know it, they know it and I suspect the public know it as well.</para>

<para>—Senator Stott Despoja’s amendment requires that there be a review by the Australian Law Reform Commission. It is no secret that the Attorney-General has said that he will be referring the sedition provisions to the Australian Law Reform Commission, and the supplementary explanatory memorandum reflects this. On the basis of that, the government believe that this is adequately catered for. There is therefore no reason to support the Democrat amendment and we will, of course, be opposing it.</para>

<para class="block">This item amends schedule 1 of the bill in relation to the definition of a terrorist organisation. Item 3 ensures that an organisation can only be listed as a terrorist organisation in circumstances where the organisation praises a terrorist act and there is a risk that such praise might have the effect of leading a person to engage in a terrorist act. That, I think, is a clear provision, and I commend the amendment to the committee.</para>

<amendments>
<amendment>
<para class="ParlAmend">(1)    Schedule 1, item 9, page 6 (lines 2 to 11), <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline>.</para>
</amendment>
</amendments>
<para class="block">This amendment has to do with the definition of advocating a terrorist act. The Australian Greens amendment is to oppose the section. It is a section which we had a significant amount of debate about in the Senate inquiry. It is worth noting that, as in previous inquiries held by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, we were provided with assistance from the Attorney-General’s Department. It indicated that protests like, for example, those outside the front of Woomera Detention Centre at Easter some years ago may well fall under the definition of a terrorist act.</para>
<para>One of the reasons the Australian Greens have a particular objection to this part of the bill is that the definition of a terrorist act is so broad. As I said, we had members of the Attorney-General’s Department indicate to us that they believed it would also include the actions of protesters out the front of somewhere like Woomera Detention Centre. We need to be very aware of and careful about sections like this one, which allow an organisation to be found to be unlawful because it is involved in directly praising the doing of a terrorist act. If a terrorist act is defined that broadly then organisations like the Refugee Action Collective or other groups that advocate activity that the government chooses to define as a terrorist act could be caught in that.</para>
<para>We are well aware from the track record of the government that they are quite willing to use intelligence information to suit their own political agenda. When we look at the way in which definitions around national security were used to support the deportation of the nonviolent peace activist Scott Parkin, it becomes very evident why the Australian Greens, in particular, have concerns about this type of legislation. Every piece of legislation like this, not just in Australia but around the world, has been used against peaceful people who were protesting, whether they were trade unionists, student activists, or feminists who are locked up in Malaysia under the internal security act. The argument put forward for that legislation at the time was that it was about armed communist guerrillas in the mountains. The legislation was then used against a far wider group of people.</para>
<para>We recognise that this legislation will first be used against members of the Muslim community in Australia. It is also clear from the way in which this government is already using its national security powers that it will also be used against peaceful protesters, people like Scott Parkin and others. So we have particular concerns about this part of the legislation. It was something that we were not able to get clear statements on in relation to the government’s intention in this matter.</para>
<para>I now ask the minister about this part of the legislation, which seeks to label an organisation that is seen as praising, urging or counselling the doing of a terrorist act as a terrorist organisation. Could he outline for the chamber at what point the government defines an organisation as having that particular view. Is a statement by the leader of the organisation seen as an indication that the organisation supports, urges or praises the doing of a terrorist act? There was some comment during the committee inquiry that perhaps minutes of a meeting would be needed indicating that the organisation had that view. Other senators rightly pointed out that not every terrorist organisation in the world has meetings for which they keep minutes which could then be used as justification for the view of that particular organisation.</para>
<para>Could the minister indicate to the chamber what the government would require in order to make the determination that a particular organisation held a view about urging, praising or counselling the doing of a terrorist act? That would help the committee to understand the government’s intention behind this legislation, and behind this particular part of the legislation which the Greens now move to oppose.</para>

<para>—At the outset I say that the government opposes the Australian Greens amendment (1) on sheet 4755. This amendment seeks to delete the definition of ‘advocates’ as defined in subsection 102.1(1). This deletion would create more uncertainty. The government took great care when drafting the definition of advocates to ensure that it was clear in its meaning, and deleting it would result in further uncertainty.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Senator Nettle has asked how you can evidence what an organisation says and does. Of course, that relies on organisational principles—that is, how it is structured and how the opinion is expressed. It would be determined on the facts of the case. The definition of advocates in the bill states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In this Division, an organisation <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">advocates</inline> the doing of a terrorist act if:</para>
<para class="block">(a) the organisation directly or indirectly counsels or urges the doing of a terrorist act; or</para>
<para class="block">(b) the organisation directly or indirectly provides instruction on the doing of a terrorist act; or</para>
<para class="block">(c) the organisation directly praises the doing of a terrorist act.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is fairly clear as to what amounts to advocating. It is spelt out there.</para>
<para>The question that Senator Nettle asked goes more to the question of the organisation itself: how do you attach the counselling or the expression to an organisation? I think that is where the Greens miss the point with their amendment. They seek to delete ‘counsels’ or ‘advocates’. With an organisation, a normal interpretation would apply. We understand what an organisation means in common parlance. It is usually a group of individuals who organise themselves, normally in a voluntary fashion, for a common purpose. That is something which I think would apply here.</para>
<para>I just want to correct something that Senator Nettle said—that is, that the evidence of the Attorney-General’s Department during the course of the committee inquiry was that a protest could be seen as a terrorist act. I am advised that Mr McDonald, who appeared for the Attorney-General’s Department, made it very clear that a normal political protest would not constitute a terrorist act. I just want to make that very clear as to the evidence that was given before the Senate committee.</para>

That was the instance to which I was referring, not the comments of Mr McDonald.</para>

<para>—We are running out of time. I would have liked to have said a lot more about this particular amendment. The Labor Party will not be supporting this amendment. It is not consistent with the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee’s findings or our subsequent amendments arising from those findings. The other problem with it goes back to the type of proscription regime that we have in place. We now have a process where those organisations which are proscribed do come back here to the parliament for a check, which I am sure Senator Brown has often recognised as the appropriate place for these things to be scrutinised. That is the system that we operate under. Sedition provisions should be reviewed. The government should also send this off to the Australian Law Reform Commission, but it is not going to do that.</para>

<para>—It goes without saying that what is happening here is that the opposition are saying, ‘We are bound within the limits of what the Senate committee recommended.’ Take that a step further and you see that the committee was represented on the government side by Senator Payne, Senator Mason and Senator Brandis. They made some very strong points, but the government rejected the whole pile of them. However, they did not go to the point of rejecting this legislation as they ought to have or to making the massive changes which would have made it somewhat consistent with international standards or to ensuring that domestic political rights and freedom of speech were assured. You only have to look at the comments from media organisations to see how far short of the mark those recommendations from the committee were in making this legislation safe in terms of protecting free speech and political standards.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What Senator Ludwig is saying is, ‘Our standard here is the same as Senator Brandis’s.’ Senator Brandis came over and congratulated Senator Conroy after his speech last night which, in effect, eulogised what the government is doing here. A senior frontbencher from Labor eulogised this legislation to the point where Senator Brandis and Senator Mason came over and shook hands with him and lauded that speech. It is remarkable politics and a remarkable capitulation by Labor to the government on this legislation. It is a remarkable failure by the Labor Party to stand up not just for international law but also for standards which media organisations, legal organisations and human rights organisations in this country have said are the limits in proportionality.</para>
<para>This is a disproportionate bill. It trespasses against protecting civil rights—that is, the right to free speech, the right not to be held for days, months, weeks and years without charge and the right to have the confidence of your lawyers. These things are broken by this Labor Party and by this government in this legislation. We are going to see the guillotine applied in 10 minutes and Labor collapse into the arms of the government on this sell-out of Australian and international standards in human rights and the right to freedom of speech. That is what we are now confronted with. Labor has aligned itself with Senator Brandis as the arbiter of where the line can be drawn on protecting the rights of Australians against the wishes of the government. Of course, Senator Brandis did not stand by the committee findings at all. Labor is saying it has. It is standing by Senator Brandis’s, Senator Mason’s and Senator Payne’s recommendations of a week ago, even though it will not go quite so far as to the point of their retreat this week at the hands of the executive of the government.</para>
<para>This is an appalling outcome. Both the process and the outcome are wrong. The Australian public expect an opposition with the gumption to stand up against this theft of rights, not least the right of freedom of speech, from the Australian people by the Howard government on this day in the Senate. Instead of that, Labor has capitulated.</para>
<para>Mr Beazley said, ‘We should have included locking down of suburbs when the time comes for a terrorist alert.’ That is in this legislation. Senator Ludwig said, ‘The Chief Minister of the ACT stood up for Labor.’ But we know that he has made it clear that this legislation does not stand by the ACT’s assurance that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights should be upheld. We have just had Labor vote against that, against Mr Stanhope’s line in the sand. Labor has sold out today, as the government erodes the rights of Australians. It is unforgivable. I think Labor sold out on its own history of defending those rights, on its own proud record, today in here. That does not excuse in any way the lead role taken by the coalition. This is the government and opposition versus the people of Australia, as I see it. The defence is on the crossbench, with the Greens and the Democrats. I think the Labor Party will come to rue the day it took the decision to fail to defend even international norms, now long established, in the Senate this evening.</para>
<para>The Scott Parkin affair that Senator Nettle referred to is a classic example of the misuse of laws against a person who was no threat to this country. He never was and never will be, but he was deported without any satisfactory trial because the government did not like his presence in this country. I remember very well Premier Gray bringing laws in to make it an arrestable offence to trespass. After hundreds of years of common law said that could not happen, that was brought in because people were going to protest in their own forests by the Franklin River. You know what? Within three years they were arresting unionists on the Burnie wharf under exactly the same legislation.</para>
<para>Let us make it clear to the opposition that this is done with eyes open, and when these laws are abused and used against people who are not planning, plotting or threatening terrorism in this country, it will be not only because the government brought them in today but because the opposition supported them. There should be a ferocious defence of the rights of people to free speech in this country and to vigorous political opposition, but those rights are being threatened by this legislation here today. It is appalling that the Labor Party under Kim Beazley has capitulated to the government because it is frightened to stand up against the use of fear in politics. This moment will pass and we will have more legislation in here and more erosion. While Mr Beazley leads this party, the opposition will continue to capitulate to the government.</para>
<para>This is an extraordinarily low point in the history of politics and the history of oppositional politics in Australia. It is proposed that an opposition, particularly a Labor opposition—a party of social justice—will stand up for justice and ensure that government does not intrude on the rights of individuals, and the Liberal philosophy says the rights of the individual will be protected, and the best the government, echoed by the opposition, can do in here is say: ‘Security first. The primary right is to safety.’ There has been no explanation in this debate justifying these laws. There has been no logic delivered which says, ‘This would have prevented, for example, the London terrorist attacks,’—we know it would not have—or, ‘This will in some way or other add meaningfully to the laws that we already have to surveil, track down, interrogate and arrest terrorists in our midst.’</para>

<para>—We have just heard criticisms on a range of issues. Let me be quite clear about Labor’s position: we are tough on fighting terrorism but we also demand strong safeguards. In this debate we have used our time effectively to hold the government to account, to expose their weakness, to expose their backbench and to see through their rhetoric in the press. What they said in the press seems to be in part, although we had a personal explanation from Senator Brandis, different from what they then said in parliament. Mr Turnbull said one thing in the parliament and he went outside and said another.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Senate is where you have the opportunity to say what you mean. In this place Labor have said that we oppose the sedition measures. We should divide on that issue. We should ensure that the government and its backbench are put to the test. Mr Turnbull in the other place will have an opportunity when these amendments go over there to also oppose that. I doubt he will. I doubt he will stare down Mr Ruddock, or the Prime Minister, for that matter.</para>
<para>Labor have through this process recognised that the environment in which we live is different, but we have also recognised that we need laws and our law enforcement agencies need the ability to utilise those laws, to ensure that we are free and continue to have the right to be free of terrorism. That is the purpose of this legislation—to ensure that those rights are also championed. Labor have been strong on UN conventions and principles.

<para>—Firstly, I will start with a number of questions for the minister, although I note that he does not appear to have any advisers here. I am not sure if he wants me to talk more generally for a period of time. I suppose the first issue would be the evidence that was presented to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiring into this legislation. A great many submitters discussed their concerns about the bill and, in particular, made the point that the government had not presented any evidence that shifting people onto a lower payment would in fact help them get a job or have any effect on increasing the participation rate.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The committee asked this question of the department on, I think, the Monday and the department took it on notice. On the Wednesday the department provided references to a few international studies—some of which looked at the effect of increasing income support payments and the effect that would have on labour force participation, which obviously in this situation is entirely irrelevant. The committee was also presented with evidence by the department of a study—which I understand the government does not rely on—on the possibility of theoretically abolishing the social security system and whether that would help people get work. Can the minister confirm that the government has undertaken no modelling, economic research or any research whatsoever that it is putting forward with this legislation to the Senate that demonstrates that a reduction in income support payments will actually lead to a rise in labour force participation?</para>

<para>—We have been through this during question time from time to time over the past few days and weeks. The answer will not surprise Senator Wong. It remains the same—that we as a government are committed to making the shift from welfare to work for many people in Australia who, unfortunately, are not engaged in the work force. Many people have spoken about it and everybody wrings their hands about it, but as yet nobody has come up with a policy to address it, other than the government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government’s approach is clear. One is an adjusted welfare payment and the other is to invest heavily in those individuals through the $3.6 billion fund that I have referred to previously, which will invest in those individuals’ futures and job readiness. Talking of job readiness does allow me to correct that which I think I have said a few times at question time—that is, that there is in fact a job shortage as opposed to a workers shortage. In this current environment where there is a jobs surplus and people are not being found to fill job vacancies, we are living in an ideal climate to assist people to make that important switch from welfare to work. As one former Labor leader once said, it is more important to talk about the people’s social interaction and engagement with the community at large, dealing with the issues of self-esteem and self-worth, than to talk about what material support is provided.</para>
<para>In relation to whether or not we have done modelling, I do not think any specific modelling has been done—but that of itself does not mean that the policy is necessarily wrong or flawed. As I indicated earlier, there has been no genuine model put forward by others in this place or in the community at large as to how we ought to be overcoming this huge dependence on welfare, where people are, on average, staying on welfare for, I think, 12 years or more. It seems to us as a government that that shift has to be made. We are seeking to address the situation. Will it be perfect? No, it will not be—but it is the only policy that is actually on the table to be discussed and considered. I would invite honourable senators to look at the policy and accept that it is the policy that is currently on the table. If others have better policies to offer, possibly now is the time to put those forward—rather than simply oppose, as we have so often seen with previous reform proposals that have come before this chamber.</para>

<para>—As senators know, these are probably the most drastic changes to welfare since 1947. Given the guillotine the government has applied to these bills and the truncated committee debate we therefore have to have, we have only until 11 o’clock tonight to discuss the bills, the government’s amendments—which were provided late yesterday—and a range of other amendments that senators have tried to prepare in the time frame. Because of that limited time frame, I am not going to engage in a lengthy debate on this, except to make this point: the minister’s answer simply confirmed what we already know. The core of the government’s policy is to dump a substantial number of vulnerable families onto a lower payment. What the minister has just confirmed yet again is that the government has not undertaken any economic research or modelling, and it has not provided any evidence to this chamber that the centrepiece of this package—the heart of the changes in this package—will actually help people get work or have any effect on the participation rate.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The minister returns, yet again, to his rhetorical answer: ‘We think people should move from welfare to work.’ It is simply not good enough to continue to repeat the welfare to work mantra. Talking about welfare to work does not make this policy one that will achieve it. Talking about welfare to work over and over again will not actually provide the evidence. The fact is that the core of the government’s changes is simply a reduction in the incomes of vulnerable families. The core of the government’s package is to dump vulnerable families onto the dole. If the minister seriously thinks that simply coming into this chamber and saying ‘We believe in welfare to work’ is sufficient when he is proposing to put hundreds of thousands of Australians onto lower payments, without offering any economic justification for doing so, frankly, we on this side find it extraordinary. We would have thought that the least the Australian people could expect would be some economic competence from the other side. If you are putting forward a set of changes, you should be able to demonstrate that they are economically sound. Yet this government does not provide any evidence; in fact, it has admitted today in the chamber that no modelling or research was done.</para>
<para>I am happy to move on, because it is quite clear that all the minister will do is continue to reiterate the same rhetorical answer that he has given ad nauseam. I note again that no-one from the government—not this minister, not Minister Andrews and not any of the backbenchers—has ever put forward a justification for reducing people’s incomes. No-one from the government has ever put forward an explanation as to how shifting people onto the dole—from one Centrelink database to another—will help them to get work.</para>
<para>I want to turn now to the issue of taper rates. Minister, with respect to the changes to the taper rates to the Newstart allowance which are in the bill, is it not the case that the effective marginal tax rate on the Newstart allowance, even with the amendments proposed in the bill, is substantially higher than that which people would face on the disability support pension and parenting payment? In other words, a person who is currently on the DSP and earning money keeps far more of every dollar they earn than a person with a disability who is put onto Newstart. Can the minister explain how it is competent and appropriate that the government is putting people onto a payment where they lose more of every dollar earned than under current arrangements? How does increasing the tax rate—increasing the amount that the government will claw back from every dollar earned—encourage people to get work? Isn’t the government simply making welfare more attractive than work? Isn’t the government simply making work less attractive than welfare by refusing to alter the fact that substantial amounts of tax will be clawed back under this policy?</para>

<para>—A number of issues have been raised. First of all, we heard lamentations about the guillotine. Could I just remind honourable senators that the Labor Party guillotined 61 bills through this place in one hour—less than one minute per bill. With a record like that, I doubt that the Labor Party are clothed with any moral authority to make a comment in relation to that. I know that the mantra in relation to the Work Choices bill was that we were guillotining it through. I was interested to learn that—apart from the Senate committee that looked at the bill for five days—the Senate spent 32 hours debating that bill.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is interesting when you engage with people in the community and say, ‘The allegation has been made that this bill was guillotined through. How many hours do you think the Senate spent on it?’ It is interesting that people say, ‘One or two hours, possibly three hours, possibly a day.’ When you tell them it was 32 hours, they say, ‘My goodness, that is a long time.’ Similarly with these bills, a considerable period of time is being spent on them.</para>
<para>In relation to how this legislation will help people get into work, I remind the honourable senator of the $3.6 billion that will be invested for exactly that purpose. Senator Wong is asking the Australian people to believe that the $3.6 billion will simply disappear into thin air and will not help one single person into work. We happen to believe that it will assist people into work. We are concerned—as a compassionate, caring government—about just throwing welfare dollars at people. We want to invest in them as individuals, concentrating on their capacity to engage in work which, according to all the social data, is such an important consideration in relation to the wellbeing of the individual person and the children that happen to be growing up in the family unit. The fact that 700,000 children in Australia today are growing up in a home where there is not a parent in work is not good enough—not only for those people but especially for the 700,000 children. Those Australian children deserve a better future.</para>
<para>At the moment, we also have a job surplus in this country—in other words, a worker shortage. How is it that we can have a worker shortage when we still have 500,000 unemployed people, according to the statistics? Just at random, I have picked out the figures for northern Adelaide. It is interesting that the unemployment rate there is 6.8 per cent according to the labour force region ABS figures. In the employment service area of northern Adelaide, we are told that there are 11,640 vacancies. Of those vacancies, 5,605 were filled within 28 days, while 51.8 per cent of the vacancies were not filled after 28 days. Interestingly enough, out of those figures, in the occupation category of ‘labourers and related workers’—in other words, basically unskilled people—there were 6,188 vacancies in that northern Adelaide LFR. Only 3,029 of those jobs were filled within 28 days. That is, 51.1 per cent of those labourer and related workers vacancies were not filled within 28 days. Over half of those jobs went begging for more than four weeks, yet there is an unemployment rate of 6.8 per cent in that area. Anybody looking at those figures would say there is something drastically wrong if there are unskilled jobs going begging yet we have a substantial cohort of the population within that area on welfare.</para>
<para>So we as a government are saying—and I think the Australian people are saying—that, when people fall on tough times, of course society should look after them, but when there are opportunities for work then there is an obligation on people to take up that employment. As I have been able to indicate, just at random, the northern Adelaide situation indicates the sort of difficulty that this country is in at the moment.</para>
<para>Can I indicate to the honourable senator that I do not accept the language that people are being ‘dumped’. What we are doing is moving people into a welfare regime which will encourage them to engage in the labour market, not only for their own good but also for the good of their children and the overall good of the community.</para>

<para>—I think Senator Fielding wanted to jump in, so I will be brief. The minister has not addressed the taper rates. I go back to the taper rates issue that I asked about: why is the government putting people onto a payment where they will in fact lose more of every dollar earned than under the current arrangements? How is that going to help them get a job or encourage them to get work? The second question, Minister, is this: why is the government proceeding with an income reduction when it could have simply imposed appropriate activity requirements on these welfare recipients, encouraging them to get into the work force, without reducing their income? Why did the government rule that out?</para>

<para>—Currently, only 10 per cent of people on the DSP work and use the more generous taper rates. Less than 50 per cent of sole parents work and take advantage of the more generous taper rates. So what we have is one taper rate clearly being used substantially more, and where people are in a position to gain employment then it is important that we seek to encourage them.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>To emphasise again that this is not a ‘dumping’ policy, I indicate that we are making significant investment in Job Network, disability open employment services, rehabilitation services and personal support programs. The latter, I think, indicates that we are looking after individuals. It is not just a huge mass of people that we are going to classify together; we want to individually manage each Australian who is currently on welfare, to encourage them into employment. People changing from DSP to Newstart are in a different classification because they are now job seekers. That is the government’s policy and, I might say, also the community expectation. The taper rates for all Newstart people have been improved. The government are focusing on supporting people into work through large new investments in the programs that I have outlined.</para>

<para>—Family First do not believe in the welfare state. Family First do believe that those who can work should work—that is, that those on welfare who can work should work—and that parents who are caring for their children should be ‘parents first and workers second’. This bill is all about trying to balance an individual’s responsibility with the community obligation that they may have at the same time.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There is an issue that I have tried to understand in this bill and that I am still trying to work through. I have spoken to quite a few people on the street within Victoria—in the regional areas and in the city areas—and asked them if they can help me understand. I have said to them that, if a sole parent of one child is moved from parenting payment single to Newstart single with children and is genuinely looking for a job under Newstart and genuinely cannot find a job, they find they have to survive on $29 less per week than what they were getting on the parenting payment single. That person is genuinely looking for work and genuinely cannot find work. I ask people on the street: does that make sense to you? I cannot find one who says it does. Family First believes that those people on some sort of income support who can work should work. The person in this hypothetical cannot find genuine work, and all of a sudden they find themselves trying to cope on $29 less per week. Could the minister explain to me, and many other Australians, how that would work and why it is the case?</para>

<para>—There are two issues that the honourable senator has raised. The first one relates to Family First’s general philosophical approach to this, which is if you are a parent you should put your parenting responsibility first. I would basically agree with that. I do not think many people would disagree with that assertion. But if you were to ask those people in towns around Victoria, ‘Do you think it is appropriate that that person should be able to live off other Australians when the one child in this scenario is at school full time?’ most of them would say no.</para>

<para>—Madam Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. The question did not go to whether parents who are on welfare should try to get off welfare if they can work. I quite agree with that principle. Family First fully acknowledges that those people who are on welfare who can work should work, and that is the individual’s responsibility. Obviously the community obligation is, if someone cannot find work, to then try and provide some income support. I am not asking about the dilemma of whether there is that responsibility. Family First has made that quite clear. The question specifically is about a sole parent who is genuinely looking for work, cannot find work and who will immediately find themselves in a situation where they will receive $29 a week less than the payment they were receiving on parenting payment single. So it is quite clear: that is the issue. I have asked many Australians in regional, rural and city areas if they can explain that to me, and they scratch their heads. I fully understand that a single parent with kids who can work should work and they should be looking for work. I fully understand that and fully accept it. The issue goes to if they cannot find work. If they are genuinely looking—they have the compliance obligation to look for work, they fill in the forms to say they are looking for work and Centrelink can make sure that they are actually doing that—but they genuinely cannot find work, why would they have to end up getting $29 a week less?</para>

<para>—I understood the question at the end but I thought the prefacing comments were phrased somewhat differently. But I am willing to accept that and it has truncated the need for me to respond any further to the introductory comments of Senator Fielding, which does assist. In relation to the specific example he has put before the chamber, I will make a few general comments. Despite the strong economic growth that we have been experiencing and the much lower rates of unemployment since the Howard government was first elected in 1996, the growth in the numbers of single parents and people with a disability on welfare has not decreased. So we clearly have a difficulty in that particular area. This situation highlights the problems of our current welfare system. The original income support system was designed for a very different world to that which we are in today—most jobs were full time, most unemployment was short term and mothers and women generally did not work. The policies were appropriate then but are not necessarily suited to today’s Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Currently, most working-age recipients of income support are not required to seek work. Only 15 per cent of the 2.6 million working-age Australians currently on income support are required to actively search for a job at a particular point in time. I suggest this reflects an outdated presumption in the welfare system that only those who can work full time must seek work. This is simply not sustainable, particularly given the ageing population and that the nature of the job market has changed so dramatically. The Howard government’s commitment to addressing this issue is there for all to see in the Welfare to Work package, which was the centrepiece of the recent federal budget. People with partial capacity to work will now be considered as job seekers. They will be going onto Newstart as job seekers. People who are currently on DSP, of course, were grandfathered, as I am sure the Senate is aware. When confronted with this lack of movement from welfare payments for single parents and people on disabilities, clearly there was a need to engage these people, because they tend to be on welfare for a very long time. That is not good for them and not good for the 700,000 children.</para>
<para>I went through the statistics at question time today. All the social statistics—be it mental health, teenage pregnancy, having involvement with the juvenile criminal system et cetera—unfortunately, are heavily weighted to those family units that are totally welfare dependent. We want to break that cycle of welfare dependency, which has now unfortunately become intergenerational. To achieve that, some rigorous activity has to be undertaken by the government, and that is what we are doing.</para>
<para>Once again, the lady you refer to who has a child turning eight will have had two years of intensive assistance to get her job-ready to be able to move into the work force. We would hope as a government that after those two years there would be a genuine prospect of employment. I picked out the figures at random for North Adelaide showing the labour shortage in labourer and unskilled work—thousands of jobs going begging.</para>

<para>—Madam Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. The minister is already truncating debate. Senator Fielding has asked a very specific question. If the minister is going to answer with lengthy rhetorical contributions that do not engage at all with the questions that senators are putting, I suggest this will be an incredibly wasteful process in the very short space of time that we have for the committee. I would respectfully request that the minister answer the question put by Senator Fielding. We are now half an hour into this; we only have three more hours and a lot of amendments to come. If every question is going to be responded to in this way, we will not get through all the matters the chamber needs to deal with.</para>

<para>—It is a bit like saying, ‘What is the meaning of life?’ I can ask that question in 30 seconds or less and therefore I expect an answer in 30 seconds or less to the question of the meaning of life. It is interesting that Senator Fielding did not seek to raise a point of order on it. He asked about the general philosophy: how you explain to people what the government’s intentions are and why the government has acted in a particular way. I think it is appropriate to indicate through a relatively expansive answer exactly what is in the government’s thinking. If we as government do not, we will be accused of treating this process with a degree of flippancy, not giving detailed and full answers.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I also remind the senator that the government has significantly increased support to families through family payments. For those who have children there is, according to the Labor Party, the ‘unreal’ $600 payment and other payments. The government supports family and work through its different policies, and so in fairness you have got to see the government’s approach, I think, in the totality of the government’s payments to the mums and dads of this country. I think we have got a well-rounded policy which does, however, have the aspect to it that encourages people to get into work to ensure their own ongoing future financial viability and development.</para>

<para>—I suppose we could tap dance around the issue for quite some time—I do not want to go through it again. The thrust of the bill in moving people from welfare to work makes sense. Very few people I meet say that moving people from welfare to work does not make sense. With 700,000 kids growing up in jobless homes, we need to be doing more. I agree that there are significant pieces in the bill that go towards making that happen. But it is tainted because people who are genuinely wanting to do the right thing find themselves all of a sudden with less per week to live on. It is a shame, because I support the thrust of the bill completely. It is tainted by that issue and I am unable to get, I think, a satisfactory answer. That is all I will say. It is a shame that we cannot have a reasonable answer as to why, say, a sole parent earning a parenting payment single moving to Newstart—and I hope they get a job—has to cope with $29 less a week. There are significant pieces in the bill that make sense, and Family First definitely support the idea of moving people from welfare to work. Those who can work should work.</para>

<para>—Minister, you were referring earlier to employment assistance training and individualised training. In the committee process, it became evident that there appears to be a difference between the number of places that are available, particularly for individualised support, which we know many people need. We know that 60 per cent of people involved have year 10 education or less, so there is going to be a high number of people moving onto Newstart who will require training. I understand there is a mismatch between the number of places available and the large number of people being moved onto the program and that people will not have access to the intensive employment assistance at the level that is required. Is that the case? If it is the case, what is the government going to do about providing the sort of intensive training that many of these job seekers are going to need?</para>

Talk in this area is very easy. We are all in heated agreement. The issue is: are people prepared to walk the walk and take some of the tougher actions required to address the situation? As yet, nobody has come up with an alternative comprehensive policy in that area.</para>

<para>Coming to Senator Siewert’s question in relation to the number of places, as I understand it people with a partial capacity will have access to uncapped programs. But, in respect of the actual number of places for people, as I understand it people will not be necessarily getting—I will have this confirmed by the advisers—full-time assistance over that two-year period. Therefore, the number of people available will be able to deal with a whole host of recipients.</para>

<para>—The answer, if I may just briefly, Senator Fielding, is that it is uncapped. So, if a person needs ongoing intensive support, that will continue to be provided. Undoubtedly, figures have been provided on that which are a guesstimate at the moment, but if it appears that there is a greater demand then clearly we will make extra services available. It is demand driven. Having said that, I indicate that I would expect a number of people to be able to access the job market without intensive training or assistance and that many will be able to find part-time or casual employment without the need for any extra assistance through the particular programs that we have.</para>

<para>—An assessment will be made of the individual and then assistance will be provided to assist that person to get to the top level of that which is deemed to be within their capacity. For example, if somebody is currently working 15 hours a week and wants to work 30 hours a week or whatever, they can be provided with extra assistance. I think the point that Senator Siewert makes is a very important one, and that is that this category of people—and I fully accept what Senator Siewert says, and it is often overlooked—is just as aspirational as the rest of us in Australia. Those who might start with a bare minimum of 15 hours work may well want to progress and keep working longer and harder and get off welfare dependency. We do have a program to assist in that regard.</para>

<para>—I ask the minister to respond to a number of matters. Firstly, I thank him for his somewhat belated concession that the taper rates faced by sole parents and people with a disability who are put onto the dole will be worse than the taper rates they are currently on—in other words, people will lose more of every dollar earned than under current arrangements. I thank him for that concession. I do not think that that has been confirmed in a number of question time answers but I do note that the department confirmed that in the hearings on this bill.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Does the minister also agree with the department’s evidence to the committee whereby they indicated that they did not fundamentally disagree with or dispute the NATSEM research, which includes a finding that a sole parent with one child who does the right thing—and this really goes to Senator Fielding’s issue as well—and works 15 hours a week will be $91 a week worse off under the new system than under the current system? I think a person with a disability in a similar situation will be $122 a week worse off. Does the government think that getting people to work for an effective return of $2.27 and $3.88 an hour is a good way to encourage people into work?</para>
<para>The next point I would ask the minister to respond to is this: the bill before the Senate undoubtedly increases the number of different payment streams in the sense that a number of groups are moving onto Newstart with different arrangements applicable to them. There are people on the DSP who have one set of arrangements, there is the group which is known as the transitional group—that is, people who applied for the DSP from the night after the budget until the commencement of this bill—and then there is the group after that. Given that there is greatly increased complexity in the system because of the different groups and the different entitlements and different obligations associated with each group, has the government costed any additional administrative cost to be incurred?</para>

<para>—In the interests of expediting this, Minister, thank you for that answer. Since the costings on this were presented to estimates through the budget process, a number of further exemptions and alterations have been announced by the government. I think there were five separate announcements. Is there any additional cost associated with the administrative complexity of the subsequent announcements over and above the cost in the budget? Are you able to indicate how much was identified as administrative cost associated with the original package?</para>

<para>—It stands to reason that, when you have a different scale or different systems in place, there will be extra costs. My advice is that they would be marginal. Once again, the detail of that will be with Centrelink. Hopefully, we can streamline those administrative costs more and more as the government make use of IT and other measures to assist in that regard. In relation to NATSEM and also some of the other comments that have been made about the mum being considered as a job seeker because she has a child aged eight, I simply point out that the differences between parenting payment and Newstart allowance are well known. A single parent at the moment would switch onto Newstart when their youngest child turns 16. That is the current situation. The government are saying that that switch should now be made at an earlier age—namely, when the youngest child turns eight.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I also indicate that the NATSEM research demonstrates that, whether recipients are on parenting payment or Newstart, they are better off working than not working. We have heard discussion, especially from the other side, suggesting that people are going to be working for $3.88 an hour et cetera. At the end of the day, you need to look at what they actually receive. For example, if somebody were to work 30 hours a week, they would in fact be receiving an income equivalent to an hourly rate of $28.63 per hour. I think that is an important consideration. You cannot just discount all government support and then say, ‘If you divide all this out, the few extra hours would only translate to something like $3.’ It depends on how you do your calculation and whether you want to simply take the Australian taxpayer for granted. We believe that we should not be taking that line. We believe in providing support where needed and appropriate, but there is a very real obligation on people, where they can work, to engage in work—not only for their own wellbeing and that of their kids but also for the taxpayers, who have funded them up to that point in time.</para>

<para>—I think it has been made clear by all parties that no-one disagrees with the principle that those who can work should work and that the principle of moving people from welfare to work is a good one. I think where we disagree is that we say your bill in essence is about switching people from one payment to another payment. Thank you for acknowledging—I think, again, for the first time—that this package does involve a switch to Newstart. In relation to the issue of how much people actually will earn and what their effective return will be, I do not think I suggested at all that we do not acknowledge the amount that people get from the taxpayer. The point is that you do not increase the incentive to work by taking more tax dollars from every dollar someone earns. It is a pretty basic principle that I think most Australians would agree with. Why should the government take 75c out of every dollar a person with a disability on the dole will earn? That is not going to encourage people to work. It is not sensible to give an incentive that has that kind of punitive tax rate.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I want to turn to a different issue—that is, participation in training. One of the things that this bill does is alter the sections in relation to what activity requirements can be imposed on welfare recipients—in this case, people with a disability and sole parents. It is certainly not clear anywhere in the legislation or in the explanatory memorandum that people trying to improve their job skills through training would meet the work search obligations set out in the bill. The explanatory memorandum talks about Job Search and participation in paid work. From our side, the obvious question that arises is: are you saying therefore that a person with a disability who wants to improve their skills cannot meet their obligations through doing training or that a person who is a sole parent who wants to go back to nursing part time cannot meet that obligation on the Newstart payment by training?</para>
<para>Surely one of the ways we can encourage people back into the work force is by enabling them to get the skills they need to get a job and to get a job that has long-term financial security for their family. I think the department said in evidence to the committee inquiry that there was a possibility of short-term training. I ask you to clarify that, Minister. What training would satisfy the activity test which will be applied to people with a disability and to sole parents? Will that be limited to anything less than a year? Where in the bill or in the explanatory memorandum is that facilitated or indicated? I have read it and it seems quite clear to me that it relates to looking for work. Where in the legislation before the Senate is that permitted? Finally, what was the policy logic behind removing the support for study, which was the pensioner education supplement, from people who had been put on the dole?</para>

<para>—To commence with Senator Wong’s initial comments, it is not for me to acknowledge anything in relation to people being changed from one payment to another. It was clear in the government policy announcement that people would be changed from parenting payments to Newstart by changing the age of the youngest child when the transition would be made from 16 to eight years. I think that was specifically pointed out. It may originally have been six years and then eight. I am not 100 per cent sure on that. But that was clearly in the government’s mind when the announcements were made.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In relation to training and education, I understand that Austudy is for further education. If the employment service provider identifies with a person in that agreement then short-term training is okay and there is support for people to finish their course through PES, which is the pensioner education supplement, when they move to Newstart allowance. Principal carer parents on income support will be able to combine job search requirements with part-time study, which can also count towards their annual part-time mutual obligation requirement. For those wishing to do full-time study, the following options are provided. I do not think you are interested in existing parent payment recipients, Senator Wong—is that correct? Your request was in relation to new claimants. From 1 July 2006, existing parenting payment claimants who move onto Newstart allowance will be allowed to complete any full-time study that they commenced while on parenting payment. They will not be required to look for work while their course of full-time study is completed. New claimants on Newstart wishing to commence studying full time can transfer to Austudy, which has a ‘single with children’ rate.</para>

<para>—Thank you for that answer, Minister, but there are a number of issues that you did not address. One was in relation to the combination of part-time job, study and job search. Is it the case that that can only occur for up to a year, or can that occur for more than a year? Where in the legislation are the guidelines or principles against which that is assessed? What proportion can a person do? For example, what if a sole parent wants to study nursing part time for a period of time while she is on parenting payment? We have a skills shortage in this country. We have a shortage of nurses. Wouldn’t it both be a good thing for her and contribute to meeting Australia’s skills shortage if she were permitted to engage in part-time nursing studies? Isn’t it the case that she will not be able to do that on Newstart with the current activity test?</para>

<para>The second point—and I notice you chose your words carefully—is that a principal carer, that is a parent, can combine study and job search. Does that mean that a person with a disability who is put onto the dole—switched to the dole, to use your phrase—will not be entitled to try to improve their skills and have that contribute to their job search? How can a person with a disability, who may only have part-time capacity in any event, both study part time and job search? Will the government be permitting people with a disability who are subject to the activity requirements to improve their job skills?</para>

<para>—That is my point, Minister. If they are already job searching 15 hours a week, is the government saying that, if you want to study part time, you have to do it on top of that, when your capacity as a person with a disability has already been assessed at 15 hours or you are a sole parent, who is supposedly only required to work 15 hours a week? Is the government saying, ‘We don’t mind if you study part time if you do it on your own time, over and above job search’? I am looking at section 613(2). It seems to indicate that you can be paid Newstart allowance where you are granted permission to enrol in a course. What I am asking is: what guidelines will apply to that? Will it be short-term—that is, less than a year only—which seemed to be the evidence given to the committee by the department? If that is the case, how in a time of skills shortage can the government justify imposing such restrictions on people improving their job skills and making it such a disincentive for people to go back and do some training so that they can get the skills they need to build a real career for themselves?</para>

As I understand it, if an opportunity for 15 hours of work arose, they would have to take that, because, as a government, we are pursuing a work first agenda. That is what we have tried to highlight—that it is a work first agenda, and if these people are on Job Search then that is their first requirement. Anything that they can do above that, be it extra work or extra study, we would of course welcome.</para>

They could potentially go full time onto Austudy. If they were on Job Search then they would have to undertake the work first agenda. However, if a person had nearly finished their degree, for example, some degree of flexibility could be exercised to allow that person to finish their degree.

<para>—I have, I think, one final question to the minister before we move to amendments. It is on the status of volunteering activity. Currently, for example, parents are able to satisfy some aspects of their mutual obligation requirements by voluntary or community activity. Will the government’s approach mean that doing things like volunteering at schools, serving in the tuckshop et cetera will not count towards the 15-hour requirement? Has the government done any modelling or research into how this will affect volunteering from this group?</para>

<para>—The honourable senator is basically right. No modelling has been done. In relation to Senator Siewert’s issue with Austudy and Newstart, I understand that the payment for a recipient with one child would be $427.80 per fortnight on Austudy, whereas on Newstart it would be $437.60. So it is pretty similar. In rough terms, it is about a $10 difference.</para>

<para>—This will be my last contribution on this issue, I hope. I would like to move to the amendments. I want to make the point, Minister, that it does seem bizarre to me, and I am sure to other opposition senators, that at a time when we have a skills shortage, and given that we know the best way to ensure someone gets a job is to ensure they have the skills an employer needs, the government would build into a so-called Welfare to Work package such restrictions and, frankly, disincentives and difficulties for welfare recipients to study and train. Surely, one of the things we want to do, if we want to move people from welfare to work—and not just move them into short-term casual jobs but into jobs where they can build a secure future for themselves and their families—is to encourage and support training and education, rather than discourage it and make it more difficult.</para>

<para>—Does the country have a skills shortage? Yes, it does. Are we encouraging people to increase their skills? Yes, we are. But there is also a shortage of labourers and related workers within our community. As I have pointed out previously, just in the northern Adelaide area for the category ‘labourers and related workers’ there were 6,188 vacancies and fewer than half of them were filled within 28 days, meaning more than half of them were not filled for a period of four weeks or more. With an unemployment rate in that area of 6.8 per cent or some considerable number of unemployed people in that area, you have to ask why those jobs are not being taken up at the moment. That is where we believe there needs to be a greater incentive to encourage people to take up these job opportunities.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>All the statistics indicate that only 40 per cent of people on the minimum wage stay on that for 12 months or more because the vast majority, having got their foot onto the employment ladder, are then in a position to prove their worth, expand their hours and take better jobs as time goes by. The important part is to get people started in the employment culture and in the work force. Once that has been attained and established for the individual, they and the children in their family unit are a lot better off. If we have finished general questions, I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments and requests for amendments to be moved to this bill. The memorandum was circulated in the chamber on 6 December 2005.</para>

<para>—This amendment is about amending the provision for review to ensure a public and independent review of this legislation. No matter whether you are on the government side, on the crossbenches or in the opposition, we have all been debating this legislation. The Australian Greens believe that this legislation will have a significant impact on our community, and I presume that the government is assuming the same thing. We probably differ in our opinions on what that impact will be. I am extremely concerned it will have a negative impact. One way or another, we need to review the impacts of this legislation on the Australian community.</para>

<para>We believe that that review needs to be independent and public.

I do not wish to take up too much of the Senate’s time talking about this. I think the requirements for this are fairly obvious. Because I know there are a lot of other amendments that we want to get through tonight, I will leave my comments at that.</para>

<para>—The Greens amendment is fairly similar to the Democrats amendment (1). I will not proceed with ours. I think we will get a sense from the chamber as to the opinion on this based on the vote on the Greens amendment. The need for a structured requirement within the legislation for a review is important. These sorts of amendments are ones that were not always but fairly regularly put in place through amendments that were accepted by the Senate and by the government in a wide range of areas across the many portfolios. History has shown that they are very valuable. It is important to have a requirement that reviews occur and that they are reasonably independent and the results are made public, because that does not always happen with government reviews. I note that Minister Andrews released a statement on Monday in which he said that he would be following up on recommendation No. 1 from the Senate committee report—one of the very small number of fairly minor recommended changes that were put forward by the government senators on that committee. Even that response will not guarantee that something adequate will happen. Either of these Greens or Democrat amendments would do that, and I think it would be highly desirable to ensure that that occurs.</para>

<para>—Very briefly, the government opposes both of those amendments, if we are having a cognate debate or considering them together for the sake of convenience. In its inquiry into the Welfare to Work bill, the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee recommended that the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations table in parliament on an annual basis key data on the implementation of the Welfare to Work package. The government’s response was that it will provide separate reports on key data on the Welfare to Work measures. These will be included in the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations annual report and those of the departments headed by the Minister for Family and Community Services and the Minister for Human Services. The government will, of course, continue to closely monitor the reforms on an ongoing basis.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government also has in place the Welfare to Work consultative forum which will assist the government in implementing these reforms. In particular, the forum will advise ministers at a broad strategic level on the design of services to ensure the government’s policy objectives are achieved; the translation of the government’s broad policy directions into operational policies and practices; communication and consultation with stakeholder groups to promote awareness and understanding of and input into the reform measures; and approaches to maximise employer engagement with reforms and specific issues associated with implementation and/or other Welfare to Work related policy issues referred to it by ministers. For the interest of honourable senators, the membership of the committee is made up of representatives from ACOSS, Salvation Army, Catholic Welfare Australia, NATSEM, the Smith Family and Mission Australia.</para>

</amendments>
<para class="block">This amendment addresses what I believe is a loophole in the legislation. I should put on record—I did not want to take up time earlier—that the Greens, as I think most people will be aware, oppose these changes. However, we are taking the same approach that we took with Work Choices. If we can help make this legislation just that little bit better, we will try, and this is certainly one of those amendments. The government have put in exemptions and listed registered and active foster carers as exempt from activity statements et cetera. They have not dealt with family carers. When we brought this up in the committee, it was recognised as an issue that had not been dealt with. At least, that is how I understood the conversation.</para>
<para>Many children are living in out-of-home care with grandparents—and admittedly a lot of grandparents will not be on Newstart, but some might be—aunties, uncles or other relatives. They are not picked up, as I understand it, through this legislation. In New South Wales alone, for example, the estimate is that approximately 4,500 children are living with relative carers or in, as we call it, family care. Many of these children have suffered abuse and they need intense support care—they need to be taken to counselling during school time and they need many forms of additional support, the same as children in foster care. As I understand this legislation, the people that are providing this family care, or out-of-home care, are not catered for in the exemptions that are provided in the bill in the same way that foster carers are.</para>
<para>We are proposing an amendment that provides for family carers, provides a description of family carers and puts in place a register of active family carers that are subject to registration according to the requirements of states and territories—in the same way as foster carers. We believe this is particularly important because the people that are providing this care need the sort of support that the government has acknowledged that foster carers need. We believe that the same situation should be there for family carers and those providing out-of-home care. If I have misinterpreted the legislation, I would like to know from the minister which provision in the legislation provides support and exemptions for family carers that match the support and exemptions for foster carers.</para>

An adult in receipt of parenting payment or on Newstart allowance as a principal carer will be treated as any other principal carer on these payments. They will not be treated as foster carers because they are not foster carers; they are considered to be a parent involved in the normal task of parenting.</para>

<para>—The point I am making is that family carers have additional family care requirements because in many cases—in fact, I would hazard a guess, in most cases—the children are coming to them from traumatic circumstances, for example, their parents may have been killed, or they are coming from abusive situations, and they require additional support and care. So I am asking that they be given the same recognition as foster carers because they have the same requirements. The government has acknowledged the additional burdens on foster parents given that they are required to give additional support. We are saying family carers require that same level of support.</para>

<para>—I ask the minister whether he recognises that, whilst the number of people this would affect is, in a relative sense, quite small, the children who go into these circumstances have been through extraordinarily traumatic events and the people who are caring for these children may have had to change their circumstances quite dramatically. If the person is leaving work in order to care for a family member’s child, and if they are a low-income person, they will get caught up in this package of measures in order to provide the inordinate care that that child needs at that time. It would be extraordinarily unfortunate if even one family got caught up in that circumstance.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Minister, the answer that you have given to Senator Siewert does not comfort me that there will be one child—if only there were only one—whose caring person is going to be caught up in this event; I think there will be far more than that. These children are children of families who are on the edge and going through traumatic events. The amendment that Senator Siewert has moved extends the exemption for children—not of foster caring families, who are doing exactly the same job, really—of families who, through their own means, support their children within their family through a traumatic event. The amendment delivers to those families the same sorts of exemptions and support that foster parent families are being provided with, which we support. Minister, in the answer that you gave to Senator Siewert, I do not see absolute clarity that those families would be treated exactly the same as the families who are treated under the provisions for foster parents.</para>

<para>—Hopefully—and I think we would all be in agreement on this—the number of children involved in this situation would be small. Having said that, the fact that it is only a small number of people should not mean that they are dismissed from our consideration, and I fully accept Senator McLucas’s comments on that.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As I understand the situation, each individual case will be reviewed and, if there are traumatic circumstances—such as outlined by Senator McLucas—there will be an exemption from the requirements for 16 weeks. After that 16-week period, if the trauma or circumstances are such that the carer of that child has to continue to spend extra time, that 16 weeks can be progressively rolled over for a further 16 weeks and so on, on the basis of what I assume would be an independent assessment to determine the actual need in a particular circumstance. In relation to getting extra payment, as I indicated earlier, they will be seen as a parent for the purposes of the legislation and therefore will not be qualifying for the extra payment that is being suggested by Senator McLucas.</para>

<para>—While I am pleased that we are making some progress on this, I am concerned that it is just 16 weeks. We are talking about the long-term impact on children. Particularly in circumstances where children are suffering from abuse, it is not something that is fixed in 16 weeks; it is something that takes years to fix. I think there is a lack of recognition of the work that these family carers do and the trauma that these children are going through. You have traumatic events but there are ongoing impacts, ongoing counselling, ongoing work and additional burdens that family carers bear by taking on these responsibilities. I would prefer to have a broader recognition of the work that these people do, because I think there is a level of discrimination going on here.</para>

<para class="block">I have circulated many amendments dealing with a wide range of matters on behalf of the Democrats. Because of the guillotine, we will not get the opportunity to examine them or put forward in detail our position on them and get on the record any possible justification the government might have for not accepting them. But I do want to emphasise this set of amendments specifically, because they go to the key issue from the Democrats’ point of view.</para>
<para>These Democrat amendments provide any single coalition senator who acknowledges that cutting the income of sole parents or people with a disability does not help them into work with the opportunity to support an amendment that would prevent that income being cut. That is what this group of amendments does. Those people would still be subject to the activity test the government is putting forward, so the government does not have the excuse that they would not have all the other obligations that would encourage them into work.</para>
<para>The sole impact of these amendments would be that people would not have their income cut. If a person is the principal carer of one or more children and not a member of a couple—that is, a sole parent—they would be paid at the parenting payment single rate. If a person has a partial capacity to work, they would be paid disability support pension rates, including the pharmaceutical allowance, and they would retain the pension income test. It would mean that people would not have their income cut; they would retain the same, fairer income test that does not take away so quickly or so copiously any income they earn from part-time work; and they would retain the pharmaceutical allowance. The amendments also ensure that the supplements and concessions for full-time students are retained, and the pensioner education supplement and pensioner concession cards are also retained.</para>
<para>The wording is complicated because it is a complicated act, but that is the key aspect of these amendments to the bill. They will ensure that, although people will go into a new category and will be required to meet the mutual obligations the government puts on them, they will not lose any income. I want to make it clear that these amendments are purely to provide a crystal-clear opportunity to remove what I see as the core flaw and core problem in the legislation. That flaw is of course that a large number of people, many thousands of people—differing figures come forward from the government department, but certainly well over 150,000 people—will have their income cut, some of them quite enormously, particularly those who want to undertake study.</para>
<para>So any individual government senator that takes the same view as the government member for Pearce in the House of Representatives, Mrs Judi Moylan, would vote for these amendments. As Mrs Moylan herself said in an interview I read on Margo Kingston’s web site, she accepted that the bill had positive aspects, so she did not want to oppose the whole bill, but she believed that there were significant problems within it, and the key problem was and is that people would have their income cut. She did not want to support it, but there was no point crossing the floor because it would not have affected the outcome.</para>
<para>Any individual government senator crossing the floor here, on these amendments, will affect the outcome if they are not willing to support the bill unless these amendments are passed. All we need is another Judi Moylan in the Senate, just one, to make clear the point that the bill should not pass unless this amendment passes and the problem at the heart of the bill would be removed. It is not the only problem and I certainly do not want to suggest that this is the only concern the Democrats have; but, accepting that many people believe that the compliance program that is being put in place is necessary to provide that extra encouragement to people to seek work, these amendments simply prevent people’s income being cut.</para>
<para>There are other options and amendments that have been circulated that seek to do similar things. There is the option, as I understand it, of simply opposing a couple of relevant schedules, which is an amendment that Labor and, I think, the Greens have circulated. That is an approach that certainly accords with the Democrat policy. The intent of these amendments is to make it as easy as possible for any individual government senator to prevent people’s income being cut and, frankly, to ensure that they have no excuse, that they will not be able to say afterwards, ‘Well, I would have liked to have had that part removed, but it would have meant that other parts of the bill were damaged.’ They will have no excuse.</para>
<para>These amendments simply prevent people’s income being cut. As I noted, I think, earlier on today or in another debate in this chamber, that core aspect of the bill is the part that the government, particularly the Special Minister of State, have avoided repeatedly, in question after question, for months. A whole range of different questions and supplementary questions have been put to him asking, ‘How does cutting people’s income help them to get a job?’ According to the count I have done, in his answers to questions and supplementary questions he has avoided that question 32 times, along the way also throwing a false smear back at those of us on this side by saying, ‘You just want people to be stuck on welfare; you support welfare dependency; you support “welfare to nowhere”,’ and all of those completely false statements. So we have had 32 dodges of this central reality of the legislation, just from that one minister. I think we would have had some from other ministers and many other government senators as well. Mrs Moylan, the member for Pearce, did not dodge the issue; she acknowledged it up front and had the courage to do so, and I call on any individual government senator to likewise show that courage.</para>
<para>The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Andrews, made a statement, reported on ABC radio, that the government, in putting forward the very small number of fairly minor amendments that they have, have met the concerns that have been raised. I know ministers, particularly from the House of Representatives, do not understand the Senate very well and certainly do not pay very much attention to the Senate—they never have, and they pay even less attention now. They certainly do not pay much attention to what happens in Senate committees. But any minister who can seriously suggest that the concerns that have been raised have been met by the government is simply delusional. That is the politest word I can think of.</para>
<para>The government has not met the concerns that have been raised, because the core concern that has been raised is that over 150,000 of the poorest, most vulnerable, most disadvantaged and struggling Australians and their children will have their income significantly cut by this legislation unless these amendments are passed. I call on each individual government senator to consider these amendments, because it will be on their heads as individuals if this legislation passes with that income cut contained in it, because any one of them could stop it. So I do hope that with this amendment, if none of the others, there is at least one government senator who will acknowledge the very serious injustice that is about to be inflicted on a lot of Australians who do not deserve it.</para>

<para>—I want to make a short contribution to the debate and pick up some of the issues that Senator Bartlett has quite rightly put, but I want to come at it from a different angle. In a bit of a rare entree for me, I want to come at it from the right-wing perspective. My concern about the package is not just that it is unfair on those on welfare and that it seeks to punish some of the most disadvantaged in our community; my other concern is that in fact it does not meet the government’s own objectives, that it fails in its economic objectives. On that basis, I think the bills ought to be rejected. We have focused a lot on those who are disadvantaged by these changes. The government has said: ‘That’s not fair. You’ve got to look at the totality of the package.’ If Senator Abetz has said it once, he has said it a hundred times.</para>

<para>—Well, you ought to read it. As Senator Bartlett quite rightly pointed out, the key issue and the thing that has got most people concerned is the change in welfare payments. After 1 July 2006, single parents or those who gain a disability are to be treated in a different way. The government said all through this debate up until the bills were finally introduced to the parliament, ‘We don’t want two classes of people.’ The mantra was: we do not want two classes. Mr Dutton was still running that line in March.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Of course, what did we get in May? We got a system that set up two classes of people—those on the DSP before the changes and those on it after and those on parenting payment before and those on it after. Clearly there are two different classes of people. What is missing from this government package that was there in 2002? I will tell you what is missing: the government proposed in 2002 that the work test measures et cetera would be applied to all recipients of DSP, but this package does not do that. The Treasurer lambasted Labor for three years over its failure to support the 2002 measures. He attacked us again and again because he said that reform of the DSP was central to welfare reform, that it was the reason the government was doing this. He said we have 708,000 on the DSP and they are a chain around the neck of the economy, that while some of them are genuine, there are real problems with this group. That was the rationale for welfare reform. He said at one stage:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There are now one in eight men over 55 in Australia on the disability support pension. Now there are men with bad backs who cannot work. I accept that and they should be on the disability support pension. But do you think that one in eight men over 55 in Australia is disabled?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That came in April this year just before the budget. He continued to attack Labor for its failure to support the 2002 reforms, he continued to complain that there were too many people on the DSP and he continued to say that the main reason for this whole reform was to deal with that problem. It is funny, isn’t it? That reform is not in this package. The main rationale for welfare reform is not here. I looked at what this did for the 708,000 people on the DSP and I could not find it. There is nothing here. Why? That is a good question.</para>
<para>It seems to me that at that fateful dinner on 2 May 2005, which we learnt about at estimates, when the Treasurer and Mr Howard sat down to dinner, they nutted out the welfare reform package, because what was presented by the department to that meeting was severely altered, as shown by the evidence given. Basically the Treasurer, with his history of being rolled, was rolled again. The Prime Minister said to him: ‘No, mate. There isn’t going to be any harm to us out of this. We are not going to bite the hard politics. We’re going to make it soft. All the victims will be after July 2006. I’m not having 708,000 disability support pensioners mobilised against us. There won’t be any ready victims. The victims will all be prospective victims. They’ll be people who get disabled after July 2006. They’ll be people who become single parents after July 2006.’ I am sure the Treasurer argued that what he had been saying for the last three or four years would be a nonsense. But Mr Howard insisted: ‘No. It’s a victory for politics over policy. We can’t have victims. We can’t have the churches and others mobilising these people.’</para>
<para>So what did we get? We got two categories each of DSP and parenting payment people. The attack was on the future recipients. Those that are currently on welfare would be grandfathered—1.3 million people currently on welfare are not contained in the major change in this package. Why? Because the government lacked the guts. It had said that that group was the economic problem, but it lacked the political courage. So what did it do? It grandfathered them. I am not arguing that they should have had their benefits reduced; quite the contrary. But, if the government’s claims for reform are to be sustained, it has to prove what it is doing about the problem, as it says it exists, in welfare in this country. And it has ducked it. What it is doing is attacking the problem that it says will emerge after July 2006. The economic credentials of the government in relation to welfare reform are in tatters because it went for the easy politics over the policy. The DSP recipients currently in the system will have no activity test, no change in their benefits and no extra assistance to move them off welfare and into work. That is 708,000 people on the scrap heap. Forget them—too hard. There will be no help, no assistance. The people who the Treasurer said were the cause of all the problems, the reason we had to have these bills, are pushed to one side. So they get no assistance, but they are left alone.</para>
<para>The interesting thing we learnt in recent times is that not only are there 708,000 people on the DSP but even under the government’s grand welfare reforms there will be an extra 53,000 people each and every year going onto the DSP. So not only has the DSP list not been tackled; it will continue to grow. That is welfare reform under the Howard government. This is great reform! The DSP rate of increase may slow slightly, but there will be 50,000 extra each year. Gee, they have really tackled the hard issues, haven’t they?</para>
<para>What do the government go for instead? They take the easy kicks. They will kick those who can least afford to protect themselves and will only kick those who come onto the system in the future because otherwise those pesky churches and those pesky social service organisations will organise them. There will be a public outcry. They will have victims. They will have mothers who cannot feed their kids. They will have example after example—people with a disability, people with kids who are being adversely affected. They will be able to point to each of them. The government say, ‘We can’t win that campaign. It’ll be like the IR campaign. Even if we spent $100 million, we couldn’t win that argument. They would have all these real live people with real live social problems struggling to live with a disability, struggling to bring up their kids, who could be shown to be clearly worse off and disadvantaged by the changes. So we’ll play the smart politics, the cunning politics. We’ll show them. We’ll grandfather the 1.3 million on welfare. We’ll put them to one side and we’ll attack those ones that come onto welfare from July.’</para>
<para>If you want further proof of why that is true, ask yourself this question: if being on Newstart is so beneficial, so helpful for getting a job and so central to the government’s objectives of moving people from welfare onto work, why didn’t they apply it to the 1.3 million already on welfare? If it is the magic bullet, if it is the solution, if reducing their benefits, putting them on the Newstart arrangements, putting them on the Newstart taper, is such a brilliant idea and is so essential for the movement from welfare to work, why wouldn’t you do it for the 1.3 million already stuck on welfare? Many of them are looking for an opportunity to get off, for some assistance, for some training and for some support. But the government say, ‘No, we don’t think it will solve their problems. It will only solve the problems of those who come after July 2006.’</para>
<para>I do not know about you but I am a bit puzzled by the logic. It seems to me that if this is the magic bullet and the solution to get people off welfare onto work, why wouldn’t you apply it to the 1.3 million currently on welfare? Why wouldn’t you cut their benefits? Because the government cannot win the politics. They would have to deal with victims. They would be seen as mean, cruel, arrogant and out of touch. They could not win the political argument, so they ducked the issue. They have got a magic solution—lower income for these people—but they have to quarantine the whole 1.3 million who are currently on the system because the politics are too hard.</para>
<para>If the government genuinely believed that putting people on lower welfare payments was a solution, they would do it for everybody. But they do not genuinely believe it. They have not got the political or policy courage to do it but, more importantly, the reason they do not do it is that they know it is not the solution. They have taken the soft option. Peter Costello was rolled by John Howard. The welfare reform package is a sham. There are some measures in it that will be useful for helping people on welfare into work, but the 1.3 million currently on welfare are exempted or grandfathered because the government did not have the political courage and they know their answer is not the answer. It is about punishing those on welfare. It is more about demonising those on welfare and it is about making their conditions worse.</para>
<para>Why? Despite all the talk about the $3.6 billion investment, work it out. I am no mathematician but, if you are paying people $30 to $80 a fortnight less, surely someone is saving a quid there somewhere. We learnt the other day that the government is saving about $1 billion over the out years, but you work it out: if you are paying beneficiaries less, there is a saving. I accept there is expenditure in the equation, but there are also savings. The government has been very coy about the savings. There is also a bit of a fiddle about the previous 2002 expenditure being counted as a saving, but I will leave that for another day.</para>
<para>The clear message I want to deliver is that not only is this opposed by the usual suspects because it is unfair, inequitable and it attacks those who are least able to defend themselves but it is cowardly, it is bad social policy and it is politics of the worst order. The government has chosen to attack those who come onto welfare after July next year because they are easy targets. If it genuinely believed in the solution it is offering, it would do the same for the 1.3 million currently on welfare. So, clearly, this is not about getting people jobs; it is as much about punishing them.</para>
<para>Quite frankly, the claims that Mr Costello makes in terms of his economic and his social credentials have been shown to be a complete failure. He got rolled. He has ducked the issue that he said must be the core of this package. The government has ducked it, and now he wants to take money off what he considers irresponsible parents. I do not know—maybe I am losing my marbles—but was this the same Treasurer who threw $600 per child at every family in Australia last year twice? Was this the same Treasurer who sent cheques of $3,000 to Aboriginal women in communities with five kids twice that led to an increase in alcohol abuse and domestic violence in those communities? Is that the same Treasurer? But now he does not want to—</para>

<para>—Senator, you might recall that the family payment bonuses that were sent out last year led to a great deal of trouble in some Aboriginal and other communities because people suddenly got the biggest cheques of their lives. But now we want to decide who are good parents and who are bad parents. I do not mind—just have some consistency. If the Treasurer wants to have a foray into social policy, he ought to work out where he is coming from and where he is going. The key point in this debate is this: this is bad economics. The government has ducked the hard issues. This is not serious welfare reform; it is fiddling around the edges. Labor supports serious welfare reform, but the government has ducked the hard issues and gone for the soft option, which is punishing those who can least afford it and those people who come onto welfare after July 2006.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>If the government believed in their package, they would have applied it to everybody, but they have not. This is about future victims, ensuring that there are not victims now because the government know they would not have won the debate. The only thing that allows the government to get this package through the parliament now is that there will be no victims until next year. If there had been victims, the government would never have carried their own backbench. Senator Bartlett is right to raise that issue. Judi Moylan did make a good point. I am sorry she did not oppose the bill but she did make a good point. What the government has done is cunning politics but bad social policy. We ought to reject the bill and we ought to hold the government up to account not only for its attack on the poor but for its failure to progress serious welfare reform.</para>

<para>—What a funny speech that was. Here we are as a government being accused of adopting an extreme ideological agenda. That has been the mantra of the last few weeks. Tonight all that has been thrown aside and it is all about cunning politics. Those who operate on the other side really do have to come to a conclusion on this.

I think that that has been Labor’s problem for the last few years. They think that that is cunning politics but I do not think it is cunning politics and the Australian people will not wear it.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I must express my disappointment at the contributions of both the Deputy Leader of the Democrats and the Leader of the Opposition in this place. Until their contributions, we were engaging in what the committee stage is usually about. But we have now witnessed basically a diatribe of opposition for opposition’s sake without them presenting any real alternatives. Senator Bartlett bemoans the fact that we have time-managed this debate. Well, those on the other side combined with the Democrats to put through—what was it, Senator Bartlett?—61 bills in one hour. Do not come to me, hand on heart, asserting to the Australian people and others that the Democrats or those on the other side would never countenance such behaviour. It seems that if Labor and the Democrats conspired to put 61 bills through in one hour that is okay because the Democrats say it is okay, but if we as a government say, ‘How about limiting this to a sensible number of hours?’ that is an outrage to democracy. The people on the other side continually play these double standards. That is why those on the other side are losing support from the Australian people.</para>
<para>I will correct Senator Bartlett. Current recipients will not be paid less. Other than that, I will basically ignore the provocations of Senator Bartlett’s speech so that we can return to the issues at hand. With regard to his great request to those on this side to cross the floor, methinks that there might be some people on the Labor side and indeed in the Democrats to whom I could make a similar request and suggestion. I could say: ‘Forget what the deputy leader of your party is saying. You know it’s nonsense. You know it doesn’t stack up. Come across and support the government side.’ That sort of argument is, quite frankly, fatuous and gets us nowhere. We know that if anyone from the Australian Labor Party crosses the floor they are in for automatic expulsion.</para>
<para>I will turn to Senator Evans’s contribution. He tried to approach this, he told us, from the right-wing perspective. Clearly he is a failure from the left-wing perspective. He has now confirmed he is also a failure from the right-wing perspective and, as a result, his contribution to public policy, I suppose, is as we have known it to be for his total career in this place—that is, not much. We heard the mantra of ‘victims’ and ‘punishing people’ and all that sort of terminology. Can I just ask for a degree of consistency? If we were out to victimise people—I think the phrase was ‘demonising those on welfare’—and if that was our motivation, why would we stop and grandfather people? Why not demonise the whole lot, if that is our motivation? Those on the other side cannot have it both ways. That is the devastatingly embarrassing position for those on the other side because they operate in a policy vacuum. They grasp at one argument to condemn us because the only policy is to oppose. They then grab at another argument to throw at us, not realising that the arguments are inconsistent. What the Australian people are wanting from the Australian Labor Party is not only opposition but alternatives.</para>
<para>If you are only going to concentrate on opposition for opposition’s sake, can I make a plea? At least make your opposition consistent so it at least stacks up, so you can at least argue it with a straight face to the Australian people. You cannot argue one day that this is just extreme ideology and then argue the next that this is just cunning politics with an eye to opinion polls, or that this is wrong from a right-wing perspective but then it is also wrong from a left-wing perspective. Get your arguments together, get them coherent and then get some traction within the community. But that is the problem when you operate in a policy vacuum, as the Australian Labor Party have done. Unfortunately, Senator Evans’s contribution confirms the lament of Mr Latham—and others in the Labor Party—who some five years into the Howard government—about halfway through, on Friday, 26 October—commented:</para>

<para>—You can misbehave and everybody else has to behave themselves! Double standards—that is fairly typical. Mr Temporary Chair, I accept your invitation and I withdraw. I would not want to sink to the standards of the minister. The fact is that there is an amendment before the chair that the minister has ignored. Not only has he ignored it; he has openly stated he is actually just giving a 15-minute homily. It is out of order to not address the amendment before the chair. We are not at the start of the committee stage. We are dealing with an amendment. I know the minister has dodged the core fact of this amendment 32 times in question time. The fact is he is dodging it again now.</para>

<para>—Mr Temporary Chair, I am discussing the amendment in just as great a detail as Senator Chris Evans did. It is interesting that there is one rule for those on the other side which they will not allow for this side. The simple fact is that welfare dependency can kill a society and suffocate self-esteem and the stability of a normal life. The perpetual dilemma of Centre Left parties is supporting the active role of government but not knowing when to stop. And that is the great dilemma for those opposite. The assertion was made, and it was a wrong assertion, that current disability support recipients do not get any assistance. That is just wrong.</para>

That was the statement that I was repeating. That is wrong. Currently, there are 23,000 vocational rehabilitation places for people on the disability support pension and there are 39,000 disability specialist service places, and therefore to assert that there is no current support for those recipients is simply wrong.</para>

I simply say that grandfathering current recipients is not an unusual activity. Indeed, when parliamentarians’ superannuation was considered by those opposite, guess what they did? They said that those on the current benefit should remain on it. Only new MPs should get the lower superannuation rate. That is a classic example of grandfathering and a Labor policy. But now of course they say that you should no longer be grandfathering.</para>

But those in this chamber cannot make the tough decisions in relation to these matters to ensure the wellbeing of the individuals concerned and also the children who are within those family units.

<para>—I have two points I want to raise this evening. The first is the point I alluded to last night in my speech in the second reading debate, and that is the issue that refers to people with degenerative diseases who have, in my view and in theirs, been caught up in this package of measures. The package of measures is ostensibly addressing people with disabilities but, as a part of that, large numbers of people with degenerative diseases—people who have MS, people who have motor neurone disease, people with Crohn’s disease, people with chronic rheumatoid arthritis and people with HIV-AIDS—have now been caught up in this package of measures and they do not fit. I made the point last night that this package of measures is poorly targeted and has not been well consulted on. This group of people in particular cannot be accommodated in this package of measures.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Will the government contemplate the request, from the MS Society in particular, that people with chronic illness—neurological disease—be exempted from this measure because they do not fit? If that is not possible, then why is it that you cannot give a commitment to this group of people that they will be able to have an assessment in a shorter period than two years? These people have a disease that means their condition degenerates over time. It means that they are not going to get better. They are not going to get to a position where they are going to be able to work longer hours; they know they have got an ailment that will inevitably lead them to work fewer and fewer hours. Why do they have to wait for two years to have another assessment of their ability to work?</para>
<para>Why is it that there is no consideration of the time it takes for this group of people to get to employment? You should know, Minister, that this group of people has extraordinary difficulties to overcome to get to work. But you should also know that people with MS in particular have a higher rate of employment than the Australian average for part-time work. So there is the proof, if you needed it, that if any group of people wants to maintain their place in the work force, it is the group of people with MS. But this system will make their life less tenable. We have had that evidence in the inquiry.</para>
<para>Minister, why won’t people with degenerative illness be excluded from this package? They do not fit. They cannot increase their capacity to work. The nature of their disease means that their capacity will diminish over time—that is a fact; it will not change. And if you will not exempt this group of people, why won’t you guarantee the capacity for people under review to obtain medical, neurological, rehabilitation, urological or psychiatric assessment in the CWCA?</para>

I respond by saying that the government remains committed to providing a sustainable and adequate safety net for people with disabilities who cannot work substantial part-time hours in the open labour market.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There is no requirement to wait two years before seeking a new assessment. I understand that Senator McLucas—I believe mistakenly—believed that to be the case, and said that in her speech, but I understand from the advice given to me that that is not the case. An assessment can be sought by the claimant or by their—</para>

<para>—Yes, that is right—it can be sought by the claimant or by their employment service provider. Information about a person’s medical condition or conditions provided by the claimant, their treating doctor and any treating specialist is taken into account when assessing the impact of conditions on ability to work. A person can reapply—make a new claim for payment—at any time. This includes where there is new medical information that a condition has deteriorated. They can also seek reconsideration of the original decision if they consider that the decision to reject the claim was wrong. So there is a lot of flexibility in the system as we are proposing it.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>We do take into account the circumstances that Senator McLucas has indicated. People with a degenerative disease will unfortunately, it stands to reason, have their work capacity reduced over time. Undoubtedly, there will be an unfortunate time when being able to work 15 hours per week will no longer be possible and then, of course, they will be entitled to the full disability support pension. But we will continue to concentrate on people’s abilities, rather than saying, ‘Just because you have a degenerative disease, you will no longer be required to work.’ That is because some of these degenerative diseases, as I think we know, can linger for many, many years. I think the example that the honourable senators refer to, in the specifics—those with multiple sclerosis—is an example where many people with the disease can continue to hold down jobs on a part-time basis and do so very well. In those circumstances, it seems to the government, there is no need to exclude them from the general regime, keeping in mind that there is a substantial flexibility in the system as we are proposing it.</para>

<para>—It is very unfortunate that the government is not prepared to accommodate the special needs of this group of people who have been caught up in this proposal, who are desperately hanging on to their employment, who desperately want to work—like most people, in fact. They desperately want to be part of the work force but, because of the variant nature of their disease, they need support. You are going to push these people into a tenuous position—a position where they are not sure whether they are going to have to be looking for work when they are quite ill, because of the variant nature of their disease. But I have made my case. It is very unfortunate.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I want to move now to the case of, let’s say, a person who has cerebral palsy. He turns 21 and applies for Newstart allowance. He is referred for a comprehensive work capacity assessment. This is an issue that was raised during the inquiry, and the answer that I received was not conclusive and not clear. The example was of a person who has cerebral palsy and is turning 21. At that point, they have their comprehensive work capacity assessment. If that assessment says that that person is capable of working 15 hours a week or more but needs support to achieve that, then what will happen, Minister, is that that person then becomes a Newstart recipient.</para>
<para>We are talking about a person with cerebral palsy living in a country town who is taken off the proper disability support payment—he is not taken off it; he does not get on to it—and put on Newstart. That person will stay on Newstart for two years. That is the first point. Why is it that this individual, who cannot obtain the support that they need to become employable for 15 hours, stays on Newstart? I want you to address that, but the substantive question is: after two years—and the department could not be absolutely clear with me on this—does that person have to re-apply and go through another assessment process, given that they have not been able to obtain the support they were told they had to? Do they then go back onto Newstart and does the whole cycle start again? In a rural area, the support that is deemed to be required may not be available. So what happens in the case of that individual who lives in rural Australia?</para>

<para>In relation to people with degenerative diseases, I note that Senator McLucas tried to round off the commentary on that and then moved on to the question I have just answered. In respect of people who have fluctuating health issues, whilst I accept that that can apply to people with degenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, there is a category of people whose health may also fluctuate, and who would feel these circumstances very keenly, and that category is people with mental health issues. As I understand it, there is flexibility built into the system to take into account those sorts of individual situations and to ensure that they are properly catered for.</para>

<para>—I do not want to use up all of the time available myself but, to go back to the requirement for a person to go to support and training in a rural area, I think I may have misled you, Minister. I said, ‘Wagga’. This person apparently lives 100 kilometres from Moree. My geography of New South Wales is not perfect, but I would be very surprised if they were able to receive that sort of assistance in that place. But the legislation makes it very plain that that person will go onto Newstart, potentially have another assessment and be recycled through one assessment process after another. The department could not advise me where in the legislation that circumstance would be avoided.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In terms of your comment about fluctuating illnesses, how many times do you have people come into your electorate office, Minister, to talk about the difficulties they have with Centrelink? That is no reflection on Centrelink personnel; it is the complexity of the system. I have extraordinarily good staff, but they are often befuddled. We have in front of us an extraordinarily complex system—one that is incredibly increased in its complexity. I do not know how my staff will cope; I do not know how Centrelink will cope. And I do not know how a young man who lives 100 kilometres west of Moree will understand what on earth is happening to him. I do not know a young woman with MS, even if she lives in Canberra, will know how she is going to navigate this system.</para>
<para>It is so complex now. People do not know what will happen to them. The essence is that it will all be sorted out in regulations. Sorry, it will be in guidelines. I wish it was in the regulations; we might be able to disallow them. The guidelines are something we will never see. This is an incredibly complex piece of legislation. We have had less than 2½ hours for the committee stage. I needed to put that on the record on behalf of people with degenerative diseases and on behalf of people who live in rural Australia who, whatever the tendering arrangements are, will not get the support that this legislation requires them to get. Think of those people.</para>

<para>—While Senator Fielding is taking his place, I will briefly indicate Labor’s view on his amendment and a number of other amendments which relate to trying to oppose the income support cuts. As I have previously made clear, Labor is of the view that those who can work should work. We are of the view that government policy should be directed to trying to move people from welfare to work. The fact is that the centrepiece of this government’s so-called welfare reform is a reduction in the income support payments of vulnerable Australians. We know from St Vincent de Paul that 70 per cent of their home visits are already to sole parents and people with a disability. These are the groups that this government wants to punish through this package. It is not sufficient to trumpet rhetoric about welfare to work and hope that it actually works. It is not sufficient for the minister to say, ‘We want to concentrate on people’s ability.’ That is an extraordinary way to characterise reducing their income—‘concentrating on their ability’.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We in the Labor Party oppose this bill. We made that clear in the second reading stage. We are prepared to look at supporting amendments moved by the crossbenchers which are consistent with our position—that is, opposition to the income support payment cuts. We do not believe that reducing the payments to vulnerable families is a sensible way to move people from welfare to work. We do not believe it is justified. We do not see why it is a sensible and competent Welfare to Work package for the government to take more of every dollar earned than under current arrangements. Probably the most bizarre thing about the changes that are set out in this legislation that the government trumpets as a Welfare to Work package is that people are actually punished for working: you actually lose more money for working than you do under current arrangements. It is not only bad social policy; it is bad economic policy. It is completely irrational to say, ‘We will take more of every dollar earned and tell people that it is about welfare to work.’ Over and over again we see the government simply trumpeting the welfare to work mantra and not engaging with the real issue, which is how you move people from welfare to work.</para>
<para>Senator Abetz says, ‘We’ve got these other arrangements in place and increased support et cetera.’ We make a number of points about that. You could have done all of that without reducing people’s payments. You could have imposed reasonable activity requirements without cutting people’s payments, but you did not choose to do that; you chose to simply grandfather one lot because you knew it was politically unsaleable and cut the payments of the future recipients. That is the core of your policy. If you really believed reducing people’s incomes was a good way to get them from welfare to work, you would do it to the current recipients, but you will not do that because you know that that is not what this is about. This is fundamentally about reducing incomes. It is about making people who are already vulnerable more vulnerable. It is about making families who are already overrepresented in the poverty statistics poorer and it is about increasing the disincentives to work—that is, making work less attractive than welfare.</para>
<para>Senator Fielding, I want to flag that, in relation to your amendments, the opposition is, consistent with our position, prepared to support it, because we are opposed to reducing the incomes. We do have some concerns with the amendment. It does not go to the issue of people with a disability, and we think, in terms of policy consistency, if we oppose, as we do, the reduction in income to sole parents, we should also—and we will also—oppose the reduction in income support payments to people with a disability. On that basis, I flag our support for the amendment.</para>

<amendment>
<para class="subsection">                  Despite all other provisions of this Act relating to the level of payment of newstart allowance single with children and of parenting payment single allowance, all references to the level of fortnightly payment for a person on newstart allowance single with children are to be read as the same level of fortnightly payment as a person on parenting payment single.</para>
</amendment>
</amendments>
<para class="block">Family First produced a minority report to the inquiry. One of the things that Family First flagged was the issue of single people with children and the concern that we have, but there are others, as the opposition spokesperson notes. I think that it is fairly important that we at least get one of the groups on the table. I call on all senators to really think about the level of Newstart payments for singles with children. Again, Family First’s position is that those on welfare who can work should work and parents with children should be ‘parents first and workers second’.</para>
<para>I do not want to chew up a lot of time. I know there are a number of other amendments here. It is quite simple. This amendment lifts the amount of fortnightly Newstart single with children payments to the same level of payment of parenting payment single. It is not a complex issue; it is very straightforward and very simple. The basis of it is that under the legislation as it stands, if a single parent who is on parenting payment single when the youngest child turns eight is genuinely looking for work and genuinely cannot find work, they will find that they have to live on $29 less per week. This amendment is quite straightforward, and I call on all senators to really think about this amendment. I seek their support.</para>

<para>—The Greens’ position is probably pretty similar to the ALP’s position—that is, we support the intent of this amendment but we do not believe it goes far enough. As you can see from the amendments that we have put, we believe that we should also be addressing the issue of people living with disabilities. We believe that, if this legislation were genuinely about getting people to work, it would be focusing on positive incentives and would not be focusing on moving people onto lower support. That it is not an incentive. What it is going to do it put people in already struggling situations into even worse dire straits. I have been a supporting partner and a supporting parent on a very low salary, and, believe me, it is extremely difficult. When your money runs out, you do not know how you are going to survive. Taking even $29 away from a supporting parent is going to have dire consequences.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>When you do not know when you are going to be able to pay your bills and you have to go to crisis support centres, it does something to you. We are now going to be driving more people to go to crisis support centres. We heard from St Vincent de Paul and a number of other organisations that presented to the committee two weeks ago that they are expecting the number of people going to these services to increase. We also heard that people with disabilities and single parents make up 70 per cent of their clients. They are expecting, as a result of this legislation which will reduce incomes, an increase in clients. The point they made and the point that came out during that committee was that the money to support people needing income support has to come from somewhere. Either it comes from government or it comes from the community. This legislation is transferring people from government support to expecting non-government organisations to support them.</para>
<para>This legislation is going to have a devastating impact. It will reduce people’s incomes, and every dollar counts when you are trying to survive and you are trying to support a family or you are living with disabilities. As I said yesterday, it is no picnic, and this is going to make it worse. We support the intent of this amendment but we do not believe it goes far enough. We have broader-ranging amendments which we will hopefully get on to discussing very shortly.</para>

<para>—I will quickly respond to the contributions. Once again I repudiate the assertions that we are about punishing people. We are about concentrating on people’s abilities, and that is why we are investing $3.6 billion in them. Some comments were made by Senator Wong about irrational policies et cetera. I do not think I will bother to engage on that other than to say that we have at least developed a comprehensive policy and, to my knowledge, it is still the only one on the table for our fellow Australians to see. The other option on the table is just to oppose what we have put forward, and that is not a policy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Last time around Senator Fielding took me up on a point of order and I was willing to cede the ground. This time he said again—and I took a careful note this time—that his view is that people ought to be able to be parents first and workers second. That is a catchy line. Family First has been using it for a while, and good luck to them. But I would ask the honourable senator and Family First: do you say that people on welfare can be parents first at the expense of their fellow Australians after their children reach a particular age threshold? Most people would say you can no longer argue that you should be a parent first after your youngest child has turned 16. You could still argue that children going to grade 11 and 12 and university need parental care, but the issue is where you draw the line. We are suggesting that the line should be drawn now at age eight, when most kids are well and truly ensconced in about grade 3, I think, at primary school. At that stage the single parent would be able to engage in at least some employment.</para>
<para>I respectfully suggest to Family First that a vital component of parental responsibility is to show your children that there is an obligation to work if you can, that work is an important part of engaging in mainstream society and that depending on and living on welfare is not the best way to go. I would say that things like reward for effort and not relying on welfare solely if you are able to work are values that parents should try to instil in their children. Whilst in general terms I can accept that single parents should devote themselves to the care of their children as their No. 1 priority, when their youngest child reaches the age of eight, I think it is appropriate to say to them: ‘Sure, you’ve got parental responsibilities but, hey, how about it? At least 15 hours work a week, three hours a day, whilst the kiddies are at school or some other time might be appropriate.’ The children would see the increased income flow into the household and the other benefits that I have pointed out.</para>
<para>Without going into great detail as to why we oppose the amendment, it is interesting to note that a single parent who works 15 hours per week at the federal minimum wage will receive $487.80 per week mixing paid work with Newstart allowance, compared with only $433.13 for a jobless single parent under the current circumstances. That would be, in very rough terms, an extra $54 a week. Fifty dollars a week by 50 weeks makes an extra $2,500 per year for the household. I think a child would see not only the very real benefits of that in the household but that there is such a thing as reward for effort.</para>

<para>—I am pretty certain that I have always used the phrases ‘those on welfare who can work should work’ and—I repeat ‘and’—‘parents should be “parents first and workers second”.’ It is the combination of those two. If you go down the track and just have ‘those on welfare who can work should work’ without the ‘and parents should be parents first and workers second’, all of a sudden they are taking jobs potentially when they cannot still be parents. Obviously, if they are working from 2 am until 9 am in the morning, it is very difficult. So it is very important that those two phrases go together to make sure that we have that individual responsibility and the community obligation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I do not want to go back and forth, but that was the point of clarification. There are a lot of good things in this bill. There is no doubt that having 700,000 children growing up in jobless homes is not good news—and we need to be doing more. The question here goes to the situation where someone is genuinely looking for work and cannot find work and all of a sudden they have to live on less.</para>

<para>—I want to put on the record that the Democrats support this amendment. It simply ensures that some parents with children do not have their income cut. It was a nice little philosophical debate between Senator Abetz and Senator Fielding about the role of parenting, but the simple fact is that, if this amendment is not passed, a lot of parents will have their income cut—and, again, nobody has explained how that will help them get a job.</para>

<para class="block">I will try to not take up my allotted time, because there are other senators who want to speak. The opposition is moving to oppose these two schedules because these are the schedules which impose the harsh and extreme income cuts on vulnerable Australians—people this government obviously cares little about. We see the same attitude in this legislation as we saw in the industrial relations legislation. The Howard government say, ‘We don’t mind creating a class of working poor in Australia. We don’t mind junking the principle of a fair go. We don’t mind junking the principle of fairness’—something Australians have always strived for and have always supported.</para>
<para>In the industrial relations legislation we saw the government voting time and time again to remove fairness and to oppose amendments that put fairness into the industrial relations system. What we see in this legislation is precisely the same attitude. It is an attitude that is coloured by a view that Australia is better off having an American social model. That is what this legislation does—particularly when it is combined with the industrial relations legislation. It is recasting Australia with an American die. It is the Howard government redrawing Australia into the American social model. It is the Howard government junking some core Australian values of fairness, of ensuring that those who cannot look after themselves and those who are disadvantaged are cared for and properly supported and that they have a modicum of dignity in our society.</para>
<para>The reason Australia has always supported these values is that we understand that we as individuals have a relationship to others in our community and, if others fail, if others struggle, if others are vulnerable, if others do not have enough to eat, the whole community suffers. There are social costs and there are moral costs. It is a question of values, and what we see in this government is an extreme agenda that is about imposing an American social model on Australia. We know that the American social security system offers virtually no financial security for the jobless, and America has an army of working poor. That is precisely the way this government is approaching its so-called welfare reform.</para>
<para>One of the most insidious things in this legislation—which we will not be able to discuss in detail due to the guillotine that has been applied—is the way in which this government will force jobless people to work for dirt or get nothing. The government have removed the protection of awards from the test of suitable employment. That will mean that a job seeker, a person with a disability or a sole parent will have to take a job provided it complies with the four minimum conditions, which are simply inadequate, and the minimum hourly rate and no other award conditions, or risk having their payments cut. That is what it means. People will have no choice. You either work for peanuts or you get nothing.</para>
<para>There is the removal of the award protections and, combined with that, the government is saying that if you lose your job—supposedly for misconduct or through some voluntary act—you also get an eight-week breach. What happens then? This is another area where the industrial relations extreme agenda collides with these welfare changes, because the removal of unfair dismissal will mean that people cannot dispute a false allegation of misconduct. They can be in the position of having an eight-week breach and not being able to dispute it through the industrial relations system, because this government is removing unfair dismissal from 98 per cent of Australian workplaces and workers.</para>
<para>The reality is that this legislation is not about welfare reform. This legislation is, at its core, about reducing the income payments to vulnerable Australians. These are families and individuals who are already overrepresented in the poverty statistics. These are vulnerable Australians. We have heard again tonight that St Vincent de Paul told the committee inquiring into this bill that 70 per cent of the visits they already make to homes are to people with a disability and to sole parents. This government should be doing something to encourage and support these people out of welfare and into work. But no; what do they do instead? They say, ‘We will cut their payments; we will put them onto the dole in the future.’ The dole was never meant as an income support payment for people with a disability. It was never meant as an income support payment for parents. That was never the basis on which the dole was introduced and it is not a payment that is structured or at the right level for those groups—people living with the costs of disability and people living with the costs of parenting.</para>
<para>I have already spoken about the irrational and economically unsound approach the government have taken in relation to tax when it comes to Welfare to Work. They have actually come up with a set of changes which make work less financially attractive. It is pretty extraordinary to have the gall to call something a Welfare to Work package when you take more money off people for doing the right thing and when people earn less and keep less in their pockets for every dollar earned under the new system than under the current system—when you are increasing the disincentives.</para>
<para>At the core of the changes, as I have said, is a reduction in the family budgets of vulnerable Australians, and we on this side do not believe that is welfare reform. As I said before, if the government thought this was a good idea, if they thought this really would help people into work, they would have applied it to existing recipients. But they are not doing that, because it is politically unsaleable because it is unjust and it is unfair and they want to quarantine the political pain. What they are doing is attacking those who are to come; they are doing it in respect of people to come. I will not even go through the issues of transitional provisions—where, frankly, they are not protecting existing recipients in the way they said they would on budget night—because we do not have the time. The primary political objective is: ‘We’ll attack the incomes of those to come because we can do so politically because we have the numbers in the Senate now.’</para>
<para>This is unfair legislation. This is absolutely unfair legislation and, combined with the industrial relations legislation, it is not about increasing opportunity, it is not about increasing skills, it is not about ensuring people have the opportunity to move from welfare to work. What it is about is reducing the amount of money that already vulnerable families have to put food on the table. That is what it is about. So the amendments moved by the opposition relate to those schedules of the bill which impose the reduction in income, because we do not believe that is welfare reform.</para>

<para>—I did of course have many other Democrat amendments which—contrary to the Special Minister of State’s continual statement that there are no proposals, no policies and nothing constructive from this side, that we just oppose for opposition’s sake—would actually have fixed some of the many small but nonetheless significant flaws in the legislation. Indeed, I point to the evidence from the Welfare Rights Centre to the Senate committee inquiry. They are probably the group in Australia that know more about the Social Security Act than just about anybody—certainly more than the minister does—because they deal with its consequences every day of the week. In the disgracefully short time frame for the committee inquiry—frankly, a time frame that could not be painted as anything other than a dereliction of duty—even the Welfare Rights Centre were unable to go through the legislation adequately because, even without these changes, it is already an incredibly complex act, and this legislation will make it far more complex. But the amendments the Democrats put forward would have addressed a number of the administrative flaws that the Welfare Rights Centre identified.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is particularly frustrating because I know, from my own experience as a past spokesperson for social security and indeed as a former adviser, before I was in this chamber, to other Democrat senators who had the social security portfolio, that it has taken many years of amendments and debates and inquiries in this chamber to put in place some of the administrative protections that minimise the number of people who inadvertently fall through the cracks. So many of those protections are now just being ripped away again by the government, because it is so much easier for them to leave it all open and put in place guidelines as they go along, down the track.</para>
<para>The opposition amendments before us address the schedules whose core aspect is to reduce people’s income. The minister is always happy to misrepresent and smear anyone on this side of the chamber who simply expresses opposition to the notion of reducing the income of sole parents and people with a disability, so I will quote Judi Moylan; perhaps he will not smear her, given that she is a Liberal member of the House of Representatives. Her comment was that she did not agree with increasing the ‘spiral of poverty’ among the most disadvantaged people in the community, that we should be able to get people off welfare without driving them into a spiral of poverty. I agree wholeheartedly. We do have alternatives; certainly, the Democrats have alternatives. We have put some of those alternatives and improvements through amendments. We do have an alternative vision of our own, but the purpose of this debate is to debate the government’s proposals, not to put forward our own range of alternatives.</para>
<para>The simple fact is that this legislation will drive people into a spiral of poverty. It will mean reduced income for thousands and thousands of Australians and their children. You have to wonder sometimes if people in the government, particularly those in cabinet, who draw up these things do not really know what it is like when $5 or $2 can make a difference to you, but that is what it is like now for many people out there. This legislation is going to take $30 a week from many people. It is going to take $80 a week from many people, people with a disability who have extra expenses over and above those many of us have. That is a consequence of the legislation and in particular the schedules that are the subject of the amendments before the chamber. Even if people support the rest of the legislation, removing these schedules would address the problem, as Judi Moylan said, of driving people into a spiral of poverty. I moved amendments before to deal with this; the minister ignored them, as he has ignored the many questions asking how driving people into poverty helps them to get into work. I presume he will do the same now and again ignore that core question, but the simple fact is that that is what is going on here.</para>
<para>I find it immensely distressing that, somehow or other, there is not a single coalition senator who agrees that this is completely unacceptable. I find it obscene that, when we apparently have a surplus approximating $14 billion and there is talk of more tax cuts for the top income earners in the next budget—four budgets in a row—at the same time we are going to reduce the incomes of the poorest people in the community. That is obscene. It is completely unjustified. I am extremely disappointed that there is not a single coalition senator, apparently—we will see once the vote on these amendments is taken—who also recognises that obscenity and is willing to stand up to make sure it does not happen.</para>

<para>—The Greens actually proposed exactly the same amendment as the ALP for dealing with the disability support pension and a similar amendment for parenting payments. To my mind, this is about providing a cheap labour source for industry. I do not believe that driving down people’s income will encourage people to go to work. It certainly will not enable them to get into jobs that they find meaningful. It will drive them into shorter term, dead-end jobs. It will not enable people to undertake study, because of the onerous requirements on them and the fact that study will have to be done on top of their work requirements. If you are studying, you do not get top-up. You are still on Newstart, so you are losing out whichever way you look at it. It is going to drive people into poverty. When you combine this with Work Choices, we are going to end up with a class of working poor in this country. As I have said before, a job is a job is a job is not the point. We are trying to encourage people into fulfilling, meaningful jobs and to upskill. We keep talking about the skills crisis in this country, but we are not adequately addressing that through this legislation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This legislation is draconian. It is mean, it is not fair and it is unjust. I do not believe that is the sort of country we live in. I do not believe that is the sort of society we live in. I believe that we should be living in a just and caring society, and this legislation is neither just nor caring. It is neither just nor caring to take money away from people living in poverty. It is taking money away from supporting parents and their children. It is not, as the government keeps claiming, taking people out of poverty; it will drive people into poverty. We all know the impacts of poverty in terms of social structure and health and we know about its relationship with crime and those sorts of things. This legislation is not just; it is not caring. If we are truly looking at how we can support people into work—which, of course, the Australian Greens support as well—we should be looking at incentives, not just taking money away from them. It is not going to work. It is going to increase the load on our crisis care organisations in this country.</para>
<para>Single parents will be required to make a choice between their family and their job. If they want to study, as I said, it is going to be virtually impossible. You cannot survive on Austudy if you are supporting a family. You cannot survive on Newstart and try to work and study. It is going to be impossible because, if you are on Newstart, it just does not provide the incentives for training. I believe that, in this day and age, this is an abomination. We have a boom economy at the moment. We can afford to properly look after those less fortunate in our community. We can afford to provide adequate training and adequate incentives. There is no justification, in this day and age, in the 21st century, to be lowering income support payments for people, and I do not believe that the Australian community wants that. I do not believe the Australian community feels this is just or caring.</para>

<para>—We traversed the industrial relations legislation, we did all sorts of things in the other contributions, and those opposite know it. Indeed, we were even subjected to another spray of anti-American sentiment. I can see Mr Beazley pulling out the American flag very shortly and doing a press conference in front of it to try to show what a strong supporter he is. I emphasise that these are Australian solutions for Australian problems to assist Australian individuals. Unfortunately the mantra coming from the other side encourages a job snob mentality. The opposition talks about money but not about those important things, pride and self-esteem. The effect of our amendments is: to shift the focus of the welfare system onto people’s capacity to participate in the labour market, not their incapacity; to provide participation requirements with safeguards for people with a capacity to work independently for 15 hours or more; to provide more than $500 million worth of employment services, more vocational rehabilitation services and other initiatives, such as Wage Assist and an expanded work modification scheme; and to provide more money for mobility allowance to people with disabilities, which will be increased from $69 to $100 a fortnight.</para>

</continue>
<para>The Labor Party is opposing support and opportunity. Not once has the Labor Party admitted the mistakes in shifting hundreds of thousands of Australians who had the capacity to work onto a pension. In May 1991 the Labor government introduced a social security amendment bill which was a clayton’s attempt at reform: the reform you have when you are not really committed to reform. This included the unemployed having to wait 12 months for any job search intervention. There was no date for when an activity agreement had to be signed. Job seekers over the age of 55 did not have to report their job search activities. They were consigned to the unemployment scrap heap. And that is the fair and just Australia that Senator Wong and those opposite seek to justify. It was a social experiment that has failed. We are working to ensure a just and fair Australia for the benefit of all the individuals on welfare—to assist them to re-enter the work force and the mainstream—for their children and for the community at large.</para>

<para>—I rise tonight to speak about an action—not about a person and not about any flaws of a character but an action that will be dealt with if we come to pass the bill relating to RU486. The fundamental question that must be posed over the abortion pill RU486 is whether it deals with one person or two. If you believe that a human life which is killed by this medication is not a human life then what is it? It is not horse life, bird life or the formative stage of a tree; it is indisputably human life. If you do not have any rights over your life at the stage of nine weeks, the apparent limit of this process, at what juncture do you get the right to your own life? What is the occurrence when and why does killing a person goes from being the right of a third party to being a crime? There is never a cognisant argument as to where, and why, this point is. It cannot be an honourable house and at the same time sanction, sanitise and excuse the killing of innocent human life.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I have heard Senator Stott Despoja speaking on state-sanctioned killing and being lost for words at 4.13 pm on Tuesday, 29 November. Well, this is abhorrent state-sanctioned killing. We are definitely dealing with human life. The killing is definitely sanctioned by the state. The people being killed are definitely innocent of any crime, yet we justify our right to kill them. For those who are killed, the form in which they are killed is abhorrent and barbaric.</para>
<para>Senator Nettle said at 4.27 pm on 29 November that we have to have a ‘consistent principle’ when it comes to the death penalty. ‘The death penalty is final’, she said; it ‘is the end of their life.’ And, she said, ‘we support justice.’ What justice do those who have committed no crime get when we terminate their life?</para>
<para>Apparently rights are not diminished by age through our life except when we cannot see the person because they are in utero. That is philosophically and scientifically illogical. Rights should not be diminished by the person’s cognisance of those rights. Your rights are not diminished because you are asleep, though you are not aware of them. If you are inebriated, your right to life should remain unaffected. The day after you are born you are not aware of your rights, but the state says your killing by a third party is murder. Why is it that the person unborn can be destroyed and it is not only sanctioned by the state but also paid for by the state?</para>
<para>We allow the sanctioning of killing of those persons not born but certainly alive because we believe our rights are superior to theirs. Why is this so? Why do we hold this conceit that we have the right of life or death over innocent third parties? What did they do wrong to deserve this? What crime did they commit? When do they have their day in court?</para>
<para>If rights are determined by nurture then what is the principle that justifies that, and why does it not apply to the baby in the bassinette? We are responsible for a baby’s nurture long after it is born and that responsibility is widely accepted as unambiguous. If a baby is in a person’s body, it is no more that person’s property than if it is in that person’s house or in that person’s bassinette. I have a responsibility for the person’s welfare but I do not have a right over their life.</para>
<para>Putting aside all these arguments by saying this is a women’s health issue or this is an issue for the Therapeutic Goods Administration is a very convenient avoidance of the key issue—that we are dealing with a separate person’s life. We are not dealing with a drug that assists with an ailment such as tuberculosis or tetanus; we are dealing with one that terminates a human life.</para>
<para>Even though I feel it is an affront, let us deal with the health issue for the other party this drug affects—the mother. This drug, mifepristone—RU486—and misoprostol make up a two-course treatment. The first, mifepristone, is an artificial steroid that blocks progesterone, a hormone needed to continue the pregnancy. The effect if it is taken is to starve the unborn child of nutrients. As a result, the foetus—a Latin term meaning offspring—or the foetus’s precursor dies. The mother is then living with a dead human life inside of her and, as such, the foetus starts to mummify. However, if there is any chance of infection you will get putrefaction, which leads to a clostridial infection that can quickly cause death. The side effects of this drug enhance the likelihood of this occurrence.</para>
<para>The second stage of the abortion process utilises misoprostol, a prostaglandin analogue which induces contractions, expelling the embryo and the uterine lining. This is associated with heavy bleeding and, if the foetus is not expelled, can lead to very serious consequences.</para>
<para>The issue in remote areas of our country is, of course, an instance where the mother takes the first course of the treatment but not the second. The first person in one of our remote communities who dies from this process is definitely our responsibility and undoubtedly the responsibility of this house.</para>
<para>Because RU486 works by blocking the effects of progesterone, the anti-progesterone effects also cause a change in the cervix which may allow <inline font-style="italic">Clostridium sordellii</inline>, a common vaginal bacterium, to enter the cervical canal. The bacteria derive nutrition from the decaying foetal tissue. Alongside this, other hormonal effects of RU486 include antiglucocorticoid actions which are taking place throughout the body. This disruption impairs the body’s ability to fight off <inline font-style="italic">Clostridium sordellii</inline> and so may spread the bacteria’s toxic by-products, a combination that can lead to septic shock.</para>
<para>In July this year, US Senator DeMint called on congress to pass the RU-486 Suspension and Review Act. This call followed further deaths of American women after taking the abortion pill. There have been at least 600 additional women who have experienced adverse events from RU486, including 200 adverse events that were either life-threatening or extremely serious. From Americans’ experience with this drug, it is clear we must consider the health of the mother.</para>
<para>Ultimately this is an argument about how we justify our belief that our rights surpass another’s over the essence of their existence—their life. We conjure up a plethora of euphemisms to avoid calling a human life a constant experience from conception through birth and our ultimate demise at death. We hope to live under the protection of law, yet this house is about to—or could be about to—further enunciate that the law of the protection of life, the most precious of our rights, is seriously flawed, and subjective, varying according to age and development.</para>
<para>I would like to leave you with one experience—that of Rachel. It has come from a US report.</para>
<quote>
<para>[Rachel] still remembers most vividly the last moment of the whole ordeal; when she woke up for the millionth time and went to the bathroom the morning after taking the second part of the dangerous abortion drug, feeling crampy and achy. She looked down and saw the unborn baby. She looked at the baby for a long time because the baby was bigger than she expected. She stared for what seemed like an hour—frozen, tired.</para>
<para>It seemed rude to flush it, she thought to herself. ‘I should be having a burial or something.’ But then she heard her daughter awaken and thought: ‘Well, you have to get on with your day.’</para>

</talker>
<para>—I would like to speak about an issue that has got a fair bit of coverage in the last couple of days in the mainstream media, the matter of Mr al-Tekriti. I will start, as I did in mentioning this briefly in the debate on the motion to take note of answers this afternoon, by making a fairly rare statement. That is that I support Minister Vanstone’s approach on this, certainly on the basis of the facts that I am aware of and those in the public arena. It is not very common for the Democrats and me to support Minister Vanstone in a controversy around refugee visas but, from all that I have seen, I think this, frankly, is an example of where the rule of law has been shown to operate. It shows the importance of having an independent tribunal able to assess claims.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I appreciate that there is a lot of difficulty for people who want to speak out on this matter, because they are worried that, if evidence comes out, it can easily be said, for example, ‘Bartlett defends war criminals,’ and those sorts of things. Certainly, if evidence does come to light down the track—because I do not think any of us are in a position to make judgments about this person’s life back in Iraq—about potential war crimes, we can reconsider it. But we can all rest assured that the evidence has been considered by a body that is set up specifically to consider these things, and that is the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It considered the evidence and found that the evidence did not have weight.</para>
<para>In those circumstances, frankly, I think the big issue here is why it is that we are denying other people from Iraq the opportunity to have independent assessments made of negative security assessments of them. I talk about the two men who are left on Nauru. They are the only two people there. They have been there for over four years. They are both from Iraq. They were rejected by ASIO on security grounds, on grounds that they do not know the details of and that they have had no chance to defend themselves against. If any of us could imagine ourselves being put in a position where we were imprisoned and, in effect, exiled on the basis of allegations that we were not able to be made aware of and had no opportunity to appeal against, I think we could all understand how unbelievably frustrating and infuriating that would be. I call on the minister to look at those two people, recognise they have not had an independent assessment, an independent re-examination of the assessment that has been made, and at least give them that right.</para>

<para>The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has published a general ruling 49421 which is the edited public version of an administratively binding advice issued to an ATO client on this type of diesel. Should the ATO have directly advised Axiom, this advice is subject to the secrecy provisions of the relevant legislation. On 22 August 2005 Treasury wrote to a number of companies, including Axiom, noting that under the current excise tariff diesel from waste plastic is not excisable and that this situation arises from a failure of the excise tariff to keep pace with certain advances in industry technology rather than being a reflection of active Government policy. Treasury also indicated that under the Government’s fuel tax policy, all fuels used in internal combustion engines are intended to be subject to excise. Axiom, and the other companies, were invited to make a submission or discuss the matter in the Treasury letter.</para>
