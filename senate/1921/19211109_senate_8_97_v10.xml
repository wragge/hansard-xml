It was to the effect that, after a conference he had with the high council of the Public Service organizations, their objection to the clause referred to had been withdrawn. 1" have since been informed by a representative of the Public Service organizations that that is not so, and I mention the matter now to give the Minister an opportunity to reconsider the clause at a later stage. </para>

I saw the Central Executive of the Returned Soldiers and Sailors Imperial League, and they informed me that proposals for the amendment of the Public Service Bill sent in by particular branches were to be ignored, and only those submitted by the Central Executive of the League to be considered. I appreciated that, because a number of proposals were sent in by branches in different States. I gave the organization all the time they wanted, and, finally, there were, I think, only four clauses in connexion with which their suggestions were not finally dealt with. I gave the executive of the Public Service Association an interview of over three hours. I agreed to certain concessions they demanded, and blankly refused some of their demands because they had already been voted upon in the Senate. I do not know to which particular clause
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline>
                        refers, but I had no intention of stating that the Public Service Association accepted the Bill as a whole. I mentioned to the executive that the provisions of the' Bill were considered by myself with other members of the Government, as a sub -Committee of the Cabinet. I said that I could not accept certain suggestions because the Government had considered and rejected them. They left me in a perfectly friendly way after shaking hands. . They took notes, and marked their copies of the Bill to show the concessions I was prepared to make, and I am redeeming my promises in that regard  by the amendments I am proposing. They knew just as well that there were other proposals of theirs which the Government were not prepared to accede to. What I said was that I had met them, and conferred on nearly every clause. When they went away  they  expressed no dissatisfaction. They put up a good case; but I was quite candid, and told them what I would and what I would not accept. To-day I purpose redeeming the promises I made to the civil servants and the returned soldiers, but I shall not grant everything they asked for. Four suggestions, which I referred to Cabinet, were rejected.

                    <para>-  I draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that no period, during which an officer may be suspended, is fixed in this clause. There should be some limit, such as twenty-one days. I realize that we cannot return to the portion of the clause dealing with this matter, but there should be some limit to the period of suspension before the hearing of a charge. </para>

                    <para>. -  There seems to be some misunderstanding on the part of honorable senators. The Courts will determine the issues that may be responsible for the suspension of an officer. The Act provides that an officer who may be suspended shall be entitled to receive his salary during his period of suspension unless he absconds, or unless otherwise ordered. The other day I quoted the case of a public servant who had been tried three times. The jury failed to agree. In his case the proceedings took eight or nine months. </para>

                        <para>- No. I do not think that there was any one who did not believe he was guilty. Some honorable senators seem to think that we are out to hit the public servant. That is not so at all, but we must provide adequate protection for the Departments. If a man commits a criminal offence or misappropriates money belonging to the Government, it is not likely that he will be kept on full pay during his period of suspension. The extreme penalty is provided, because it is necessary to be in a position to deal with any officer who misbehaves himself. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am rather astonished at some of the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior,</inline> who seems to assume that the members of the Board will be biased. These gentlemen will be on oath, and will serve as members of an independent Court. Has the honorable senator  ever  known of an advocate occupying a seat on the bench? If those who have to come before the Court require an advocate, they can, if they desire, obtain the assistance of a King's counsel. The suggestion of the honorable senator is unreasonable, because the Board will comprise three public servants conversant with departmental procedure. One will  be a permanent  chairman,  another an officer of the Department, and the third an elected representative of the division to which the appellant belongs. If I had to appear before a jury I would prefer it to be comprised of members of this Senate, because they know my virtues as well as my sins. The impression seems to exist in the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> that were desirous of punishing public servants. </para>

                        <para>- We do not wish to be severe, but are anxious to prevent wrong being done. It is not likely that many cases will come before the Appeal Board - I doubt whether there will be more than twenty-five per annum - because the number hitherto has been comparatively small. The cases to be dealt with by the Board will relate largely to technical irregularities inside the Departments. These go before the Commissioner, or the head of the Department. I hear of cases' practically every week, and I am bound to say that, unless there be a rare instance of a man bluffing, no difficulty is found in securing a, fair adjustment. Just treatment has always been meted out by the Commissioner, and I feel sure the same can be said with regard to departmental heads and inspectors. Under this Bill the proposal is that the right of appeal shall be to three members of the Public Service. What more generous offer could be made than to provide appellants with a jury drawn from their own ranks? Would a Board consisting of three outsiders, or including two, or one, be better from their point of view ? </para>

                        <para>- The objection to the present Board appears to be that appellants lack confidence in it. I cannot understand the reason, but it may be either due to doubt concerning the merits of the appeal, or to actual cowardice on the part of the would-be appellant. I affirm that there is no reason to fear or distrust the Board. As for any question of bias, as I have just indicated, the members of the proposed Appeal Board will be put upon oath to undertake to perform, their duties without thought or fear of bias. That should be sufficient protection. </para>

                    <para>.- It is generally understood that the employees' representative upon an Appeal Board has been elected specifically to look after the interests of employees. The latter certainly expect as much from him. I was once acting as secretary to the Queensland Railways Appeal Board, which consisted of three members. The  chairman,  however, was an outsider. It would be beneficial to the Commonwealth Public Service if the  chairman  of the proposed Board was also an outsider. In the Queensland Railways Board the  chairman  was a police magistrate; the other members were the head of the Department immediately concerned, and a person directly elected by the employees themselves. Appeals would generally be heard in a Police Court. After hearing evidence, the Board would retire to discuss the case. Comments, each from his own point of view, would be offered by the head of the Department and the employees' representative, to which the  chairman  would carefully listen. Generally - unless, of course, the case was an obviously bad one - the appellant would gain some benefit from having gone before the Board ; and, naturally, it was popular with the railway service. I think it may be said of Appeal Boards, as a whole, that they are worth stating one's case before. </para>

Indeed, I suggested the name of an officer in the Attorney-General's Department, and the proposition was received with pleasure; so that I feel confident that the Service will welcome the appointment of a Board consisting entirely of members drawn from the Service. </para>

I do not want to suggest that there are not men in the Civil Service who are capable of taking the position. My object is to secure an ideal Appeal Board, and that object, I think, can only be achieved in the way that I have indicated.

                    <para>. -  The Committee has already decided in favour of the appointment of a man from outside the Public Service. That has been provided for by inserting certain words in clause 7, which states that "Unless otherwise expressly provided this Act shall not apply to . . . the Commissioner of Taxation." The Committee inserted after " the Commissioner of Taxation " the  Chairman  of the Appeal Board as one of the officers to whom the Act should not apply. When interviewing representatives of the civil servants I gathered that they did not desire that an outsider should be appointed. The Government, therefore, proposes to revert to the original proposal. I intend to re-commit the Bill. When this is done, the Committee will have an opportunity of dealing with the clause' as a whole, when there will be a straightout issue as to whether the  chairman  should be a civil servant or a man from outside the Service. </para>

                    <para>. -  I know it is somewhat tragic that we should be hammering out some of these clauses, and that our conduct as legislators in doing so should not be universally appreciated. At the same time I want to say that my perspective of the Bill is that it affects 25,000 civil servants throughout the Commonwealth, and that it is the duty of honorable senators, as far as possible, to see that they get a " fair deal." The Minister's attitude in connexion with these apparently small matters is ever courteous and gentlemanly, and I am sure he will recognise that honorable senators are approaching the Bill from a proper standpoint. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> is redeeming the promises he has given to civil servants, and if honorable senators do their duty the Bill, by the time it has passed the Senate, will be as fair a deal to civil servants as this Senate can make it. In regard to subclause 5 I am somewhat inclined to agree with the Minister that the  chairman  of the Appeal Board should be a public servant. In view of what the Minister has said, I think we may assume that the  chairman  will be a civil servant not connected in any way either with the officer who has inflicted the penalty or with the Department in which the offender is employed. </para>

                        <para>- The effect of those two amendments, if inserted in the Bill, would be that the  chairman  of the Board would be an independent person; that the second member of the Board would be quite outside the division, organization, or Department to which the delinquent belonged; and that the third member of the Board would be the elected representative of the organization to which the delinquent belonged, and who, consequently, would probably be more of an advocate than a judge. As the clause stands, we have got two independent members of the Board of Appeal and one member who, it is reasonable to expect, would lean rather on the side of the officer who imposed the penalty. The suggested amendments would make the clause one-sided to the appellant. As the Bill stands, it is a little lop-sided against the appellant. The appeals are appeals against punishment inflicted by the chief officer. The second member of the Board of Appeal, as the clause stands, will be " an officer of the Department to which the appellant belongs (not being an officer concerned in the laying of the charge against the appellant), appointed by the chief officer for the purpose of the particular appeal to be heard. The " chief officer " here referred <inline font-style="italic">to is the</inline> man who, in the first place, inflicted the penalty. If the clause is passed as it stands, we shall have an independent chairman, an officer of the division to which the appellant belongs, and a member appointed by the chief officer who has inflicted the penalty originally on the delinquent. I think that is just as unfair to the delinquent as the suggested amendments which I shall not move would be to the Department. </para>

We have a Board of two independent members and a third member, who, it is reasonable to assume, because he has been appointed by the man who inflicted the penalty, will be biased against the appellant. </para>

                    <para>. - There seems to be a great fear on the part of some honorable senators that the public servants will not be given a fair deal. I should like to direct attention to the composition of the Appeal Board under the existing Act. It is referred to in section 50. Under that section an appeal is submitted to a Board -  consisting of an inspector, the Chief Officer of the Department to which such officer belongs, or an officer nominated by such Chief Officer, and the representative of the Division to which such officer belongs, elected under the regulations by the officers of the Division to which such officer belongs, in the State in which such officer performs his duties. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">What is proposed in this Bill is a Board very similar to that at present provided for, except that a permanent chairman  takes the place of the inspector under the existing Act. We have had some experience of the working of the existing Appeal Board, and it has shown that the chief officer or his nominee has appeared as the representative of the Department and of authority, as against the trade unions in the Service. We have found that not only is the man who is elected as the representative of the employees on the Appeal Board a member of the union, but also the officer from the Department to which the delinquent belongs is a member of the union. In actual practice the result has been that in the hearing of appeals by the Appeal Board under the existing Act there has almost invariably been two against one. I may inform honorable senators of one extraordinary case that occurred. There was an officer of the Trade and Customs Department in Melbourne who was charged before a civil Court and was duly convicted and sentenced for pilfering on the wharfs. Very naturally, he was suspended, and subsequently dismissed from the Department. He appealed to the Appeal Board as constituted under the existing Act, and the two representatives of his trade union on the Appeal Board insisted that he should be reinstated in the Department, and that man is in the Department to-day. , </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It appears to me that some honorable senators desire to strengthen the position of the trade union on the Boards of Appeal, which should really be Courts, and not specially representative of trade unions. I think that in all the circumstances honorable senators should be wary about accepting the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior,</inline> and it is for that reason I mentioned a case which has actually occurred under the provisions for an Appeal Board under the existing law. We know that under the existing Act it is practically impossible to get useless wasters and rotters out of a Department, and the good men in the Service, who are, of course, greatly in the majority, have to carry these men on their backs and do their work for them. </para>

                        <para>- A Parliament dominated by a particular party can do almost anything. This Parliament, if it so desired, might dispense with the services of the whole of the public servants, but that does not affect the matter under consideration. What we are here to do is to give a fair deal as between the taxpayers, those in authority, and the public servants. We are not here to legislate for the benefit of the public servant any more than we are here to legislate against him in the interests of the taxpayers or of those in authority. Any suggestion to strengthen the Appeal Board in favour of the public servant should be considered very carefully. The Appeal Board now proposed is no more strongly against the interests of the public servant than that which is provided for under the existing Act. It is generally admitted that the gentlemen appointed to constitute an Appeal Board under the existing Act are on the Board to act as advocates rather than as judges. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened with pleasure to the statements made by Senators Pratten and Drake-Brockman. I feel somewhat keenly on this matter, because I have had something to do with some of these Boards. I feel, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> that there is a danger that the chief officer of the Department will appoint some one as his representative on the Appeal Board who will advocate the cause from his stand -point. On the other hand, the elected representative of the division to which the appellant belongs will no doubt be approached to act as his advocate. In the circumstances, under the proposal made, we shall have but one officer acting as a judge in the case, and he will be the  chairman  of the Board. I think that the difficulty is one which can be overcome, and I direct the attention of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> to an' Act passed by the United States of America Government for the purpose of dealing with industrial disputes. If my memory serves me aright, under that Act the Secretary for Labour makes up a panel of a certain number of names. . The Board of Trade also selects a panel of a certain number of names. There is a . final selection from both these panels of persons whom the parties to the dispute have no opportunity of approaching. </para>

                        <para>- The right of challenge is allowed. By adopting this method we should be able to secure an Appeal Board of three members, who would be unbiased, and could not be affected by either the chief officer or the appellant. It seems to me that if we have two advocates on a Bench we cannot expect it to give satisfaction. That has been the experience of the New South Wales Arbitration Court, where that system has not worked at all. </para>

The person to be. appointed under paragraph a is the permanent  chairman,  who is to be an officer in the Commonwealth Public Service, and is to have the qualifications of a stipendiary or police magistrate, but he is to be appointed to the position by the Board of Commissioners. Suppose he is independent. The next man is to be appointed by the officer who lays the charge; he certainly will be strongly biased. One cannot expect anything else.

                        <para>- Yes. What' I am asking for is not the elimination of " division," but the addition of the words "or organization." I think it will be admitted that my claim has something to commend it. I am not looking at the position having in mind the Ministers now in office; we have to legislate for years to come. I know how easy it has been under the present Act to prevent an officer from having a chance to defend himself, and I am glad that a charge must now be made in writing. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable senator spoke of the representative of the Department as being the subordinate of the chief of the Department who makes the charge. I would point out that the head of the Department very seldom makes the charge, because it is chiefly laid by a  deputy  in one or other of the States. We are the protectors of public property. We have civil servants handling the note issue. Are the Departments to have no representation ? Suppose money is missing, and fraud has been practised. Is an officer of the Department not to lay a charge for fear he might be suspected of bias? The head of a Department should have the same right as a  deputy  to lay a charge. The Departments must be protected, and we are here as trustees of those Departments. I have always defended the civil servants. The three men to compose the Appeal Board will be civil servants, and that is a great compliment to the Service. What higher compliment could be paid to it? I suppose we could obtain the services of outsiders, but they would be lacking in experience of departmental methods. </para>

The Government, and I, personally, wish to have a civil servant as chairman, because we do not think there will be enough work to warrant the appointment of a chairman to do that work alone.

                        <para>- Upon the honorable senator's own reasoning, the appellant should be directly represented. The Committee has already determined that one member of the Board shall be an officer of the Department to which the appellant belongs. To be logical, therefore, we cannot deny the appellant himself the right of direct representation. Suppose, for instance, an officer is charged with dereliction of duty, such as neglect properly to attach telephone wires to an insulator. The details of this work can be known only to men in his organization. An officer of the Postal Sorters Union, for instance, would have no knowledge of the circumstances, and yet he might be called upon to assist in determining the charge. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister is proving my own argument. A division includes a very large number of Commonwealth public servants. If one member of the Appeal Board is to be the elected representative of the division to which an appellant belongs, the person appointed may know nothing whatever about telephones, and the charge may be some dereliction of duty in the fixing of telephone wires. A penalty may be inflicted for neglect of duty, and because it is considered excessive an appeal may be lodged. </para>

                        <para>- I prefer to deal with it at this juncture, because I believe that if this sub-clause is passed in its present form we may not have the opportunity of considering an amendmen in the direction I desire. This is a question which we' should consider very carefully, because I believe there is a consensus of opinion among honorable senators that the principle which has been observed from time immemorial, at all events in all British Parliamens, is that Parliament should have control of its own officers. But there is a portion of this measure which may be construed in such a manner that that power may be taken away. In- this sub-clause we are dealing with parliamentary officers so far as they come within the control of an Appeal Board. This is the most essential portion of the Bill, so far as parliamentary officers are concerned, because, notwithstanding the fact that the Public Service Act has been in operation for many years, these officers have no Board to which they can appeal. We have heard a good deal this afternoon concerning the cases that may come before an Appeal Board, and the injustices that may be inflicted, and a good deal of time has been taken in discussing the pros and cons of this matter in order to provide that officers who have to approach the Board shall be fairly dealt with. It is not necessary, therefore, for me to repeat the arguments which have been adduced on this point, because honorable' senators are fairly conversant with that aspect of the question. But we have to consider what kind of Appeal Board we should have for parliamentary officers. At present we Lave not any, and so far as this particular sub-clause is concerned, they will be left in practically the same position as they have been in for a number of years. I believe that Parliament wishes to provide for an Appeal Board for its officers such as is proposed in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Department, the Depart7 ment of Trade and Customs, the Department of the Treasury, and other Departments. If any parliamentary officers have a grievance, or have committed an offence, they should have some independent Board to which they could appeal. They should not have to appeal from  CÃ¦sar  to  CÃ¦sar.  In the present circumstances the individual who fines them will either listen or refuse to listen to their grievances, according to his mood, and that is so opposed to the sense of fair play that we cannot allow this sub-clause to pass in its present form. We are embodying in this Bill what has been the practice in connexion with parliamentary officers for a number of years. I speak as a member of the first Joint Library Committee, and as a member of the second Joint House Committee, and the practice at that time - which was a good many years ago - was that if any officer had a grievance it could- be ventilated either before the Joint Library Committee or before the Joint House Committee when it was decided if any action should be taken. I can very well remember the first  President  of the Joint House Committee - the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker - who was very punctilious in regard to his duties, and who was very careful to see that everything done by him as  President  of the Senate was strictly in accordance with the Constitution and our Standing Orders. No man could have been more particular and no  President  has ever been more punctilious than the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker. The first Joint House Committee was appointed before the first Public Service Act was passed, and when the attention of the Committee was directed to the fact that some alteration had been made by Parliament, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker said, " I find in looking through this that it is going to be a very difficult matter for us to comply with the provisions of the Public Service Act as it is framed." He further said that the Joint House Committee was to deal with parliamentary officers, and that that body would take the place of a Board of Appeal. That was found to be an eminently satisfactory procedure, and not one word was raised against it. </para>

During the whole of the period in which the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder was  Speaker  in another place, and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker was  President  of the Senate, that was the method followed, and I cannot recall a single instance in which the practice was unsatisfactory to those immediately concerned. My proposal is to insert, in subclause 6 specific references to the "Joint House Committee," and the " Joint Library Committee," which will necessitate certain consequential amendments. These, if accepted, will have the effect of restoring to those Committees their rightful powers and responsibilities. I heard of an instance, only a little while ago, which will indicate the state of affairs in connexion with the Library Committee. That body went so far as to defy the wishes of one of its individual members, who had forwarded a protest concerning some action which was proposed to be taken. Members of these Committees do not wish to be embroiled in any clashes. I desire to see the House Committee restored to its original basis, and I know of no other way to bring that about except by the medium of my proposed amendment. I move - </para>

But these Committees have no statutory existence'. They may, or may not, be elected ; they may or may not exist. Consequently honorable senators should be careful in inserting in this Bill certain references to Parliamentary Committees, in connexion with the appointment of a, Board of Appeal, in view of the possibility that there may not any such Parliamentary Committees in  existence. </para>

Employees of this Parliament should have the right of appeal to some independent Board. As a member of the House Committee, I have felt my position keenly. Different statements have been made to the effect that the House Committee has been responsible for this action, notwithstanding that, as a matter of fact, it has no powers and has no functions . to perform. Its members have felt themselves to be quite helpless. In considering the inauguration of an Appeal Board honorable senators should have regard for the employees of this Parliament, taking special care to see that they are given reasonable opportunity of appeal. While our officers remain permanently in the service of the Parliament, Presidents and Speakers may change. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> has raised an important issue. </para>

                        <para>- If Parliament deems it necessary to appoint Committees to administer the functions of internal Departments, then, if such Committees are worthy of election at all, they are worth being clothed with authority. I do not wish to be misunderstood. While Parliament has placed the responsibility upon the shoulders of the  President  and  Speaker,  I am quite certain that those officials would be only too glad to be rid of it. The present position is most unsatisfactory. I say so from personal experience. In a recent case various letters were received and overtures were made to me concerning a person who was supposed to come within the administrative authority of the House Committee. Altogether, I found myself placed in an objectionable position, seeing that the Committee had no jurisdiction, but was at the same time held responsible by certain persons outside. </para>

Whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's amendments will fully meet the position I cannot say, but I am willing to assist in bringing about more satisfactory arrangements, both in regard to members of the Joint Committees, the officers and employees of Parliament, and the  President  and  Speaker  themselves. </para>

                        <para>- I can only repeat that every suggestion will be fully set out and printed for the information and guidance of honorable senators. TheSenate has a right to control itself. Until I looked at the Standing Orders to-day, I was not aware how I had in the past been made a member of certain Committees of the Senate. There are the House Committee, the Library Committee, the Printing Committee, the Returns and Qualifications Committee, and the Standing Orders Committee. Nobody asked me to join any of those Committees. Somebody made the suggestion, and I was nominated. The nominations are submitted to the Senate, and any senator has a right to call for a ballot. What the Committee is discussing now is how to define the functions of these parliamentary Committees. It comes to me as a new question, and I would like to have an opportunity of looking into it. I suggest that all the provisions dealing with the Senate and with the officers of Parliament be postponed, or that they be recommitted later and a proper schedule of amendments printed so as to bring them clearly under the notice of all honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>.- I think the Minister has dealt with the Committee very fairly in this matter. Perhaps I may be permitted to say a word or two to define my own personal position. Even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's amendment is accepted, in some form, by the Government, it will merely be the thin end of the wedge in connexion with giving the various Committees elected by Parliament some little control over the officers who serve them. It will only act when appeals are made by officers of the Senate against fines or penalties inflicted upon them; but it will lay down the principle that the members of the Committees concerned have at last some little responsibility. I am speaking as a member of the Library Committee, as well as a senator. Owing, I think, to the very long illness of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> we have had no meeting of this Committee - at least I have received no notice of any meeting - for six months or more. The Library continues to exist just the same, as far as I know. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but members of the Library Committee have not the power to apply the advice that they give. I understand that there are other  Committees  which are in exactly the same position. . I have felt, and some of my co-members of the . library Committee have felt, that a position which, in the public eye, at all events, brings some little responsibility, should also carry with it some little power. Otherwise it is not worth having. I know that the Minister will understand that I make these remarks in a spirit of fairness. </para>

                    <para>.- It is clear from sub-clause 2 that evidence will be taken by the Board of Inquiry or Appeal Board. It has been suggested by the Public Service organization that some provision should be made in this clause to enable an officer charged with an offence to have access to a copy of the evidence taken from, day to day. That seems to me to be a reasonable suggestion, as in some cases it may take a week or longer to determine an appeal. </para>

                    (Victoria. - Vice-President of the Executive Council T5.361. - I understand from inquiries I have made that the procedure suggested by the honorable senator is not followed in any Court other than the Arbitration Courts, and I see no reason at present why it should be introduced in connexion with Public Service appeals. I take it that the appellant, or his representative, would take notes freely of the evidence given. I see no great objection to the appellant having access to the evidence; but I would not undertake to supply it from day to day. It is not done in ordinary Courts of law, and I should require some' stronger reasons than I have so far heard for departing from the present procedure of tie ordinary Courts, in connexion with these Public Service appeals.

                    <para>. - The Minister's reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Payne  seems to me a fair one. I understood him to say that provided no extra expense is involved there will be no objection to letting an appellant have a copy of the evidence taken in connexion with these appeals at a convenient time. But the Public Service Associations have asked for something more than that. They have 'asked that it be obligatory on the part of the Appeal Board to supply the appellant with a copy of the evidence taken from day to day. I can conceive of many circumstances which might make that extremely inconvenient and costly, whilst in nine cases out of ten it might be unnecessary. Sub-clause 1 gives the appellant the right to be represented by counsel, attorney, or agent, and that reasonably protects his interests. If, as the Minister says, what the Public Service organizations desire is not done in any Court but the Arbitration Courts, I cannot by my vote place an appeal against a conviction for some misdemeanour in the Public Service on the same plane as proceedings in the Arbitration Courts. I think the Minister made a fair reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> and with it I shall at present rest content. </para>

                    (South Australia) T5.421. - We have dealt in clause 53 with an Appeal Board for the trial of appeals from officers other than those in the first and second divisions. In clause 54 we have dealt with officers of the first and second divisions. We are dealing in the clause now under consideration with a Board of Inquiry, which, I assume, is entirely different from the Board of Appeal provided for in clause 53. The Minister is to nominate members of a Board of Inquiry which is to consist of three members. I want to know whether this Board is to inquire in order to report to the Appeal Board, or whether it is to report to the Board of Commissioners.

                    <para>- In sub-clause  2  of clause  55,  reference is made to the duty of " the Board of Inquiry or Appeal Board."  This clause deals with officers of the first and second divisions, as does clause  54.  I am afraid there will not be sufficient clarity when these clauses have to be interpreted. It will be necessary to strike out the words " or Appeal Board," because the Appeal Board is the Minister, and the Board of Inquiry is simply the Board that reports to the Minister. An alteration in the verbiage is certainly needed.  </para>

                    <para>.- When a charge is laid against an officer of the first or second division, it is fully investigated by the Minister, who has power, after making due inquiry, to suspend the officer. If the officer is suspended, his case is dealt with by the Board of Inquiry, and that is practically a final hearing. The Minister will not suspend an officer without having an investigation made, and we are vesting in the Minister power to deal with officers of the first and second divisions. When, after full investigation, the Minister is convinced that the officer is guilty, he is suspended ; and, in order to have fair play, the case is referred to the Board of Inquiry. If the charge is not substantiated by the Board, the suspension has to be removed. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to direct the attention of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> to the very isolated position of the residents in the south-western portion of Queensland, which I have recently visited. At Bedourie and Birdsvillo, in the south-west corner of Queensland, there have been a great many discussions at to which route should be taken in connecting those centres with the main telegraphic system, and honorable senators will readily realize the unfortunate position in which these people are placed when I inform them that the nearest telegraph station to Birdsville is over 240 miles distant. Birdsville has not been connected by telegraph because two factions have been at work, and it has been difficult to decide which route should be adopted. A line has been suggested from Marec, in South Australia, or one from Boulia, in Queensland. Bedourie and Birdsville are on the main stock route,' and this year from 40,000 to 50,000 head of cattle have been sent to the Adelaide market. In the absence of telegraphic facilities those sending cattle to market Have been severely handicapped because they have been unable to ascertain the prices ruling in the southern markets while the cattle were coming down, and they have also been unable to order trucks in advance from the South Australian Railway Department. This question concerns South Australia as well as Queensland, but I have mentioned it because Birdsville is inside the Queensland border. In addition to the other disabilities experienced in consequence of the absence of telegraphic communication, medical attention of any description is not available, and when I was at Birdsville recently a child who could not have medical attention died. The parents had no possible means of rapidly summoning medical assistance by telegraph or of securing advice by telephone. It is my intention to deal with this matter more in detail at a later date; but I desire to urge upon the Postmaster-General the desirableness of connecting Birdsville by telegraph or telephone with the more populous centres in order to assist the settlers in that remote locality at the earliest possible date. </para>
