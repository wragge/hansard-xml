Will he say whether the 1915-16 Wheat Pool and succeeding Pools will be cleaned up now, or some time before the Armageddon! </para>

                            <para>- The 1915-16 Pool was cleaned up several weeks ago, so far as the Australian Wheat Board's connexion with the Pool is concerned. We made our allotments to the States, and they have to clean up local supplies. I understand that in Western Australia the local authorities have cleaned up the Pool, and have sent on the information to the Australianwheat-growers. </para>

                    <para>. - I am quite prepared to have a test vote taken on the question of deleting the words " permanent head," with a view to substituting the word " Board." I have already urged the desirability of making the Bill as effective as possible in the interests, not .only ofl the Public Service, but of the Commonwealth. I have endeavoured to point out that, as we contemplate under this Bill the appointment of a Board in lieu of a Commissioner, our object is to increase the efficiency of the Department and the Public Service generally. The Board's powers will be very extensive; in fact, it is to be held responsible for bringing about reforms, wherever found necessary for the effective working of the Service, and with a view to economy. The question of promotions and transfers is of vital interest to officers. From a perusal of the existing law, I find that the head of a Department, or the chief officer, is not given the power which it is proposed to give him under the Bill. The present Act provides that whenever a vacancy occurs, and it is expedient to fill it by the promotion of an officer, the Governor-General may, on the recommendation of the Commissioner, fill such vacancy; but it is now proposed to appoint a Board to carry out the functions hitherto performed by the Commissioner, and it seems a retrograde step to give the permanent head or chief officer power to fill vacancies from his own Department. My object is to give a wider choice, so that an officer from another Department may be appointed if he is more suitable for a particular position. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. But an officer who has received an appointment, even if the appointment is only  provisional, has an advantage over other officers in the Service. I have not heard the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> give any reason why it is proposed to alter the existing practice. Some reference has been made to the difficulty of filling vacancies in towns far removed from the central government, but that difficulty could be got over. I would not press this matter as I am pressing it if I did not feel convinced that throughout the Service- there is a strong feeling against the proposed alteration. It has been pointed out to me that it is not fair to handicap officers who may have special qualifications for filling a vacancy. </para>

I received information from an officer of the Association, soon after that assurance was given, to the effect that the Minister's statement -was not correct.' I have taken the trouble to make further inquiries, and I am assured that members of the Service are opposed to the alteration./ They claim that more efficiency will be obtained if the Board, instead of the permanent head of a Department, has the power to make appointments. I want to see the Public Service as efficient, as economical, and as useful as possible, and also to see deserving public servants as contented as possible. There will always be malcontents in every business, but on the whole I think we have a loyal staff,, and I desire to insure that every inducement is given to those who enter the Public Service to qualify for higher positions with a knowledge that they will receive the promotion to which they are entitled. The clause really proposes io clip the wings of the Board by providing that it shall not have the same powers as the Commissioner has had hitherto.

                    <para>The Public Service extends over six States, with a Public Service Inspector and Chief Officers in each State; consequently, in order that a uniform practice might be followed in the filling of vacancies by promotion, it was necessary to deal with the matter by regulation. Briefly stated, the regulations provide for the following procedure: - Vacancies are divided into two classes - (1) those for which it is desirable to invite applications by notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> and (2) those which may be filled without advertising. In the case of' an advertised vacancy, two weeks' notice is usually given, and upon receipt of applications the Public Service Inspector confers with the Chief Officer. After conference, the Inspector and Chief Officer submit separate reports to the Commissioner, the Chief Officer forwarding his report through the permanent head. Upon these reports the Commissioner makes his recommendation to the Governor-General, such recommendation being transmitted through the Minister of the Department concerned. The Governor-General's approval is conveyed through the customary channels back to the Department, when the promotion is gazetted. In regard to non-advertised vacancies, the procedure is similar, excepting that consideration is not limited to the claims of applicants as in the other cases. The time and labour involved in this complicated and circuitous procedure is evident, and, although efforts have been made to shorten the process by delegation of authority in certain classes of cases to Inspectors and Chief Officers, nothing less than an amendment of the law will suffice to place the matter on a proper footing. </para>
                    <para>The provisions of the law requiring a report from the permanent head or Chief Officer, recommendation by the Commissioner, and approval by the Governor-General, were designed, no doubt, as safeguards against unfair discrimination in the selection of officers for promotion, but in the application of these provisions excessive delays have occurred in filling vacant positions, and consequent expense and inconvenience to Departments because of the necessity of making temporary arrangements pending the permanent promotion of officers. It is not unusual for months to elapse between the notification of a vacancy and the filling of the position, and in cases where the vacant office is in the higher grades of the Service, the consequential changes following upon the initial promotion can only be made long after the occurrence of the original vacancy, with hampering effects upon Departments which call for rectification. The time and attention of Public "Service Inspectors, especially in the larger States, are absorbed in dealing with promotions and transfers of officers to such an extent as to militate seriously against their usefulness in other directions, particularly in regard 'to the general organization of Departments and the disposition of offices and officers to insure efficient and economical management. If Inspectors were relieved of the responsibility of advising on staff changes involving promotions and transfers, more beneficial results would accrue from the exercise of their inspectorial functions, which are highly important and far-reaching in relation to successful administration of the Public Service Act. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>That is a condemnation of the old system, under which the inspector and the head of the Department conferred. In that case there was no appeal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> was rather unfortunate in his suggestion that an officer of another Department, having superior qualifications would, under this clause, have no opportunity of appointment to a vacancy. There will be a full period of six months within which any aggrieved officer may prosecute his appeal. If successful the officer appointed provisionally will be displaced. </para>

                    <para>- No. Under the present system there is a conference between an inspector and the head of a Department, a recommendation is made to the Commissioner, the Commissioner transmits it to the Minister and the Minister to the Governor-General. If that is not a circuitous method I should like to know what is. The Economies Commission pointed out that heads of the Departments concerned ought to be consulted in the filling of vacancies, because they should be in a position to make a sound recommendation. It is quite true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has said, that a brilliant officer in some other Department may be overlooked, but this clause provides a remedy against any bias which may be shown by the head of a Department in favour of officers under his immediate observation. I am not bound to the  exact wording of the clause, but, unless I am persuaded that it can be altered with advantage I shall not accept any amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - The clause as it stands provides that whenever a vacancy occurs in any office, in other than the First Division, and it is considered expedient to fill the vacancy by the promotion of an officer, the permanent head - as originally drafted it was "i chief officer" - may, subject to the provisions of the Act, promote an officer of his Department to fill the vacancy. With the words " chief officer " in place of " permanent head " the clause was bad enough. Now it is infinitely worse. First of all the tendency and effect of the clause will be to make every Department watertight. In other words promotion in a Department will be from officers within the Department itself. The Government, the Service, and the public will not, in practice, get the advantage of ability outside the Department. I am thoroughly convinced of that, ° because it is provided that if a vacancy occurs the permanent head shall provisionally appoint some one to the position. The chief officer who, under the clause as originally drafted, would have exercised this authority, is defined thus - "Chief officer" means the chief officer in a State, or part of the Commonwealth, of the Department in connexion with which, or wherein is' employed, any officer in connexion with whom, the term is used or is applicable. </para>

                <para class="block">That is to say, the chief officer of the Postal Department would be the  Deputy  Postmaster-General of the State in which the vacancy occurred, and in the Customs Department he would be the Sub-Collector of Customs for that particular State. As the Bill came to us, when a vacancy occurred in the Postal Department the  Deputy  Postmaster-General had the power to appoint some one provisionally to the position. Under the clause as amended any such appointment will be made by the Secretary to the Central Administration in Melbourne, and from my experience all of these Central Administrations want breathed through them constantly a knowledge of what is being done outside Melbourne. The permanent head of a Department is probably the most incompetent officer that could have been selected for the purpose of making promotions or filling vacancies in the Department from outside.

                        <para>- I know it is. Let me refer to a case which occurred quite recently. In Tasmania an officer who had been Sub-Collector of Customs for many years died, and his position was filled by an outsider. There were men in the service of the Customs Department of the Commonwealth and of Tasmania before Federation, but what recognition did they receive when a new sub-collector was appointed. I do not know of any of them personally, so I am not speaking with a knowledge of their qualifications, but what recognition did they receive when the position had to be filled? The Central Administration appointed a person known to them. When there is a "plum," it is given to some officer from Melbourne, and the unsatisfactory position in Tasmania applies with equal force to "Western Australia, to Queensland, and some of the other States.When any of the higher positions become vacant, an officer in close touch with the Central Administration is invariably appointed. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that; but if we look through the list of appointments in the Customs Department particularly, it will be found that invariably the officers appointed to important positions in the other States have really acquired no experience in those States. I am not prepared to enter into a discussion concerning the merits or otherwise of the persons appointed, and the qualifications of those who have had experience in other States, and who were not appointed. I know none of the men who were appointed, or who might have received promotion, but that is the position as I see it. To invest the permanent head of a Department with power to make provisional promotions in States of which he has no direct knowledge and with which he is not in personal contact is a wrong principle. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> has quoted from the report of the ex-Public Service Commissioner on the matter, but I do not think that the remarks read by the honorable gentleman are relevant to this clause. I am certain that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> did not make that statement with this clause before him. He has, of course, pointed out the circuitous method adopted under the existing Act in connexion with appointments and the filling of vacancies by promotion, but everything the ex-Public Service Commissioner said on that point will apply with equal, if not with greater, force to the proposal now before the Committee. This method is just as circuitous, as it provides that the permanent head may, subject to the provisions of this Act, promote an officer of his Department to fill a vacancy. It goes on to provide that the appointment shall be only a provisional one, and the Minister with a fine display of generosity endeavoured to explain that it will be open for any officer in any other Department who considers himself fit to fill the position to appeal within six months. It is an excellent idea to give an officer the right to appeal, but how often would one do it? If he did, would he be successful? The utter absence of any hope of success would prevent him exercising his right. I know that when an officer in a Department has received promotion, and an officer decides to appeal, say, from an outside State, on the ground of greater efficiency, that he has little prospects of success. </para>

                        <para>- Does it? The Minister has referred to an officer who was transferred from one Central Department to another. I have nothing to say against him because he is a capable man, and was an officer under me when I was a Minister. I think I was one of the earliest who recognised his ability and capacity, and gave him duties apart from those ho. was then performing. But. what of the other officer who might have been promoted? I have nothing to say concerning his experience, ability or capacity, but a great many were surprised when he did not receive the appointment. I shall give another instance of what is gained by being within hearing of the officers of the Central Administration. Some years ago when I was a Minister, an officer in -New South Wales whose work seemed to me to be extraordinarily good was brought under my notice. I had never met the man, but took an early opportunity of interviewing him. One of our most important officers in Melbourne had to leave - in fart I insisted upon his going after what I had been informed by his medical adviser, and I brought this officer from Sydney to fill his place. I sent a man from Western Australia to fill the position occupied by the Sydney man. The Western Australian would never have come under the notice of the Central Administration but for that temporary transfer. But, later, when I had brought the Sydney officer to take the place of the one in Melbourne my colleagues became scared, and were very apprehensive of the result, because this officer was unknown to them. I assured them that he " would fill the bill," and even mare. Same said, " Well, it may be the ' funeral ' of the lot of us, but it is primarily yours." I said " All right, I shall take the full responsibility." That officer came to Melbourne and I do not think he ever left here. He rose to the highest positions in the Commonwealth Service, and if it had not been for that temporary transfer from Sydney to the Central Administration he would probably have remained in that city until this day.  His  worth was brought under the notice of the Cabinet of the day and of successive Cabinets, and his outstanding abilities, which I early recognised, displayed themselves to his advantage and to the benefit of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I was considerably interested in the observations of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> but I am anxious to learn to what extent the Board, unless it delegates its powers, will be 'an improvement upon a permanent head. I ha,ve known of many complaints by officers concerning the manner in which they have been overlooked, especially in .'the Defence Department. They have given faithful service for many years, and have had to remain without hope of promotion on account of the fact that the Central Administration, on St. Kilda-road, has known only those established in Victoria. All the other  parts  of  tha  Commonwealth - excepting, perhaps, Queensland, for the reason that  numbers of the leading lights at Headquarters have come from that Stake - have been ignored. Men have been " turned down'" or superseded time after time, although they have proved themselves able, professional soldiers. Their misfortune has been that they have not been able to get into official touch with the "heads " or into social contact with their personal circles. I know of a man. who 'had served in Tasmania for nearly twenty years. He was a staff sergeant-major, and he lost an eye during the course of operations in a bombing school in that State. After medical examination, he was. notified that he must retire from, the Service. He came to Melbourne and chanced to meet, socially, the Chief Medical Officer in the  Defence  Services. When he had made himself known he said, in a laughing way, "I am the man whom you kicked out in Tasmania, because I had lost an eye in a bombing school." That personal reference, and the fact of coming into immediate touch, interested the Chief Medical Officer; and, eventually, the Tasmanian was made a temporary lieutenant. It was not long before his outstanding ability became recognised. He could not be accepted for active service on account of his disability, but he performed strenuous work at Headquarters. For several months he was doing the duties of two colonels, three majors, and several lesser officers. He was placed in charge of a multiplicity of activities, including the secretaryship of the Supply and Tender Board and the Remount Section, and he also acted as D:Q.M.G. I repeat that, but for the fortunate accident of the social .meeting, following upon the unfortunate incident of the loss of his eye and of his dismissal, that man might still have been a staff sergeant-major in Tasmania. Men in any branch of the Public Service who are holding office in distant parts, or in States which have not much " pull " at Head-quarters, have but a dog's chance of getting on. I want to know, however, how the Board may be expected to serve any more satisfactorily. If the Board delegates its powers to a  Deputy  Postmaster-General or to a Sub-Collector of Customs, the same old principle must be followed. It will be the recommendation of the chief officer in the State concerned which will be accepted by the Board. </para>

It must receive a recommendation from someone in charge in the distant State where a position is to be filled. The Board itself would have no more personal knowledge of distant officers than the permanent head could be expected to possess. If the Board finds it necessary - as it must do - to. delegate its authority, exactly the same condition of affairs will continue as exists to-day. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> could show me that, by the substitution of the Board for the permanent head, there would be provided fair and reasonable opportunities of promotion to officers who are far removed from the Central Administration, I would be able to see something in his amendment. The only consideration is that the Board may be in a position to obtain more knowledge than the permanent head concerning distantly placed officers. But, seeing that the latter will have been in control of the Department, no doubt, for a considerable period, is it not far more likely that he should know something more of his officers, in every State, than a newly appointed Board could be expected to know ? </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened to all that Senators Keating and Foster have said. This is not by any means a party measure. It is a genuine attempt at reform of the conditions of the Public Service, and the best intelligence of the Committee should be devoted to its consideration. Under the Bill a permanent head may fill a vacancy in his Department by the transfer or promotion of an officer of the Department, or he may recommend to the Board that an officer of another Department be promoted to fill the vacancy. Such transfers or promotions are provisional only, and a dissatisfied officer has a right of appeal, but if we give to the Board alone the power to make transfers and appointments dissatisfied officers will have no right of appeal, or only the right to appeal from Caesar to Caesar. If a right of appeal from a decision of. the Board is given, then the Board will not be the final arbiter. I am not wedded to the terms of the clause, and if a practical scheme can be suggested which will be an improvement upon what is proposed in the Bill, I am willing to consider it. I cannot accept' the amendment because, in my view, justice will not be done to officers of the Service if this power is given to the Board and its decision is to be final. I am prepared to give sympathetic consideration to a proposal to give a right of appeal from decisions of the Board in these matters. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has said that dissatisfied officers would not appeal, and that he would advise them not to do so. He assumes that officers appealing would not receive justice and fair play, and if there is ground for such an assumption, that condition of things should not be tolerated for a moment. In fifteenyears' experience I have never heard of any exception being taken to the promotion of any officer to the position of head of a Department. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause, dealing with promotions, is very important. There is a general impression that men of very mediocre talent who are close to the throne have their talents magnified out of all proportion to their deserts, and that men at a distance do not have their qualifications brought under review. In well-managed business concerns outside, the heads of sub-departments are frequently transferred for the purpose of coordinating the service and to enable the transferred officers to obtain knowledge and experience of different localities. <inline font-style="italic">J</inline> think it is unwise that officers should be permanently located at one place. Distance in the matter of promotion never " lends enchantment to the view," and left and right we hear the opinion expressed that men are attracted to the Central Office because they know that if they can get to the Central Office their chances of promotion will be sensibly increased. </para>

                        <para>- They would do so in order to bask in the sunlight, so to speak. We cannot completely alter this condition of things, but if we can hit upon a plan which will lessen the disadvantage under which talent far removed from the Central Office has to labour, we will have done some good. The question raised is whether these matters should be dealt with by the heads of Departments or by the Board, and it is possible that we might overload the Board by giving it too much detail work to do. Even at the risk of overloading the Board, I believe it would be better, since its members would have a wider range of vision than is given to the head of a Department, to place in their hands the selection of officers for promotion. </para>

The head of a Department might act with unconscious bias in favour of some officer placed near him or some particular pet. It will be the duty of the Board to supervise the whole of the Service, and not merely special Departments, and it will be more likely, in the circumstances to give a distant man, possessing exceptional talents, a chance of promotion. </para>

If a vacancy should occur in the Postal Department, close to the Central Office, and the duty of filling the vacancy is left to the head of the Department, he will not unnaturally confine his attention to officers of the Postal Department alone, whereas the Board would be likely to take into consideration the qualifications of officers in other Departments to fill the vacancy. </para>

                        <para>- We are told hy the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> that there is the right of appeal. That right, however, is seldom availed of, because in the average case there is very little chance of an appeal being successful. It is only in a glaring case, where a person who is totally unfitted for a position has been appointed, that an appeal would be considered worth while. It appears that the only way to give_ officers in outside districts a. chance of promotion according to merit is to leave the matter to the proposed Board. We know what human nature is, and the head of a Department is almost sure to favour one of his own men, altheugh he may believe he is doing right. </para>

                <para class="block">I desire the vote on this amendment to be regarded as a test vote, and if the amendment is agreed to certain consequential amendments will follow. The Committee dealt the other day with the question of giving the right of appeal to officers of Parliament against decisions of the  President  or the  Speaker  of another place. In looking through the reports of the debate, I noticed that it was stressed by more than one honorable senator whose attitude in regard to officers of the Senate is hard to determine to-day, that an appeal by an officer should not be an appeal from Caesar to Caesar. The Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> himself objected a few moments ago, in speaking to an amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> which sought to substitute "the Board " for "the permanent head," that the proposal would amount to appealing from the Board to the Board. He reminded honorable senators that in his opinion it was an inherent right of any British subject to be allowed to appeal, even to  His  Majesty the King. The proposal put forward, in the Bill is that the appeal shall be made to the  President  or the  Speaker.  When this matter was mentioned on another clause the other day, some honorable senators said it would be impossible under the Bill to appeal to the House Committee, and that, if it waa desired to do so, it would be necessary to pass regulations or a schedule to define exactly how the House Committee was to be appointed. It was also said that the House Committee of the Senate had never sat as a separate House Committee, but only as part of the Joint 'House Committee. I am not concerned with what the House Committee has done or how it is constituted, but I find that our Standing Orders provide 'that a House Committee consisting of the  President  and six honorable senators shall be appointed. There is a similar provision for the appointment of a House Committee by another place. I take it that, when. I move for the insertion of the words " House Committee," those words refer to the House Committee as provided for under the Standing Orders of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I will say what I have to say on the matter; and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> moves an amendment, I will withdraw mine, if I think his is satisfactory. We have a House Committee constituted under our own Standing Orders, and we have, recently, heard something regarding the difficulty that we find ourselves in because we have no joint standing orders for certain purposes. I have not been able to find any standing order of either the Senate or the other place that makes any provision for the appointment of joint Committees. That is, probably, a position created by precedent, but we would be perfectly right in adhering to our own Standing Orders, and in regarding them as being applicable to the words " House Committee " in this amendment. Some honorable senators, during the discussion of a previous clause, said it would not be proper for members of the House Committee to be approached by officers of Parliament in regard to complaints. If my amendment is agreed to, the appeals which will come before the House Committee constituted as an Appeal Board will be of the same nature as officers of the Public Service can make to the Appeal Boards provided for them. Trifling complaints would not come before the House Committee, but in cases where an officer was penalized through not being promoted, or by being fined more than <inline font-style="italic">£2,</inline> he would have the right of appeal. I do not think any further argument is necessary if honorable senators are sincere in what  they have said regarding appeals from Caesar to Caesar and the desirability of every man having the right of appeal against what he may regard as an unjust decision. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think anybody will object to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poster,</inline> that officers and servants who may have had a penalty imposed upon them should have a right of appeal if they feel that they have been unjustly or harshly dealt with; but the remedy proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> is not the correct one. Fines are not imposed by the  President  or  Speaker,  but by the head of the Department. Therefore, an appeal to the  President  or  Speaker  would not be an appeal from Caesar to Caesar. It is only in the case of dismissals, or similar grave punishment, which would be made by the  President  or  Speaker,  that the appeal would be from Caesar to Caesar. I do not want to have an appeal from myself to myself, and I am perfectly certain that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> would not desire that either. The general practice in the Public Service is to have an independent Board. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster's</inline> amendment proposes that the Board shall be a political Board - that is to say, a Committee composed of members of Parliament - who will be subjected to all kinds of wire pulling, and will perhaps not be in a position to give the unbiased decision that such a tribunal ought to give. I would suggest that the sub-clause should be left out altogether, and that provision should be made for an independent Board of Appeal on which the employees themselves would be represented. That would be in conformity with the general practice of the Public Service, and it is, in my opinion, the most desirable way to meet the difficulty. In this Parliament there are five Departments. My proposal is to create an independent Board composed of two heads of Departments, one to be nominated by the  President  on  Speaker,  or by the  President  and  Speaker,  as the case may be, and another by the officers of the Department to which the appellant belongs ; and an elected representative of the Division to which the appellant belongs. This Board would appoint its own  chairman,  and would hear and deal with appeals. The head of the Department to which the appellant belongs would not be a member of the Board. It would be an entirely independent and thoroughly representative body, and its creation should remove the anomaly of officers appealing to members of Parliament - a right denied to any other member of the Public Service, and which brings in the political 'element. The amendment has been prepared by the Parliamentary Draftsman. I am informed it will meet the case, and is in accordance with the other provisions of the Bill. As I have said the head of the Department to which the appellant belongs would have no part in the hearing of an appeal. To permit him to do so would be most improper, because he 'would be the officer who charged or punished the appellant. If we remit authority to the House Committee to hear appeals, there will be unconscionable delay. Suppose, that after Parliament entered into recess, a dispute arose, the appellant would probably not be able to get a hearing for six or seven months, because members of the House Committee might be absent from Melbourne. And then there is the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> Department, with which the House Committee has nothing whatever to do. </para>

                    <para>. - I must say that we are getting on very satisfactorily. I am glad to see that at last the principle for which I have so long contended is to be adopted, and that we are to get away from the system of one-man control. This is a back-down by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> on this question. Whilst listening to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> I was wondering how they were going to square their utterances with the amendment of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> had given notice. However, things are now beautifully smooth, and everything in the. garden is lovely. The only objection I have to the proposition is that the House Committee is not to be the Board of Appeal ; but, seeing that there is to be an independent Committee, call it by what name you like, it does not matter a great deal after all. I certainly object to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> speaking as he does regarding political influence, and suggesting that such influence is something vicious and corrupt. I think political influence is not a bit worse than social influence. </para>

                        <para>. - Following a practice which has grown in this Chamber, and which is of convenience to honorable senators, I made an explanatory statement when the Budget-papers were presented covering the main features of the Budget itself. It will not be necessary to repeat what I then said, but it is incumbent upon me to make some reference to alterations which have been effected in the Budget in another place. First I would remind honorable senators of a few of the outstanding features of the Budget. The general statement made at the time of tabling the Budget and Estimates, on the 11th October, showed, briefly, the Estimates of revenue and expenditure for the year 1921-22, and the financial position of the Commonwealth as at 30th June, 1921. Portion of the Estimates, namely, those relating to works and buildings, have already been considered by the Senate in the shape of the Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Bill 1921-22, and the Loan Appropriation Bill 1921. The alterations made in the Estimates covered by those Bills have already been explained. This Bill is to grant £15,030,765 for the ordinary services of the country. The only alteration made in these Estimates since they were tabled consists of a reduction of £70,000 in the Universal Training vote under the Department of Defence (Military). Including the reduction made in the Works Estimates, the total reductions thus amount to £500,000, and the total estimates of expenditure from revenue consequently show an estimated decrease of £519,629 as compared with the expenditure foT 1920-21. The appropriation proposed to be made by the Bill amounts to £27,391,035, which includes £12,360,270 granted by four previous Supply Bills. The amount proposed to be granted by the Bill includes, in addition to the totals specified in the Estimates, sums under the usual items of Refunds of Revenue amounting to £750,000, and Treasurer's Advance covering £1,500,000. Under the various headings of the Departments, as they come before honorable senators, in Committee, such detailed information as may be sought will be, wherever possible, supplied. I move - </para>

                        <para>. -There is a matter involved in the proposed vote for the Senate which requires elucidation. Honorable senators will notice that for the first time in many years there is a discrepancy shown between the salaries payable to the  Clerk  of the Senate and to the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives. The salary of the  Clerk  of the Senate is set down at £1,000, the same amount as was voted last year, and for a number of years past. The salary set down for the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives this year is £1,250, whereas the salary paid that officer last year and for a number of years previously was also £1,000. I may explain that a salary of £1,000 a year as attaching to these positions has been voted since 1913. At that time the present  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, and I, in a letter dated 27th August, 1913, made the following communication to the Prime Minister :  -  27th August, 1913. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable senators will notice that that was a joint representation made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and myself. I have at all times considered it desirable and necessary for the maintenance of good feeling, and to secure efficient service, that there should be uniformity in the salaries paid to officers of the Parliament performing similar work. I have made every effort to attain that desirable object. Before the Estimates were sent in. this year, I suggested to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and he concurred with my suggestion, that we should have a conference of the heads of all the Departments of the Parliament, to examine the Estimates of those Departments, with a view of seeing that officers rendering the same service and performing similar duties should receive about the same salary. The purpose was to secure harmony and co-ordination. The conference was held, and Estimates, approved by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and myself, were sent in which contained so far as we could discover no anomaly. Some months ago I learned that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> had made a recommendation that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale</inline> should be appointed  Clerk  of the Parliaments, with an increase of' £250 a year. When the matter was referred to me for my comment, I sent the following letter to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>My dear Prime Minister, </para>
                        <para>I have to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 2nd inst., No. 20/385/5 (signed by the  Hon.  E. J. Russell, on your behalf), covering a Me of papers containing a communication from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> ' with reference to the restoration of the position of "  Clerk  of the Parliaments" and the elevation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> A. Gale,  Clerk  of the House of Representatives, to that position with increased remuneration. </para>
                        <para>I was very much astonished to learn that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 1 Speaker</inline> had taken upon himself to make such a recommendation, which concerns equally both Houses of the Parliament, without my knowledge or sanction. </para>
                        <para>I distinctly and emphatically object to the recommendation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> being adopted by the Government. If any reason at all exists for the appointment of a  "Clerk  of the Parliaments," then the officer appointed to that position should be the  Clerk  of the Senate, because all parliamentary functions or proceedings at which a  Clerk  of Parliaments would be necessary .take place in the Senate Chamber, and it would be unthinkable that in that Chamber a  Clerk  of the Lower House should take precedence over the  Clerk  of the' Senate, and would create- a position to which I feel certain the Senate would never agree. </para>
                        <para>This matter was threshed out in 1908 on the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> G. Blackmore, who occupied the position of  Clerk  of the Parliaments, as well as  Clerk  of the Senate, from the establishment of Federation until that date;  and, in .the course of the discussion which took place between the then  President  of the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Albert</inline> Gould, and the Government, the position was fully set out, and, as shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Albert</inline> Gould (by the quotations in accompanying notes), all the precedents were in favour of the  Clerk  of the Upper House occupying the position of  Clerk  of the Parliaments. It was ultimately agreed, at the instance of the Government, that a  Clerk  of the Parliaments should not be appointed; but it was also agreed, and definitely stated in writing by the representative of the Government (the then Vice-President of the Executive Council), <inline font-style="italic">vide</inline> letter of 7th September, 1908, "As regards the title '  Clerk  of the Parliaments,' if such a titular position is further continued, I personally think the office should be held by the  Clerk  of the Senate." </para>
                        <para>The position is fully set out in the  accom-ponying  notes, which I have the honour to submit for your consideration. </para>
                        <para class="block">The file of papers is returned herewith. </para>

                    <para>Thos. Givens, </para>

                    <para class="block">Acting on that communication, the Government did' not accede to the recommendation. I had no further information with regard to anything it was proposed to do until the Estimates were tabled. When they were tabled, I saw that not having succeeded in obtaining the position of  Clerk  of the Parliaments for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale, Mr. Speaker</inline> had set down in the Estimates the increased salary proposed to be given him as  Clerk  of the Parliaments. That creates a very grave anomaly. It has always been recognised that the Clerks of both Houses should be equally remunerated, because there is equal responsibility on each. In addition, the officers of the Senate have work to do which officers of the other Houses are not called upon to perform. The officers of the Senate have the very important responsibility of looking after the Refreshment Room, and its accounts, which entails a great deal of labour and responsibility. I have no wish to enter into any controversy on this matter at all. I have merely related the fact , and it is for the Senate to take Such, action as it may think fit to rectify what I consider an anomaly. </para>

                            <para>- There are two courses open to honorable senators. They may request another place to increase the salary to be paid to the  Clerk  of the Senate sufficiently to make it equal to that voted for the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives. The other alternative is to do something which would be very invidious, and might create feeling, and that is to request the House of Representatives to reduce the salary which that House has already voted to its  Clerk.  It is for honorable senators to decide what shall be done. The matter to which I have referred is an example of difficulties which are continually cropping up, and which have made me always anxious to find some method to bring about uniformity of practice and co-ordination of the work of the officers of the Parliament, because there has been continual evidence of a desire on the part of one officer to get ahead of another, or to secure precedence over another instead of working together harmoniously, as they probably would do if uniform emoluments were attached to similar positions. </para>

                        <para>. - There is no appreciable difference between the length of service in their present positions of the two officers, and there would have been none at all were it not for action taken by myself. Dur ing a recent debate, much was said about the existence of water-tight compartments in the service of the Parliament, which prevented the transfer or promotion of an officer from one Department to another. I happen to be the only Presiding Officer of the Parliament who ever took an officer from one Department, and promoted him to another. I have regretted doing so ever since I did it, because advantage was taken of my action which I think was unfair and improper, and I will tell honorable senators why. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline> retired as  Clerk  of the Senate, an application was received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy,</inline> who was then  Clerk  of the House of Representatives, for the position vacated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell.</inline> After giving the matter full consideration, I granted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy</inline> the position. I was influenced largely in doing so by the fact that officers of the Senate had an opportunity of promotion which was not open to officers in another place at the time. I never had any fault whatever to find with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy,</inline> and had no complaint to make so far as he was concerned, but in promoting officers of the Senate instead of giving them the maximum salaries of the offices to which they were appointed, at the time of their appointment, I started them at considerably lower salaries, subject to conditions under which they could only attain the maximum by annual increases extending over three years. For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monahan</inline> was then promoted to the position of  Clerk  Assistant to the Senate, and instead of being paid the full salary of the office - £775 - I appointed him at £700 with a promise of three rises of £25 per year. But the moment <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy</inline> was transferred to the Senate other officers in another place secured promotion, and they were immediately paid the maximum salaries of the offices to which they were so promoted. This had the effect of making them senior to men who had. occupied similar positions in the Senate for a longer period. It created an injustice to our officers, and it is another of the reasons why I say that some attempt should be made to find a method of co-ordinating the services of Parliament to prevent this continual endeavour of officers to get ahead of each other. Were it not for the action I took, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monahan</inline> would have been undoubtedly senior by a very long time to officers In another place. A grossly unfair and in- vidious  distinction has been made, and honorable senators should make some attempt to find a remedy. </para>

                        <para>.- I am very pleased to have the information supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> though I am sorry that the occasion for it should have arisen. I am very strongly of opinion that there should be no differentiation between the status of the officers, of the two Houses of this Parliament. There is an impression abroad, which I am sure is not entertained by many, that the Senate is not of the same importance in the government of the country as another branch of the Legislature. I want to assure honorable senators that I personally look upon the Senate as equally important with another i place. The question of seniority as between the officers of the two Houses should not enter into the matter. "We should be detached and self-contained. Seniority should influence our decisions when it is a question of seniority between officers of the Senate. So far as the salary proposed for the  Clerk  of the Senate is concerned, I think that it is a very fair one, and this is no time for the Government or this Committee to propose the payment of extravagant salaries. In the circumstances, objectionable though it will be, I shall be prepared to move a request to the House of Representatives to reduce the .salary of the  Clerk  of that House by £250. This will not be a pleasing duty, but it is one which I think should be&gt; performed. I do not feel disposed to vote for an increase of £250 in the salary of the  Clerk  of the Senate, and believing as I do that these two officers should be on an absolute level so far as salary is concerned, I have no option but to adopt the course I have .mentioned. </para>

                        <para>. - I think, with the previous  speaker,  that the Committee is indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">"Senator Givens</inline> for (having informed us as to what the procedure, since he has been  President  of the Senate, has been. This may be looked upon as a minor matter, but it must have been impressed upon honorable .senators that there is need for some definite line of procedure, and some co-ordination between the two Houses. There are two systems, apparently, open to us. One is to treat the Senate and </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">House of Representatives as controlling separate and independent Departments, each Chamber ordering the fortunes of its officials, and the other is to regard the officers of the two Houses as members of a joint Service, in which the service rendered by one set of officers would be remunerated on the same basis as that rendered by the other. It seems to me that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has described indicates that we have in operation neither one system nor the other, and that some injustice is likely to be done to individual officers as well as the country itself. I cannot help thinking that the arrangement which existed before: the present} incident, proved to be reasonably workable, those responsible for the officers in the two Houses conferring with one another. At any rate, there was a working agreement, and, so far as I am aware, there has never been any unfairness to an officer, or any neglect of the interests of the country. If the salaries of officers may be increased, and their seniority raised, on the recommendation of the  Speaker  alone, one can imagine that the only way to secure justice for the officers of the Senate would be for the  President  to take similar action. It seems that the  President  would either have to condone what has been done, or raise the salary of the  Clerk  of the Senate to an amount which is excessive. The present procedure is impossible. </para>

                            <para>- I think the honorable senator refers to the invariable practice that, when an officer is appointed to a new position, he commences at the lowest rung in that grade. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has pointed out that he endeavoured to follow that course, when there was a re-allotment of these parliamentary positions. He invariably placed the incoming officer on the lower grade, so that in two or three years the officer might, by successive steps, reach the maximum. That course, however, has not been followed in another place. Whatever course is adopted, it ought to be adopted in both Houses. It ought not to be possible in either House, owing, it may be, to different views being held, to give benefits to one set of officers which are withheld from officers in the other Chamber. I do not think we should be justified at this juncture in increasing the salary of the officers of this Chamber, but, at the same time, I see very great difficulty in objecting to the proposed increase in the salary of the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives. There is a very strong tradition that each House should largely control its own affairs. What is needed is not rivalry between the two Houses, but some plan of co-ordination. If we proceed to bring the salary of our  Clerk  up to that of the  Clerk  in another place we run the risk, apart from the question of whether we ought, for financial reasons, to grant the increase, of putting one House in competition with the other. Suppose, later on, some  Speaker  thought an officer in the other House was worthy of a higher salary than the corresponding officer in the Senate, he might increase that officer's salary. If the Senate proceeded on the same lines, it would be a dangerous course, and one entirely lacking in dignity. I see no immediate way out of the difficulty. Either of the two courses is objectionable, and I regret to say that I cannot offer a suggestion. </para>

If we sent a resolution on, side by side with the fact that we had passed the item, the other House would accept the passage of the item with gratification, and regard the resolution merely with a smile. There is only one way to make the resolution effective, and that is by disturbing the salary. If I could offer the Committee a workable solution I would do ,so, but I cannot. It is a matter that should never have arisen. It should have been settled by a conference. Some effort should have been made to work together. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; I can give specific instances, if necessary, of the Joint Committee having fixed salaries; the Library Committee did so only a few months ago. Under the original arrangement there was co-ordination and harmony. Members in the other Chamber think that the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives should be paid a higher salary, because there are more sitting days in that Chamber, and because he is senior to the   Clerk  in the Senate. It would have been an easy matter to have got over this difficulty if the precedent established in the first Parliament, and followed in several subsequent Parliaments, (had been continued. The  Clerk  of the Parliaments was the  Clerk  of the Senate. The first  Clerk  of the Senate was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackmore,</inline> and of another place <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins. Mr. Jenkins</inline> retired, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy,</inline> who was Assistant  Clerk  in the Senate, became  Clerk  in the House of Representatives. It was considered that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackmore</inline> held the senior position, and that condition of affairs prevailed for a long time. If that principle had been continued, and the  Clerk  of the Senate had always been the senior  Clerk  of Parliament, the present difficulty would not have arisen. There would have been no friction, and the two Houses could have worked harmoniously if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale</inline> had been transferred to the Senate, and made  Clerk  of t'he Parliaments. In that way alone can I see a way out of the present position. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen that if we increase the salary of the  Clerk  of the Senate by £250 a year, there' will still be no finality. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens'</inline> requested amendment will not bring us any nearer to' a settlement of the matter. I would prefer, rather, to take the stronger and more drastic action suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle.</inline></para>

If we increase the pay of the  Clerk  and ignore the other officials, we shall be extending the injustice. Something must be done. It may be unpleasant to have a collision with the other place, but I see no other way out of the difficulty but to reduce the salary of the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives to the level of that of the  Clerk  of the Senate. I admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monahan's</inline> .experience is short by comparison with that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale,</inline> but he, no doubt, considers that he ought to be regarded as of the same seniority, and entitled to the same salary. </para>

                        <para>. - I have, I suppose, like other honorable senators, been trying to do a little thinking whilst this, debate has been proceeding to see if I could not, in some way or other, remedy the omission to which I pleaded guilty just now when I said that I was unable to offer a suggestion. I do not know that I am any nearer being able to offer a workable suggestion now than I was before, but I am going to take the responsibility of offering one. The request that has been moved does not seem to me to carry us anywhere. The intention of the honorable senator who moved it was that the salary of the  Clerk  of this Chamber should be increased, and the salary attaching to the similar position in the other House should not be touched. If the other House rejects that proposed increase, we cannot then go back to the question of the salary of the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives, to which we will have committed ourselves. On the other hand, if we pass the salary of the  Clerk  of this Chamber as it stands on the Estimates, at £1,000 a year, and reduce the salary attaching to the corresponding position in the other place, and it comes back again to us, we cannot then revert to the question of the salary of the  Clerk  of this Chamber, and say we will raise it. In that event, the only thing open for discussion would be the salary attaching to the Clerkship of the other House. If we are anxious to arrive at some mutual understanding as to how this position should be dealt with, we ought to seek to keep both these items open and available; for discussion. 'That means we must propose some amendment of each  of them. Only in that way can we insure an interchange of messages between the two Houses on both items. I suggest that some increase should be proposed in the salary of the  Clerk  of the Senate, say, to £1,125, and that a request should be made for a reduction in the salary of the corresponding position in the other House to £1,125. That would leave both positions open, for discussion between the two Houses. If we assent to one of . those two salaries we cannot go back to it in any discussion that may ensue. I make the suggestion so that if it is thought desirable we can seek an interchange of views with the other House with a view to devising a better system than the present one. I hope it will be understood that the Committee discusses these items in the spirit that the salaries have no relation at all to the officials in the two positions. I hardly feel that I should be justified in agreeing to any alteration of the Estimates as submitted by the Government, and I express the hope that my suggestion, or some improvement of it, will be adopted. </para>

                        <para>.- ;I do not know whether the Committee is willing to accept that suggestion; but I am not. The proposed requested amendment is either right or it is wrong. The other place is either justified in making an increase of £'250 in the salary of their  Clerk,  or they are not justified. It does not appear to me to be a case in which we should indulge in technicalities with a view, if the other Chamber does not do what we believe to be right, to checkmate their claim to superiority by increasing the salary of our own  Clerk  and doing another wrong to the taxpayers. I would very much like to see the salaries of everybody increased in the - proportion of £250 a year. It would be quite a pleasant task for me to move it; but the taxpayer also has a say in the matter. We are handling, not our own money, but that of the people. Therefore, we have to see that we do not grant higher salaries than are commensurate with the services rendered' to the people. I hold that the  Clerk  of either branch of this Legislature is adequately paid at ,£1,000 a year. I do not feel that either branch of the </para>

The suggestion is that we shall request the House of Representatives to increase the item of £1,000 for the  Clerk  of the Senate by £125, and that when we come to the vote for the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives we shall request that they reduce the item of £1,250 to £1,125. The House of Representatives will immediately see the idea. They are intent upon the increase being granted to their own officer, and they will refuse the Senate's request point blank. What can we dc then <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Will we then move that the salary of the  Clerk  of the Senate be increased from £1,125 to £1,250? The members of another place will very quickly realize what the object of that move is. That kind of tactics, although legal, is not desirable. We ought to take a strong stand. If it is right 'that the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives should have £250 increase in his salary, let us pass it. If it is wrong, let us make a request that the amount be reduced. Unpleasant as the task is, I shall move later that the House of Representatives be requested to reduce the amount by £250. </para>

                        <para>. - No doubt we have got into somewhat of a tangle; but it is none of the Senate's making. It is well to recognise that. The suggestion made by the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> is a very ingenious one, but I am afraid that it, also, has its defects. It ' proposes to increase the salary of the  Clerk  of this Chamber, and to commit ourselves to a course of action which we will have to stand by later on. If the Committee increases the salary it will pet away from what I assume is the considered policy of the Senate. It will commit itself to the opinion, for the sake of putting itself right in a situation that may arise afterwards, that the  Clerk  of the Senate is at present underpaid. On the other hand, if it proposes' to alter tie remuneration of the official of another place, it will also commit itself to a very definite stand. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> proposes to say, quite frankly and respectfully, that the proposed increase in the salary of the  Clerk  of the other place is not appropriate, and is not in keeping with the condition of things that ought to exist between the two Chambers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle's</inline> proposal may appear to be somewhat of a bludgeon, containing a stand and deliver threat. But it is not so. I do not know that it is subject to that interpretation, for the simple reason that when the Estimates emerged from the other House, and the lower amount was recognised as suitable for the official of this Chamber, the suggestion was that this Chamber was inferior to the other in so ° far as the figures could suggest. We do not say that either House is inferior to the other, as typified by the remuneration of its officials. We desire to say that we consider ourselves, by the Constitution, as a co-equal and co-ordinate branch of the Legislature. I do not think we are entirely guiltless in this matter, because I have a recollection that  officers of this Chamber were at one time remunerated at a higher figure than the officers of another place. I remember a figure of £900 being set down on one occasion for the  Clerk  of another place, and £1,000 for the  Clerk  of the Senate. Now the tables have been turned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle's</inline> proposition should ' be adopted as a clear indication to another place that, while we do not consider this Chamber superior, we do not regard it as inferior. We have been told by the  President  that the duties devolving on the  Clerk  in another place are onerous, but he has assistance. Although numerically the House of Representatives is the larger Chamber, and perhaps the duties of the principal officer there are greater, he is provided with assistants, so the position is about balanced. He is not called upon to perform any more work than is the  Clerk  of this Chamber. As this Chamber is to be judged as much by the remuneration of its members and officers as by anything else, I do not think we are justified in allowing the two items to pass in this lop-sided fashion; therefore, I will support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> in a respectful request to another place to reduce the salary of the  Clerk  there to the level of the salary paid to the  Clerk  in this Chamber. </para>

                        <para>.- While the Minister's suggestion has much to recommend it, I intend to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle.</inline> In my judgment, £1,000 a year is a very fair salary to pay to the  Clerk  of this Chamber or another place. Judging from the remarks of honorable senators, there is a belief that the House of Representatives is more or less antagonistic towards the Senate. I do not subscribe to that view at all. We know quite well that many item9 in Supply Bills are not individually scrutinized, and it is possible that this item was not brought under the personal notice of members in another place. I take it that the Government are to some extent to blame for this additional vote of £250 for the  Clerk  of the House of 'Representatives. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Where were these advocates of economy in another place when this item 'came under consideration ? They were prepared to sacrifice returned soldiers, but evidently did not protest against this increase. I am confident that members of another place are not antagonistic towards the Senate. Last evening I. listened to quite a number of stirring speeches in that chamber commending the action of the Senate towards the Tariff. Is it not possible for the Joint House Committee to make some recommendation in regard to this matter, or is it not possible for two or three members of the Senate and another place to discuss these points of difference, and recommend a solution? I regret that I am unable to support the Minister's suggestion, because we may find . a future  Speaker  putting £500 on to the salary of the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives in the expectation that there will be some such compromise as the Minister now suggests. Our best course is to request another place to reduce the salary of their  Clerk  to the former amount. </para>

                        <para>. - It is regrettable that this discrimination appears in the Bill. I should like to know whether the  President  had an opportunity of discussing this matter with the  Speaker,  as I take it that the  Speaker  framed his Estimates, and that the  President  was responsible for the Estimates for this Chamber. My memory carries me back to the original Estimates, in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackmore,</inline> the first  Clerk  in this Chamber, was designated "  Clerk  of the Parliaments," and held a senior position. Later, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline> became  Clerk  of the Senate, and he was succeeded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy.</inline></para>

                            <para>- I am aware of that. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackmore</inline> was a man of outstanding ability, and wherever British parliamentary institutions exist, he was a recognised authority in his particular work.His contributions to parliamentary law and lore were both valued, and not infrequent, and it was thought desirable that he should occupy some such position, and be regarded as the senior officer in the Federal Parliament. If we tacitly acquiesce in this discrimination now, we do not know where it is going to lead us. If the  Speaker  of another place considers, as evidently he does, that the work done by the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives is greater, and of more importance, than the work done by the  Clerk  of the Senate, some future  Speaker  may think there should be a, much greater margin, as represented by the salary, between the importance and volume of the work in the respective Houses. I do not feel disposed to take any course that involves such a possibility, and, seeing that the  President,  in framing his Estimates, did not think it necessary to increase the salary of the  Clerk  in this Chamber over the amount paid last year, we should be a little hesitant about taking the course suggested by the Minister. </para>

We should adhere to the other course, and ask the House of Representatives to take off the additional £250 voted to the salary of the  Clerk  of their Chamber. I am very well aware that there may be a disposition on the part of some people to consider the Senate as perhaps not doing as much work as the House of Representatives, and that the position of  Clerk  here does not involve so much responsibility or work as that of  Clerk  of another place, but, as has been pointed out already, the staff on the Senate side is not as large as the staff of another place. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The staff there is supposed to be equal to the increased work involved in the larger number of members, and the consequent more frequent sittings. But if honorable members in another place contributed as much in debate in proportion to the difference in the number of members in this Chamber, they would at least sit a little more than twice as often and twice as long, as we do. Although they have, in consequence of their longer and more frequent sittings, a larger staff than is supposed to be commensurate with the difference between the two Houses, the responsibilities of the  Clerk  in the Senate are as great as the responsibilities of the  Clerk  in another place. For these reasons, I see no justification whatever for any difference in the salaries. I commend the object the Minister has in view in making the suggestion, but as I am rather doubtful that it will achieve the end which he desires, I shall be prepared to support the request that the House of Representatives bring1 the two items into line as they were last year, when such vote stood at £1,000. </para>

                            <para>- Before our Estimates were sent in, I was fully impressed, as I have always been, with the desirable- nesa of co-ordinating the Departments, and the necessity for some uniformity ' in relation to the salaries of the officers in the five different Departments. "With that in view, I suggested to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> that there should be some agreement in connexion with; the Estimates, and that the heads of Departments should peruse the proposed figures in order to rectify or bring into harmony any anomalies that might exist. After that examination, had been made, and we had arrived at what we considered was fair, the Estimates were sent in, and those for the Senate were in the form in which they now appear before the Committee, with the exception of those in relation to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. During this year I found that it had been recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale</inline> should be made  Clerk  of the Parliaments with an increase of £250 a year. In response to my representations, the Government did not accede to the request, and I thought the matter had ended, because I. knew nothing about the additional payment to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale</inline> until the Estimates were tabled. </para>

                            <para>- In New South Wales, it will be found from a perusal of their Estimates that the  Clerk  of the Legislative Council, corresponding, of course, to our Senate, is described as the  Clerk  of the Parliaments, but he receives only £740, while the  Clerk  of the Legislative Assembly receives £900 per annum. It may be claimed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> that he has a right to appoint" the  Clerk  in that chamber  Clerk  of the Parliaments because he has more work to do, and that, in consequence, he should also receive a higher salary. The New South Wales Parliament is the oldest in the Commonwealth, and we should, I think, be guided by what it does. </para>

I trust that as far as this Chamber is concerned we shall, with the assistance of our Presiding Officer, show that we are not going to quietly submit to the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives being appointed  Clerk  of the Parliaments, because by doing such a thing we would not be acting fairly to our own  Clerk,  or adding to the dignity of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>. - As we are likely to be expected by another place to give some reasons why we should take the action suggested, I desire to draw attention to the number of clerical workers in the two Houses. We find that in another place, which undoubtedly sits longer than we do, there are ten clerical workers, as against five in this Chamber. It will be seen that no move has been made in the direction of giving those officers a higher salary than those performing similar work in this branch of the Legislature. The  Clerk  of the Senate, having a smaller staff, must necessarily have more questions submitted to him, and, as he has less assistance, his work must be consequently heavier. I can only see one way out of the difficulty, and that is that the  Clerk  holding the senior position should be made  Clerk  of the Senate, and his length of service would thus be recognised. </para>

                            <para>- I am not dealing with that. The 'position seems to be perfectly clear. The  Clerk  of the Senate holds a certain position at a certain salary, and if we are to allow the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives to receive a, higher rate we shall be disrating our  Clerk,  because, after all is said and done, the only honour attaching to the position is in the remuneration paid. If we are going to agree to the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives receiving £1,250 per annum, we should see that our own  Clerk  receives a, similar amount. I am more inclined to favour the reduction of the salary of the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives to £1,000 than to increase that of the  Clerk  of the Senate to £1,250. If the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives is to be paid a higher salary, it will ' be said that our  Clerk,  who, I believe, is senior, is made junior to the other officer mentioned. </para>

                        <para>.- Instructions were recently issued to messengers in the rooms devoted to Federal Members in Sydney and Brisbane - and in other State capitals also, I presume - to the effect that no cor respondence should be stamped, except by members of Parliament themselves. It has hitherto been the practice for letters to be handed to those messengers for stamping in the ordinary course. </para>

                            <para>- Even though the privilege may not have applied in all the States, my point still holds good, namely, that there should be consistency. Within these precincts members of Parliament may have their correspondence stamped by the messengers authorized for that purpose. Those who do not reside in Melbourne, however, are unfairly discriminated against in that they are bound to stamp their correspondence out of the allowance granted for postage and* telegrams, namely, £25 each. Federal legislators resident in Victoria may send all their letters by means of the facilities provided in this building. I suggest in fairness that no letters should be so despatched, but that the allowance of £25 should he regarded as sufficient for the stamping of all correspondence. In this way a certain amount of money could be saved, and all members, no matter from what State, would all be placed upon the same footing. Here is an opportunity to bring about consistency, and, , at the same time, practise a little economy at home. </para>

                        <para>. - The privilege accorded in Sydney and Brisbane in respect of the stamps of Federal members' correspondence was withdrawn after full consideration by the Joint House Committee. The view was taken that the specific allowance for stamps was sufficient for the purpose; and, since there have been certain irregularities in connexion with the use of those stamps', it was deemed desirable, as well as necessary in the best interests of the country, and of the reputation of the Federal Legislature, that the practice should be stopped. Further, there was no good reason why legislators representative of the two States mentioned should be given advantage over those coming from any of the other four States. I assure honorable senators that the whole subject was very carefully considered, 'and that the members of the Joint House Committee were practically unanimous in coming to the decision. </para>

In my view, the special messenger should receive considerably more per annum than the other.  His  duties entail certain responsibilities, and he has been of material assistance, particularly to new senators. This messenger has done all that has been possible in that direction, and he has to undergo strenuous and responsible periods of duty. The anomaly of the payment to each of these two messengers being the same should not be permitted to continue. I move, therefore - </para>

The Estimates were decided upon after full and careful consideration by the heads of the Departments concerned, and following upon consultation with a view to securing coordination and harmony between the various Departments in the Parliament. Any increase made in respect of the salary of one official will bear upon the payments made to others and must entail consequent adjustments if co-ordination is to be maintained.

                        <para>.- Under the subdivision dealing with " The Senate- Contingencies," there is an item, ' ' Writing paper and envelopes, including cost of printing and embossing thereon." The envelopes provided for the use of honorable senators are the poorest sample of stationery which it has ever been my misfortune to be required to use.  I  doubt if one in ten of them will contain any letter placed therein, without bursting. The paper which is made available to honorable senators is not nearly as good to write upon as that formerly provided, although I understand that it actually costs more. As for the envelopes, their poor quality entails considerable waste. Altogether, they are very badly made, and reflect no credit upon those by whom they are supplied. I do not know where or by whom they are manufactured. </para>

                        (Queensland [4.30]. - All stationery is supplied by the Government Printing. Office. Honorable senators will realize that the quality of' all paper depreciated very much during the war, and, as a matter of fact, it has been almost impossible to get the supplies of paper required. I have found no difficulty in enclosing letters in envelopes supplied for the use of the Senate.

But I suggest mat the Government should give the matter close attention before next year's Estimates are submitted. As the item was included in the Estimates to meet a special contingency it should disappear or diminish in accordance with the reduction in the cost of living. </para>

                        <para>. - It will be noted that the Library staff now totals ten as compared with, eight last year. One additional employee is a cadet cataloguer at a salary of £100. He is a young officer who has been training at the University, and I think he still attends lectures there. A cataloguer has to inform himself in a general way of the contents of every boole, and record them. We have an experienced cataloguer in the Library, but somebody must be in training as a cadet cataloguer, not merely to relieve the senior official, but, ultimately, possibly, to take up his duties. </para>

In this time of stress, and in view of the' need for economy and retrenchment, I think consideration ought to be given to the question of whether the staff of the Public Works Committee is necessary . </para>

                        <para>. - As a member of the Public Works Committee, I may say that the Committee have very little to do with expenditure in administration. I do not mean to say that members do not take an interest in the cost of the administration of the Committee ; but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has pointed out, the Committee is under the control of the  President  of the Senate. The work done by the Committee is very important. I venture to say that during the short time that I have been a member of it, the Committee has effected savings of many thousands of pounds to the taxpayers of this country. It is only twelve months since a reference was made to the Committee in connexion with an obligation that the taxpayers, through the Government, were faced with, and as a result of the recommendation of the Committee the taxpayers have been saved something over £100,000. I cannot say more than that, because writs have been issued by the contending parties. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> were at one time members of the Committee, and they will support me when I ask honorable members not to be too critical of the expenditure incurred by the Committee, in view of the great amount of work it does, and the large amount of money it has saved the taxpayers. </para>

We carried out the wish of Parliament in undertaking the inspection.

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> has drawn attention to the difference between the amounts voted and the amounts expended for the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The difference is made up by the circumstance that in the case of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works there is provision made for a clerk and messenger. In the case of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, there is provision only for an office assistant at £200, as against the clerk of the Public Works Committee at £245 and the messenger at £182. In respect to the staffs of' both these Committees there is provision for cost of living bonus and basic wage allowances, in connexion with which there is not very much difference between the two Committees. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts has always been housed in Parliament House, but the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has not, up to the present, although arrangements are now being made to house that Committee here. This arrangement is only possible in consequence of extensions that have been made to the building on the House of Representatives side, whereby additional Ministers' rooms and conveniences for members have been provided. Personally, from my experience, I have no reason to doubt that the housing of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in this building will lead to economy in the administration costs of the Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has indicated that as a result of arrangements which are now being considered there will be economy in the administration costs of the Committee in future. That is an indication of the advantage that can be gained by concentrating Departments, instead of having them scattered, as they are at present, all over Melbourne. It was necessary for the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works to have a messenger, because it was at first housed at the other end of the city in the Wool Exchange buildings in King-street. After that it was moved to Broken Hill Chambers, Queen-street. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts does not appear to have had a special messenger. The secretary to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has occupied that position since the Committee came into existence. He is an officer of outstanding ability. He was taken from one of the Departments, in which he had been employed since the establishment of the Commonwealth. He is a man of attainments, experience, and accomplishments, and when he was taken from the position that he held in one of the larger central Departments of the Commonwealth due regard was paid to his then claims and prospects for promotion and advancement. He has held the position of secretary to the Committee for five or six years. He is steeped in experience of the work of the Committee, and is a very valuable guide, counsellor, and friend to every member of the Committee, and especially to incoming members. On the other hand, the officer who is occupying the position of secretary to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts was, immediately preceding his occupancy of that office, clerk to the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Public Works under the officer whom I have just designated. He has not had the experience or the length of service with the Commonwealth that the secretary to the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Public Works has had. It is because of the difference in their age, experience, and length of service that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, while able to get an active, efficient and intelligent secretary, has net found it necessary to pay the same salary as is paid to the secretary of the Parliamentary  Standing Committee of Public Works. ' I rose, more than anything else, to point out the economy that is effected in administration by having different Departments and activities concentrated as far as possible in the same building, instead of being scattered and divided, as they are at present, in Melbourne. Honorable members know that even single Departments in Melbourne are in many instances to be found not housed under one roof, or even under adjoining roofs, but scattered throughout the length and breadth of the city and suburbs. The difference in the cost of the administration of these two Committees is a striking illustration of the disadvantage of the existing conditions. </para>

                    <para>I desire to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> a question with regard to the reserve or allotment that is to be found on the northern or north-western side of the block of the land on which Parliament House stands. There is an alley-way, or right-of-way running from Spring-street to Albert-street. On the north-westerly side of it is an enclosure or reserve which, I understand, belongs properly to Parliament House, which is a State property. It has been announced more than once that the State authorities have been desirous- of throwing the allotment in with the rest of the parliamentary grounds, provided that certain conditions are complied with which will insure to the public access 'to the grounds. At present the public has not access to the grounds, because they are enclosed. The allotment is unsightly and not useful. I would like to know from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> if a proposition such as- I have mentioned has come from  the State Government, and, if so, what it is proposed to do with regard to it. The public would like to know what is the exact position. Is it intended to do anything? If not, what is the reason for inaction? </para>

                        <para>. - I think that for about eight or nine years Parliament has voted the money for this purpose, and the Commonwealth has been ready 'at al! times to undertake the whole of the capital cost of converting the land referred to into an open garden, similar to the corner plot at the other end of Spring-street. At present it is not used at all. The original proposition put before the then State Government was that we should bear the whole of the capital expenditure in the removal of the fence along the right-of-way, and convert the property into one garden. The scheme had the approval of the then State Premier <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alexander Peacock),</inline> the architect to the State Public Works Department and the Melbourne City Council, but the Joint House Committee of the Victorian Parliament would not agree to it. The money has been voted on several occasions, and has always been available. If the proposal were carried out it would make a perfect balance. This House would then stand in fine grounds, and there would be room for the erection of statuary. At present the area referred to is useless, and cannot be regarded as ornamental. The conditions under which we occupy Parliament House and the grounds . from the State Parliament render us helpless in the matter without the consent of the State authorities. It is not our responsibility that nothing has been done up to the present. We were prepared to spend about £1,500 in the beautification of the grounds, but I did not feel like going cap-in-hand to the members of the State House Committee to get their approval. </para>

                        <para>. -  The expenditure in this Department last year very greatly exceeded the amount voted. I am quite aware that, owing to its very nature, the Prime Minister's Department might be expected to expand, but during the last four years it has outdistanced all the other Departments from the point of view of expenditure. If we add the amount not spent upon immigration, £75,000, to the excess expenditure, we have a total of well over £100,000 in excess of the vote agreed to by Parliament last year. I recognise that it is almost impossible to keep the expenditure of this Department within the vote, but the excess is so large that I think we are entitled to some explanation. On' the administrative side alone last year there was a clear increase of over £100,000. Expenditure in the High Commissioner's Office alone exceeded the vote by over £20,000, and in view of the report made by  Colonel Ramaciotti  it would appear that Australia House requires overhauling. I have no fault to find with the increased vote for the Audit Department, because I regard that Department as the watch dog of the Commonwealth Public Service, and it is essential that it should be kept up to concert pitch, so to speak, in regard to its staff. I regret that the amount set aside for immigration was not spent. Last year we voted £100,000, but spent only £12,000. When this matter was last before the Committee, I drew attention to what was done in Western Australia seventeen years ago, and by a Labour Government too. A close watch needs to be kept on all public expenditure. According to the Budget papers, there has been an increase in administration expenditure from £10,000,000 in 1917-18 to £15,000,000 this year, an increase of 50 per cent, in four years. Our public expenditure may be divided under three headings - the Departmental Vote, the Special Appropriations, and expenditure on War Services. We cannot touch the Special </para>

                    <para class="block">Appropriations without altering the Act. Under this heading the expenditure in four years has increased from £12,000,000 to £14,000,000, an increase of 16 per cent. This does not call for special comment, but expenditure on War Services has increased from £11,000,000 to £31,000,000. I had apprehended that there would be a decline of expenditure under this heading.. Turning to the ordinary departmental expenditure, there has been an increase, as I have shown, of 50 per cent, in four years. If we maintain this rate, we shall strike trouble very quickly. The Budget-papers point to the danger. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook, dealing with the seasonal prospects, said that the prices of wool and wheat were very good. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps not. But we must not forget the reservoir from which all this expenditure is drawn. On page 179 of the Budget-papers, it is shown that the area under crop in 1912-13 was 13,S38,049 acres; and in 1919-20, 13,298,000, showing a reduction in seven years. The wheat yield in 1915-16 was 179,000,000 bushels, and last year 144,000,000 bushels. The ex-Treasurer referred to the last-mentioned quantity as a guarantee that 'the Commonwealth could rely upon receiving satisfactory revenue, notwithstanding the fact that the quantity was considerably less than it has been in previous years. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> must admit that there is a tendency to increase the departmental expenditure to the point where it is necessary for us to seriously consider that our production is declining in volume, and that we are approaching the time when there will be trouble ahead, and we shall have, in the classical language of another place, to apply the "meat axe." I trust the Minister is fully alive to the necessity of keeping a firm hand on expenditure in this Department, which offers the best opportunity for effecting economy, because there have been substantial increases without any explanation, except in connexion with immigration, on which I would have been prepared to support an increase. I am sure that the Minister will be able to give a satisfactory explanation for the heavy expenditure on the High Commissioner's Office, and the total of the Prime Minister's Department, which has been increased by £100,000. </para>

                        <para>. - I feel sure that the Committee will recognise the very serious nature of the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> when he draws attention to the necessary relationship which must exist, if we are to successfully continue, between the value of production and the cost of government. Coming down to the points he particularly stressed in relation to the increase in the Prime Minister's Department, I shall point out one or two items which are self-explanatory. Generally it has been recognised that as things have been of late years it has not been possible to conduct Departments as economically as hitherto. Wages have been increased, and it struck me as somewhat inconsistent that attention should have been directed to the growing expenditure in the aggregate when we  -  I think all of us have been more or less guilty - have been assisting in creating that increase by granting additions in various directions. We are condemning the fact that the expenditure of conducting Departments has increased; but because we have approved, or have refrained from preventing, increases, we have really been responsible for swelling the aggregate amount. Much of this expenditure has arisen in consequence of increased salaries, and from such items as the basic wage allowance and child endowment payments. </para>

The honorable senator referred to the increased expenditure of £100,000 in the Prime Minister's Department. There was an increase of £53,000, representing the difference between the expenditure and the vote as Australia's contribution to the cost of Secretariat to the League of Nations. Honorable senators are aware that this is a matter which, to 'the full extent of my powers, I sought to have remedied, so that the contributions levied would be on a more equitable basis, and that Australia would not have to contribute amounts similar to those contributed by such countries as Great Britain and France. That is now being remedied. </para>

                            <para>- Originally the nations were classified in five divisions. Australia, in some respects, was untitled to be classified with the first-class Powers, but in regard to our payments it was pointed out that we could not be expected to contribute to the same extent as other countries in that classification. As the result of the objection which was lodged, Australia has been placed in a less costly division, but at the moment I cannot say what our annual contribution is likely to be. The League of Nations prepare a Budget from year to year, and in future we shall have to pay whatever amount may be fixed under the new classification. I think, however, I am safe in saying that we shall have to pay about one-half of what we have previously paid, and it may be less. </para>

As was to be expected, in connexion with the visit of  His  Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, there was an excess of expenditure over the votes, aud that, in conjunction with the contribution to the Secretariat of the League of Nations, represents, broadly speaking, £100,000. </para>

                            <para>- No. A Royal Commission waa appointed to inquire into the question of a uniform gauge for the Commonwealth, consequent upon arrangements made between the Government and the  State Premiers. The Commission consisted of an American ana an English railway expert and an Australian railway official. That Commission has completed its investigation, and therefore the item will not occur again. The same may be said of the amount of £6,000 for the Taxation Commission. These items represent expenditure for which there was no previous provision. </para>

                            <para>- Provision was made for that, but the expenditure exceeded the estimate by £881. Apart from the League of Nations and the expenditure in connexion with the visit of the Prince of Wales, there have been no large increases in these particular items. If honorable senators will peruse the items they will see that there is none which invites criticism or any which can really be cavilled at. I do not think that it could be suggested for a moment that we should have demurred in connexion with our contribution to the Secretariat of the League of Nations, because it would have amounted to repudiation. We would not do that. As I have said, the expenditure, apart from the two rather large items which I have mentioned, is not unusual, and is represented by a number of smaller items for which either no .provision has been made or the provision has not been sufficient. </para>

                            <para>- Because, unfortunately, whilst provision had been made for bringing more people out, the shipping difficulty was so great that it prevented them coming here. In addition, the agreement with the States provided that we should not bring out more men, women, and children than they were in a position to receive and place in employment. The Government did not wish these people to be dumped on the wharfs without any arrangements having been made for finding them employment or settling them in the country. Whether that will be a satisfactory (permanent policy I take the liberty of questioning. The policy adopted in the past in consequence of that limitation of the States will prevent the Commonwealth bringing more people to Australia than it would otherwise be able to do. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> stressed the question of immigration, and on that subject I desire to say a few words. I would have liked to have seen a material reduction in the Defence vote, and every penny of the money saved employed to assist immigration. It has often been said that unless we can fill our empty spaces we cannot hope to hold this continent. The logic of the situation is that if we do not make use of Australia some one else will. Even if we continue with our military expenditure as at present, our Military Forces would not be of much moment, when all is said and done, if some of the Powers that are spoken of in hushed whispers were to come down upon us But if we filled our waste spaces, and established in Australia a great Democracy in the place of the small Democracy we have at present, we should , be in a position to resist any military invasion in a way that we could not expect to be able to do at present.  I  repeat that  I  should like to see a material reduction in the vote for the Defence Department, and every penny of the money saved in that way expended on the immigration of the proper class of people to fill the enormous waste spaces of Australia, which might well be filled by people capable of engaging in agriculture, who would make good and useful citizens of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable senator asked a question about the vote for motor cars. An arrangement has been made to garage the cars required for all the Public Departments in one garage, which is under the control of the Prime Minister's Department. Instead of the expenses being debited to the respectiveDepartments, the whole of the administration work connected with the cars is centred in the Prime Minister's Department. </para>

                        <para>.- Last year we voted £800 for " Salary and travelling allowances of officers acting as Secretaries to Leaders of the  Opposition  in the Senate and House of Representatives and Leader of the Country party." This year £1,300 is asked for. Surely  it  cannot be put forward that the duties of the Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate have increased to such an extent that an additional amount is required to cover his travelling allowance. </para>

                            <para>- There is a vote of £2,500 set down for the Geneva Conference, 1920. Honorable senators will find that £5,802 was expended in 1920-21 for " Commonwealth representation at Geneva Conference." In the circumstances I should like to have some explanation of the additional vote asked for. There is a small vote of £250 down for " Prize for military band contest at Ballarat." Two hundred and fifty pounds was voted for this purpose last year, and only £50 was spent. It would be interesting to know, in the circumstances, whether the vote of £250 proposed this year is likely to be absorbed. I find a vote of £6,000 down for the Taxation Royal Commission. Last year there was an expenditure from . the Treasurer's Advance on this Commission of £7,429. I understood that the Commission had finished its labours some months ago. It would be interesting to know whether the vote set down in this year's Estimates will cover the balance of expenditure incurred by the Commission. If the Commission has finished its labours the Government should be in a position to say what amount has actually been expended. I notice a new item, " Expenses of Berthing Officer and Assistants, Newcastle, £1,200," about which I should like some information. Last year £800 was spent from the Treasurer's Advance under this heading, although no money was voted for the purpose last year. Last year £3,051 was expended on the Scientific Expedition to New Guinea from the Treasurer's Advance. There is no vote set down this year for the Expedition, and I desire to know whether it is proposed to continue to finance the Expedition out of the Treasurer's Advance, and whether the Minister is in a position to say what the probable cost of the Expedition will be. I find that the number of officers in the High Commissioner's Office provided for this year is ninety-two, as compared with twenty-three last year. Does the increase indicate that quite a large number of those  who have been temporarily employed in the office have now been put on the permanent list? Last year the expenditure for temporary assistance amounted to £10,000. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne'</inline> has asked for information upon a number of items. The second amount required to meet expenses of the Geneva Conference is due to the belated arrival of some accounts which have reached us from the Imperial Government. When the Convention was about to be held they undertook to make arrangements for delegates from all the British Dominions. Their offer was accepted, and the expenses covered by the accounts which they rendered afterwards for the accommodation provided were shared amongst the various delegates. Some accounts have been received only in time to be included in this year's Estimates, though the services were rendered a long . while ago. With regard to the vote for a prize for the Ballarat band contest, a similar amount was originally voted for the Ballarat festival, which those controlling the festival were not able to use. A sum of £50 was then given for a minor competition in connexion, I think, with the cadets. It is proposed now, subject to parliamentary concurrence, to give this year the £250 promised for a previous occasion, which those controlling the festival could not avail themselves of. With regard to the Taxation Commission, that body has finished its travelling and the taking of evidence. It has yet to complete some supplementary reports on matters referred to it. It is not anticipated that it will continue in existence very much longer, and the vote now asked for is believed to be sufficient to cover the expenditure in connexion with the Commission which has yet to be met. The berthing officer at Newcastle was appointed in connexion with the control of the export of coal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> will probably recollect that owing to the higher price that could be obtained abroad for coal, there was a tendency at one time to export coal to such an extent that it was thought probable that Australian industries might be left without sufficient supplies. In order to prevent that, the Government made the necessary proclamation, appointed a berthing officer' at Newcastle, whose duty it was to determine which ship should go in first for loading, the idea being to see that no coal went out of Australia which was needed for carrying on Australian industries. Certain alterations in the nature of the coal control have followed, which experience has justified. </para>

There is no change in the conditions of their employment - they were employed under the High Commissioner Act when shown under "Temporary Assistance," but it is considered that the classification adopted this year is the more correct one, as, although they are in a different category from permanent officers, they are employed under different conditions from the ordinary temporary officers of the Commonwealth Public Service. Their employment may, however, be terminated at any time by the High Commissioner. </para>

                            <para>- That is unfortunate, because it would be useless to request a reduction. I understood that the labours of the Royal Commission were not yet completed. The question of the unification of railway gauges crops up whenever Premiers or other Ministers from the various States meet in conference. Some time ago it was announced by the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> that a scheme had been accepted which would cost something like £61,000,000, the expenditure to be spread over a period of years. Australia will be unable to standardize its railway gauges for many years, and if the Government are likely to have such a huge sum to spend on a project of this kind, I would remind them that there are a hundred and one other matters upon which the money could just as well be spent. Defence experts differ as to what would be the value of a unification of gauges. Had Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania not built narrow-gauge railways, they would never have had the development that has taken place in those States, because it would have been impossible to construct a similar mileage of broad-gauge railways. Why not spend some of this money in encouraging immigration, or on some other work which would bring a quick return? While it is, perhaps, deplorable, from many points of view, that there are so many breaks of gauge in Australia, . we are faced with the fact that we cannot afford to incur such an immense expenditure as unification would involve. Let the Government throw open such country as the Burnett lands in Queensland, every inch of which is suitable for settlement. Every part of Australia is in need of greater population, and money should be spent on immigration instead of on investigations and discussions which lead us nowhere. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I do not think that it is possible to say how valuable the work of the Bureau of Mines has been in the United States of America in opening up country, bringing capital in, and increasing mineral production. If we appointed a competent Director, the initial cost would not be great, apart from the officer's salary; but such an official could collate information which would be of the greatest value both within and outside Australia. </para>

                            <para>- This vote is for Australia's contribution to a movement which is doing for the Empire exactly what the honorable member suggests should be done for the Commonwealth. I think there is a great deal in his proposal. I often think that we have resources in Australia which lie untapped because we fail to make them better known. If the honorable senator's suggestion could be carried out, especially in co-ordination with the efforts of the .States, much good would result. I shall have his remarks brought under the notice of my colleagues. I entirely differ from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> in his criticism of the value of the work of the Unification of Railway Gauges Commission. This is no new idea, and it is utterly wrong to say that it is leading nowhere. Such criticism could be levelled at every movement, upon its inception. It might be offered with respect to the long journey which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> and other honorable senators) have recently completed. </para>

                            <para>- There are many people who would have put it further ahead than that. Hitherto there has always been a disagreement as to the railway gauge to be adopted for the Commonwealth; but an agreement has now been arrived at. The States concerned and the Commonwealth are unable to agree as to what the gauge should be, but they agreed that they would appoint this Commission, consisting of one Englishman, one American, and one Australian, and would accept the result of the Commission's findings. That is progress. It is not so rapid as I would like, nor as the .honorable gentleman would like in matters of which he .approves, but it is not right to say that it has not led us anywhere. I draw his attention to the fact that he has spoken of £50,000,000 as the cost of conversion. One thing the Commission has done is to show how the work can be carried out for much less than that sum. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; they have worked with the same desire to save the taxpayers expense, and have reached the same goal as that aimed at by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> and his colleagues. If Australia cannot afford to pay the cost of unifying railway gauges, it also cannot afford to delay doing it any longer. Every day we are adding to our railways, and, therefore, to the cost which we will ultimately have to face when we do unify them. My own State is building more lines on the 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge, and I think Queensland, subject to financial limitations, is doing the same. Where it would cost £18,000,000 or £15,000,000 to-day, it would cost infinitely more in a few years' time. The longer we delay the more costly will the job become. I thought it was the accepted belief that the work had to be done, and that the sooner we did the the cheaper it would be. As to the Commission, it has completed its work, and has been disbanded. There are certain officers working at details which the Commission left unfinished. The vote of £10,000 is to pay for the expenditure already incurred, but it is not anticipated that the whole of that amount will be required. The extent of the saving that can be effected will depend upon how long the calculations now being made will take to complete. </para>

                        <para>.- - I want to bring under the notice of the Committee a great inconvenience to which residents in the Northern Territory are subjected. I am not springing this on the Minister, for I have already made the same complaint direct to the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> and to the Treasury Department. There seems to be practically no difference in the way in which taxation forms are handled when they are sent to a person living in Collins-street and when they are sent to a settler in the Northern Territory, 500 miles beyond the rail-head. At one place in the Northern Territory a gentleman recently received his assessment form for income tax on the 14th or 15th of the month, and on the form it was stated that unless he paid the amount due by the 20th of the same month he would be fined 10 per cent. </para>

                    <para class="block">There was no mail out for three weeks, and it took another six weeks after that for the payment to reach the Treasury Department in Victoria. The man was fined, and had to pay. Another case was brought under my notice of a man who, by the "same mail, received an assessment form and a notice telling him that he was fined. This was the first mail that had been received at that place for about six or eight weeks. Although these complaints may seem trivial to honorable senators, I can assure them that it is pin-pricks like these which cause so much inconvenience and irritation to the people who live many miles from civilization, and have plenty of time to ponder over such details. A grievance becomes magnified when one is living a life of semi-isolation. The inconveniences that these people suffer cause them to look with very unfriendly eyes upon the Government, and to curse the administration of the Northern Territory and everything connected with it. I think the best way to remedy this grievance would be- </para>

                        <para>. - I would like an explanation from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator' E. D. Millen)</inline> regarding a matter to which the Auditor-General refers on page 27 of his report. It is to the effect that the ordinary advance to the Treasurer, a vote of £150,000 - I think it is reduced this year - has been exceeded by a rather serious amount. Under warrant authorities issued in excess of the provision made by this Parliament, the vote was exceeded by something in the neighbourhood of £98,000, and the Auditor-General very properly calls attention to it. It would seem that the ex- Treasurer (Sin Joseph Cook) in this respect has been exceeding his duty. There may be ample reason for it, bub it wants to be a fairly substantial reason to warrant going beyond the authority of Parliament to the extent of that large sum. In this case, parliamentary authority has been ignored by one who ought to be the first to respect it. An explanation, is given that " it is certain, however, that the expenditure outstanding under these authorities will not, at any time, exceed the appropriation." I suppose that the annual expenditure has not exceeded what has been granted under the warrants. It is as well for the Treasurer, as for any one else, to recognise the authority of Parliament. He ought to be the first to set a good example by living within his means, and within the authority given to him by Parliament in the expenditure of public money. </para>

                    <para>In regard to the uncollected taxes, I see.' that there are large amounts of the war-time profits tax and income tax outstanding. In regard to income tax, there is a large amount of £4,500,000 outstanding. That clearly bespeaks, to my mind, that the people who are levied upon for income tax find it very difficult to pay the tax, otherwise it would not be outstanding. Although I know that a system of fines is in operation, as far as I am aware, no statement has been made to this Committee as to the amount of fines levied and collected in respect to these defaulting taxpayers. </para>

                            <para>- Attention might very well be drawn to the Treasurer overdrawing his advance account to the extent of £90,000 odd, because he should be the last to go behind the authority of Parliament in the expenditure of public money. The Department includes several sub-departments, one of which is Taxation; and, again, the watchdog of the public finances, namely, the Audit Department, has directed attention to the fact that about £8,000,000 of land tax, wartime profits tax, and income tax, remains uncollected. I hope that the officials of the Taxation Department have satisfied themselves that there is very good reason for this default on the part of Commonwealth taxpayers. "Whenever I have been behind with my income tax payments, I have had to pay a fine, although when I sought the indulgence of the Department I was given some little time within which to pay. I am surprised that such a large amount of revenue, in the form of wartime profits, should be uncollected three years after the war. If a person is dealing with the Customs Department, he must pay "on the nail " before he can shift fie goods; but it appears that a different method is followed in the collection of war-time profits taxation. Apparently, those who have been able to make . huge profits during war time are allowed to dodge their obligations, at all events, for the time being. </para>

                            <para>- Nevertheless, it is a fact that a huge sum in war-time profits taxation remains uncollected to-day, and naturally I am anxious to know whether the Department, with its increased vote of £100,000 this year, is likely to be a little more alert. I hope that if it is not able to collect these arrears this year it will, at all events, see that the people who are indebted to the Treasury give some <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> for the advantages they enjoy. </para>

                    <para>Another matter to which I wish to direct attention is the expenditure of cash balances at the disposal of the Government, and again I am indebted to the Auditor-General for showing that £5,000,000 has been let out at 2 per cent., and another sum of £2,000,000 at 3 per cent. In his Budget speech, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook stated that short-dated loans in London command a much higher rate of interest than that. I think the lowest is 3-J per cent.; so I am anxious to know why the Treasurer cannot secure a better rate of interest. T shall welcome some information from the Minister. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not know that I can supply the honorable senator with information which,1 apparently, is not already in his possession, because the manner in which he discusses these details indicates that he has himself thought out the reasons for the various matters to which he directs attention. I shall, however, endeavour to put. the case, as it appears to me to be in accordance with the facts. First, then, with regard to the uncollected taxes. The explanation is simple. These taxes are uncollected because time was given by the Department for their payment. In many  cases profits which business people showed upon their transactions were not in liquid cash at all. They were represented by stock or goods in hand, and very often by debts due to them. It is quite obvious, therefore, that if the Department had demanded payment at the due date, many business people would have been forced into the Insolvency Court. Take the case of the pastoralist. Very often his profits would not be represented by cash balances in the bank at all, but by increased stock upon his run, or, it may be, by wool in the warehouses upon which he had not realized. In such cases the Treasurer authorized an extension of time for tile payment of taxation due. The Commonwealth Government could have no possible profit  in the ruin of any man. By acting the part of the generous creditor, it met the public sentiment on this question quite fairly. </para>

                            <para>- No. That amount does not represent arrears for one year only. I have always thought it most unfair, that whilst he was granting time to income taxpayers to meet their obligations, the Treasurer should have been abused because he was unable to balance his incomings and outgoings. The Treasurer could have presented a very different balance-sheet this year if he had demanded his "pound of flesh" immediately it was due instead of extending consideration to a section of the taxpayers. Had he been the manager of a private business concern, he would have taken these amounts in on the credit side of 'his ledger as assets. If the Treasurer had done that his financial statement this year would have shown a substantial credit, instead of which the amounts do not appear on the balance-sheet at all. Nevertheless, the Government have been roundly abused, because while £7,000,000 arrears of taxation is owing to the Treasurer, he drew to the extent of £2,000,000 on the accumulated surplus of the previous years. I mention this fact, not as having very much bearing upon the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> but as a reply to the criticism that has been levelled against these Estimates from many quarters outside. </para>

                    <para>Let me now deal with another matter, the quotation made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> from the Auditor-General's report. I must compliment the honorable senator upon the comprehensive and exhaustive examination which, apparently, he gives to all public documents. I doubt if any other honorable senator has such an intimate knowledge of the multifarious documents that are presented to this Parliament, documents which, I suppose, nine out of ten of us never look at. With regard to the point raised by the honorable senator, the Auditor-General has pointed out that the warrants' issued by the Treasury in respect of the Treasurer'? Advance vote exceeded ' the amount appropriated by Parliament last year. That is true lt in no case was more money spent than had been appropriated. </para>

                            <para>- Well, I shall keep my own opinion upon that point. I understand from the Treasury officials tha't warrant authority may be issued for certain amounts. Let me take the actual figures in order to make my meaning clearer. Let us suppose that the authority for the Treasurer's Advance is fixed at £1,500,000, and the warrant is issued "in the first instance for £1,000,000, of which only £750,000 may be spent, leaving a balance of £250,000. If they issued another warrant for £500,000 the Treasurer's supply would be exhausted, but knowing that only £750,000 of the first warrant authority has been expended, they issue from time to time warrants for expenditure in respect of which authority had not been exhausted. It is a question which method is the better. Some people prefer one, and some another. There has been an under-expenditure, if I may so term it, under the first warrant, and therefore they issue a further expenditure in respect of the same warrant at the latter period of the year. The Auditor-General prefers a different method of bookkeeping, but the Treasury officials have given the Auditor-General an assurance that they approve of their method of handling these matters. I am not expressing any opinion as to which is the better system. There is nothing fundamentally wrong or suggestive of looseness in the keeping of the account. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to direct the attention of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> to the continued increase in the cost of the Taxation Department, the estimated expenditure this year being £546,372 as compared with an expenditure last year of £511,672, the increase being £35,000. Honorable senators will see, by referring to the item, that the vote last year, £440,000, was insufficient by about £70,000. Surely the time has arrived when the Departments should realize that there has been a decrease in the cost of all commodities as compared with the prices which prevailed a few years ago, and we- should therefore be  justified in anticipating decreased expenditure in the Department. We have had it dinned into our ears year after year, when we have protested against extra expenditure, that we have failed to recognise that the Departments have had to bear the additional cost of materials, just as individuals have had to pay increased prices for necessary commodities. Apparently everything is on a down grade, and I do not think we are justified in providing a larger sum for the Taxation Department than was voted last year. In 1920-21 the total number of employees was 1,656, but according to the figures before us, we are to provide this year for 2,027, an increase of 371, which is equal to 18 per cent., although it is estimated that we shall receive only 3½ per cent, more in taxation than last year. </para>

                    <para>According to a statement of the ex-Treasurer  the cost of the Maternity Allowance Department is increasing, and surely this, of all Departments, should be conducted as economically to-day as it was some years ago. The figures for 1914 show that the total number of claims paid was 134,998, the number rejected 709, the total amount paid £674,000, and the cost of administration £.1 10s. 6d. per cent. For the last financial year the number of claims paid was 140,162, the claims rejected 622, the total amount paid £700,760, and the cost of administration £2 6s. 2d. per cent. </para>

                            <para>- In its initial stages the Department had to perform some pioneering work and incur expenditure in getting its machinery into running order; but to-day we ought to be able to reduce expenditure considering that the amount of business handled is only slightly greater than in 1914. At the risk of wearying honorable senators I intend to carry out my promise that I shall never lose an opportunity of entering my protest against the payment of maternity allowance on the present' basis. The time is opportune for the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> to give an assurance to the Committee that this question of policy will receive very careful consideration during the recess, and that the Government will be prepared, when Parliament re-assembles, to submit some scheme by which assistance can be given by the Commonwealth where it is needed, and by means of which we can dispense once and for all with imposing a levy on the taxpayers, especially tie poorer section, to provide people with money when it is not required. </para>

This is one of the ways in which relief could be given to people who are already heavily taxed without in any way refraining from assisting deserving people who require assistance at a critical stage. The present system is, after all, a very crude one, inasmuch as no differentiation is made between the wife of a man receiving £150 a year and one in receipt of £5,000 a year. </para>

                            <para>- That has been suggested; but if my proposal were carried out that could not be said. There has been no mention of pauperizing people who are in receipt of the invalid and old-age pension. We do not look upon the recipients of that Government grant as paupers. Those who really needed the maternity allowance would not feel that they were paupers if they received it, whilst those who have ample of this world's goods would not suffer if the bonus were not paid to them. What right have I to claim from the taxpayers of this country £5 for every child which comes into my home ? The Act provides that I can claim it if I desire, and, unfortunately, nearly all parents, to their shame, claim the bonus. </para>

                        <para>.- I am quite in accord with a good deal of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has said concerning the maternity allowance, and am of the opinion that in many isolated cases it would be better to spend the money in subsidizing hostels, erecting hospitals, or providing funds to assist bush nursing, instead of paying the allowance to the wives of men in receipt of, say, £400 per year and over. It has recently been my privilege to travel through the centre of Australia, and a strong case was submitted to me by the people of Alice Springs, which is approximately 400 miles from, the rail -head. Apart from the accommodation provided at the hospital of the Australian Inland Mission at Oodnadatta, there are no facilities available for the women in Central Australia., and the only means by which they can travel south from Alice Springs, unless their husbands should drive them down in a buggy, is by means of a camel in charge of an Afghan driver. No medical attention is available at Alice Springs, and there are other outside places in a similar position. If there is one institution which, above all others, is doing practical work in the bush in providing medical comforts for people who would otherwise be entirely without them, it is the Australian Inland Mission, run under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church. At the present time the Mission is engaged in the erection of a hostel at Alice Springs,- but it is making slow progress owing to lack of funds. The Mission desires to erect a hostel at Birdsville, in Queensland, which is even more isolated than is Alice Springs, inasmuch as the nearest telegraph or telephone is over 240 miles away. The Government should not find it difficult to expend much of the money now paid by way of maternity allowance to people who do not need it, to far greater advantage to the people of this country. When I was at one of the isolated places in the centre of Australia, a woman gave birth to twins, and, unfortunately, one of the babies' died. At that place there was no medical attention obtainable, and practically no means of communication with the outside world. We are being continually reminded that if we are to progress as we should like to do, we must give more attention to the people in the back-blocks, and make their lives more comfortable for them. Great use is made of this cry at election time; but after an election it is forgotten until the next election comes around. </para>

                            <para>- I may have been somewhat lax in the past in this matter; but having recently spent a few months travelling to out-back places, I can promise the Minister that my voice will be raised on every possible opportunity to secure for the people in the out-back districts some of the comforts which are available to those who live in centres of population. The Government might subsidize hostels and hospitals established by the Australian Inland Mission and other missions in the out-back places of Australia. It might be news to honorable senators to learn that, with the exception of the railway doctor, who travels up the line between Quorn and Oodnadatta, there is no medical attention available between Oodnadatta and Darwin, apart from that provided at the hostels established by the Australian Inland Mission. There is one at Oodnadatta, I have said that one is being erected at Alice Springs, and there is another at Marranboy, which is 300 or 400 miles south of Darwin. Marranboy is one of the worst fever centres in the Northern Territory, and because of an exceptionally wet season in the Territory fever has been more prevalent there this year than it has been for many years past. As a consequence, the work thrown upon the Australian Inland Mission's hostel at Marranboy has~been very severe indeed. If honorable senators had an opportunity of seeing the work done by the Mission for the welfare and comfort of the sick and needy, they would be in full sympathy with the suggestion I have made. A £5 bonus is of little use to people living in those out-back districts, and it would be far better if some system were adopted which would enable them in times of need to secure <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> worth of comfort and medical attention. Honorable senators have expressed the opinion that the system of distributing the maternity allowance at present in force is a wrong one. They contend that those who are so fortunate as not to be in need of the allowance should not come to the Government for it. When the allowance was first introduced by the Fisher Government, I venture to say that the principle underlying it was that it should assist mothers bringing young Australians into the world who were not in a position to provide necessary comforts at the time of their birth. </para>

                        (Tasmania) [8.40^. - There are two items to which I wish to direct attention. I should like to know who is responsible for parliamentary printing. I direct attention to the amount of printing that is done in connexion with the parliamentary debates and reports and papers of all sorts that are laid on the table. I do not know whether' the number of copies printed of each paper is decided by the Printing Committee or by Government officials, but I do consider that a tremendous amount of money is wasted every year in printing. Some little time ago, between three and four tons of papers were carted from this building in loads. Some six months ag,- honorable senators were circularized by the Government Printer, o* some one in charge of the Department, asking whether they wanted certain papers or reports sent to them regularly, as there was a legitimate endeavour to cut down the number of copies printed of certain papers. Some attention might be given to this Department to see whether all the printing that is now done is necessary.
                    </para>
                    <para>There is another matter to which I should like to refer, and which has been dealt with on a number of occasions by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle.</inline> The honorable senator tells me that he is getting tired of trying to induce the Government to do something in connexion with this matter. I refer to the maintenance of persons admitted to </para>
                    <para class="block">State charitable institutions and hospitals under the provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. When the pension was lower than it is to-day, an amount was paid to the State Governments for the maintenance of old-age and invalid pensioners in State Government institutions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has repeatedly raised the question that with the increased cost of living, and of everything that old-age pensioners have to buy, we should be able to do something more than allow them the same amount of 2s. per week as pocket-money that was allowed them ten years ago. These poor old chaps have to buy a little tobacco and other things, the cost of which is 100 per cent, more than it was some time ago, and on this account they should be given consideration. We may very well ask the Government to direct their attention to this matter, and see whether the State institutions could not make available to old-age and invalid pensioners in their care a little more than 2s. per week out of the amount allowed them by the Commonwealth Treasurer, or, failing that, whether some other arrangement may not be made to give these poor old people a little extra pocketmoney. </para>

                        <para>.- As a member of the Printing Committee, I can assure SenatorFoster that the Committee has cut down printing as much as it possibly could. It has to be remembered that papers are very often sent to the Committee which have been ordered to be printed by the Senate. Many papers which are ordered to be printed have to be set up in type in any case, and, therefore the cost of a few extra copies is not very great. The Printing Committee, however, keeps a watchful eye over this matter, and the quantity of printing is kept down as low as possible. </para>

                        <para>. - Attention was drawn by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> to the increase in the proposed appropriation for the Taxation Department. The total increase for the year is £35,000, but against that there are some items which more than balance that amount. First of all, there is the amount due for the payment of the salaries of the Western Australian taxation officer's, but, owing to the decision to amalgamate the two services there, the necessary money has to be appropriated under this Bill. The automatic increments to officers amount to £11,800, and the non-automatic increases to £2,000, making a total of £13,800. There is also the difference between the full year's expenditure for the basic wage allowances, including child endowment, which is £6,000, of. £41,000 for the three items mentioned, making about £6,000 more than the increase of £35,000. In the Taxation Department the number of assessments have increased by 25 per cent; and that necessarily involves additional work. I do not think anybody has discovered a means of collecting taxes without employing tax collectors, and an increased number of these officers have been engaged. Allowing for all the circumstances, I do mot think the increased expenditure can be cavilled at. Probably the general opinion is that some improvement in the distribution of the maternity bonus is possible, but there is very little agreement as to how that improvement is to be achieved. Many people think that the provision of actual attendance and facilities at the time of child-birth would be better than a cash payment, but it is not easy to devise an alternative system. The matter seems to me to be of sufficient importance to justify me in placing before my colleagues the views expressed here, which, I gather, have some measure of support among honorable senators. A question was asked regarding the vote of £75,000 for the maintenance of persons admitted to charitable institutions and hospitals, in accordance with the provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Acts. </para>

                            <para>- There are institutions which are private in the sense that they are not controlled by the State. I am told that every State institution or institution subsidized by the State is entitled to receive the payment. There is an appropriation in existence with authority to pay these sums into Trust accounts, but this particular matter is not so covered, and it is necessary each year to seek separate appropriation by Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> ba3 referred to the printing of parliamentary papers. That is a very old subject of discussion. There have been very many, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> has said, and, I believe, largely successful, efforts to keep the printing bill down ; but there are difficulties in the way. It is never possible to estimate exactly how many papers of a particular kind will be required. On some occasions every honorable senator will want a certain paper. I have frequently looked at the title of a paper, and immediately consigned it to the waste paper basket, but very frequently I come across a paper containing information that is valuable to me. After all, is the item a big one for Parliament. Comparatively speaking, the figures are moderate when we consider the vast amount of official and other matter that has to be printed, if only to be placed on record. Apart from the careful supervision of the Printing Committee, I know of no way of more successfully policing this vote. </para>

The deposit of £5,000,000 was renewed for a period of six months at 2 per cent, from the 5th June, 1921, and deposits totalling £2,000,000 were renewed for a period of three months at 3 per cent, from 1st September, 1921. </para>

                    <para class="block">There is a constant supply of money known as surplus balances, and they are renewed from year to year. The best interest shown in the report is from 2 to 3 per cent. The ex-Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> stated in his Budget speech that the latest information from England was that money was becoming cheaper, and that short-dated loans could be obtained as low as 3f per cent., while three months bills were only 4 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent. In the absence of in formation to the contrary, I can only say that the Federal Treasury seems to be .a benevolent institution. </para>

                            <para>- If more than 2 or 3 per cent, cannot be obtained, I have nothing to say; but it is the duty of the Government to get more if possible. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> was the central figure in a financial arrangement with Great Britain for the loan to the Commonwealth of £89,000,000, for which Australia had to pay 6 per cent, interest. I would like to know in what time the total loan will be liquidated. Is it not possible to invest some of the floating and accruing balances in the Old Country, thereby relieving the Treasury of the very high, rates of exchange that must necessarily be charged? If the Minister is in need of a precedent, I may refer him to New Zealand, where the Treasurer acknowledges, with appreciable gratitude, that he has a large sum invested in London, whereby his financial arrangements are much more easily adjusted through having the money invested there instead of in New Zealand. </para>

I regret having overlooked the point when I spoke previously'. &lt; With regard to the rate of interest that the Government is receiving on its deposits, I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> has already done by interjection, that even a banker must live, and that the rate which he charges when he lends money is not the rate which he pays when he borrows it. There is a difference in the two rates, and that difference has to be taken into account. There is a further fact which applies particularly to the Government investments. The Government, when it made these deposits with the banks, had a right to withdraw them at any moment. They were practically deposits at call, and no one expects that deposits at call will earn the same rate of interest as  fixed deposits. </para>

                            <para>- Yes: but the Commonwealth had an arrangement that, if the necessity arose, it could break the stipulation, and call the money in. The Treasury officials are as keenly alive to the value of their money as 13 any one else, and they made at the time the best arrangement that seemed possible to them. It is true that they did not need to break these deposits, as money came in from other quarters, but they fully expected they would have to do so when they made the arrangements. It is always easier to size up a problem when you. look at it after the event. It is not quite so easy, beforehand, to determine what is the best course to pursue. I think the Committee will credit the officials with seeking to obtain the 'best possible price for the money. They made, in the circumstances, a very fair arrangement. The right to break the deposit, and call the money in, would have been of great value to the country if the necessity had arisen. </para>

                        also asks for information regarding tha period of the loan arranged when I was in London. He mentioned a payment of 6 per cent. I remind him that that figure includes sinking fund. The great bulk of the loan will be repaid in thirty-five years as a result of the sinking fund contained in the 6 per cent, payment. Small amounts will be wiped out earlier.

                        suggested the advisability of investing some of the balances that we have in Australia in London in order to steady the exchange rates. The trouble. is that these balances are in Australia; the Commonwealth has no loose balances in London.

                            <para>- It is not a book entry. The British Government says, " You ewe us £1,000,000." We may have £1,000,000 in Australia, but it is not a book entry to get it to London. It is an actual transfer of the money from Australia to London. It is to avoid the heavy expense 'of exchange that arrangements have been made from time to time to raise money in London for the purpose of paying the British Government. In any case, it is' clear that, we cannot invest money in London that is in Australia. The Exchange market being as it is, we would lose more by the exchange than we would gain by the transaction. I am quite certain, if I know anything of the Treasury officials, that if they could see a chance of doing what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> suggests, it would have been done long ago. When I was in London, it was necessary, because of the exchange difficulty, to ask the Imperial Government to allow the payment of interest then due or two bills to stand over for six months and twelve months. The money was here in Australia, as it had been put by regularly year after year. By the end of the period mentioned, it was hoped that the exchange would have become stabilized. That baa not happened, unfortunately. That hope was like many hopes which cheer the heart for the time being, but under the crucial test, which comes from the lapse of time, take wings and fly away. The hope did not prove well-founded ; but owing to the great consideration of the British Government we were relieved from what otherwise would have been a very difficult and pressing obligation if we had been required to raise the money at that juncture. </para>

                        <para>.- I would like to obtain some information from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D.

I think the statement has been made in another place that a certain amount of stock has been bought in by the Government on the open market at the ruling market rates. It is a very good investment for the Government, and the practice should be continued! As far as I have been able to ascertain, the only two markets on which these operations are carried out are Melbourne and Sydney. If this practice is continued the war loan will be quoted at a higher rate in Sydney and Melbourne than in the other States, which will give the investors in those cities an unfair advantage over those in other parts of Australia. As far as I am aware, no operations have been carried out in Brisbane, Adelaide, or the other markets. If the Government is going to continue the practice, and I suppose it is, I hope it will not confine its purchasing to certain markets, thus giving the bond-holders on those particular exchanges an advantage over others. The repurchasing of Government bonds should be carried out on all exchanges where brokers operate in them. </para>

                        <para>. - The value of the bonds repurchased by the Government is approximately £3,000,000. It is not quite correct to say that the only markets operated upon are in Sydney and Melbourne. The principal city in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil's</inline> State has also experienced the operations 'of the Government, but I do not think it is necessary or desirable to pursue that topic, seeing that the very purpose of the Government's purchasing is to steady the market. The operations will fail to achieve their object if the Government issues a proclamation declaring when and where it will purchase. </para>

                        <para>.- Quite a considerable sum of money is included in the vote for the Home and Territories Department for the administration of the Northern Territory. I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister, and honorable senators generally, one or two anomalies which I consider exist in that Territory. I want, first of all, to deal with the question of the police. After having come into contact with a great many members of the Commonwealth Police Force in the Territory, I am satisfied that they are men who will compare favorably with the members of any other police force in Australia. They are desirous of carrying out their duties to the best of their ability, but I am sorry to say that in a number of cases the accommodation provided for them is nothing short of a disgrace. In several places which members of the Public Works Committee visited the Police Force were living in humpies that any one in the town would not have put a pig in. They are mostly stone and mud humpies, it being too expensive to take iron there. The roofs are in some cases iron and in some cases thatch. The members who went on that trip formed the opinion that the accommodation provided by the Government was very unsatisfactory. There are a number of men belonging to the Police Force in the Territory who are stationed within reach of civilization, at least sufficiently close to enable them to take their wives out with them. It is absolutely impossible, however, to take a woman to some of the humpies that are supplied by the Government for the police to live in. I refer particularly to the conditions at Frew River, about fifteen miles from Hatches Creek, where the wolfram was obtained during the war. When the wolfram fields, were in full operation there were from forty to fifty, and sometim.es more, men working there, and the policeman, being mines' warden and protector of aborigines, in addition to carrying other responsibilities, was kept very busy. Living in the Territory, isolated from one's fellows, is bad enough at any time, and it is the duty of the Administration to see that these men, who serve this country so well, have at least all the comfort it is possible to give them. The Frew River Police Station and one or two other places that we visited are a disgrace to civilization. The dwellings are not fit for men to live in. The duties of the police in the Territory are very arduous at any time. Their beats cover hundreds of miles, and on many occasions they have to go out from the main station after aborigines who have been cattle stealing or cattle spearing. They have to cover hundreds of miles of what is practically uncharted country, and for the whole of that time they are in the hands of the black boy. It is only fair that when these men do return to their main station they should have some measure of comfort. </para>

                    <para>It is the duty of the Government, as soon as possible, to substitute a buggy mail service between Oodnadatta and Alice Springs. In my remarks on the Treasury Department, I pointed out that the only means of reaching the rail-head from. Alice Springs is by camel, a most uncomfortable method of travelling. If a buggy mail service were established it would, no doubt, be more expensive, but the people would feel that they were in touch with civilization to a much greater extent than at present. </para>

Only a few days ago the Government accepted tenders for an aerial mail service between the capital cities of the Commonwealth. Surely the existing arrangements, which include express trains daily, are sufficient without the addition of an aerial . mail service. The Government might very well provide aerial mail services for these out-back places. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the trouble that has arisen owing to the outbreak of citrus canker in Darwin. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hill</inline> was sent from the south to inquire into the position, and he immediately ordered the destruction of the whole of the fruit trees, with-, out distinction, from between 100 and 150 miles south of Darwin, down to Alice Springs, a distance of about 900 miles. Urgent representations were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> to the Government, with the result that the fruit trees in the vicinity of Alice Springs have been spared. There was absolutely no rhyme or reason in the order to destroy all the fruit trees down to Alice Springs simply because fruit trees in the vicinity of Darwin were affected by the canker. This is one of those things that hulk very largely in the eyes of people living in such isolated places. Although they may appear trifling matters to those who enjoy all the privileges of living in civilization, yet to people out-back these .pinpricks become genuine causes for complaint. These incidents prove how impossible it is to deal with the Territory as a whole unless sound common sense is exercised. </para>
                    <para>Another matter of some importance is the fact that this year there has been a great deal of malaria in certain portions of the Territory. Several cases were brought under my notice during our recent visit. We were informed that if the mailmen who travel through the fever-infected districts and come in contact with settlers and drovers on the road were supplied with a stock of quinine they would be able to save the lives of many people who are stricken with the fever, which is worse this year than ever before, owing to the excessive wet weather. One mailman who approached me at the Katherine River stated that, as he had to travel from 70 to 100 miles through some of the worst fever-infected territory, he had made application for a medicine chest, including quinine, in order that he might be able to relieve sufferers along his route, but his request was refused. I hope all these matters will be carefully considered* by the Government, because the people living in these isolated parts of the Commonwealth are just as good Australians as are people living in Sydney or Melbourne. Indeed, they deserve more consideration, because they have the courage to face all the hardships of life out-back. It is my intention on every occasion that presents itself to raise my voice on their behalf, in the hope that I may be able, to some extent, to alleviate their sufferings and remove their disabilities. </para>

I have always believed that there are two classes of people there - one class, by reason of their energy .and determination to make productive those areas that are so far afield, fit for an earthly heaven; and another class, which I do not know how to place at present. I have been waiting to hear if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> had anything to say to this latter class during his recent visit. </para>

                            <para>- One class of people in the Territory are, as I said, a credit to this country; but unfortunately another group, gathered from the eas£ and from the west, have by their actions brought ruin to many established industries, discredit to the Territory itself, and injury to their own cause. Wot long ago the Administrator, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staniforth</inline> Smith, who was appointed by this Government, sent down a bulky report, in which he referred to everything except the one tiling he should have mentioned, namely, the duty of the Administration towards those who have been carrying on in such a way as to bring about the closing down of the meat works established there, and interference with shipping and other industries, all in the name of labour. Then these people talk about no taxation without representation! No wonder Madame Roland exclaimed, " 0 ! Liberty ! Liberty! How ,many crimes are committed in thy name|" These people at Darwin, who claim that there should be no taxation without  representation, pay no taxes at all. They have to be haled before the Courts to do what people in the other parts of the Commonwealth do so cheerfully. What is the Commonwealth doing for them ? It , is virtually shovelling money into the Territory. It is about time this Parliament faced the facts. If we strike a line across the continent from the Indian to the Pacific Ocean, cutting the Territory in two, we shall find that both on the east and on the west, in Queensland and Western Australia respectively, there are areas, as isolated as in the Northern Territory, well settled by an industrious band of pioneers. </para>

                            <para>- Not at all. The Territory wants to be cleared of those individuals who never work, who have been responsible for the meat works closing down, making ships leave the port with cargoes unloaded, and the name of the Territory being regarded as a place for every man of industry and talent to avoid. v We find that in three years the total revenue, everything included, for 1919-20 was £86,000, and the total expenditure £343,000, or equal to a payment of £4 for every £1 received from the Territory. In 1920-21 the revenue declined to £73,000, and the mo[ney expended was £353,000, clearly showing that for every £1 received from the Territory these people who are asking for representation here have received £5 in return. I am "glad that the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> spoke, as he is entitled to speak, in a decided way. It is useless asking these men to pull their weight, or to shoulder their share of the burden, although people in corresponding locations and further south are working longer hours and very much harder, and have to deny themselves in order that the taxes upon others may be lessened. Here is another interesting point. We are paying interest on their debt to the extent of £90,000, which, if added to the deficit,* approximates £400,000 in this blessed region known as the Northern Territory. This is a serious matter, which gives clear proof that something must be done. It is time the Government dropped its policy of "coddling," and discontinued its practice of paying fares to and from the Territory, when it is a place that should be peopled. This and previous Governments - particularly the Labour Government of which I was a supporter - must shoulder their share of the responsibility. I supported the Labour policy, and all those who did were undoubtedly and unquestionably in a great measure to blame for the state of affairs which has prevailed. This Government should not have followed in their footsteps, but I am supporting them in the belief that they will not pander to these people as has been the policy in the past-. </para>

                    <para>The Government should anticipate the future by constructing a railway from Queensland to some suitable port in Western Australia. I do not mention that for the sake of helping Western Australia in the least; but I believe it would be 'an easy means of getting stock from the Territory to the east or to the west when the Territory is hard pressed for feed, and an easy outlet to the sea. It would provide easy means of access te the sea, because there are ports in the north-west of Queensland and in the north of the western State quite equal to any to be found on the Australian coast. It would be a means of developing that great country. The American people construct their railways, and expect the people to follow them, and that is the policy which Canada is adopting to-day. The Government could go on the market to-morrow, and, as I have previously suggested, raise a loan" in New York to enable the construction of such a railway to be undertaken. </para>
                    <para>Let us take another matter. I have been informed by those who are prospecting for oil in the north of Western Australia that the policy of the Federal Government is most illiberal in this direction. Men who (have been prospecting in the north of the western State have reached the boundary of the Territory, and on inquiring as to the conditions which prevail, have found that the Commonwealth Government provide little encouragement for those in search of oil as compared with the conditions  which exist in Western Australia. I have been informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Freeney  that the prospects in Western Australia are exceedingly bright, but those who desire to exploit oil-bearing country in the Northern Territory, where the prospects should be equally encouraging, are hampered because the Commonwealth Government have placed unnecessary obstacles in their way. </para>

I have also received communications recently concerning oil prospecting in New Guinea and elsewhere, which prove conclusively that the Government should overhaul their policy, and give prospectors an opportunity to work in that Territory. </para>

                    <para>So far as it is possible I want my views to reach the people in the Northern Territory, because I should like them to know that it is time they got down to work in the same way as men did in Northern Queensland when I was there thirty years ago, and when the cream of Australia, was gathered there. Those men assisted in making Queensland what it is to-day. They were not the devotees of any Lenin and Trotsky policy. Some of these people in the Northern Territory say that they will not pay their taxes, and they have the impudence to ask for representation in this Parliament. My suggestion is that they should be allowed to send a representative down here without a vote, who should be allowed to blow off his gas as long as he liked, but in the other Chamber. That may be something in the nature of a remedy, although I have not much faith in it. One thing that is needed is the constant launching of a declaration to these people that they must work if they expect to prosper. I would make them do their work, and let them understand once and for all that they are no longer to be " coddled." Let them consider the hardships that are being experienced by the men living in their humpies on the mining areas and in the lean-to shanties on the farms, and who are subject to conditions infinitely worse than they have ever undergone. As I -have said, there are two classes of people in the Territory - the highest and the lowest. They are there to do their work as other people are doing theirs. In Western Australia and in Northern Queensland men are working much harder, and under ' infinitely worse conditions than those in the Territory. Work we call it! The Territory has been under the control of the Commonwealth since 1911, and I gave my vote to assist the Commonwealth in assuming control in the belief that it would be a territory that would prosper under new administration. The men" there, however, appear to think that they are the dog, and we who find the money the tail. </para>

                        <para>.- I intended referring to the attitude of the men whom. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has mentioned, but I am sure it would be impossible for me to deal with them in a more able manner than the honorable senator has done. I do not want it to be thought that the Northern Territory is Port Darwin, or that Port Darwin is the Northern Territory, because, irrespective of how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> can express himself concerning some of the elements in Port Darwin, there are people in the southern portion of the Northern Territory who can express themselves much better than he can concerning Darwin and some of its inhabitants. There are men in the Territory to-day of the old pioneering type, who went out in the early days, and who battled along against drought and all kinds of adversities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> referred to the extreme Labour element, which appears to be in control, and to the disadvantages experienced in consequence of the refusal of men to handle meat at the works at a reasonable figure, which has contributed largely to that establishment being closed at present. On the other hand, I do not hold Vestey Bros, altogether free from blame, because right through they have apparently been afraid to stand up to some of the Labour leaders. Whenever a strike was threatened, and a request was made for increased wages, Vestey Bros, complied; and this weakness can also be attributed to the Railway Department, but to a less degree. There has never been an instance when any fight has been shown by the authorities opposed to Labour. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Frequently the men waited until a boat was to be loaded, and the meat was in the refrigerating cars alongside the ships, before they made their request, because they knew that the meat could not remain in the cars longer than a few hours without being spoilt. It was at such times that they submitted their ultimatum, and Vestey Bros felt compelled to give in. The railway authorities were in control of the wharf at the time. </para>

                            <para>- They were not sufficient in number. Until there is a much bigger population at Darwin, I do not see much hope for improvement in the conditions at that place. At the same time, honorable senators should not run away with the idea that every one in Darwin is tainted with Bolshevik principles. There are as good people in Darwin and other parts of the Northern Territory as are to be found anywhere else in the Commonwealth. I met people in the Territory whom I would be as pleased to invite to my home as I would any one in any other part of Australia. A few individuals have obtained control because no one stood up to them. They have now such an exaggerated idea of their own importance that they think that no one will stand up to them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has pointed out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staniforth</inline> Smith pampered them instead of standing up to them. As a consequence, amongst a certain section in Darwin he is regarded as the greatest Administrator the Territory has ever had, but we met people at the Katherine River and Alice Springs, many miles south of Darwin, who hold a very different opinion of the administration of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staniforth</inline> Smith. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> referred to the revenue obtained from the Northern Territory, and it may interest honorable senators to know that there are runs on the rich Barclay Tableland extending 1,000 square miles in the Northern Territory and 1,000 square miles over the border in Queensland. The big pastoral companies holding these runs are paying from 3s. to 4s. per square mile as rent to the Commonwealth Government, and as much as 17s. 6d. per square mile to the Queensland Government for exactly similar country. </para>

                    <para>So far as the political representation of the Northern Territory is concerned, it would be a good thing if it were given representation in another place. There is a section in the Northern Territory who say that they will not pay taxes unless they are given representation in this Parliament, but they would not pay taxes if they had a dozen representatives here. The demand for representation is not, however, confined to them. There is a strong feeling of resentment amongst the people of the Northern Territory because they are not treated as are the rest of the people of Australia. Honorable senators may be under the impression that if the Northern Territory were given representation in this Parliament they would send down a fiery Bolshevik as their representative. I do not think that they would. I think they would elect a representative who would give expression to their views in a calm and dispassionate way. I am glad that I was privileged to meet so many people of the Territory. The number of those who are refusing to pay taxes and posing as martyrs is comparatively small. There are many residents of the Northern Territory who pay taxes and are good citizens desirous of helping the Commonwealth Government in the great problem of administering the Territory, who still feel very strongly that they have a right to be represented here. I have seen a good deal of the Northern Territory, and I know the task confronting the Minister charged with its administration. It is not my intention to indulge in criticism of the administration unless I am in a position to suggest how it can be improved. It is easy to criticise, but in dealing with the administration of the </para>

It may not seem very much to us to grant the franchise to the people there, but if it were granted on the terms indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">'Senator Lynch,</inline> and they were given a representative without a v6te in another place, it would diminish unrest, and would remove one of the causes put forward by a section of the community there as a reason why they should not pay taxes and obey the laws of the Commonwealth. I commend my views on the Territory to the consideration of the Minister. </para>

                            <para>- The commissions of the two officers were different. The Judge was appointed for life, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey's</inline> appointment was during pleasure. The Government could have removed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey</inline> at any time, but they had no right to remove the Judge. They would have had the right, if their defence that these officers left their posts could have been substantiated. They were never able to substantiate it, and never made any real use of that defence in Court. They put it. up and then ran away from it. It is an extraordinary thing that the very remedy which Judge Bevan recommended to the Government to bring about order in Darwin, namely, the suspension for the time being of the right of trial by jury, has since been adopted by the Government in that place. That was the head and front of the charge made against Judge Bevan by the union officials at the inquiry by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Ewing. If the Government are going to treat their officers in this way, how can they expect any decent administration from their officials? They endeavoured to carry out their duties. </para>

                        <para>. - There are some people who always seem to think that the Government are in the wrong, and they take the side of those who have a dispute with the Government. There are certain members of Parliament who seldom speak unless to point out what they regard as the faults of the Government. I am going to' dismiss the observations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. A member of Parliament is not allowed to pass free comment upon a Judge unless he is prepared to conclude with a motion. That is a considerable handicap, and it gives protection, as was intended, to members of the Judiciary. I do not accept the words even of a Judge as infallible, and there are occasions when the personal feelings of a Judge may shape his utterances. It is altogether wrong, and not in conformity with common sense, to say that the Government failed in the case in which it was recently the defendant. The claim was for wrongful dismissal, but the claimant did not succeed on that point. He withdrew that claim, and succeeded with regard to some allowances for expenses, a claim which was never submitted to the Govern.ment at all. To call that a victory is to give words a meaning which they do not carry in the minds of ordinary individuals. Something has been said as to whether these people stood fast by their job out there. If they did stand as the defenders of the outposts of our Empire, then God help the Empire! They were told by a humane Minister, certainly, to stand fast, but not to take undue risks, and they followed that part of the instructions. They took mighty good care not to risk their skins. </para>

                        <para>.- There is an item of £20,000 for the investigation of oil-fields. Last year the expenditure was £15,000. It would be interesting to know what are the probable results of the operations proposed for the ensuing financial year. I feel sure that the general community would support the Government in a large expenditure if there, was a reasonable chance of discovering oil. I notice, under the heading of " Miscellaneous," that last year we voted £9,000 for the conveyance of members of Parliament, and we are now asked to vote £17,000. A month or two ago this question was mentioned here, and I think the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen&gt; stated that the State Railway authorities had demanded a larger sum annually for the conveyance of members of the Federal Parliament over the railways. As there is such a wide margin between the two items an explanation seems desirable.</inline></para>

                        <para>. -  An intimation was given some time ago that some difficulty had arisen between the States and the Commonwealth over the charge per head to be paid by the Commonwealth Government for the conveyance of members of the National Parliament. Originally the amount was £60, and the States now ask £120. Negotiations are in progress, but finality has not yet been reached. As to exploration in Papua for oil, the Australian Government and the Imperial authorities each undertook to find £50,000 for the investigation, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was the agent for carrying it out. Some search has been made, but so far the results have not been entirely encouraging. In the meantime, the British Government have expressed a desire to withdraw from the arrangement, and have offered to sell their share of £50,000, which was largely represented by plant, to the Commonwealth Government for £25,000. We are disposed to accept that offer, and some means of obtaining the concurrence of "Parliament in that matter will be sought. In the meanwhile the operations are going on as a responsibility of this Government alone. The present operations are .being confined to our own New Guinea. Some geological surveys have been made, and are being made, in what was recently German territory. That, is the information as I have it. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to thank the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> for the information he has given, but would suggest to him that it is a very unwise procedure to provide a larger sum of money for the conveyance of members of Parliament over the State railways than was spent last year. The negotiations with the State Railway Departments are pending, and the very fact of providing an additional sum this year may lead to the State Departments standing firm in their demands. I think it is a mistaken policy to increase the Estimates this year by even £1 above the actual expenditure of last 'year. The Treasurer, from his advance, could meet any contingency which might arise under a new agreement. This vote is practically inviting the State Departments to press their demand for a considerable increase. I am of opinion that- the State Railway Departments are paid amply for the services they render to the Commonwealth. Some members of the Federal Parliament use the railways very little. </para>

                            <para>- The State Railway Department is assured of a large sum annually, whether members of Parliament travel or not. Some regard ought to be .paid by the State Governments to the need for the Federal Government making ends meet. The Federal Government is charged the same per head for each member as is paid by a private individual .travelling between capital and' capital every week. It is rarely that I have a trip to another capital. I may have one or two in a year; yet the Federal Government is paying for my conveyance over the railways as much as would be paid by a private individual travelling every week. </para>

Millen)</inline> and the Government the position as I see it in regard to the present method of compulsory training.^ I consider that the method adopted of training lads before they leave school, and up to the age of eighteen years, when they enter the Senior Cadets, is doing very little good for compulsory training or for the defence of the country. I know that that is a serious statement to make, but, having watched the matter closely, I think I am safe in saying that very little military experience is gained by the boys during the early stages of their training, and that if the training were abolished until they had reached the age of eighteen years it would be very much better for the lads themselves and for the country. » </para>

                            <para>- I anticipated that one of the first questions that would be raised would relate to physical development. I think that the average young Australian supplies himself with quite a considerable quantity of physical development. He leads an outdoor, healthy life, and takes part in school sports, running, cricket, and football. It was clearly shown by the stamina of members of the Australia Imperial Force that the Australian lad is second to none in physical development. </para>

                            <para>- Generally speaking, the Light Horse Regiments were composed of men who came from the country and had no previous military training. They lived an outdoor, healthy life, and when they were asked to answer the call of their country, they very quickly became proficient soldiers. At present the training consists in making the boys " Form fours," "Salute," "Bight turn," and " Left turn " - evolutions which have very little, although they have some, usefulness in the making of a soldier.  So  far as the handling of a rifle is concerned, I do not consider that the boy gets any benefit at all from his training. Although what I am saying may make me unpopular in certain sections of the community, I arn risking that. I think the training of the lads is doing very little good, and that the country is getting hardly any return for the expenditure. The Department is now issuing new uniforms, consisting of a pair of shorts, gymnasium shoes, and a khaki jumper. One can see the boys wearing the shoes and the khaki jumpers to work in, and for fishing, and I think it would be possible to find them swimming in them. The present system of training deserves the earnest consideration of the -Ministry. A lad of eighteen can be quickly knocked into shape and ' turned into a soldier, but too much training at an earlier age, instead of making the lads fond of being soldiers, makes them despise military training. One has only to notice the cases in which the training is dodged to perceive that, in many cases, it is distasteful to the lads. </para>

                            <para>- Those are the people who ought to be "roped into line, as they ought to have been when the country had its back up against the wall. Instead of doing that, the Government took a referendum. It is too late, however, to deal with that now. The whole question ought to be reviewed by the Government, although it may be that many who have positions in the Defence Department are naturally not anxious to see the expenditure cut down. I have no doubt that I shall receive a scathing answer from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen),</inline> and probably from other members of the Committee, but I believe it to be in the beat interests of Australia that the expenditure should be very much curtailed. </para>

                            <para>. - I a.m afraid that I cannot agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> in his suggestion that there should be no compulsory training before youths reach the age of eighteen years. It appears to me,* from my personal observation, that the compulsory training of our lads as cadets goes a long way towards making them what we hope they will become- disciplined men who have learned to obey orders. I am quite satisfied that, in the majority of cases of compulsory training, the effect is good on the lads. I have had an opportunity of watching the development of many lads who now have no distaste for military training; they had a distaste for it when they first commenced to drill, but, after having been at the game for some time, mainly through the good offices of the men who had them in hand, they began to love their work. Although there may be many malcontents in the ranks of the cadets in Australia, the average boy likes the work when he gets accustomed to it. </para>

                            <para>- I have not gone about Australia with my eyes closed, and I am acquainted with a good number of lads who take their training regularly. Although I admit that some of them do not like the work, the great majority of them,, once they become accustomed to it, appreciate and like it. Not long ago I was in the honorable member's State, and met a lad who admitted that he had been sent down to Brisbane for seven days' detention training. When I asked the reason, he said he absented himself from drill because he wanted to go to the pictures, but he would never do so again, as he had come to like the training. A great deal depends upon the staff. I know a good many of them. I think the Department is fortunate in obtaining a good class of instructors - men who are doing very good work amongst the Cadets, and who endeavour to understand the temperament of the lads that come under their care. I should not like to say anything to interfere with the present system of compulsory training for our boys at the present time, because I am satisfied that it is for their good. </para>

It must be remembered that our cadet training, to all intents and purposes, lapsed during the war, because our instructors were otherwise engaged, and it will take a considerable time to get the system going in full swing again. Certainly, some of the boys dislike the drill, but many of them who most actively resent interference with their liberty prove very fine soldiers when it comes to actual fighting. </para>

They absorb a certain amount of discipline, which shortens the period of training in the ranks, and, however short that period may be, it is a help in improvising, as we may have to improvise in the future, an army at very short notice. During, the last war we had some little period of breathing space within which we were able to prepare for the active campaign. I am not 'at all sure that the same interval will be allowed us on any future occasion. </para>

                            <para>- Apart from drill with arms, they get a certain amount of training in elementary military formations - they learn to march in fours and to deploy - very essential military training. Under the new syllabus it is intended to concentrate training largely upon the physical development of the boys. We found that hundreds of young men at the beginning of the last war had to undergo physical training before they could pass the medical officers. Already there has been a considerable improvement in the physique of our youth. Quite apart from its value in providing an army, the better physical development of the rising generation will be of enormous value to the nation. </para>

                            <para>- That is involved, of course. Our military system is capable of radical improvement. I think it was quite unnecessary, for another five years from the time we started, to have a divisional and higher commanders; that all the necessary training could be carried out by battalion commanders. That is the way we started under the Kitchener scheme at the beginning, and we should, in my opinion, have started in the same way again, gradually building up the whole of the existing organization which had gone to pieces during the war. We are, however, to this extent better off - we have at call a great number of young officers with actual experience in the field, and we look to them to lay the foundations upon which the higher organization may ultimately be built. We are starting at the wrong end by constituting a great number of highly-paid staff people. However, that is a matter upon which I am prepared to admit that there is room for difference of opinion. There is another point. The Government would be well advised to go carefully through the Central Administration staffs, and see if some re-arrangement could not be made. I hear on every hand, particularly since I have ceased to hold an actual command myself, that the whole of the administration is top heavy, and, I believe that very considerable savings could be made in that direction with gain all round. It might be considered whether, in the present state of affairs, and in view of the Disarmament Conference,  we could not combine the office of the Chief of the General Staff and Inspector-General, as well as several other offices. In Great Britain these offices are necessarily separate and distinct, because there they are dealing with regular soldiers who are under arms throughout the whole of each year. It should not be necessary to maintain the same organization here, because ours is a Militia Force only required for training/ for short periods of each year. One of the newspapers the other day contained the suggestion that our organization was without a soul, and presumably, therefore, would perish. From my own experience I may state that in my dealings with the staff in an endeavour to get some fundamental justice for members of the Australian Imperial Force, I have at times found them practically soulless and bowelless. I give as one instance the case of a young fellow whose treatment was brought under my notice by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> a week or two back. He had enlisted from New South Wales with his father and two brothers and three brothers-in-law, so the family were pretty well represented. On Gallipoli his father and brother were badly wounded and invalided with a pension. Hs himself also was badly wounded and was sent into hospital, and subsequently a blood vessel burst in his head as a result of his experience. Later he was sent to France, where he was again wounded. The hospital sheets show that he suffered from shrapnel wounds in the face, and that the sight of both eyes was affected. He was also gassed. After coming out of the hospital, he absented himself without leave for a short period, and then finally absented  himself for some time and was dealt with as a deserter. At the court-martial he was not represented by counsel, and no medical evidence was called. He admitted that he was absent without leave from his unit, and gave as the reason that he had heard that his brother and father had been permanently disabled and invalided with a pension of 7s. 6d. per week. This disgusted him and he left. This man was sentenced to ten years' penal servitude, and was returned to Australia.  His  friends, finding that he was a physical wreck, commenced to move in his favour. I have seen the medical re- ports. With one accord they agree that he had never recovered his mental balance or physical condition from the time of his first shell wounds on Gallipoli.. They admit also that when subjected to heavy shell-fire he would quite reasonably lose his mental balance. One would have thought, in the face of such evidence, that the whole of the proceedings would have been quashed. Certainly, the authorities did not deny that the man had suffered from shell-fire, but they submitted that this evidence merely went in mitigation of his punishment; and having come to that  conclusion they remitted the remainder of his sentence. He had already served eight months in prison.  His  people were not content to let it rest at that, and from time to time they renewed the application that the stain on this young man's character should be wiped out. It is clearly admitted by the medical evidence that he suffered very considerable derangement by shell-shock, and consequently ought to have been pardoned, and the whole of the proceedings quashed. I may mention another case of a similar nature, the result of which was very different. It concerns  one of  Colonel Bolton's  own men, who had been badly wounded at Gallipoli. He came back to me in France, and distinguished himself at Bullecourt, where he was again badly wounded. He attracted the attention of his commanding officer, and on his return to his unit a few months later he was recommended to me, and obtained his commission. When we went into action at Polygon Wood a few weeks later, this officer disappeared, but some days later was found in the rear with the base details, where he had reported himself to the officer in charge. He was court martialled, cashiered, and sentenced to imprisonment, but being represented by counsel, medical evidence was called to show that, having been severely  wounded at Bullecourt, when subjected to heavy Shell fire in Polygon Wood subsequently, he suffered mental derangement. That evidence was submitted to the War Office and to the medical authorities there, with the result that the War Office quashed the charge on the medical certificate. In the meantime the soldier was. on his way to </para>

                    <para class="block">Australia, and when the position was made known to me I reported the matter to General Bird wood, and a wireless message was immediately transmitted to the man on the ship, so that it would reach him before his arrival in Australia, restoring him to his proper rank. I see no distinction between these two cases. In the one, owing to force of circumstances, the man had the assistance of counsel, and was able to call medical evidence, which relieved him of a court-martial, and he returned with an honorable discharge, whereas the other, who was not in the same fortunate position, did not. It seems cruel that the members of a family who have done their duty so well should be compelled to bear this stigma, and I appeal to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> to take the case into very serious consideration, despite the idea which prevails at the Barracks to-day, that medical evidence merely serves in mitigation of punishment, but is not a total excuse. Naturally one can imagine the feeling held by the family, and everything should be done to assist this unfortunate man, who is still a nervous wreck, in part, at any rate, caused by the disgrace of having been sen tended to serve ten years for desertion in face of the enemy. </para>
