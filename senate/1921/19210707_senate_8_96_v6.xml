                <para class="block">The object of the amendment is to provide that on the Board of Commissioners there shall be. a direct representative of the public servants, selected by the Governor-General from a number of. persons to be nominated by the Public Service organizations. I wish to impress upon honorable senators the desirability of doing all we can to make the Public Service of the Commonwealth as effective, in the interests of the taxpayers, as possible. In order to make it effective it must be a contented Service. If we give the public servants direct representation on the Board of Management, we shall be in a position to say to the members of that large body of employees that, to a very great extent, it will be in their own hands to make the Service effective and contented. The representation I suggest will be only a minority representation, but the direct representative of the public servants should be able to. do very fine work in conjunction with the other members of the Board. He would no doubt be selected for his merits and experience, and his experience should be invaluable to the Board in enabling it to arrive at reasonable con-; clusions on all matters affecting the administration and effective control of the various Departments, The proposal is- not new, because in many large business concerns provision is made for admission to the boards of management controlling details of their operations of representatives of the employees engaged in them. </para>

                    <para>. - In submitting his amendment, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> said that the suggestion to give the employees representation on the proposed Board was not new in Australia. It would not only be an innovation in Australia, but in every other part of the world, because I have had exhaustive inquiries made, and find that there is not a single instance in which public servants are represented on Boards which have the power to determine wages and classification. </para>

                        <para>- There they have three Commissioners, one of whom is the senior, and the other two act as his assistants. If we established the right of public servants to have representation on a Board which fixes salaries and classifications we would interfere considerably with our existing legislation, in which provision has already been made for wages to be fixed by Arbitrators and Arbitration Courts. When cases are submitted to an Arbitration Court they are dealt with by independent Judges, who come to a decision after hearing evidence from both sides. The proposed Board is to fix wages and adjust the classification, as well as place men in, certain positions. We have already provided that appeals can be made from the Board to an Arbitrator, and in that way the public servants have rights equal to those enjoyed by other citizens. If it is to be conceded that it is right to give a representative of the Public Service an opportunity to assist in fixing salaries, other workers will have the right to claim a similar privilege. Even after awards have been made by Arbitration Courts numerous complaints have been made, and industrial chaos has been caused in many directions. I have a very high opinion of the public servants, many of whom are quite capable of performing this work; but if a representative of the Service were to act asa member of the proposed Board he would be performing duties in which those he represented would be personally interested. It is unfair to give the Service the representation suggested; and, although a member of the Public Service could be found who would perform the duties perhaps as well as any other citizen, he should not be placed in such a position, for the reasons I have indicated. Imagine 30,000 men saving to the selected representative, &#34;What is your policy?&#34; He would have to say that it would be his endeavour to fight for the highest wages for all, and the Lord help him if he did not stand by that. If the public servants were being sweated, such a proposal as that embodied in the amendment might be considered, but as we have a Public Service Arbitrator to whom dissatisfied public servants can appeal from the Board, I ask the Committee not to support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - If the words of the Vice-President <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> are of any value his objection would also apply to the other two members of the Board, but in another direction. These two men would have to fix the salaries of the Public Service they would then be directly controlling on behalf of the Government, by virtue of the powers given to them by Parliament. Does the Minister fear that the representative of the Service would overpower the other two members of the proposed Board ? Does he think that the representative of the public servants would have more authority than the representatives of the Government? If honorable senators peruse clause 15 - which, I am not at liberty to refer to at this juncture - they will find that the question of wages is relatively small when compared with the duties to be undertaken in other directions. The Minister has admitted that there are men in the Service capable of performing useful work on a Board of this kind, and I cannot see that there is any foundation for his argument that because wages have to be fixed by the Board, such an appointment would be undesirable. </para>

No argument has so far been advanced concerning why a representative selected from the Public Service should not have a seat on a Board designed to govern the Service. A representative of the Public Service who has grown up therein would be bound to know far more of its workings and requirements than the best commercial or specialist outsider. A Board having among its <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> a direct representative from the Service would certainly be better equipped to ascertain the requirements, to deal with the grievances, and reorganize the management, of the whole body of public servants. </para>

                    <para>. - My first objection to the amendment is that it is too vague. It contains the phrase &#34;nominated by the Public Service organizations.&#34; Who are these bodies ? Presumably they exist, but certainly not under this Bill. It contains no definition of them, and&#39; has nothing to say as to who they are, how they are constituted, who brings them into being, and who controls them, or whether they comprise the whole or only portion of the ranks of civil servants throughout the Common wealth. Nor is there any machinery provided in the Bill for conducting an election. This first objection, I submit, is fatal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> says there is no reason why a member of the Public Service should not have a seat upon a Board of this description. I suggest that the honorable senator read the rest of the Bill. He might also recall what has been the character of our Arbitration Courts. The experience of all who have had to deal with these Courts confirms that they consist, in effect, of a Judge and a special advocate for each side; and that, in fact, neither of these latter interested parties is a Judge at all, but is purely a special advocate for the interests which he represents, and which has appointed him to his position. If one of the members of the proposed Board were the nominee of the Public Service, either by popular election or by selection of the organizations, he would be nothing but a special advocate for the Service. It would not be his interest to safeguard the welfare of the general public; but that is what we want the Board for. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so, and the proportion is all wrong. If he will carefully read the remainder of the Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> will discover that there is reference to a power of delegation on the part of the Board, so that any one of its members may carry out practically the whole of the functions of the Board. Should there be a special representative of the Service upon the Board, those powers of delegation could never be exercised, for it would be impossible to delegate the whole of the Board&#39;s functions upon one individual solely and specially representing the 30,000 public servants. Should some special case arise, say, in Western Australia, wher.e ordinarily one member  of the.  Board  could, attend&#39; to matters having the full powers, of the Board delegated upon him - the. whole of the&#62; Board would- have- to: travel, to: Western Australia. In fact* the scheme generally would, break down.. If the power of delegation were placed upon the. one advocate whose special .and sole interests were those of the Public .Service, where would be the rights and interests of- the 5,000,000 people of Australia.? </para>

                    <para>. - Had a division- taken place  last night  on this question, I would probably have supported the amendment -submitted By <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> not because I believed it would be an advantage to include it in the Bill, but because I thought that its inclusion would, lead the Government to see fit to drop their proposal for the appointment of a Board of Management, against which I have been fighting most strenuously. However, having slept over the suggestion, I find I am not prepared to support the amendment. If the purpose of. appointing a direct representative of the Service on the Board of Management is to do away with, discontent,, this-; can. only be done by having that representative elected1 straight out. by. all. the civil&#39; servants-,, temporary as, well as&#187; permanent. The interests of temporary employees have as much right&#39; .to&#39; be- conserved as those of the&#39; permanent men- in the Service&#39;. In a pamphlet sent to honorable senators&#39;, the officials of the Public Service organizations are asking us tei provide in the Bill that no permanent official, however unnecessary he- may be, shall be dismissed . while one temporary, employee remains in the Service. As a matter- of fact, there are quite a- number of temporary employees rendering good service in the Commonwealth, some of them having been employed for years, others Having been merely appointed for periods of. six or nine months, and their interests must be considered as well as those of the permanent employees. Therefore, I cannot support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Payne&#39;s  amendment, unless he provides for an election by not only the permanent employees pf the Commonwealth, but also the temporary hands. Furthermore, if the purpose of the honorable:  senator&#39;s amendment is to abolish. discontent, he ought to &#91;provide that the person elected may. be recalled.  Dis-content  cannot be removed merely by re*, presentation.. If the  giving  of repre.sentation allays discontent,, then: the) people of Australia ought, to be the most, contented people in the world,, because; they have so many Parliaments and so. many representatives. The real point, is* how the elected representative conducts1 himself. A striking illustration of the necessity for providing for.- the? right of recall in respect to the proposal to allow the Commonwealth employees to elect a representative on the Board of Management has just been furnished from New South&#39; Wales, where the railway employees are asking for direct representation on the Board of Railway Commissioners. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butler,</inline> who has been freely mentioned as their possible choice, audi who. took a very active part in the recent railway strike, thereby possibly earn: ing a good deal of popularity among the. nien, was appointed to represent their, case before a. Royal&#34; Commission which is . now sitting, but, for some reason or other, they seem to have&#39; become dissatisfied with- the way. in which he has been, representing them, and the executive of,&#39; the union has just recalled him.. Unless <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> provides for the right of.&#39; recall I am not- prepared to support his. proposal. Have not our civil servants been&#39; represented in the past by civil servants ? When Parliament  gave- away the- control of th&#39;e_ Commonwealth&#39; employees it intrusted that- control &#39;tot a Com-, missioner- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> a man- who! had been a civil servant from- his, youth, upwards. I do not. suppose his successor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edwards,</inline> ever did a day&#39;s work outside the Public Service, and all of his six* inspectors, have- been  chosen from the Public .Service* and know all about &#39;it...  Furthermore,  after providing that every person: dealing with the classification: the hours, of work and rates of pay of the public servants shall be a . public servant, himself, we have gone still further and given every man in the Service the right to appeal to a. public servant, sitting as Arbitrator. What more representation could be given.? If discontent prevails- in the Service, it cannot be because it isi not controlled by public servants. </para>

                        <para>- If that is not the desire, what is the reason for the objection to the existing system, under which the Service is controlled by a representative of the other Divisions? I suppose that the number of employees in the General Division exceeds the number in the other Divisions by five or ten to one; and if there is anything in this proposal it means the selection of some member of the General Division for appointment to the Board. I do not suggest for a moment that, within their sphere, members of the General Division have not done good service; but if a member of that Division is selected he will have had no experience of administration. It should be pointed out that it is open to all members of the General Division who possess the necessary qualifications to secure positions in the Clericaland Administrative Divisions if they desire to do so. I cannot see how the proposal is going to remove existing discontent in the Public Service if the direct representative of the public servants is to be outvoted, as he may be, by the other two members of the Board. In my view, it would be a great mistake not to have on the Board of Management one, if not two, public servants, but the Government should have the right to select them. </para>

It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> conclusively proved that there is no mention in the Bill of Public Serviceorganizations, and therefore they cannot be consulted in this matter; but the honorable senator, I am sure, is aware that if the amendment is carried it will be the duty of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator  Russell)</inline> to recommit the definition clause, in order to make all the necessary alterations which may bead- vised by the drafting specialist of the Government. The difficulty raisedby <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> can be very easilyovercome. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> has said that the amendment would bring about disorganization and , chaos in the Public Service if it were adopted. </para>

Iremind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> that the Repatriation Department, and other Departments specially affecting the interests of returned soldiers, are very largely administered by returned soldiers. Do those administrators act unfairly as between the general public and their previous comrades. I never heard any returned soldier complain that they would receive more sympathetic consideration from outsiders than they receive from men who were their comrades at the. war. </para>

                        <para>-  The appointment of returned soldiers to control these Departments has not been attended with unsatisfactory results, a.nd we have no reason to anticipate that evil results would follow the direct representation of the public servants on the Board of Management. In my opinion, the effect of the proposal would be to bring about greater satisfaction amongst the public servants. We would get better service from them if they were more satisfied, and I am therefore willing to give the proposal a trial. If the amendment is carried, it will be necessary to include in the Bill provisions defining the method by which the Public Service organizations shall arrive at  a   decision as to the person to be nominated for a position on the Board. I consider the proposal worthy of a trial, and I shall support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - When the Bill was last under consideration by the Senate, I was inclined  to  favour this proposal: On further thought, and after listening to the arguments advanced to-day, I am not so keen about it; We have to consider who has controlled the. Service in the past. In the first instance, the heads of Departments possessed the . power of control, and I think they were untrammelled. It was considered that, under that system, members of Parliament exercised too much influence with the heads of Departments. The Board of Management is intended to be a body that will act fairly between the public servants and their employers, the community at large, who provide the funds for their employment/ The. Board must be a thoroughly impartial body. If we have an advocate of any particular section on the Board, that will probably tend to increase the discontent in the Service. </para>

                        <para>- Those appointed to the Board will not .continue to be public servants. We require perfectly independent men on the Board to protect the interests of the public, and at  the same time to see that the employees of the Government are properly looked after. Public servants differ from men in outside employment. They will still have the protection of their parliamentary representatives. When a member of the Public Service has a grievance he soon lets his parliamentary representative know about it. We bring pressure to bear on behalf of public servants, and are practically advocates of their interests. I cannot see my way to support the amendment, because I believe that ,we require a thoroughly impartial Board. There should be on the Board one man selected by the Public Service whose knowledge of the Service will enable him to guide the other members. The other members of the Board should be business men who will understand how the different Departments may be run economically. Such&#39; men are specially needed. I feel sure that the 5,000,000 people outside the Public Service desire that ari absolutely independent Board shall be appointed. </para>

                    <para>. -  I intend to support the amendment. We have heard a great deal in previous discussions of this Bill about discontent in the Public Service. We have been told that the substitution of the Board of Management for the Commissioner would get rid of a great deal of that discontent; but if there is to be no representative of the Public Service on the Board, I do not think that we. can , expect to get rid of the discontent which has been referred to. </para>

                        <para>- No. The condition of discontent is divine. Although the members of the Public Service are only human, they still have certain divine attributes. It is urged that a direct representative of the Public Service on the Board of Management might -regard himself as to some extent the advocate of the interests of the Service particularly. We might just as well regard the other two members of the Board as representatives of the Government and the general public respectively. It might be natural for the representative of the public servants to adopt the attitude of van advocate ; but I do not think it necessarily follows that he will disregard entirely the interests of the Government or of the public. I know the difficulties attendant upon control by a Board of Management, and I have dealt with this matter in connexion with a previous clause when I made it clear that  Ave  were not justified in changing from  a Public Service Commissioner to a Board of Control. The Government have taken this responsibility, and have chosen to appoint a Board in place of a Public Service Commissioner. If a Board has been decided upon, I am certainly going to support the proposal that the public servants shall. have the right to nominate one of the three members. This principle has been adopted elsewhere, notably in Great Britain as during the war period great trouble arose between the Government and the railway employees. To some extent they were overcome by the management being vested in an authority, a portion of which was directly representative of the employees. Before the war, when the railways of <inline font-style="italic">G./eat</inline> Britain were under the control of private companies, there was a good deal of discontent, and it had been suggested that the employees should have some voice in the management. Later, when the Government controlled the various railway services, the employees had representation on the Board of Control. The same principle has been adopted in connexion with coal min- ing and other huge enterprises. One of the basic principles in the Whitley report was a participation in the management of industries by those who were actually doing the work. If this method has worked successfully in undertakings such as I have mentioned, I have reason to hope that it will be successful, and very little reason to doubt that it would prove effective in .connexion with the management of the Public Service by the proposed Board. </para>

                    <para>. - I am indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> for. informing me that the Public Service organizations are unknown to him. If such is the case, the next deduction to be drawn from the honorable senator&#39;s statement is that there is no such thing as a Public. Service. The honorable senator called attention to the fact that the proposed Board would act as a Court, but it would not be a Court in any sense, because the members  of the Board are not to be advocates for one side or the other. They would act as administrators or managing directors of a commercial company. I cannot understand why it should be suggested that if one man were chosen as a representative of the Public Service the efficiency of the&#39; Board would be in any way impaired, and one of the opponents of the proposal submitted the strongest argument in favour of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> told us that the men who have been controlling the Service were drawn from the ranks of the Public Service; these men had never done a day&#39;s work in any other sphere of activity. Is it to be feared that if one man were nominated by the public servants and the other two by the Government, chaos would prevail? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> suggested that the members of_ the Board should be selected from hardheaded business men. </para>

                        <para>- If it is , to be feared that the representative of the Service would watch the interests of public servants to the exclusion of others, it could also&#39; be said that the representatives of the Government would support only the interests of those who nominated them, in which case the Service would not get a fair deal. I cannot see how a  . representative  of the Service occupying  a seat on the Board , of Management j would weaken, the authority* Senator:&#39; Drake-Brockman. called  attention to the;: power of.- delegation,, bratcm. . the. clause dealing with  this matter- it is laid down, that the. powers of  delegation can . be revoked in writing, and such: powers are distinctly limited to the. State* iooj. which- they are: to be used- and the object for which they are to&#62; be employed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> said that the member a of the- Public Service numbered only 20,000 out of a population of o,,000,000 ; but he: must remember that many of the public servants are married men- with wives and. children, whose interests are similar. It is absurd to suggest that a representative from the General or Clerical Division would represent only the employees in that division. If a man. were chosen from the Public Service he would endeavour, to voice the best interests of the  Service. </para>

                    <para>.^Ihatve followed very closely the a-rgumente&#62; adduced by those in favour of SenatorPayne&#39;s amendment* and* I have, not heard, anything, that, has-, been. at. all convincing.. This is an innovation, and on.e which. I am not prepared to support. The. Public . Service is a growing concern., and is  becoming a bureaucracy,,, which is one of the greatest, menaces to Democracy. I&#39;  have not the slightest objection-, to any&#39; proposal that will be the means of fmprov-, ing the Service and make public servants more contented; but I do not think this is one. It will be generally admitted that, a member of Parliament is not conversing&#39; with a public servant very long -before he&#39; commences to air his grievances. I do not think there is any likelihood  of the&#39; Public Service ever being- contented, owing, to the particular type of individual it employs. I do not &#34;wish to speak harshly concerning the public1 servants; but they always appear, to be different f rom_ those men who are outside &#34; roughing &#34; it, and fighting for an existence. They always regard their position- as secure. If the- suggested representative of the Public Service  ceased; to become a _ public servant he Would not give satisfaction&#39; <inline font-style="italic">tor</inline> very long, unless the organizations -which, selected him had the power -to- withdraw him&#39; from the Board.. As a member of the Board, he- would ha.ve to concur in decisions that might not be- acceptable to thei Service generally, and there would. then be a general&#39; desire for him to withdraw. The- man- who- has1 to &#39;shoulder responsibility&#39; should beable&#39; to carry out &#39;hiswork without the fear- of-losing - his job. It has been- stated that&#39; the Whitley schemes in England have been responsible for placing men in positions&#39;- similar to membership of this proposed Board. Most of those bodies, however, may be described as shop- committees; they directly concern themselves with, the . interests of an  industry and. the . practice is an excellent one. This Board,, however, will be administrative. Its members should be quite free in the- expression of their views and the. perform&#39;anee of their duties, and should not be subject . to recall. During&#39; the- activities of a Royal Commission-, to which I am attached, attention was called&#39; to the large number of temporary employees in the Service. These latter would have no voice in the . selection of the special representative. Neither would those other servants who, in l&#39;arge numbers, refrain from attaching themselves to any of the Service organizations. B&#39;oth the Parliament&#39;s and the. Arbitration Courts have, in the past,, adopted an arbitrary attitude in laying down that, unless an. individual is a member of the specific union which has placed its case before the Court, he can claim no right to benefit under, an, award gained by the. union. That principle is contrary to British justice. Why. should any man be coerced into joining: an organization? If the Service&#39; is to be represented as a Service, the . selection should be made, from and by the whole of the Service. Moreover, if a ballot is taken, of the whole- of the- Service, who will bear the expense? And would any such selection be really fair, in view of die. fact that the General Division claims the largest number of members, so that i&#39;ts nominee would probably be selected&#39; by sheer weight of numbers ?&#187; The result would be the selection of a man having, perhaps, no knowledge of administration,, although he might be an excellent officer.,, with a wide knowledge of the interests, of. his.. Department, and, possibly,- of his division. </para>

                <para>SenatorREID.  -  That merely bears out my contention. A man so selected from the General Division might be an excellent postal sorter; and he might have a special gift for stating a case on behalf of the Postal Service; but would he also possess qualifications for an administrative post ? If I thought that the outcome&#39; of the amendment would be to increase efficiency, or was likely to provide the public with better value for the money expended on the Service, I would not hesitate to support it. As for the claim that a member selected from the Public Service would necessarily be .;the best possible representative of (Service interests, there is this to be borne in mind :  The experience of returned soldiers has shown that when they have (had to deal with fellow returned soldiers occupying administrative posts, they have frequently complained of getting a worse deal than they would have &#39;had at the hands of a civilian. It cannot be gainsaid that, in regard to the Repatriation Department, returned soldiers are, in the main, the  most  discontented in the community. The theoretically excellent practice of placing returned men in positions of responsibility to oversee the affairs of returned soldiers generally has not proved always successful. In the present instance, selection should be left entirely to the Government, who may be relied upon to choose the very best men from all points of view. </para>

                <para class="block">Service to-day is serious. The public are not getting value for the money spent upon this &#39;huge organization, and I have moved my amendment because I believe that it would prove a step in the right direction. That has been the only consideration which has actuated me. It should be taken for granted that the Public Service organizations - embracing, as they do, as large  a  proportion of keenly intelligent men as any other association or group of associations in the Commonwealth -would take care to select  a representative  who would be accepted by the public as fair and competent. If there were complaints, however, Parliament could amend the Act at any time and withdraw the privilege of the Service to have a direct representative upon the Board. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> referred to the fact that the Board will  be  equipped with powers of delegation. Clause 14, which deals with that matter, provides that if a permanent head or chief officer requires that  a  recommendation of any member of the Board shall be referred to the full Board, that recommendation shall not be regarded as  a  recommendation of the Board unless the full Board has indorsed it. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> implied that, in endeavouring to make out  a  case for my amend - ment, I indicated that the New Zealand Board included on its <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> a  direct representative of the Public Service organizations. I did not refer to New Zealand. In the pamphlet issued by the High Council of the Public Service organizations, it is stated in an explanatory note, that a representative of the New Zealand Public Service is directly appointed to the Board. I do not say that that is not so, but I have not found corroboration of the statement. The argument that no Public Service organization is mentioned in the Bill is hardly worth replying to, because, . as already pointed out, the matter can easily be dealtwith,byrecommitting the definition clause. I think Iwasjustified in submitting this amendment, because it would not be in the interests of the public servants to abuse the confidence of Parliament reposed in them by giving them direct representation on the Board of Management, and I felt that what we gave we could take away at any time. </para>

                <para>SenatorPAYNE. - If at any time we find that legislation we pass proves ineffective or unwise, surely the honorable senator would not say we are not justified in repealing it. I have not the feeling towards public servants that some honorable senators seem to display - I. may not know them as well as others do - but from my knowledge of some members of their organizations I believe that there are in our Service really conscientious men who are doing the best  they can for their Departments and the State. There may be a small minority who do not give satisfaction, but that is not sufficient justification for our having no confidence in the majority. I feel sure that if the public servants were given representation on the Board of Management their representative would render valuable assistance to his fellow Commissioners, not only in suggesting economies, but also by putting forward schemes for re-organization as the outcome of practical suggestions submitted to him by those who have&#39; known the workings of the Departments for many years. </para>

                <para class="block">Yesterday, I endeavoured to place before the Committee the fact that I did not favour the appointment of a Board of Management, but as the Senate has agreed to such an appointment my only anxiety now is to make the Board a strong one, which it cannot be if the respective Commissioners are to retire at the end of three years, four years and five years, and then every five years afterwards, although they may be eligible for re-appointment. My idea is that once a Commissioner is appointed he should hold office&#39; until he is 65 years of age, which is the retiring age provided for the Public Service. It will not help to secure a strong Board if every few years the Ministry had the right to re-appoint a retiring Commissioner, because it might be necessary for the Board if it did its duty to oppose Ministers, and it would be only human for a Commissioner subject to reappointment to play up to the Ministry possessing this power. When a Committee is investigating the way in which a Department has been administered, it always arouses the ire of the officials of that Department, and very often that of the Minister controlling it. Say a word against the Defence Department and see at once the look of pain on the face of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline></para>

After reading the departmental replies to the criticisms of the Economies Commission, I have no hesitation in saying that if the Board of Management were to seriously criticise some of&#39; the Departments Ministers would not be in favour of the re-appointment of their critics. The Post Office was severely criticised by the Economies Commission, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster,</inline> who was Postmaster-General at the time, has replied in a pamphlet which he has issued to all of us.

The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> when introducing the Bill to provide for a Board of Management, which was previously considered by the Senate, urged that the members of the Board should be appointed first of all in the way here proposed in order that if the Government subsequently found that the plan was not so successful as they anticipated it would be, it might be altered within a reasonable time. That can scarcely be said to be a. strong argument in favour of the proposal. It does not say much for the confidence Ministers have as to its success. We are not here to pass legislation with the idea that we may repeal it after a little time. This Board of Management will have very important functions. Under clause 15 of the Bill it may be called upon to take strong action, even against the opinion of Ministers in the appointment of officers. If it is appealed to, it may have to stand up against Ministers and permanent heads, because both Ministers and permanent heads will, under this Bill, have more say in the matter of appointments than they have hitherto had. I want to provide for a reasonable tenure of office for members of the Board, and to prevent the necessity for . continual re-appointments by the Government. </para>

In the first instance, &#39;themembers of the Board &#34;are to have terms of office of three years, four years, and five years respectively. After three years one must retire, and if he has proved to be a suitable man, and has done good work, the Government, who I am sure are not looking for trouble, will reappoint him. The Government proposal affords an opportunity to put a new man in his place if he has not been found suitable. At the end of four years there will have to be another appointment, -and again at the end of five years. The Government plan provides for a continuous Board and a continuous policy, because, under it there will, after the first three years, be two members of the Board who will have held office longer than the third. </para>

                <para>SenatorDUNCAN (New South Wales) &#91;4.53&#93;.- I do not think that there is any other member of the Committee Who can at times &#39;be so delightfully inconsistent as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas.</inline> Yesterday the honorable senator drew a most harrowing picture of what would happen in the Public Service under -this Board of Management. It would lead to all kinds of confusion, the members of the Board would quarrel amongst themselves, and the honorable senator forecast that before many months were over the Governmentwould be faced With the necessity of reversing their decision in this matter. To-day the &#34;honorable senator has been able to convince himself that what he said yesterday was so &#39;far wrong that instead of giving the Government the opportunity to reverse their decision in three years, four years, or five years, he proposed that the members of the Board should be appointed until each attained the age of sixty-five years.Inthe course of his remarkable speech the honorable senator again convinced himself that he was entirely wrong in what he proposed today, and before he sat down he amended his original proposal, and substituted for it one that the members of the Board should be appointed for a. term of &#34;seven years.The chief argument which the honorable senator put forward in support of his proposal to add two years to the term of office proposed by the Government was the necessity for having a strong Board. He wanted aBoard that would be able to stand up to the Departments to Ministers,, and to Parliament. He urged that it was quite impossible to secure such a Board if the members were to be appointed for only five years. But if they were appointed for seven years that would give them an added strength and dignity which would enable them to stand up to everybody and defy the universe. I fail to see how an additional two years is likely to inspire the members of the proposed Board with the added confidence of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> speaks. I agree that the necessities of the situation demand a strong Board comprised of men , with courage to do what is right, but after all the onus of appointing such a Board rests with the Government. The mere fact of extending the period for a couple of years will not tend to change the personality of the members in the slightest degree. If the members were unsuitable it would be infinitely better if they were appointed for a shorter term., because the Government would have the opportunity of replacing them by more competent representatives. The proposal to appoint a Board of Management is somewhat in the nature of experimental legislation, because it has not been tried before, and if the awful consequences which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> forecast yesterday are likely to happen the Government should be in a position to retrace their steps as quickly as possible. Ido not agree with the opinions expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> buthis arguments so impressed me that I am amazed to find him suggesting something so inconsistent with the conclusions at which he arrived yesterday. In fact I have been considering whether it would not be wise to move for a reduction in the term for which the members are to be appointed. But I have come to the conclusion that the proposals of the Government in this connexion are sound, and I think the period of five years is quite long enough., because by the time that has expired we shall be in a position to &#39;judge whether the Board is likely to be a success or not. </para>

                    <para>. -  According to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> my actions may appear to be somewhat inconsistent, although they do not appear so to me. I did what I could to amend the proposals of the Government, but as the Senate in its wisdom decided otherwise, it is my endeavour to make the Bill one that will be generally acceptable, particularly if the provisions in clause 15 are carried out. It is unfortunate that there are varying periods of service, and I would prefer the three members of the Board&#39; to be appointed for the same term, so that they would all retire at the same time. Under the proposals of the Government three appointments will have to be made in five years. A good deal &#39;has been said concerning the advantages of continuity of policy; but that will be largely controlled by the Government of the day. I do not think the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> quite understood me when I was referring to re-appointments to the Board. I was not dealing with dismissals, but with the reappointment of a member when his time had expired. A member of the Board may be doing his work extremely well, and for that reason may not be reappointed. Honorable senators, who are, of course, conversant with the position in New South Wales, know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frazer,</inline> a Railways Commissioner in that State, and who is a very able officer, would not be re-appointed at the present time if his term had expired. I believe that the Government would re-appoint a member of the Board, even if he had acted somewhat leniently towards the Departments. I am in favour of the three members being appointed for a. period of seven years, and to that extent there would be continuity of policy. </para>

                <para>I was greatly impressed yesterday by the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator John</inline> D. Millen and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> which were directed towards the fact that if the three members of the Board had equal voting power there would be a strong tendency towards dissension. I understand, from the Minister&#39;s statements, that in the Dominion of New Zealand there is a Chief Commissioner and two Assistant Commissioners. The Chief Commissioner is paramount, and my amendment is to place the  Chairman  of the Board in a similar position. Although he would have additional powers, he would, of course, be guided by the advice and assistance of the other members. </para>

                    <para>. - There appears to be a little misconception concerning the object of the Government in appointing a Board of three members. At present there is no suggestion <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> give the  Chairman  greater power or a higher salary than the other members of the Board, and the powers of delegation will be largely availed of. Each member of the Board will control a special branch of the work and submit his recommendations to the full Board for indorsement. It is not suggested that in the event of an inquiry being necessary in Western Australia, Queensland, or Port Darwin, the three members of the Board shall visit those places, but that one member shall conduct the inquiry, and make his report to the full Board. One of the causes of the failure of the Public Service Commissioners Act was the lack of power and authority vested in the inspectors. Any appeal had to be from Cæsar to Cæsar. No one can defend the principle of carrying an appeal back to the original party responsible. The Government cannot accept the amendment. What is desired in every instance is the full judgment of the Board, and not that of an individual member. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the amendment. If the members are to have equal powers, there may be delays in the issue of decisions. I have not examined the New Zealand Act, but I know that in New South Wales the appointment of the Railways Commissioners is based upon the same principle as that contained in the amendment. The Chief Commissioner also receives a higher salary than his colleagues, and the same applies to the Railways Commissioners in this State. Here, the Chief receives . &#163;5,000 per annum, while the other Commissioners are paid &#163;1,500 each. It would be ridiculous if the lower paid Commissioners could outvote their Chief. However, if the salaries of the proposed Board are to be identical, each of the members should have an equal say. The  Chairman  of the Board, I consider, should be more highly paid than his colleagues. The idea is to secure a. capable and experienced business man. But how many business men, qualified as I have just indicated, are likely to be attracted by the salaries which have been hinted at ? The amendment provides for notification of decisions to, Parliament, and the same holds good in respect of the. New South Wales and Victorian railways authorities. </para>

In such case, the Board would probably depute one member to deal with the question, but he would require to be armed with the full powers of the Board to call for papers, and so forth. These powers would be delegated to him at a meeting of the Board. On his return he would probably report to the full Board, which would come to an ultimate decision on the matter. </para>

As the clause stands, it merely gives the chief officer of a Department the power to request that the full Board shall take a matter under its cognisance, whereas the decision of the member of the Board may really suit that officer and not those under him. </para>

Where that necessity is shown the Board should have the power to devise means to meet it. Under clause. 27 the Board on the recommendation of a permanent head may recommend the. creation of a new office in any Department, but that does not mean the extension of the staff of any office, which I think is a power that the Board should have. </para>

                    <para>.I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> that the word &#34;limitation&#34; may include extension. The sub-paragraph refers to the limitation of the staffs of the various Departments to actual requirements. We might have in a particular office a staff of ten men, whilst the actual requirements of the office for effective working might require  a  staff &#39; of twelve. In my view the word &#34;&#39;limitation&#34; as used in the paragraph under consideration would cover any extension necessary to meet actual requirements. </para>

                    <para>.-I hope the Committee will not agree to the amendment. The Board, under its general powers, can make provision for the extension of the staffs at any time. The word &#34; limitation &#34; in this sub-paragraph does not necessarily mean reduction. The object is to enable the Board to devise means to prevent the employment of excess officers&#39; in any Department. Imayinformhonorable senatorsthat,during the period of demobilization, it was necessary that &#39;big reductions of staffs should be suddenly made in the Defence Department. The . staffs should have been reduced in proportion to the number of men who had returned. I could not get any officer, and particularly any State Commandant, to undertake this work of reducing the staffs! I had to put a man on specially to go round from State toStatewith the power to supersede the &#34;State &#39;Commandant in the matter of reducing the staffs. In &#39;that way we got rid of thousands of useless men who -were battening on the Department. </para>

In the middle of the period of &#39;demobilizationSenator Pearce returned and I left the Defence Department. I believe he continued the system I had initiated. I want to say that General Ramaciotti did magnificent work in going from one Military District to another to secure reductions of staffs.

                <para class="block">The main function of the Board of Management is to devise means for effecting economies and promoting efficiency in the management and working of the Departments, and it seems to me that one of the very best means of per- forming that duty is to get rid of inefficient officers. No power is given in the Bill to deal with such persons. It  is true that, under clause 64, if an officer appears to the Board, after report by the chief officer, to be inefficient or incompetent to discharge his duties, or incapable of discharging them efficiently, they may retire him, but that clause gives the Board no power of initiative. They must wait for a report from the chief officer, and they may have to wait a very long time for such a report in respect of a man who is in favour with his chief officer. </para>

They may not be in excess of the actual requirements of a Department, but they should still be removed to give place to efficient officers. It may happen that even the head of a Department may be inefficient and incompetent, and, in such a case, the Board should have the power to deal with him. </para>

                    <para>That the following words be inserted at the end of sub-clause (3) - &#34; And if the Board does not agree with the reasons given, it shall so inform the permanent head, and request that the matter be referred to the Minister, and the permanent head shall thereupon refer the matter to the Minister accordingly.&#34; </para>
                </quote>
                <para>I shall then move to strike out sub-clause 4 with a, view to inserting three new sub-clauses 4, 5 and 6 as follows: - .  (4.) The Minister shall thereupon, unless he sha|l forthwith order the approval or adoption of such recommendation report or suggestion or unless the Board shall at his request withdraw&#39; the some, within fourteen days after its receipt if the Parliament is then sitting, or, if not, then within fourteen days after the next meeting of Parliament, cause the recommendation report or suggestion, together with such reasons for its non-approval or non-adoption, to be laid before Parliament. (5.) If either House of Parliament shall within thirty days after the recommendation report or suggestion has been laid before Parliament as aforesaid pass a resolution disapproving of such recommendation report or suggestion, then such recommendation report or suggestion shall not come into force but otherwise it shall immediately be carried into effect. (6.) The Board may, if it thinks fit, although it has withdrawn its recommendation report or suggestion at the request of the Minister as above mentioned, report the matter to both Houses of Parliament either by means of a special report or By inclusion in its annual report. </para>
                <para class="block">The new sub-clauses provide what is already in the Bill, but I desire to give the Beard greater power in bringing the matter directly under the notice of Parliament. It is provided in the Bill that the Board may bring a recommendation under the notice of the Minister, and if he does not adopt it the Board cannot compel him to give publicity to it by bringing it before Parliament. Many documents are laid upon the table, or axe placed in. honorable senator&#39;s pigeon holes; and, unfortunately, but necessarily, the majority are overlooked or forgotten. This measure has been subjected to a great deal of criticism. It has been said, for example, that the Bill will &#39; do no good even if it passes as the Government have framed it; and, further, that the Board will have no real authority to enforce efficiency and economy. My amendments would remove much of the force of such criticisms. The amendment at present under consideration is designed to provide direct means for bringing recommendations before a Minister. If the Minister responsible chooses to disregard a recommendation of the Board, the onus will be thrown upon him to bring the subject-matter of that recommendation directly before Parliament. That procedure, I maintain, would be effective and infinitely superior to the method proposed in the Bill. </para>

In order that the strain upon the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> Staff may be reduced as much as possible, honorable senators have been consulted and are agreed that it is desirable that the Senate should not sit after dinner.
