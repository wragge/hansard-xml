                        <para>. - I am sure that the constant attendance of honorable senators during the whole of the proceedings on the Tariff Bill this week was due to the high level attained by the debate.. I listened with very much pleasure to various speeches made, but to none with greater pleasure than that made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> last night in moving the second-reading of the Bill. It was one of the most forcible and conclusive speeches on the subject I ever heard delivered in this Chamber. I propose addressing myself to the question of the Tariff and its incidence in various directions. This Bill is really now in operation, although it can become law only after review by another place of requests made by this Chamber and acquiescence therein. I do not regard the Tariff ,-submitted as absolutely a scientific Tariff, but it is by far the most scientific and thorough instrument for the protection of home industries ever formulated in Australia. It is not perfection, and while I hope that the deliberations of the Senate will make it more perfect than it is, we cannot look for absolute perfection in this fallible &#34;world. I believe that most of the duties proposed are the result of very long and searching investigations, and of mature deliberation by experienced and fair minds. To my personal knowledge the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> and his officers have carefully and sympathetically considered the very numerous representations made to them by the many and varied interests concerned. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>This Bill contains three schedules. The first is a British Preferential Tariff providing for substantial preference to the Mother Country. I am one of those who hold that some day reciprocal relationships will be entered into with us by the Mother Country. But British Tariff reform is not, to my mind,&#39; a question for any Australian representative. The second schedule is an intermediate Tariff which at present does not operate, but which is included in the. schedule to the Bill, as a basis&#39; for negotiations with sister Dominions or allied or friendly nations for the purpose of reciprocal trade with Australia. The third schedule is a general Tariff which applies to all goods imported from outside the Mother Country. These schedules, including even the first, should provide Australian manufacturers with an adequate defence against unfair competition, and  by the incidence of the whole Bill should foster and encourage trade- &#34;within the Empire as well. I .do not think there are more than one or two honorable senators who will quarrel&#39; with the principles that the Government has laid down in the . Tariff. In &#34; order to give Australian industries a reasonable chance to live, I am one of those who believe that the Tariff should be considered from the stand-point of keeping out all goods that are made outside our borders by cheap labour, and that will come into competition with Australian labour. Unless a reasonably high Tariff is adopted, the home industries will not be able to survive the competition that apparently is looming for the world&#39;s trade. Local manufacturers should be given a fair chance to capture the whole of the home trade, and from this, amongst other stand-points, my attitude towards the Tariff will be governed. </para>
                    <para>In war time Australian manufacturers practically had the whole of the home market to themselves. They had exceedingly high artificial aid in the shape of high shipping freights, and the absence of competitive trade from overseas, but now the world is shaking down again, and it seems to me that the time  has arrived when we should consider what our permanent policy with regard to local industries is going to be. Notwithstanding the artificial protection during the war, the home industries of Australia are not even yet satisfying the requirements of the Australian people in many directions. Plenty of room exists for further development, not only in the estab-&#39; lishmemt of new industries, but in the multiplication of old ones. When local manufacturers have caught up with home requirements, and Australian industry is supplying the whole of the needs of Australia, there will be no reason why their progress should stop. This country, with few exceptions, produces every commodity and raw material needed in the whole range of the world&#39;s manufacturing activities. It has been said in the Senate, over and over again, that we have plenty of coal, and we all know that coal is the base of most important industries. Metals we have in abundance, and I think that with a good understanding between capital and labour we should, during the next . decade, see a large expansion in the exports&#39; of Australianmanufactured goods. The point we have reached in connexion with the development of Australian industry has not been attained without some educational effort. My mind goes back to a time not very long ago. when it was almost a tradition with the purchasing public that nothing was any good unless it was imported, and for goods to beAustralianmade was for them to be prejudiced. My colleagues from New South Wales will, I think, indorse the statement that I now deliberately make, that thirty years ago almost anything made in Australia was anathema. </para>

During the period 1908-18, agriculture has increased in value by 50 per cent.; the production of wool by 100 per cent., and the production of manufactured goods also by 100 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but it includes also the period of very high prices for wool, so that the comparison, so far as manufacturing development and wool growing are concerned is fairly relevant. I may state, for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> information, that the latest statistical figures in connexion with the manufacturing position in New South Wales show that in manufacturing industries in that State alone over 144,000 persons are employed, and are paid &#163;21,000,000 per year in wages alone, an average for every employee, male and female, young or old, of &#163;145 per year. In wages alone there is being paid in New South Wales to-day a sum that approximates in value to the whole of the recent phenomenal wheat crop. When it is considered that the world may have to pass, and I believe will have to pass, through a long period of more or ; less depression, it can be seen how very important our secondary industries are to the Commonwealth. The factory output of those 144,000 employees was in the region of &#163;120,000,000, of which over &#163;80,000,000 was for raw material, most of it produced in Australia. In listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> whom I respect for his non compromising Free Trade attitude, my mind went back to twenty years ago in those so-called halcyon days of Free Trade in New South Wales. You saw a man dressed something like this :  His  hat was American, his hair oil was French, his cigarette was American, the match to light it was Swedish, his collar probably was Irish, his tie was English, he occasionally drank Scotch whisky, his watch was Swiss, his underpants, perhaps, were German, his stick probably was Austrian, his socks were German, and his shoes&#39; probably were American. </para>

Thanks to the very great development of Australian industries, that equipment of the average Australian man no longer obtains.

                    <para>Tariff debates in this Parliament in the past have naturally not extended very far beyond the ambit of the controversy between Free Trade and Protection. . This was quite natural in past years before a good many old economic theories were upset by the recent war, and Tariff debates quite rightly consisted largely of. the merits and demerits of Free. Trade or Protection. Customs duties were regarded by some as a convenient means of raising revenue, and by others solely from the stand-point of the encouragement of local industry. Some regarded Customs duties as anathema and detrimental to Australia, but there is to-day a rapidly diminishing number of persons who, by conviction, are Free Traders. </para>
                    <para>In my contribution to this debate, I desire to approach the question of whether or not this Tariff is good for Australia from a somewhat different angle. Another point of view has arisen, which is altogether &#34; outside the question of Protection and Free Trade, as a result of the overthrow of some of the economic theories of the Victorian era. I remember that not very long ago people seriously argued that the more a&#39; country imported, the richer it became, but, that theory has gone . overboard &#39; as the result of war experience. It is . common knowledge that there is very little money in the world - compared with the enormous  commercial transactions going on between the people of one nation and another, and amongst themselves- and that payments and receipts as between nations for goods exchanged are not made in gold at all, but in debits and credits as the case may be. </para>

                            <para>- It is not quite  that; and I shall show the honorable senator that, it is a question of liabilities or assets in the- form of debits or credits. Of all the hundreds of millions of pounds that Australia has borrowed in the past, we have received scarcely a single sovereign. The whole of the payments that we have obtained abroad have been made in the form of goods or services, and certainly not in money. The greatest war in -the world&#39;s history has cost the nations about &#163;40,000,000,000. The proportion spent by the Allies was about two-thirds of that sum, and that spent by our enemies about one-third. I am wondering how the world is going to meet its liabilities, and how other nations are going to pay their debts. That does not immediately concern us, but we want&#39; to know more particularly how Australia is going to meet her liabilities, and how our debts will affect our country and its prosperity.&#39; </para>

                    <para class="block">Before the war, Australia was a heavy debtor nation, and now our national stock-taking shows a total indebtedness, State and Federal, of about &#163;800,000,000, two-thirds of which is owing abroad. As against that total of &#163;800,000,000, there is only approximately about &#163;200,000,000 of interest-earning assets. Australia is, therefore, faced with a non-interest-earning debt-Federal and State - of approximately &#163;600,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of the whole of the Commonwealth. &#39;One of the assets which is placed against this huge debt is the possible indemnity that we may some day obtain from Germany, but, as far as I can see, if Germany carries out the Peace Treaty to the letter, and pays to the uttermost farthing the claims imposed upon her by virtue of that Treaty, I cannot see- how Australia&#39;s share can be more than &#163;20,000,000 or &#163;30,000,000 at the most. I have, therefore, not included that as a possible credit. </para>

                    <para>I desire to show how the Tariff is going to affect the public debt of Australia, and I think, on these figures,, we may assume that Australia has to-day a nonMnterest-producing debt of approximately &#163;600,000,000. We may reasonably say that on this debt we shall, on the average, have to pay interest&#39; approximating 5 per cent, per annum. In interest alone the permanent charge imposed upon every man, woman and child in Australia will be about &#163;5 per head per&#39; year, and obviously in addition to? . that, there will be liabilities for pensions, repatriation and defence, that will for some years add a considerable amount - probably another &#163;10,000,000 - to the figures I have given. An obligation will, therefore, be imposed upon every man, woman and child in the Commonwealth to provide, on the average, &#163;7 per head per annum to pay interest on the aftermath of war debts. </para>
                    <para>The Tariff we are now discussing will, I hope, have a vital and far-reaching effect in connexion with the relief of our non-revenue-producing indebtedness of &#163;600,000,000, half of which is . owing overseas. I do not think we can pay this amount or attempt to reduce it very much by any foolish financial scheme such as levies on wealth, or even confiscation or repudiation. </para>

The &#39;whole fabric of our financial prosperity and stability is built up on credit, and when we take the total capital wealth of the 5,500,000 people in Australia to-day as being in the region of &#163;2,000,000,000, we must remember that this is not comprised of sovereigns or even liquid assets, as nearly half of it consists of land values, which, without use are only paper values, and a large proportion of the remainder is in bricks, mortar and machinery. Only a comparatively small portion is in the form of liquid assets and &#39;commodities that can. be used so that both public and private economy is absolutely necessary if we are to have financial stability and derive full benefit from our national assets. Land is of no value without use, and neither is machinery, bricks or mortar. </para>

                    <para>I propose giving close and careful attention to the items in the Tariff which we shall discuss in Committee, particularly from the standpoint of what is best to be done in connexion with stimulating Australia&#39;s balance of trade. I am glad the policy of the Government has been framed generally in the direction of giving the maximum encouragement to our citizens to produce, and to export every pound&#39;s worth of Australian products above our own requirements&#39;. The policy of the Government, as explained by the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),1</inline> is broadly in the direction of stimulating internal production as far as possible, particularly in regard to those commodities that we have previously imported, and with that policy I entirely agree. I think&#39; our legislation should be shaped in the direction of giving as much encouragement as we possibly can to sell goods abroad, and to  purchase as little as we can overseas. It : is quite obvious to me that if we can reduce our imports, say, to &#163;50,000,000 a year oh the average, and increase our exports to &#163;100,000,000 in value,0 there must be available to Australia overseas credits amounting to &#163;50,000,000, which could be used to reduce our liabilities abroad, and provide further credits to purchase foreign securities, or use it in the development of our country. The broad principles of the Tariff give encouragement to this policy, and I trust it will be the means of diminishing imports, and thus do a great deal to assist Australia&#39;s balance of trade. The United States of America has been shrewd enough throughout the whole of her later day policies, to see the benefit that can be derived by her own people and the nation from having a favorable balance of exports over imports.  Her  excess of exports over imports during the war period was about &#163;2,000,000,000. But she did not get this in money. Where did it go to? Is it not obvious that it went in loans to our Allies, and, also, that a great deal was used in the repurchase of United States securities, which were then held in Europe, or in the purchase of European securities themselves? Speaking nationally and broadly, by pursuing this policy,,,and_,, . stimulating a favorable balance of trade, the UnitedStates of America paid from two-thirds to three-quarters of her costs of the war. </para>

I am speaking of the facts as they are, and pointing out that America made the fullest use of  her commercial and manufacturing resources, with the result that, ultimately, we may find the hub of the financial world moving to New York. This policy is still being pursued by the United Spates, as disclosed in connexion with the recent Tariff, which has been framed on  drastic lines in the direction of  prohibiting imports and encouraging  in every possible way sales overseas of United States manufactures. America does not want to buy. She wants to sell, all the time, even to the extent of dumping her exports. </para>

                    <para>As regards New. Zealand, speaking nationally again, the evidence shows that during the war period she placed herself in a fairly good position ; her exports exceeded imports to the extent of about - &#163;40,000,000. Canada&#39;s excess exports during war-time really exceeded the whole of her expenditure upon the war. Australia&#39;s excess exports during the four years was only about &#163;26,000,000, or less than 10 per cent, of our war charges, and this, again, was nullified by the recent record imports. The favorable balance of trade in the United States during the four pre-war years was more substantial than in any other country in the world, whereas Australia, in spite of. the high prices for her commodities and reasonably good trade, very little more than held her own. &#39; We have a large overseas trade when exports and imports are lumped together, representing about &#163;50 per head of population. Since 1893 our exports have considerably exceeded our imports, except &#39;for the seven years from 1913. This is necessary if we are to pay our way, because there is a liability of &#163;20,000,000 in regard to interest obligations and for services performed . for the Commonwealth overseas; so, if our exports do not more than balance our imports, we shall be running further&#39; into debt. Therefore, any legislation which will diminish our purchases abroad and encourage&#39; the development of local industry should secure our hearty indorsement, irrespective of party or fiscal beliefs. </para>
                    <para>As I have already remarked, the whole of the loan&#39;s raised outside the Commonwealth have been returned to us in goods, and goods alone. A study of the Commonwealth Statistician&#39;s figures sbfcws clearly that for the past twenty or thirty years our imports have been governed largely by loans raised in London. In other words, when no loans have been floated, the figures have shown a diminution of imports; and, on the other hand, when large loans have been placed on the market, or when there has been a. considerable period of loan activity, our imports have been heavy, increasing almost in the same ratio as the value of the loans placed abroad. If we had a large export trade, and I think this Tariff will help us to get into a favorable trade position, we should establish an excess world&#39;s credit, enabling us gradually to shift the ambit of our indebtedness to our own people, with the result that we would have then more taxable income, and consequently much more revenue from this source. The Commonwealth takes in taxation &#163;40,000,000, and another &#163;10,000,000 for services, and probably the direct taxation is pretty well 15 per cent, of the total incomes taxable. Graduation  seems fair  and reasonable, but if we could possibly by the Tariff and other measures eventually shift our outside indebtedness and owe nothing except to ourselves the load could be funded and dealt with here, and even if we then paid interest to ourselves at 6 per cent, per annum on the whole of the Federal and State non-productive indebtedness of. &#163;400,000,000, this &#163;24,000,000 interest we should have to pay yearly would be taxable, and in Federal direct taxation alone,  if it were specially ear-marked, .would allow a sinking fund of nearly 1 per cent., which would extinguish our debts in  forty years.  Therefore, I am in favour of the Tariff, because it will help us to stimulate the balance pf trade in our favour, and I think most of our legislation should have this end in view. I am not going into the question of paper money, but I may point out that a favorable balance of trade affects everything in connexion with our communal welfare. This may be seen in the currency of the United States of America, Japan, and Canada, where the balance of trade during the war period was overwhelmingly favorable, whereas in other countries where the balance of trade was in the </para>
                    <para>Q other direction, currency has depreciated almost in the same ratio. </para>
                    <para>In view of the facts which I have set out, a Customs Tariff that will stimulate local industry has my warmest support. We have been told that Australia should be self-contained and self-supporting. I would like this country to be in the position of exporting heavily and importing, lightly. We .would then be better off, because we would be establishing our credit overseas from year to year, and it would have to be dealt with in the way ; I &#39; indicated earlier in my address. r </para>
                    <para>A great deal has been said in connexion with the incidence of the Tariff, so far as our primary producers are concerned. I do not believe it is necessary to make a mountain out df a farmer&#39;s complaint that is a molehill; neither do I desire to make a molehill out of a mountain. But I am certainly not going to forget in connexion with my attitude- towards the Tariff that, if by paying good wages in industry, we can increase value and produce in our secondary industries an extra pound&#39;s worth of Australian commodities, it is of the same value to the community as a pound&#39;s worth of wool, wheat, or sugar. </para>

                            <para>- No ; providing we can use it ourselves. The problem of Australia&#39;s indebtedness need not revolve around the question of reduced wages so much as around the question of honest work, and the stimulation of our primary and secondary industries. In spite of some adverse economic criticism I hold that if we want needles and anchors, this community would be infinitely, better off if it could make these needles and anchors here, because, as I have already shown, by this process we would be retaining credit which otherwise would go out of the country and be a debit against us to somebody overseas. In setting out my argument in connexion with the incidence of this Tariff, I am well aware that excessive costs of production militate against Australia&#39;s ability to sell in the overseas market; but I am convinced that the policy of this country should be to keep our national credit amongst our own people, and  that if  we have to go outside we should, as far as possible, keep credit - I am talking in terms of credit and r not in terms of money now - in the family. That is the policy which I am pleased to know this Tariff will encourage. </para>

                    <para>Yesterday the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> supplied us with some very stimulating figures in regard to the investment of capital in our secondary industries since the armistice. After all, our workmen play by far the most important part in the development of those industries. The chief source of irritation and controversy in industrial affairs is the failure of the various . groups to think in terms of their common interests,  and to take account of the natural forces which are always in play. Nothing is fixed or certain in the business world, but there is always an automatic tendency for things to balance. Yet people sometimes urge that things must &#39;be taken in hand, and adjusted forthwith usually by main strength and generally to suit themselves. I believe that the natural resources of- Australia will enable us to continue to pay good wages to our workmen. Providence has helped our capital account by providing us with cheap land and a congenial . climate., The very droughts from -which we* suffer seem, in historic perspective, to be not altogether unmitigated evils. Our . natural resources, I repeat, should- insure the payment of good wages in Australia. The United States of &#39;America furnishes us with a very - good example of a country which is blessed with similar conditions, and which is able to pay high wages, even in competition with the world, so long as its home market is secured to its own producers. It cannot be too often stressed that we cannot simultaneously have less work, more wages, and cheap goods. But the workers of this country can reasonably expect to cash Australia&#39;s natural- resources, and thereby obtain higher wages than the world&#39;s average. </para>
                    <para>I wish now to say a few words regarding our farmers and their position tinder this Tariff. Several honorable senators have expressed their sympathy with the man upon the land. I indorse a good deal of what they have said in that connexion, and no action of mine will be unfair to our primary producers. But. neither will the primary producer be unfair to his fellow citizens. I have taken the trouble to analyze the figures relating to  the production and consumption in Australia of nearly all the products of our primary producers, and I have been gratified to learn that it can be conclusively proved by these statistics that the best market for the man upon the landis his home market. </para>

I repeat that the &#39;farmers&#39; best market is his home market, and the bigger we can make that market, the better off he will be. Take the figures relating to the production and consumption of quite a number of our primary products for the year 1918-19, and what do they disclose? They show that practically the whole of our production in oats, maize, barley, potatoes, sugar, cheese, and bacon, and ham, was consumed in the home market.  What proportion of the total butter production of Australia did our population consume? During the year I have mentioned it consumed more than three times the total amount of butter that was exported from Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I sympathize with the dairy farmer, in respect. to many of the difficulties which he has to encounter, and which were so -well voiced last night by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson.</inline> Our home market . consumed two-thirds of the meat produced&#39; in- Australia during 1918-19, as well as 25 per cent, of the phenomenal wheat crop which&#39; was garnered last season. It&#39; is true that our wool consumption&#39; is, so far, almost a negligible quantity, but our home market for everything else is far and away the best market possessed by the Australian farmer. Therefore the bigger we can make that market the better it will be for him. Under the present Tariff, barley, maize, Coats, bacon, hams, cheese, butter, sugar, and eggs are all heavily protected,&#39; and consequently the home market in these commodities is already assured to our farmers. In the discussion of this Tariff, I shall have carefully to consider whether, the &#39; imposition of. fair and reasonable duties upon certain commodities, with a view to fostering local industries, will bear harshly upon our primary producers. I .agree with, what same honorable senators. ha,ve said that, in regard to the main crops of wool, wheat, and meat, our farmers have largely to compete in the markets of the world. But I believe that they are prepared to give as well as to take. They merely desire fair play, and they are entitled to get it. I believe that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> and his officers have studied this Tariff from almost every angle. But sincere and hard-working as they have been, I do not consider that their decisions in respect of it are necessarily sacrosanct, it will be necessary for us to carefully scrutinize - many of the duties which have been&#34; imposed in another place. I believe that there are  anomalies which require to be rectified, and that a more scientific application of some of the preference duties, for the purpose of assisting trade within the Empire, is possible. &#34;There axe also a few weaknesses in the Tariff caused by the taxation of the raw materials of certain industries, without -sufficient consideration having been devoted to what should be the duties upon the finished articles. </para>

                    <para>There is another reason why I intend to  give this Bill my general support. About two years ago the United States Congress passed what is known as the Webb law, which authorized the &#34;formation of Trusts for the co-operative exploitation of foreign markets. Under that law, American citizens are allowed to practice in foreign countries a form of competition which, if attempted in their own, would be punishable both&#39; by fine and imprisonment. The United States Congress also passed the .Jones Mercantile Marine Act, / under which the American Mercantile Marine can co-operate wilh the Trusts formed under the Webb law in their raid upon the trade of other countries. </para>

                            <para>- I thank the Senate for the consideration which it has extended to me. We cannot blame foreign manufacturers for attempting to capture our markets. But it is our duty to see that they are not successful. We ought, therefore, to do our best in the hurly-burly of commerce to help our manufacturers and. producers. I do not think that the world will get back to pre-war costs for a long time yet, if it ever does. I know that the prices for the world&#39;s principal commodities such as wheat, wool, . rubber, metals, tea, cotton, steel, coal, and fats are not at all steady. I do not think that the pendulum average price has yet been reached or will be reached for some time. But in view of the average rise in&#34; wages throughout the world, we may reasonably expect that the prices of these commodities over a decade, will never again reach the low pre-war level. The cost of living in England even now is over 100 per cent, more than it was before the. war, and it will be agreed that the cost of living has a very vital effect upon the prices of commodities. In pursuing this sidelight of the many phases incidental to the&#39; Tariff, I wish to say that so far as the primary producer is concerned, in spite of the stagnation in the wool industry to-day, he may look forward with reasonable security to an overseas market for a period of .at least a de-  cade with reasonable prices. I am not too keen about making a mountain out of the molehill of a difference in a few  pounds  in price of a certain article if the., purpose served is to strengthen the policy in which I. thoroughly believe, and that is the making of Australia  self-contained  and self-supporting. </para>

                    <para>T believe that Protection and production must automatically attract a larger population. This increased population is one of the keys, and, perhaps, the only key, required to lock up a good many of Australia&#39;s&#39; troubles. In making the Tariff scientific, and as reasonably Protective as we can, we shall be doing what is best for the future of the country; we shall be helping to meet the financial position, and we shall be stimulating  the favorable, balance .of trade. I believe that the Bill is sound in policy, and its main principles will have . my general support. </para>
                    <para>I should like to. say &#39;a word or two fu conclusion upon two matters closely related to the subject of this measure. First of all,.&#39; what is going to be ,done in connexion with the renewal of commercial relations with Germany? I- hope that we shall obtain some information on this , subject before we are called upon to complete our labours in connexion with this Bill. My attitude in some directions, and  to some extent, will depend upon what the  future has in store for us in this connexion. Another matter that was raised by my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> is that of the establishment of the proposed Tariff Board. I believe that the fundamental intention, of the Government in creating a Tariff Board is to make it impossible for a manufacturer, or a group of manufacturers or business men, who are highly protected under the Tariff, to exploit the consumer. With that intention, I entirely agree ; but -my vote will be recorded against any Tariff Board if, directly or indirectly, it is proposed to enable it to take out of the control of Parliament the ultimate decision as to what duties shall be imposed. I shall deal with the Tariff as I best can as a representative of the people.  I am prepared, so far as, my vote is concerned that it shall be final, and I shall not consent to any abrogation of my rights here as a representative of New South Wales. I shall expect to be asked to support legislation in connexion with the  establishment  of a Tariff Board, or other legislation appertaining to the Tariff, only * on the understanding that if it is found that any alteration of the Tariff . as it passes this Chamber is necessary, the alteration proposed must be reviewed by this Chamber before it can come into force. I thank honorable senators for their attention. I hope I have made my attitude upon&#39; the Tariff clear. </para>

                        <para>.  - In rising . to address myself to the second reading of this Bill, I should like to say that when the high praise given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> to the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> for the speech with which he moved the second reading of the measure received the applause of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> nothing further need be said on that subject. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> alluded to the high level of the general debate on the Tariff, but he rose in his own speech to heights I should have thought unattainable even with an aeroplane. In  dealing with the practical business proposition presented to us in the Tariff, he soared beyond the clouds. There was one somewhat surprising feature common to the speeches of both Senators Russell and Pratten to which I should like to direct attention. In somewhat different phrases each honorable senator gave expression to practically the same idea as to the primary producer. Honorable senators will recall the remarkable picture of the primary producer which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> painted for us last evening in contrasting the farmer of to-day with the farmer of a few years ago. He drew for us a picture of the primary producer travelling over his farm on a machine, carrying his youngster on his knee, and smoking a cigar. </para>

                            <para>- Was it a pipe? I should regret above all things misrepresenting the honorable senator in this matter. He told us that instead of labouring as he had to do in years gone by, the primary producer of to-day rides along nursing his youngster and smoking a pipe. Is that a fair representation of what the honorable senator said? </para>

                    <para>He has asked me to quote him fully, but I have already said that he reached an altitude to which I cannot hope to follow him. I do know that- he &#171; said that to trie farmer a drought is not an unmixed evil. We &#34;have heard that to-day the farmer is not a hard-worked man as he was some years ago. He now rides, and smokes, and nurses his youngster while at work, and a drought is not an unmixed evil to him.- If this be so, it seems to me that good reasons have been afforded for increasing the number of farmers, and filling up the vacant spaces of Australia, where men can get work under conditions to which factory hands and city unionists can never hope to attain. </para>
                    <para>We have been told that the farmer, toils from early morning until late at night, and giving all that in, I still believe  that the conditions of his employment are  better than are those of the man who works eight hours a day in a coal mine or in a factory, with walls all around him. The Tariff aims at putting population into factories and mines, and employing people in uncongenial occupations and cutting them off from the more congenial and attractive occupations of farming and primary production. In my view, the people might be expected to develop mentally and physically greater parts if employed in the open air in the work of primary production in the country. </para>

On the contrary,&#39; it retards it. Let honorable senators consider the correspondence which they have had since the introduction of the Tariff. There is scarcely an industry affected by this Bill in connexion with which we have not been communicated with personally or by letter by persons who claim that the Tariff injuriously affects their interests. The stone-masons refer us to the duty imposed on Italian marble which they require for certain kinds of work, for which the local article is unsuitable. I have received a communication, in, common, I suppose, with other honorable senators, in which it is shown that nine-tenths of the marble-workers of Australia -ask for a reduction of the duty on Italian marble. </para>

                            <para>- I might refer to a number of other industries in connexion with&#39; which we are- up&#39; against a similar proposition. Although honorable senators will claim that by the Tariff they are protecting industries, those concerned in many of them complain that the advantage . they are given by the duty on the finished article of their manufacture is lost in the increased price they are required to pay for their raw materials, because of the duty imposed on them.. If we put a heavy duty on hides and a heavy duty on leather, what is the use of saying that we are going to protect the bootmaker by putting a heavy duty on boots? First, we make the hide and the leather more costly, and the boot manufacturer finds that the . benefit he obtains from a duty of 35 or 45 per cent, on boots is eaten up by the price he has to pay for his raw material. </para>

The honorable: senator appeared to assume that it was the absence of- this scientific- Tariff that put Australia in. the; false position of not possessing the. factories,, to produce the- things- that were wanted. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, a marvellous, thing, The Minister- tells- us. that in 191.4, the war found, us- unable, to produce for ourselves many.  simple . little, essentials which we had. been; in the habit of buying from other - countries,, because, we. hftd. established. no industries to. manufacture them, here. Why. was . that, so ? Victoria offered Protection for those* industries before, the Minister was born, and has offered it ever  since. That is the whole  of the difference between a Protectionist and myself. A Protectionist believes that if we put on a heavy Tariff industries will grow, but I do not believe anything of the kind. A heavy Tariff is one of&#39; the things most calculated to prevent industries from growing. The man who gets in first under it. is put in a very strong position.. Take, for instance, -the Sunshine , Harvester Works. The owner, under the Tariff paid by the people of Australia, has established an enormous business and installed great machinery, but, in that case, instead! &#39;of helping to develop business and1 competition, the Tariff has cut. out competition. Who can now compete with the business built up- by subsidies taken from the pockets&#39; of the Australian taxpayers? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> drew a picture of the lack of the- simple- yarn required for knitting socks for&#39; the soldiers. He said! we did- not. mate the yarn in Australia,  Victoria has had&#39; fifty years of Protection, and yet did- not produce a&#62; simple&#39; article of- that, description-.Fifty years ago there was unlimited wool in this State,., and! there has been unlimited&#39; wool every year, since. During, all that* time there was a. Tariff, sufficien^lyi high to induce some manufacturer to invest his money in the production of woollen yarn. Perhaps this- scientific Tariff is a better brand of protection- than the old Victorian Tariff was, but the fact remains that after fifty years of: Protection in a. country which possesses the best wool! in the- world, and the largest&#39; supplies of it, we- did- not* have one industry that could produce the material&#39; required, t&#39;o make a pair- of socks ,  </para>

                    <para>I recognise the apparent hopelessness of getting the Free Trade argument generally accepted, but I am not altogether without hope that this , Tariff will awaken the people, of . Australia to&#34; the absurdity of. trying to develop a country by making&#39; &#39;everything dearer in it. It is said that it is the last straw that breaks the camel&#39;s back. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> drew a picture of the old-time Australian, and all he could buy on 30e. a week. He said he wore an American hat. I suppose; it was a Stetson, worth about &#163;2 2s. now. He smoked a Manila cigar. I do not know whether he carried a cane from Jamaica,&#39; but he wore American boots. Probably his,, flannels were made in Germany, the cloth from which his clothes were made was Scotch or Irish tweed, and <inline font-style="italic">his</inline> dollar was from Belfast. That is the picture the honorable senator drew of the average Australian in the good old Free Trade days.. I think the honorable senator added that he drank Highland whisky. We have Protection now, but with all his increased wage, the average Australian cannot buy an American hat, or smoke an imported cigar, or drink Highland whisky. These  things are nearly all cut out. The higher wages have brought with them a higher cost of living. The honorable senator said the average Australian was now getting &#163;5 a week. I should like to know where that happens. The Government the honorable  senator&#39; supports would not give that wage to the public servants, although a Commission appointed by the Government recommended a living wage of &#163;4 16s. 6d. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> suggested, that, unless the value of the material was given, the information was useless. When I was speaking on the first reading of the Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> by interjection, said that there had been very little falling off in imports during the war period, and I shall, therefore, quote for the honorable senator&#39;s&#39; information the following figures-: - Our imports were valued as follows - In 1913, &#163;79,749,653; 1914-15, &#163;64,431,83? ; 1915-16, &#163;77,521,142; 1916-17, &#163;76,228,679 ; &#39; 1917-18, &#163;60,822,164.- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> suggested that there had been scarcely any difference in the import trade, but the figures&#39; I have quoted show that in 1917-18 our imports were valued at &#163;60,872,164, and in 1913, &#163;79,749,653.. According to the honorable senator&#39;s argument, these figures are useless unless, the value of the material is. given&#39; but, if. we measure our imports by their value in . 1913, the &#163;60,822,164, which was the value of the 1917-18 imports, would not, on the 1913 values, amount to more than &#163;20,000,000, because values, had increased by approximately 300 per cent. In view of these figures I presume that the honorable senator will have to seek in some other direction for information to support his contention. The figures which I have quoted are to be found in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Year-Book,</inline> No. 13, page 606. </para>

No; by far the* ugliest sign of the times is the fact that of late years two words which for half a century have been tabooed in British politics are now, after some whispering and stealthy hintings, beginning to be spoken trippingly on the tongue. These words are &#34; Protection &#34; and &#34; conscription.&#34; They are the words of abomination and desolation ; words that, being openly spoken, should be resented by the . people as an insult to their understanding and a threat to their liberty.. </para>

                    <para>We may assume that this highly Protective Tariff is going to cost Australia &#163;50,000,000, and the people will have to find the money, and, seeing that the Government are submitting such a proposal, surely they should be prepared to show the people in what way the expenditure is justified. Of . course, we shall be told that there will be direct and indirect benefits - some will argue one way and some another - but we should have some tangible proof that high Protective duties are going to benefit the whole of the community, particularly &#39; when our taxation and expenditure are on the increase. Two British union secretaries - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorpeof</inline> the Gas-workers Union and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Inskip</inline> of the Boot and Shoe Operators Union - were sent as Labour delegates to represent Great Britain at the convention of the American Federation of Labour, held in Kansas City early in 1919, and on their return these statements were made : <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorpe</inline> said, &#34;As a working man, I would not choose the United States as a home.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Inskip</inline> &#39; came to the same conclusion. Speaking with . deference to., his American brethren, he is, nevertheless, of the opinion that the workers in England are better off than the workmen in the United States, for while the latter may earn more in actual cash, the purchasing capacity of their wages, for the necessaries of life is less, by comparison, than in England. </para>

My desire is to see this country thickly populated and developed in such a way that we shall be able to make use of the enormous resources at our disposal. If the resources of Australia are to be fully&#39; utilized, the &#163;50,000,000 which we will take out of the pockets of the Australian people by means of this Tariff could be spent in the development of the primary industries &#39;of Australia. If such a policy as that were adopted, we would have, not only 5,500,000 occupying this great continent, but a population of 50,000,000 and instead of looking for markets for our produce we would have sufficient people here to purchase and consume it. </para>

                            <para>- A very . fine Government. It is interesting to note that in connexion with the forthcoming by-election in Queensland this Government are not game enough to send a candidate to contest it. I was directing attention to the results which have been achieved in this State, with its English climate and beautiful land, during the last fifty years. I venture to say that after the first 30 miles on leaving Melbourne this afternoon I will see undulating lands, green verdure, a few sheep and cattle, but no&#39; workmen. When we reach the&#39; River Murray, what do we find ? On the Victorian side there is the struggling township of Wodonga, which has been under Protection for thirty years, and on the other - the prosperous side - the town df Albury, which has developed and progressed under Free Trade. </para>

                            <para>- Very well, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I shall accept  your suggestion. My proposal, I think, needs merely to be mentioned to be accepted. Certainly the Protectionist members of the Senate can scarcely refuse to support it, because if they are prepared to vote for heavy duties to assist private enterprise, surely it is not too much to expect them to indorse a proposal for a preferential Tariff of 2&#189; per cent, in respect of goods carried in our own ships, especially in view of the attempts which have been made in England to interfere with cargo offering for the Commonwealth vessels. My proposal is really mixing patriotism with business. I do not like doing that usually, but if we are prepared to tax the people of Australia to the extent of &#163;30,000,000 for the benefit of private enterprise, surely we can adopt this concession in the interests of our shipping enterprise? If it is adopted, there will be the further advantage that the loading . and unloading of cargo in the Commonwealth ships will be under -the supervision of our own officers, and there is not likely to be any difficulty in the matter of carrying goods at other than correct schedule rates. </para>

                            <para>- This being a scientific Tariff, its. purpose of course is to prevent trade with the rest of the world, and to oblige people of the Commonwealth to do everything for themselves. There is no desire according to this Tariff to take advantage of the labour-saving devices and industrial organization of the teeming millions of England, America, France, or Germany. Protectionists say they do not want any of these advantages at all. They want to put a ring fence around Australia to shut out commodities from other countries in order that we may employ only our own people. If Protectionists are prepared to go to that extent, surely they are willing to do something for ships that have been paid for by Australian people, and which are controlled by Commonwealth officials. My proposal appears to me to be so reasonable as to need no argument. -If goods in . ships owned by the shipping companies are entered for duty at 5 per cent., we simply say to the consignees, &#34; If these goods are carried in an Australian-owned ship the duty will be only2&#189; per cent.&#34; That is a simple, straightforward proposal, and one which I think the Senate might well accept. </para>

                    <para>The Senate, we believe, is composed largely of the best intelligence of the community. Its Protectionist members claim to* be well informed. I do not care to say very much about the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> and so I shall let the praise uttered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> stand. The Protectionist case was well put. I, do not mind telling the Minister that I was thrilled by some of his eloquent passages concerning the capacity and skill of the Australian workman. I think my chest expanded at least two inches while he was&#39; referring to the achievements of Australians in the field of sport, and by our mechanics and engineers in industrial affairs. Of course he did not say it, but he rather inferred that in his opinion Australian workmen were very much better than those of any other country, and therefore I can hardly understand why . it is. necessary in this Tariff to handicap, say, the Japanese workman with a duty of 45 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- I think the Economies Commission ought to look into this matter of dumping, and I suggest that if there is any objection to it, the Government might allow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> and myself to take charge of all the dumped goods, which, no doubt, are the things we want in Australia. This talk about dumping goods is the kind of material to &#34;feed Protectionists with. America, under Protection, can give an example to the world of almost any kind of legislation. Only the other day a representative of an American firm travelling through pur States discovered a very capable young man, and induced him to go to America to help in a business in which he had been engaged in Australia; but so many obstacles were placed in his way that, -before he got free from  the American authorities, he contracted a disease from which he died. , It appears he was being kept back by some interested persons, and I remember reading a memorial to the American  President  referring to the ill-treatment of an Australian citizen. What are the anti-dumping laws of America? They are designed to prevent competition from outside, which the Tariff of that country fails to prevent. The Tariff- of the United States of America, though a high one, still leaves the American manufacturer open&#39; to the competition of &#39; the world. </para>

                        Earle, during the course of his remarks, supplied us with a long list of figures with a view to showing what the Australian workmen &#34;have lost in strikes. I propose to give the Senate some statistics showing what the Australian workmen will pay under our Customs Tariff. For this purpose I shall assume that the produce of our factories is sold at a reasonable profit upon the cost of production plus the Tariff.

I shall take,- as an average, 22&#189; per cent. The value of ten years&#39; production in this particular line amounts to &#163;14,471,454, upon which that duty would represent &#163;3,278,577. Upon other machinery our British preferential Tariff ranges from 27&#189; per cent, to 30 per cent. Taking 25 per cent, as the average duty, that would mean upon &#163;321,129,958, which represents the value of ten years&#39; production, the sum of &#163;80,282,487. Coming to boots and shoes, our present British preferential Tariff ranges up to 40 per cent., but I will take it at an average of 35 per cent. As the value of ten years&#39; production under this heading is &#163;43,008,077, that rate of duty represents a payment of &#163;15,052,827. Upon leather, the duty under our British preferential Tariff ranges from 25 per cent, to 35 per cent. Taking the average as 30 per cent., and the value of ten years&#39; production at &#163;30,536,249, obviously that duty represents the payment of &#163;9,160,874. Upon woollens the duty under our British preferential Tariff is 30 per cent. Taking 25 per cent, as an average during the first five years of the present decade and 30 per cent, as the average during the remaining five years, as the value of ten years&#39; production under this heading amounts to &#163;11,965,752, those duties represent payments of &#163;943,652 and &#163;2,457,343 respectively. Upon sugar our present British preferential Tariff is &#163;6 per ton, and upon the value of ten years&#39; production that represents a payment of &#163;21,574,213. The total Tariff payments, therefore, in connexion with the six industries which I have mentioned &#39; during a period of ten years amounts to the formidable sum of &#163;132,749,973. That is what the workers of Australia have to pay for Protection. </para>

                            <para>- We have also, to remember that the cost of Protection is a recurring cost. It is true that a strike this year may involve a loss of millions sterling, but under a . Protective Tariff the fleecing of the workers continues day after day and year after year. That is my reply to the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle.</inline></para>

                    <para>I have already directed attention to the fact that .  the average duty which the manufacturers of Great Britain will be required to pay under our Tariff is 22-&#189; per cent. Yet the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> had the temerity to emphasize the preference that we are extending to Britain . It is true that we admit cocoa-nuts free, but Great Britain does not produce any. When, however, it comes to the admission of motor cars, woollen goods, and agricultural machinery, we say to the manufacturers of the Old Country, &#34; We cannot be as generous towards you in respect of these goods as we are in the matter of cocoanuts!&#34; </para>

                    <para>Referring to timber, we have heard Tasmanians claiming that we should put a tax upon the rest of Australia because there are a few little forests of timber in Tasmania. We have some valuable timbers in New. South &#39; Wales, and I can speak on the subject of timber as a practical builder. I served a master for five years, and carried out exactly the terms of an indenture which, as closely as possible, represented slavery in a free country like this. I undertook to serve the interests of my master day and night, and to obey his lawful orders day and  night. Having served for five years under an indenture of that kind, I developed so far that I dared to make up estimates and put in tenders for buildings myself . I have seen my own father, as a wheelwright, -many a time cut his own timber, and often helped him to make waggons and wheels. I can pose, shall I say, as a &#34;scientist&#34; on timber, and I hold that for building purposes there is no timber in Australia equal to American Oregon. </para>

For fitting and joinery we have in Australia some of the most magnificent timbers to be found in any part of the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> has said that Australian timber is good enough for his building. I have never seen the inside of the honorable senator&#39;s house, but I say that if the ceiling joists are of hardwood from Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales, or Western Australia, and his ceilings are plain lath and plaster ceilings, they will not be up for two years before every, ceil-  ing in his house is cracked. If the ceiling joists are of American Oregon there should not be a crack in them. </para>

If you have a ceiling with an ordinary span of . 16 feet, with laths nailed on to hardwood joists and plaster put up on to the laths, the ceiling will be so heavy in itself that the timber will warp and twist, and the plaster is sure to crack. </para>

                            <para>- There may have been a slight increase in their wages,, but it has not, ; I think, been material. Notwithstanding years of Protection and&#39; the operation of this scientific instrument, - the prices charged for timber in Australia, to-day are- exorbitant. I do not deny that it is possible, to find pine- in some places which, for certain purposes, might take the place of American pine. But for general: utility there is no Australian pine equal to Oregon, and it would be a distinct advantage to import. as much as possible of it.  It is useless to compare with it Australian timbers, because they may be better adapted to other purposes. </para>

                    <para>Protectionists are looking forward to the day when,, to use their own phrase, we shall, in Australia, be &#34; self-contained,&#34; and will not require, to import any goods from other countries of the world. When we reach that stage and we desire to send the products or manufactures of Australia to other countries of the . world, ships will have to come empty from those countries to load up with our exports. This will mean double- freights on our exports. I do not believe that Free Trade will bring about the millennium any more than do other honorable senators. I believe that there will be poverty in Free Trade as well as in Protectionist countries, because neither Free Traders nor Protectionists will tackle the problem of giving the worker what he earns. But Free Trade will remove the barriers to trade set up by Protection. We want shipping to come here from other parts of the world.&#39; If we were self-contained and produced everything we required, the people of other countries would have to send empty ships to Australia to take our wheat. My idea is that we should try to get our goods to market as cheaply as possible, and we can only do that by encouraging trade with other countries of the world. I indulge no racial &#39;animosities, and if men of another race and country produce goods which the people of Australia are willing to buy, I consider that it- is a reasonable policy that we should be prepared to trade with them, irrespective of colour or creed. </para>
                    <para>These are, perhaps, my last observations in this chamber for the next week or two. I hope that honorable senators will direct their energies to the removal of the duties imposed on machinery required for the mining and agricultural industries. I especially plead with honorable senators that, if they are concerned about the defence of their country, they should be careful to strike out&#39; all duties proposed on motor traction, in order that we may have the greatest assistance to* our defence by admitting freely to this country, and at once, as much motor traction as possible. Holding the views to which I have given expression, I content myself with having spoken on the first and second readings of this measure. </para>

                            <para>- The interjections do not in any way affect what I have said. The amendment deals with a question that is not one of taxation, nor is it a question of Customs duties. Whether the reference is to a particular line of boats is immaterial, because the fact remains that the amendment deals with something other than taxation, or Customs duties. I know that many Presidents, including yourself, have said that it is not their duty to interpret the Constitution, but I take it that the Constitution is really a part of our Standing Orders, because it is the parent of our Standing Orders. It is the root from which the tree of our Standing Orders grows, and, therefore, we1 are governed by the Constitution as if it were part of our Standing Orders. For instance, no honorable senator can move an amendment to this Bill. That is because it is so provided in&#34; the Constitution. Neither can we move to reduce or increase an item by way of amendment. We must do it by way of request in this particular class of Bill. I submit, therefore, that the  President  is bound to take notice of this particular prohibition in the Constitution, just as he is bound to take notice of the other prohibition that alterations in this Bill must be made by request and not by direct amendment. This point is of great importance also, because if the course&#39; proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator&#39; Gardiner</inline> is in order - no matter whether his proposal passes or not - the fact that the Senate has allowed the question to be discussed and to be put from the Chair will have established the principle that the Senate can, in a Bill to impose duties of Customs, tack on provisions affecting some other matter whether it is freight, shipping, or &#39; anything else. Clearly, that cannot be said of the preferential duties. In that case it is&#39; simply a question of the place of origin&#39; of the goods which are the subject of the duty, and that is clearly relevant to the duty itself. But to say that if goods are carried in a ship owned by a certain firm or by the Commonwealth they shall carry a differential rate of duty is, I think, going beyond the scope of the Bill and comes into direct conflict with the prohibition of section 55 of the Constitution. If the Senate were to accept an unconstitutional position or procedure, it would be bound to lose in the long run. If this proposal, could be passed, and the Bill came  into law and - was found to be in conflict with the Constitution, it could be declared by the High Court to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> Therefore, it would be extremely unwise for the Senate, in its procedure, to adopt anything that is in conflict with the Constitution. As the Senate is the guardian of its own procedure, I submit the point of order in order that we may obtain your view thereon. It is a matter of such importance that it should not go without being challenged. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think much time need be taken up in deciding this point of order, because it has been more than once decided already in the Senate. It is my plain duty to follow out the practice of the Senate, and I do so the more readily because it coincides with what, in my view, is the clear interpretation of both the Constitution and the Standing Orders. It is quite true, as the Minister for Defence has said, that section 55 cf the Constitution &#39; provides that laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the  imposition of taxation. That provision was put into the Constitution for the protection of the Senate, in order that nothing in the shape of a tack, ais it has been called in .other Legislatures, should be at- . tempted in an effort to coerce the Senate into doing something which it would hot otherwise do. That is the specific purpose for which that provision was included in the Constitution.&#39; I fail to see, then, how the Senate, by deliberately preferring a request, as it is entitled to do, will abrogate any of its own rights in that regard, more particularly as, in my view, it is not tacking anything on to the Bill. It is merely imposing a condition. This Bill is full of conditions attached to the Tariff. Not only can Parliament prescribe those conditions, but it is laid down that the Minister can prescribe them. Honorable senators will find the words &#39; &#39; as prescribed by the Minister &#34; in various items. Surely if the Minister has the right to impose conditions in regard to the Tariff the Senate or Parliament has the right to prescribe them. My ruling would, therefore, be that this proposal is not tacking any extraneous matter on to the Tariff. Above and beyond that, there is in the </para>

                    <para class="block">That is plain and mandatory language. The Senate must have the power to do what is there stated, and I hold that that provision in itself gives the Senate the right to make almost any request that it wishes. We are not seeking, and, indeed, have no power, to tack on to this Bill anything that is extraneous or not relevant to the Bill. The utmost we can do is to request the House of Representatives to do something. In the session of 1906, it is recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Notes on the Practice and Procedure of the Senate in Relation to A&#39;p&#39;pro&#39;priation, Tarnation, and Other Money Billa,</inline> that a Bill which  came  before the Senate for imposing duties of Customs on agricultural machinery contained, - in addition, a clause for regulating the prices at which manufacturers of such machinery should sell their goods. The point was taken &#34;That the Bill was not in order, and could not be proceeded with in the Senate, as it dealt with a matter other than the imposition of duties of Customs, and to that extent violated the provision of the Constitution that &#39; laws imposing duties of Customs shall deal with duties of Customs only That will be found recorded at page 5949 of volume 35 of the Parliamentary debates. After a lengthy debate on the question, the then  President  - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker - declined to rule the Bill out of order, basing his decision on the following ruling laid down by himself in the early days of the Senate, which had been accepted ever since by the Senate - </para>

                        <para>It does not seem to me that I should from the Chair undertake the responsibility of interpreting all the provisions of the Constitution. The Constitution itself has provided for a tribunal, the High Court, which, after argument and consideration such as would be impossible and undesirable in this Senate,- is empowered to finally determine its meaning in most of the cases which will arise. It is my duty to interpret and determine the Standing Orders, and to regulate the procedure &#39;of the Senate, and, perhaps, to interpret the Constitution so far as the conduct of the business of the Senate is concerned. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is recorded at page 5967 of volume 35&#39; of the Parliamentary Debates. The then  President  further stated Chat he did not think he should undertake the responsibility of ruling the Bill out of order, but that if the clause to which exception was taken ought not to be in the Bill, it was for the Senate in Committee to vote it out. In Committee, .as recorded at page 5968 of the same volume, it was moved to amend clause 4, whereupon the  Chairman  ruled that as the Bill was a taxation measure the method of procedure should be by way of request. From this course the Committee dissented, and the matter, was referred to the  President,  but as the point at issue in that case was not the same as the one now before the Senate, it is not necessary to quote the record further. It has been ruled by the  President  over and over again that, except so far as it related to the rights and proceedings of the Senate, the Presiding Officer of the Senate was not the proper person to interpret the Constitution, but that where there is a clear direction in the Constitution as to the powers of the Senate, that direction overrides any standing order or practice of the Parliament. We are bound by the terms of the Constitution, and the Constitution clearly provid.es that it is the right of the Senate to return a Bill of this character to the House of Representatives at any - time  with a request.

                        <para>. - One of the noticeable features of this interesting debate is the amount of discussion that has taken place on what may. be termed the definition of Protection. We have heard .the terms &#34; High Protectionist &#34; and. d&#39; Scientific Protectionist &#34; used. I do not propose to use any qualifying words -to explain what sort of a Protectionist I am in order to define -my position. To me &#39;the object to be attained in framing a Tariff, and this is how I propose to approach this Tariff, is to find in what way the industries of Australia can be developed up to the very highest capacity, and to proceed along those .lines as far as is within our power. When that object is attained, we shall have done something to promote the best interests of the country. Production is the cry of the hour, and members of all parties, both Protectionists and Free Traders, have joined in the chorus for more and more production. That is, briefly, my position, and I shall make it more definite as I go on, although I recognise at this stage that we can only indicate in a general way what our views are on- the fiscal question. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was speaking, I interjected, and a further interjection was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> in which he questioned the possibility of science having anything to do with the Tariff. He seemed to think it was a ridiculous idea that England&#39;s Free Trade policy had helped the chemists of Germany to capture for Germany the trade for aniline dyes. I want to bring this argument right home to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> because, strange to say, no two politicians in Australia today have more responsibility on their shoulders for driving the aniline dye trade into German hands than those two. Free Trade members.. That may seem a strange statement to make, but I shall endeavour to prove it beyond any doubt. Senators Gardiner and Thomas were members of the Free Trade Parliament of New South Wales many years ago, when the Free Trade Administration of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid abolished the duty on kerosene oil. That action did a great deal to help the aniline dye industry of Germany. It may seem a far cry from Free&#39; Trade New South Wales to Protectionist Germany, but that is ah absolute fact, and this is how it came about. The well-known Joadja seam of coal in New South Wales, was the raw product . from which a very excellent kerosene oil, in which&#39; New South Wales had a most remunerative trade, was produced.. There was a duty . on kerosene, which &#39; projected that New South Wales product,  , but &#39; the Reid Administration struck it off. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> were members of the State Parliament when the &#39;duty was removed from kerosene oil. I was living in New South Wales at the time, and unless my memory is at fault, I think they supported the Free Trade Government in doing this thing. What was the result? A most useful and profitable industry which was giving employment to a large number of men was immediately destroyed, and the works closed down. Any one visiting that locality to-day will see houses, substantial public halls, and churches built of Hawksburn sandstone crumbling &#39; to decay. They will also see great rows of oil retorts - numbering about sixty-four - and long lines of oil pipes, which were used to reticulate the oil from one part of the works to another, lying idle. What was the next tragedy in this unfortunate drama ? Although the retorts were closed, and the distillation of oil ceased, the miners continued to raise the shale and export it. Such a thing had never been known before. The shale was raised and shipped to Germany, where it was afterwards utilized by scientists and chemists&#39; in connexion with the aniline dye industry. We can charge the two honorable senators I have mentioned with assisting in that direction. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not, but it was a blind blunder on the part of Free Traders. .There was a shocking lack of foresight, and when attention is directed to such blunders these Free Traders, in their old age, ought to profit by the failures of the past. In spite of their years of experience, however, they are prepared to go on. blundering so long as they have an opportunity of&#39; destroying industries. In this particular instance we can see what Australia has lost. The cheap oil coming from America at that time was being dumped into Australia at such a low rate that it was impossible for any similar industry in Australia to make any headway in competition with the imported product. It is quite true that for a while New South Wales under a Free Trade policy continued to obtain supplies of kerosene  at  a reasonably cheap rate, but that did not continue. New South Wales, in common with other parts of the Commonwealth, is now paying enormous prices for imported kerosene, whereas if the New South Wales&#39; Government had continued to develop their deposits prices could have been modified to a large extent, because they were producing themselves. The free ports of Britain provided a market for German aniline dyes, which killed an old industry in England. The Free Traders of New South Wales killed another established industry in this country, and supplied shale, the raw material for aniline dyes, to the Germans. Unless these two Free Traders and those who supported them are prepared to adopt a different policy, an9 assist in building up the  kerosene shale industry in Australia, there is no hope of ns ever obtaining supplies at a reasonable price from America or any other country. </para>

I am not certain that, during the many years I have been associated with the honorable senator, his presence in public life has added a great deal to my personal comfort; but I still find a great deal of satisfaction in knowing, despite the fact that we have always been political opponents,&#39; that we are still friends. I can sincerely shake him by- the hand, and wish him good luokj and I am sure honorable senators would like&#39; to &#39; take the opportunity .

                        <para>.- I am very much obliged to the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> for the few kindly words he has uttered. Although it is thirty years since I entered the public life of Australia, thanks to the good judgment of the electors, I have not been continuously in Parliament, as &#39;they have given me an opportunity of a little relaxation on one or two occasions. Thirty years have passed since the 14th July, 1891, when the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph. Cook)</inline> and I were first returned as members of Parliament. I cannot claim the same unbroken record as the present Leader of the Government in another place; but I never once went out regretting the attitude I had adopted, and. when I was returned, I never altered my policy &#39; or opinions in the slightest degree. The Minister for Repatriation has said that on occasions my presence in Parliament has not always added to his comfort, and I can only Bay that I have often found&#39; that his presence has not added to mine. I look upon the Senate as a club, and however strenuous and bitter our political, fights may be, party, warfare is soon forgotten when we leave this chamber. I thank the Minister for his kindly references, and I trust that the good feeling which at present . prevails will always continue. </para>

Although he stands alone in the Senate, he must not think that those on this side have other than the kindest feelings towards him. </para>
