                    <para>. - This clause makes provision for furlough and allowances in lieu of furlough. An officer on retirement is to be entitled to one and a half months' full salary or three months half salary in respect of each five years of service after he has served twenty years. In clause 64, provision is made under which an officer may be reduced to a lower grade at a lower rate of salary than he has been receiving. In such a case, the effect of using the word " salary " in this clause would be that on retirement his allowances in lieu of furlough would be based on the reduced salary of the lower grade position which he was occupying at the time. Suppose that after eighteen years' service an officer were reduced, under clause 64, to a lower grade, and that after serving two years in that lower grade he retired and claimed his furlough allowance, he would be paid allowance in lieu of furlough based on the salary of the lower grade to which he had been reduced. But that officer having given eighteen years' good service at a higher salary should be given all the privileges to which he was entitled by his service. The Minister has admitted that certain increases of salary were given during war time-, amongst other things, to meet the high cost of living. I should like to know whether an officer retiring under the circumstances to which I have referred would receive allowance in lieu of furlough on the basis of his salary on retirement, plus the allowance for high cost of living.. I suggest the substitution of the word "pay" for the word "salary," in order to include all allowances in the amount upon which the retiring allowance is to be based. The salary remains unchanged, and I am contending that an officer on retiring should have his retiring allowance based on the salary he received plus bonus to meet high cost of living, or other allowance. </para>

                        <para>- My contention is that those allowances are really part of the officer's pay. An officer may retire after twenty years' service because of illness, and on his retirement may have heavy doctors' bills to pay. I do not think it is fair that he should be given a furlough allowance based on the lower rate of salary he received, if he had been reduced to a lower grade, without taking into account any allowances he received in addition to the fixed salary of his office. </para>

                    <para>. - I am afraid <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> is influenced largely by sentimental considerations. He referred to the question of allowances; but quarters cannot be regarded as such, because their cost is deducted from an officer's pay. Postmasters and other officials actually pay rent, because the rental value of the quarters they occupy is deducted from their salaries. Quarters cannot be regarded as allowances, but we must not deduct more than 10 per cent, of an officer's salary on that account. An allowance of 5 per cent, is made to officers sent to certain portions of Western Australia because of the conditions of life there. If a public servant is transferred to Western Australia for three years, he receives an allowance on the basis mentioned, and, after his period of service in that State has terminated, and he returns to Victoria, the allowance is discontinued, because it was granted for a special purpose. An officer might perhaps be sent from Melbourne to Tort Darwin, in which case a special allowance would be paid for the full period he was away, but  that arrangement would be terminated when he returned. </para>

The sum payable is intended as a reward for good and faithful service, and nobody should benefit apart from the officer himself, members of his family, or direct dependants. Money intended as a reward for loyal service should not be handed over, for instance, to an officer's brother-in-law. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause is a very interesting one. It proposes to shift from Parliament to the Board the onus of defining "salary." The Senate has no power to deal with a regulation except to disallow it. I ask honorable senators to look at the proposal carefully, and to decide whether the clause will have the same effect as a precise statement of what salary includes. I object to the practice of leaving so many things to be prescribed. Under this clause the Board will have the power to say what portion of a man's direct monetary pay shall be regarded as salary. </para>

For the past two or three years there has been some discussion as to whether the 25th April, which is Anzac Day - the day on which it has been said Australia was born as a nation - should be observed as a public holiday. For two years there was some difficulty in arranging the matter, but the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> I think principally because of his interest in the matter, granted last Anzac Day as a public holiday. The soldiers' organizations, particularly, and the Fathers and Mothers Associations, are very keen in desiring that this day should be observed as one of our national days. I have moved that it be one of the prescribed national holidays, and that the number of days which may otherwise be prescribed as holidays be reduced from four to three. I know that this is a matter which has to be dealt with carefully, because the number of public holidays in the year must be kept within reasonable limits. </para>

                        <para>- The Government would be glad to grant Anzac Day as a holiday, but they think that the occasion should not be used for holding picnics, prize fights, and the like. They think that it is too serious a day to be devoted to such amusement, and that it should be observed in a semi-religious manner, on 'a Sunday. I think that is also the view taken generally by the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- There is a difference of opinion regarding the way in which the day should be observed. Some people say that it should be observed as a memorial day, and others that it should, if it is the day on which Australia was born as a nation, be a day of national rejoicing. Something can be said in favour of both these views, but, how-' ever the day is observed, that does not alter the principle that it should be a national day. The method of observance must be left to public sentiment. How can the Government insure that the holiday shall be observed in any particular way, except by passing special legislation to prohibit race meetings and the like being held on it? </para>

                        <para>- Some i of the States two years ago observed Anzac Day as a holiday, but the Commonwealth offices were not closed. In the State of Tasmania I jestingly rang up the Attorney-General and suggested that he should send the policemen down the bay for a holiday, as some returned soldiers were going to picket the post-office and other Commonwealth offices, to insure that no one worked there. I think that if the Commonwealth Government were to give a lead in the matter, and te approve of the day being observed as Australia's principal national day, it would then be possible to educate public opinion as to how the day should be observed. </para>

                        <para>- Special church services are often held to commemorate an occasion on the Sunday nearest to the day on which a holiday is generally observed. If Anzac Day is made a memorial day, it is very likely that special church services to com mem orate it will be held on the Sunday nearest to the date fixed for the general observance of the holiday. I think that we should say definitely in this Bill whether or not it is intended to observe this day about which so much has been said. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister residing in Melbourne will be called upon to determine al case in, say, Western Australia. He will know nothing of the circumstances, so he will call for the papers, and, having ascertained the capital cost of a building, will say that an officer must pay so much by way of interest. If an officer in receipt of a lower salary displaces an officer of a higher status, the rental charged to him, in proportion to his annual salary, will be greater than that charged to his predecessor, and will be tantamount to a reduction of salary. 'Cases of this kind have frequently been reported to me, and I think this is a favorable opportunity to mention the matter. However, if the Committee thinks that it should be left as it is, well and good. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause refers to the presence in the Commonwealth Public Service of any objectionable person, described in the marginal note as an officer of enemy origin. Seeing that the Empire, which includes Australia, is at peace with late enemy countries, I do not know if it is advisable to perpetuate the verbiage of the clause, and particularly the marginal note. </para>

If there is good ground for believing that an officer 13 disaffected or disloyal he should not be continued in the Service; but is it wise that we should adopt the expensive and cumbersome method of appointing a Royal Commission to bring about his dismissal ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not see the necessity for the adoption of this expensive method to discover whether a person in the Public Service is disaffected or disloyal. I do not see why the Board should not be armed with sufficient powers to make the necessary inquiries in these cases, and to inflict punishment where that seemed to be justified, even to the extent of dismissal from the Service.' I do not know that a magistrate or a Judge of an inferior Court would possess special qualifications which would not be possessed by the Board. It might be shown that the person charged was not actually disloyal. He might come right up to the chalk -line, but not cross it. It seems to me that it would be rather futile to appoint a Royal Commission to make an investigation which might end in smoke. If the Board can be trusted to deal with members of the Service in all other respects, I do not see why it should not be empowered to consider the case of an officer suspected of disaffection or disloyalty. </para>

                    <para>. - This is intended to cover, not so much the future as cases which have arisen in the past. We want to provide that where the Government, in good faith, have acted upon the reports of Royal Commissions inquiring; into these <inline font-style="italic">cases</inline> their decision shall be final. We do not desire that the Government should be dragged through the Courts for action which it was deemed desirable to take against alien enemies during the war. I may remind honorable senators that on one occasion a Royal Commission was appointed to report on patent medicines, and it was found necessary to pass a special Act to protect <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale,</inline> who made the report, against action which might be taken by persons who had millions behind them to crush a man who had only done his duty in showing up certain abuses. An enemy subject who was a member of the Public Service may have suffered certain disabilities, and may now desire to get back into the Service or to secure compensation. I . do not think that aliens who were dealt with during the war should have the right to prosecute the Government in such cases. Mistakes may have occurred in dealing with some of them, but in the course followed the authorities felt that they were doing what was their duty at the time.

                        <para>. -  I desire to take advantage of this opportunity to refer to a question which I submitted to the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> yesterday in regard to the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook as High Commissioner, and his reply to the effect that there was no information to give. Again, this morning, when another place was congratulating <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook on his appointment, the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> who was the only Minister present at the time, informed me that the position was the same as it was yesterday. I am not making the complaint a personal one; but as a member of this Senate who contends that we have co-ordinate powers with another place and are entitled to be supplied with public information at the same time, I strongly dissent from the Minister's attitude in declining to give information on a matter of public interest when it was available in the place which makes and unmakes Governments. May I throw out a suggestion to the party opposite, and say that the time has arrived when the number of Ministers in the Senate should be more in proportion to the number of electors we represent. I realize that we have three Ministers, one of whom is usually absent, and perhaps it is unfair to complain of scant treatment, because they appear to be overworked; but it is time an alteration was made. I utter a most emphatic protest against Ministers in this Senate withholding information, or supplying misleading particulars, in regard to public matters when correct information is in possession of honorable members in another place. I am not going to complain unduly of the attitude of the Minister who was in charge at the time, although he was responsible for the refusal to answer the question I submitted this morning. The time for secrecy has passed, and I lodge my protest, trusting that Ministers will cease giving scant attention to the questions asked in this House. Ministers must realize that it is not the individual who is slighted by a refusal to answer, but the prestige of this Senate. This branch of the Legislature, except where otherwise stated in the Constitution, has powers equal to those of the other Chamber. As a senator, I shall always insist on public information being made available here at the same time as it is disclosed in another place, and if it is not, I shall do as I am now doing - utter my emphatic protest against treatment of such a character. </para>

                        <para>. -  I desire to support the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> because the Senate is entitled to information of public importance such as has been given in another place. In discussing this matter with an ex-senator of considerable experience, he said that if such a position had arisen when he was a member of the Chamber there would have been " something doing." We come here as representatives of the people of Australia, and are entitled  to  be supplied with information of public interest when it is made available in 'another Chamber. Surely the representatives of the Government in the Senate enjoy the same privileges as Ministers in another place. I should be very sorry indeed for this protest to be regarded as a personal reflection upon the Vice-President of the Executive Council - I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> does  not  wish  it  to be treated as such - but I strongly protest against the treatment the Senate has received, not only in this but in other instances. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> expressed himself very eloquently yesterday, and  I  am  only too pleased to be able to indorse <inline font-style="italic">his</inline> remarks. The attitude we are adopting must not be regarded as criticism concerning the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook to the office of High Commissioner, because such is not the case; but we resent the Senate being treated in this way. Surely it is not suggested that this deliberative body should be refused information on matters of policy. </para>

                        <para>. - I have been privileged to occupy a seat in this Chamber for a number of years, and during that time I have always endeavoured to give information when it was obtainable. This morning I attended a meeting of the Executive Council at 10 o'clock, and I reached this building at 10.45, just prior to the commencement of the memorial service. I was not approached by any honorable senator before we met, and when I was questioned I merely replied that I did not have anything to add to what the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> had said yesterday. I have been asked why I did not give the information, but I am not allowed to disclose particulars of the proceedings at a gathering at which Ministers are on oath. If I had answered the question submitted to me, without the consent of my colleagues, I would have been breaking my pledge, which I refuse to do. If I had been approached before the Senate met I would have been able to communicate with the 'Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> But I have been alone on the Ministerial bench during the day, my colleagues, as honorable senators are aware, being unavoidably absent. </para>
