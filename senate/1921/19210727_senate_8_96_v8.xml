If the Board had power to do that, it could travel anywhere in the Commonwealth ; and yesterday the Vice-President of the Executive Council told us that it would cost Â£153 for the Board to visit Western Australia alone ? The taxpayers have a right to insist that the Minister, who is responsible to. Parliament, shall be answerable for the proceedings of the Board. </para>

The taxpayers have a right to insist that an inquiry shall not be made by the Board except on reasonable grounds, and that the Minister shall be responsible for what is done. If the Minister receives com plaints, and finds that there is justification for the reference of them to the Board for inquiry, they should be referred; but the Board should not be continually touring Australia making inquiries and inflicting pin-prick annoyances on the manufacturers of the country. At the start, the Board may be rather energetic, with something of the thoroughness of the new broom, and at the end of six months it may have spent the sum set apart for its work. </para>

Government, should the Board not prove the success that is hoped for, would have a way out; but Ministers must take full responsibility for the Board. The taxpayers have a right to know that there will be reasonable justification for every inquiry made by the Board. It may seem a simple thing to require a manufacturer to give evidence before the Board, but the preparation of his evidence might impose on that manufacturer weeks of labour. If the taxpayers are to be put to that expense and inconvenience there should be a good reason advanced for the investigation, and the Government should take the responsibility.

I remind the Committeethatthe matters to be referred to the Board, under clause 15,  are  distinctly divided. There; is;  a  series concerning' which the Minister " shall " refer to the Board, while there, are others which he " may " refer. With respect to the latter, if he does not refer them to the Board for inquiry and report, clause17 provides that the Board may take action upon its own initiative. It may be taken for granted that the Board: will not be composed of fools. </para>

If this particular industry be established in Australia, we shall be able to produce alcohol which will be a third more powerful for the driving of internal combustion engines than is petrol. The production of this spirit would, therefore, become a primary industry in Australia, because we grow certain grasses from which it can be obtained. The provision in the Bill to which exception has been taken is of an all-embracing character, and is intended to cover any new industrial developments. </para>

The Bill itself is rather a useless one, but the absence of this particular clause would render it still more useless. One reason which has been advanced for the creation of the Board is that as certain Customs duties have been imposed for the purpose of protecting our manufacturers from outside competition, it is necessary to- insure, as far as possible, that our consumers shall not be charged unduly high prices. What individual is most likely to bring a case before the Board? Obviously, it is the consumer. </para>

                        <para>- Some honorable senators are of that opinion. As a matter of fact, I am a little inclined to view the matter in that light, myself. But it is quite possible that we may not be able to reject the Bill upon the motion for its third reading. Consequently, we ought to make it as good a measure as we can. The clause is one of the few useful portions of the Bill, inasmuch as it will enable the Board to discharge certain duties without reference to the Minister. I am very glad that the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> is opposing the amendment, and I trust that his action will be supported by a majority of the- Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - I regard this clause as vital to the Bill. In considering the amendment I ask honorable senators to pay due regard to' the obligation which is imposed upon the Board by a subsequent clause, to. report comprehensively to the Minister each year concerning the operation of the Tariff and the development of industries. I cannot see how it .is possible for the Board to do that unless its members are free to. make such inquiries as they may deem to be necessary. If the clause be amended in the manner that is proposed, or if it be omitted, we shall divest the Board of every particle of independence, and practically reduce it to the level of a political body, which possibly will deal only with such matters as the Minister may consider desirable for party or other purposes to refer to it. By limiting the expenditure of the Board to such a small sum as Â£4,000 per annum, we have already shorn it of much of its usefulness; and if we amend the clause as now proposed we shall make it impossible for the Board to render useful service to the community. </para>

I followed the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> very closely in his reply to the mover of the amendment <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson),</inline> but I think he failed to grasp the involved position of all the so-called productive and industrial helps to Australia that now appertain. I ask the Minister to consider how that situation is to be met. The mover of the amendment, so far as I can see, wishes to confine the ambit of the Tariff Board within certain well-defined limits. In the first place, he desires to prevent the Board from having a roving commission to do anything it pleases, quite apart from any instruction issued to it by the Minister. As * ' the clause stands, the Board on its own initiative, subject to the limitations imposed by the amount set apart for its purposes or such other votes as may be passed by Parliament, may inquire into anything it pleases. </para>

                <para>SenatorPRATTEN.- We have another institution, also under the control of the Minister for Trade and Customs. I refer to the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, which is presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stirling</inline> Taylor. One of its functions is the encouragement of new, and the further development of established, industries. In order to amplify the statement of. its functions, I would refer honorable senators to the annual report of the Bureau for 1920. The first part of it deals with general matters; the second with proposals in connexion with the development of the woollen manufacture industry; while the third part, much to my surprise, is headed " General Instructions to Australian Trade Commissioners." I thought- that, so far, we had only one Trade Commissioner. It will be seen from this report that the Bureau covers almost the entire ambit of the second part of clause 15 of this Bill. There is yet a third institution already in existence, namely, the Bureau of Science and Industry, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> is the Director. This, again, is under the administration of the Minister for Trade and . Customs. Its work, amongst other things, comprises the collection and dissemination of information regarding industrial welfare and questions relating to the improvement of industrial conditions. I noticed in the daily press the other day a statement that it was hoped that at an early date <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> would report upon the question of the development of manufactures or industries within the Commonwealth during recent years.

                <para>SenatorPRATTEN.- I am talking, not of the blowfly pest or of freights, but about the overlapping that is likely to take place unless the amendment is carried. I have not risen in any spirit of unfriendliness to my honorable friend in this connexion, but only to justify the amendment. If we are to have three or four sub-departments or sections of the present Customs Department, presided over by the Minister, all in some respects doing practically the same work, is it not better to pass a Bill under which the discretion of the Minister shall be exercised in connexion with a roving Commission ? </para>

                        <para>- They have accepted the Bill- so far with very slight amendment. We have to deal with the Bill as we find it, and cannot anticipate events'. Up to the present the Committee has accepted the principle of establishing a Tariff Board. I want to see it made as effective as possible. I am just as anxious as the mover of the amendment' for economy, and just as keen on it as is any other honorable senator, but there are two ways of advocating it. One may advocate a reduction which may not lead to economy at all. The fact of saving Â£100 here or there on certain items, if it means incurring expenditure which will bring in no return, cannot be classed as economy. I not. only want to see the Bill' made as effective as possible, but I want it administered as economically as possible. By a. previous amendment we have taken out of the hands of the Minister "the control of the aggregate expenditure, by fixing a limit of Â£4,000 per annum. This clause gives the Board the power on its own initiative, to inquire into certain' matters which are absolutely vital. Not even the mover of the amendment could suggest that the four paragraphs in sub-clause 2 of clause 15are not essential to the whole procedure. We must retain them, . and the Bill, gives power to the Board to initiate inquiries under them. I take it that whoever are appointed members of the Board will- be competent. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and I supported it; but let us be consistent, and follow the lead which the honorable senator set yesterday. Let us refrain from putting on the Minister an unnecessary responsibility: We appoint the Board in order that we may have; as far as; possible,, an effective-Tariff, and if we rob the Board of the power of- initiative we shall practically clip- its wings, and cannot expect it to do. the good work that would otherwise be- done. I would not give the Board full power in every direction,- but the four paragraphs in sub-clause 2 of clause 15 are essential, and every inquiry under them which can be initiated by the Board must have a direct relation to the Tariff. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has, on the- face of it, made out a fairly good' case in justification of the amendment regarding the possibility of duplication: of work, I claim that, although there may be some duplication, that does not justify the carrying of the amendment. If the Bureau of Commerce and Industry are engaged- on an investigation into certain phases of trade and commerce in Australia, and the Tariff Board' is brought into existence by the passing- of this Bill, surely- the intelligence of the members of the Board will- prevent them from making an- inquiry in exactly the same direction . They, will be able, to get. the details to. a  certain point from the work of the Bureau, and. deal in their inquiry with the evidence obtained by the Bureau only as it affected the Tariff'. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> - Would it not be an exception to find one Government Department taking any notice of what another is doing? </para>

We are ignoring the fact that we can reasonably anticipate the appointment of a Board composed of men who will know their work, and that whatever they do will be in the direction, not of duplication, but of original inquiry into matters which can ,-be intimately connected only with the working of the Tariff. </para>

But these matters are all bunched together in subclause 2 of clause 15, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> - " any other matter in any way affecting the encouragement of -primary -or secondary industries -in relation to the 'Tariff." -It would be possible for the Minister, if he wished to 'refer a matter 'connected with the. sugar, the 'banana, the boot, or -any other industry, to refer the whole of that industry for  the consideration pf the Board. In my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson's</inline> amendment would prove a benefit, and I intend to support it. </para>

                        <para>-Because there might just as well be three departmental officers without any Board - one to look after the incidence of taxation as affecting the -revenue, another to pay attention to the effect of taxation as affecting industries in Australia., and so on, no one being empowered' to look at the subject as a whole. I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> what he seems to have forgotten, that it is quite possible for one circle to enclose several other circles, as a glance at the face of his watch would show. That honorable senator desires to bring all these Boards together, though each looks at the matters for inquiry from a different angle. "The Tariff Board must be seized of .the effect that the Tariff has on Commerce, industry, and manufacture, and it has to take a larger and more general view than that taken by any other Board. I am not going to deny that it might be better to have one measure dealing with all these bodies, but we are now dealing with only one, and must take things as they are, and not . as we would like them to be. As I say, the adoption of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson's</inline> amendment would take all initiative away from the Board, and leave the Minister burdened, as he is to-day, with an immense" amount of work that should be done by his officers, or by some Board; indeed, the amendment makes the Board ineffective,' and we might as well do without one, and save Â£4,000 per year. </para>

Sub-clause 1 has regard to the general aspect of affairs, while sub-clause 2 has relation entirely to the Tariff; and the proposed Board is a Tariff Board. I am surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> does not see that the Board is asked to concentrate itself on the effects of the Tariff in relation to, say, bananas - to what has been the effect of the duty on the revenue, and so forth; and it is in regard to such matters that the Board may act on its own volition. </para>

The Institute of Science and Industry has for its object the application of science to industry; and, as.  I  have said many times in my place here, lias, in the matter of the treatment of wheat, mainly through the efforts of a South Australian scientist, saved this country hundreds of thousands of pounds; it has prevented loss more than will be represented by the cost of the Institute in the next ten years. Let us be honest about these matters. </para>

The Board of Trade, which is an honorary Board, has performed excellent work, and I believe 99 per cent. of its recommendations have been accepted by the Government. The members of the Board of Trade are busy commercial men, who do not receive any salary, and as their work is of an advisory character, reports are not published. The members of the Board of Trade have a lot to do; but if it is possible for the members of the proposed Board to undertake some of the work now performed by the Board of Trade, that will be done. </para>

                        <para>- The Government always accepts the responsibility. There may be a slight overlapping in connexion with certain details, but it is unreasonable to suggest that the work of the Tariff Board should be undertaken by the Board of Trade, the members of which act in an honorary capacity.. It would not be unreasonable to suggest that the Board of Trade should surrender some of its powers to the proposed Tariff Board. During a most critical period . the Board of Trade rendered very valuable service, and the value of its work has been generally recognised. I ask honorable senators not to support the amendment, because the simple issue is to give the Board power to initiate certain inquiries within the limitations prescribed in the Bill. </para>

                <para>SenatorREID (Queensland)[4.4].As one who voted for the retention of the Tariff Board because I believe it can perform very useful work, I do not intend to support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson.</inline> In the two previous clauses the Minister has all the necessary powers to refer specific questions to the Board. Sub-clause  1  of clause  15  provides that the Minister shall refer certain matters to the Board for inquiry and report, and sub-clause  2  provides that the Minister may refer certain questions to the Board for a similar purpose. This is the only instance in which the Board is given independent power to act, and that is why I intend to support the provision. The Board is responsible to the Minister for Trade and Customs. During the course of its investigations it may discover that inquiry is necessary in certain directions, and it should, therefore, have the authority to act on its own initiative. I desire to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> on what information does the Minister act? </para>

If the Tariff Board discovers information that may be of service to the Government it will pass it on to the Minister. I do not think any Minister would object to a Board submitting requests for inquiries if there were sufficient reasons, because the Board would be able to support its suggestions with evidence. There is such a thing as political influence. </para>

If a Minister acted in defiance of a unanimous recommendation by the Board, he would show that he was not fit for his position, because the members of the Board will have experience which in nine cases out of ten the Minister will not have. </para>

                        <para>- That would be done only in a grave emergency. Parliament is imposing a high Tariff in the hope that it will stimulate manufacturing industries, and this Bill is brought forward for the purpose of strengthening the Tariff. What man would invest a lot of money in a new manufacturing business if there was always overhanging him a threat of interference by the Board, with the possibility of being called before them and compelled to explain his business transactions ? That is the policy that is being followed by Labour Governments, in connexion with their price-fixing devices, but it has been abandoned by allNational Governments. The proposal in this clause is nothing but a price-fixing device, which experience has proved a failure. The only influence that will cope with abnormally high prices is the law of supply and demand. </para>

I am sure we shall destroy entirely any good which might result : from the Tariff if we allow this Board to continually interfere with manufacturers, probe into their businesses, and drag them before the public. Any good that is derived from the high Tariff will be discounted in that way. </para>

                    <para>. - I regard clause 17 as quite unnecessary, and I shall vote for the amendment because the Minister has admitted that if it is carried he. will ask that the clause be struck out. ' The clause empowers the Board to initiate inquiry into certain matters specified in sub-clause 2 of clause 15, but their activities would be to some extent limited- by reason of the fact that we have restricted their expenditure in any one year to Â£4,000. These matters, however, may still be inquired into, because the Minister will, if he thinks they are of sufficient importance to be inquired into, direct the Board, to make an inquiry. into them,. Therefore, there is no virtue in retaining the clause as it stands, and I am surprised, after all that has been said about the duplication of the work of. Boards, that the Minister has not induced Cabinet to . come to some decision as- to what is to be done in respect of them.. I think we are entitled to some statement from the Government, on- the point after all that has been said in this chamber during the last week or two. . </para>

                    <para>. - Apparently, the purpose of the amendment is to limit the Board's discretion to inquire into any of the matters set out in the. latter part of clause 15, that is to say, to limit its inquiries to any matter submitted to. it by the Minister of the day.. On the other, hand, we are told that it is necessary to give the Board certain discretionary power in order to enable it to discharge its functions and fulfil the usefulness expected of, it. But. clause 15 and clause 17 seem on the face of them somewhat contradictory: Our object should be. to make the intention of Parliament as clear as possible. Nothing is more confusing in our Law Courts: than the haggling of lawyers as to what has been the intent and true purpose of: Parliament in passing certain legislation. There is nothing mandatory in the latter part of clause 15 declaring that when the Minister does refer certain things to the Board for inquiry and report the Board must take them into consideration, and inquire into them on the spot, and may not choose to conduct their inquiry at a later date. It has. been well said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> that other Boards, have no option, but must inquire into matters specially referred to them; and if it is the intention of the Government that this Board shall have no option, but must inquire into a matter specially referred to it, then that intention is very vaguely expressed in clause 15. The vagueness is confirmed by the fact that clause 17 arms the Board with discretionary power to act on its own initiative. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but; that sub-clause really contains the kernel of the whole position, because it includes a drag-net paragraph which says that the Minister may refer to the Board for their inquiry and report " any other matter in any way affecting the encouragement of primary or secondary industries in relation to the Tariff," leaving to the imagination such an infinity of scope and space' that it is very hard to say what might not come under that heading. This drag-net paragraph is almost as expansive as the subject of a lecture I once saw advertised in London, " The Universe and Collateral Subjects." The power proposed to be given to this Board may not be quite so ramified as the scope covered by that lecture, but it is in the neighbourhood of it. It certainly leaves to the Board a power of imagination which I am not prepared to give it. We have had not only Boards, but also Ministers, with keen imaginations, and I do not think the interest of the public would bo served. very greatly by allowing these keen, lively imaginations to have full scope. I have been comparing previous legislation with the present proposal, and I find that the functions of Boards previously created to furnish reports have been laid down, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> has mentioned, and that any subject upon which they were empowered to make an inquiry had first to be referred to them by Parliament or the Government of the day. These Boards have no option but to make the particular inquiry they are directed to make. If we had amended clause 15, and provided that the Minister must refer certain matters to the Board for inquiry, and thereupon the Board must do so-and-so, it would have obviated the necessity for clause 17 with so much ambiguity in it. </para>

I am not prepared to assent to this. This Parliament must be superior; and a Minister, as its servant, should be its responsible mouthpiece. No Board, no matter how wisely constituted, should be able to override a Minister, or rob him of that responsibility which is justly his as a servant of this Parliament. In fact, I am inclined to strengthen his position, and as, so far as I have been privileged to understand it, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson's</inline> amendment seeks to strengthen rather than weaken Ministerial responsibility, I am inclined to give it my support. </para>

The latter portion of the clause deals largely with the administration of the ordinary- laws under the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. If something comes under the notice of the Minister of an awkward nature, which he considers should be fully inquired into, he may immediately refer it to the Board for a report, and when he receives that report he may, or may not, act upon it. We pass on from that stage to inquiries into matters which are of an administrative character! The Board may be of  the opinion that under  a  regulation  a  certain course must be taken. It, of course, could not amend that regulation, but it could report to the Minister that, according to the law  as  it stood, the position was such and such, and that, in the Board's opinion, the law needed alteration. The Board could, too, determine of its own initiative to inquire what alteration was needed, and, after inquiry, could recommend to the Minister the alteration which it thought necessary in the interests of justice or departmental convenience. </para>

In doing that, it  Would  not supersede the Minister, because it would have to report to him, and it would be the Minister who would be held responsible for any alteration of the law. The Board is only an advisory body. The "Wool Board was not interfered with by the Government, though we were at all times ready to give it any assistance that it might ask for.

                    <para>. - In my opinion, the Minister has not met the argument against the clause. I agree that, largely, though not entirely, the making of the proposed amendment would be tantamount to the negativing of the clause; but I am opposed to the Board having such wide powers of initiative in the matter of inquiry as the clause gives it. The Minister says that the Board should not run to the Minister for Trade and Customs about all kinds of minor matters; but the matters into which it may inquire on its own initiative are, many of them,. major matters of extreme importance to the people of Australia. </para>

Subclause 1 of clause 15 specifies a. number  of matters which, the Minister shall refer to the Board for inquiry and report, and sub-clause 2 contains a list of other matters, equally important and comprehensive, which the Minister may refer to the Board, or into which the Board may of its own initiative make an inquiry. What has happened in the administration of the War Service Homes Commissioner shows the danger of removing Ministerial control from a Department. The War Service Homes Commissioner was given very wide powers. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister for Repatriation could not, because of the way in which the War Service Homes Act. was framed, control the Commissioner for War Services Homes. This clause proposes to give to the Tariff Board very wide powers of initiative in regard to inquiries ; and to inquire is to act. The Board is to consist of two business men, and a departmental officer. The business men might care nothing for the authority of the Minister, and. be animated solely by the desire to do what is best for Australia. In these circumstances, the Board, on certain facts being placed before it, might, determine to make inquiry into, say, the general effect of the working of the Customs Tariff in relation to the primary industry of wheat production. The business members of the Board might be interested in this matter, though not pecuniarily. </para>

                <para>SenatorDUNCAN.- Their interest might be in no sense personal'; but they might think- that the effect of the Tariff was to give the wheat-growers of Australia a rough spin, causing them, it might be, to pay too much for their agricultural machinery. The Board might, therefore, decide to initiate' an inquiry into the effect of the- Tariff on wheat-growing: Such an inquiry might engage it for six months, requiring it to travel to the various States to ascertain the conditions  oft  the farmers, the cost of production, and the like: </para>

We shall do wrong if we give the Board the right to say what inquiries it may make, whether the Minister likes it or not. In the best interests of the Government it would be wise to agree to the amendment. Acceptance would not harm the Bill, although the objection has been advanced that it would destroy it.

                    <para>. - I welcome the amendment for the reason, among others, that its effect will be to provide a quorum of two members. As a matter of convenience of course, a member of the Board should have authority, with the consent of his colleagues, to administer the oath to a witness. I suggest that the words proposed to be inserted should follow the word "may," so that the clause would read, "For the purpose? of this Act any member of the Board may on resolution of the Board, . . . summon any person to attend . . . ." </para>

                    <para>. - This provision is identical with the section in the Inter-State Commission Act, which gave rise to the action which was decided by the Privy Council, and to which I alluded yesterday. It is just about as <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of our Constitution as that particular section was declared to be by the Privy Council. However, the Committee have determined to insert in the Bill all these unconstitutional provisions, which will only serve to create a lot of work for legal gentlemen. From my personal standpoint that is the only satisfactory feature of the measure. At the same time, I should like the maximum penalty which is set out in this clause  to  be substantially reduced. At present it is big enough to frighten the small man and small enough to permit the large  man  to defy an Act of Parliament. A penalty of Â£100 inflicted upon  a  small merchant who has not the means to enable him to appeal to the Privy Council would be severe enough, whilst  a  penalty of Â£500 would cripple him.

                    <para>. - I do not think it is the desire of a democratic Parliament like this to impose extreme penalties. Whether a citizen be poor or rich he knows that under British law he has no right to defy constituted authority. The penalty of Â£500, which is provided for in the clause would not be inflicted upon the individual who merely commits a technical offence as the result of ignorance. But we should be chary about substantially reducing the penalty in the case of a man who has important documents in his custody and who refuses to produce them when called upon to do so by the Board. </para>

That being so, even if no penalty were provided for the offence which is set out in this clause, sufficiently drastic punishment could be inflicted upon a recalcitrant individual by a reduction of the Tariff duties which have been imposed upon particular articles. </para>

                        <para>. - The maximum penalty for an offence under clause 23 or clause 24 is <inline font-style="italic">Â£250;</inline> but here we are providing under the clause as it stands for a minimum penalty of Â£500 and a maximum of Â£1,000. The point that I wish to make is that whereas a magistrate would be at liberty to impose a fine of Â£5 for an offence under clause 23 or clause 24, in this case no discretion is allowed him in so far as the minimum penalty is concerned. Under the clause as it stands, be could not inflict a fine of less than Â£500, or under the clause as proposed to be amended a fine of less than Â£250. I think it would be sufficient to provide for a maximum penalty of Â£500, leaving to the discretion of the Court the determination of what penalty within that limitation should be imposed in any case. I would also ask whether action is not to be taken in regard to the provision for imprisonment. </para>

                        <para>- There is no virtual or substantial -difference between a trade secret and a secret process of manufacture. While I do not know what the exact functions of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> are, I venture to say that he has very often to be put in possession of trade secrets before he can hold the scales of justice fairly between contending; parties. This- Board is to be his right hand, his adviser but the Bill gives the Board no power to do what the Minister may, I presume, already do. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act, passed in 1904, and amended eight times since?, contains a provision- 'empowering the Arbitration 'Court to obtain trade secrets if the purposes of the Court so require, but it .also -enjoins on the Court the observance of secrecy 'when put in possession ?of such information. This Bill creates a body which is -practically superior in the field of industry to the Arbitration Court, but it 'does not give it the same -powers. We deny to the Tariff Board a power which we have already cheerfully conceded to the Arbitration Court, and confirmed on at least, 'eight separate occasions. At the same time, -we give -the Board, either by implication or by failure to provide the contrary, an extra power to divulge secrets in defiance of the wishes of the party concerned in such a way as may ruin him. We should put both bodies on the same footing in both respects in the public interest. The public interest will often demand the disclosure of trade secrets to the Board, and demand also that the Board shall preserve inviolable silence about them.' The .public interest stands supreme, and no trade secret should be withheld from the Board; but the Bill allows it to be withheld, even if the public interest requires the contrary. The Bill is drawn in a slipshod way, and is so sparing in the use of language, in this instance, .that w.e can well afford to substitute the plain , and unambiguous language of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I urge the Government to take into consideration the advisability of doing so. </para>

                    <para>ji5.3'7i). - The functions of a 'Board such as this and of an Arbitration 'Court, are entirely different. A manufacturer using a -secret process may be making large profits and paying lower .wages .than he should, and the Arbitration Court should have the right to know .it. I was .once the champion rabbit skin-man in Australia in handling rabbits that were wanted for export by the British Government, mostly for hospitals, and on one occasion I had a dispute .with a 'hatter... I suggested that we should go -to the Denton Hat Mills to settle the point; but when we. got there they said to me, " We will gladly admit you, senator, and give you any information at our command, and even let you see one of our machines for treating rabbit-skins - a machine that no other hatter in Australia possesses." </para>

                        <para>- Only so far as they relate to the question of wages. If a man, by the use of a machine, reduces the cost of production of an article from 20s. to 14s., the other side has aright to ask for particulars of the cost of production in relation to wages. If a man makes a big profit in that way, he should consider his employees. This is an entirely different matter. The object is to prevent information reaching trade rivals through loose publication or disclosure by individual members of the Board. </para>

The exception is made to enable, the members of the Board to discuss the information across the Board table, but that is very different from publishing it broadcast for the information of business rivals. The Minister is free to do what ha likes; but I have never known any Minister to be charged with such lack of discretion as to drag a man's secret principles of manufacture into open discussion in Parliament. I do not believe Parliament would tolerate such conduct from any Minister. I hope no amendment will be made in a clause which, after all, . seeks to do the fair thing by protecting the progressive and inventive citizen. The established practice of all civilized countries is to- encourage the inventor and the man of enterprise. </para>

                    <para>. - I entirely agree with the Minister that the clause should be accepted as it stands. I fear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has, to some extent, misconstrued the meaning of the provision, which is really intended to protect the manufacturer from being compelled by the Board, under any circumstances, to disclose any facts relating to his secret processes, if the disclosure may be inimical to him. It will be remembered that within the last three or four years, in spite of parliamentary enactments, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox,</inline> the manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, successfully defied the Inter-State Commission, and refused to disclose secret processes, which had cost much money and research to discover, on the ground that the disclosure would seriously prejudice his company. I again- point out that this Bill is connected with the Tariff and all matters appertaining thereto ; and witnesses, I take it, will be called for the purpose of recommending either a raising or a lowering of the duties. If a witness is an applicant for higher duties he will, of course, be willing to give the fullest possible information in support of his case ; and if he be called by the Board, with a view to showing that he is extracting too much profit from the community, and he refuses to give evidence, that refusal will, more than anything else, be likely to prejudice him. I think that the clause should be carried in its entirety as a very proper one in a Bill of this sort, in view of all the surrounding circumstances. What would bo the good of a Board asking a manufacturer how he gets the glossy sheen on his hats or how he gets the beautiful colour on his biscuits, and so makes them that they retain their freshness over months; or what recipe he uses in making his beautiful marmalade? These are the secret processes, I take it, contemplated in the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I am afraid that the Minister has either not got the "hang" of my contention, or is trying to mystify the position. What I said was that we have created, on the one hand, an Arbitration Court, to which any fifteen men who form an industrial organization ' may apply. On eight occasions that Act has passed through Parliament and has been amended in various particulars, but one section has remained untouched. We have armed that Court with power to ask for and obtain information regarding trade secrets, but - and this is the proviso that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> did not emphasize- those trade secrets must not be made public property except for the express purposes of the Court. Power is also given to the Arbitration Court to call for the disclosure of the financial facts, with the proviso that, if the parties to the suit think that it would be injurious to their interests, the Court is not free to make the facts public property. If this Board is of the importance that the Minister asserts, I do not see why it should be put on an inferior plane as compared with that of the Arbitration Court. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going into a detailed comparison of the two bodies, but the section in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to which I refer has stood the test of time. The Board to be created under this Bill is armed with no. such power. The Board has no power to obtain any trade secret, but it has the power to make public financial facts relating to those who come before it, though the disclosure may be prejudicial to them, and they may not be consenting parties. That is where I say this Bill is wrong. Clause 9, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> has referred, is merely the stereotyped provision we find in every Act of Parliament, namely, that for the purposes of carrying out the measure certain information shall be kept secret; but the Board is given discretion whether it make the information public or not. I contend that the Board should not have this . discretionary power. In the Arbitration Court, as I have pointed out, it is. left to the parties to say whether the financial side of any dispute shall or shall not be published; and I wish to open the eyes of honorable senators to the manifest discrimination made between the proposed Board and the Court. The public interest requires that every trade secret shall be made known, although not made public property. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is entitled to his opinion, which I respect; but it has been the deliberate intention of this Parliament to act in a manner directly opposite to that suggested by the honorable senator. If he believes that the withholding of a trade secret is in. the public interest, I flatly and totally disagree with him, because the public interest in this country must remain supreme. In this clause wo are providing that a trade secret shall be withheld, and that is detrimental to the interests of the people. The disclosure of trade secrets has been adhered to in the past; but we are not doing it in this instance, because the Board will not be armed with sufficient power to compel witnesses to disclose secret trade processes. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> slid over various points and emphasized the danger of making certain features public property. </para>

                        <para>- When the Minister was referring to the disclosure of certain financial features of a business concern, he was arguing on wrong premises. If the holder of a trade secret believed that it should not be made public it could be treated as confidential, if the holder so desired. If the Committee think that this provision is fair in the public interest, I can merely lodge my protest; but it is altogether different from that embodied in the Commonwealth Arbitration Act in which the Arbitration Court is given power to compel a witness to disclose the information. If the Board is to successfully exercise its functions in the industrial arena, and compel competitors to toe the mark by carrying on their business according to upright standards, it must have the power to insist on the disclosure of a trade secret, otherwise it will be able to say that it is placed on a lower level than the Arbitration Court, and denied the authority which that Tribunal possesses. If there is any reason why information of this character should be withheld, perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> will be prepared to supply it. The crystallized opinion of the representatives of the people is that the public interest should stand supreme; but that does not necessarily involve the disclosure of a trade secret unless the owner so desires. If this provision is allowed to stand, the Board will not possess greater powers than a casual observer in the street. </para>

                    (Victoria- Vice-President of the Executive Council) [6.61. - I was not under any misapprehension when I said that there was a distinct difference between the Tariff Board and the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The Government do not desire the Board merely out of curiosity to make investigations concerning the details of every man's business, but to have a Board sufficiently strong to enable it to secure all the information essential for successfully conducting its inquiries. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court may .desire the disclosure of a secret process to enable it to ascertain, what it represents to its holders. It frequently happens in our Courts that a witness asks for protection in giving evidence, and, in some instances, statements are handed up in writing to the Judge in order to preserve secrecy. Occasionally a Court is cleared while evidence is being given to enable a witness to make a confidential statement. A witness may desire to give the evidence, but not necessarily for publication. A witness before the Tariff Board may be -willing to disclose certain particulars; but we do not desire to compel him to -divulge something which may be injurious -to his business. Large sums of money have been expended in perfecting secret- trade processes.

                    <para>.; - I do not wish to impute motives ; but it appears to me that the proposed new clause has been submitted .'in the interests of the profiteers whom we wish to control. There is a strong desire for legislation compelling the publication of the balance-sheets of certain trading concerns; but the proposed new; clause, if adopted, would prevent it. If, as the result of inquiry, it was shown- that a business undertaking was returning only a reasonable profit, it would be of no interest to publish its financial .position ; but if, on the other hand, a firm was charging exorbitant .prices, and was making a profit of 50 or 100 per cent, instead of 12 or 13 per cent., the position should be divulged. An amendment such as that proposed would protect the profiteers, and would be of no benefit .to another business man who was in a less f favorable position. The Board would be prepared to sympathetically listen to applications from men in a somewhat weak position, but it could not 'be expected to refrain from publishing -'the balance-sheet of ia firm making excessive profits. The pre posed new clause, if adopted, would be of advantage .to the unscrupulous man, and I am surprised at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> endea- publishing to assist those who are exploiting the -people. The Board is pledged to secrecy,, land it has to -report 'to -the Minister, who  will  use his discretion as to what is published. </para>

The. amendment seeks only to establish a principle which Parliament has thought wise to insert in the Arbitral tion Act. The Minister has stressed profiteering as an argument in opposition to the clause, but there are conceivable cases in which the person concerned would be desirous of keeping secret, not profiteering, but his acute financial embarrassment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has proposed that whenever an individual tenders evidence about the finances of his concern, the Board must keep such evidence secret if the witness so requires. That is the practice in the Arbitration Court. The principle has been long recognised by this- and other Parliaments, that every Tribunal is entitled to arrive at a con- clusion,asmuchontheevidence, it receives <inline font-style="italic">in camera</inline> as on the evidence it receives in public. That principle has been in operation so many years, that it cannot be ignored now. </para>

                        <para>- Somes honorable senators: are inclined to look on the Board, as likely to be possessed of almost angelic virtues; to. believe it will do nothing wrong, and will be, in, fact, slightly above the. calibre of ordinary men. I believe that it will have the. human liability to. err. The Minister's argument is. that we must trust the Board, but I say that any manufacturer or other witness before the Board should have power to demand that his evidence shall not be published. I am not content to give the Tariff Board any greater power than is given to the Arbitration Court. A witness should have the power to prevent himself or his business being publicly injured. </para>

                    <para>. - I have not argued that the Board must be trusted. My contention has been that the Board will have no power to make any public statement. They will be bound, on oath to observe secrecy in regard to matters that come to their knowledge. But I have pointed out that the Minister is the avenue through which publicity might occur. The Board will report confidentially to the Minister, but the Minister will have discretionary power to strike out certain evidence before he submits the report to. Parliament. He may not do that ; he may allow the whole of the facts to go to Parliament, and I say that in certain circumstances he should allow them to go to Parliament. For instance, if a. man has been deliberately profiteering under cover of the Tariff, Parliament should be. so informed, but in other circumstances I do not think that the evidence should be made public if it would do injury to an individual. The Minister will not be submitting to Parliament reports upon individual firms; he will be dealing with the trade or industry collectively. He will not submit to Parliament JohnBrown's balance-sheet in order to prove that his industry is not prospering, but in order to help that industry he may ask Parliament to sanction an increase of duty. </para>

I am afraid that it would be necessary to retain the books of a fair-sized manufacturer for four or five days. What would the manufacturer do in the meantime ? No doubt the Board would make provision for the safe custody of his books. </para>

                        <para>- But it would be a poor return to the manufacturer to compensate him . in cash for the loss of his books. It is more a matter of the inconvenience he would suffer if his books were kept for what might be a reasonable time in the opinion of the Board, but what might be from his point of view quite an unreasonable time. There are other ways in which the Board can get all the information it desires without retaining the books needed by the manufacturer. It could appoint an accountant to attend at the manufacturer's office and go through his books. </para>

                    <para>. -  The practice of nearly all Government Departments is to send officials to examine books. I had a dispute the other day with the Land Tax Commissioner with regard to the value of certain land,' and as he was anxious to see my firm's books in order to ascertain what profit had been made, he sent two of his officers to inspect them, and make extracts from them. That is the most convenient way of dealing with the matter. </para>

I know that most Government, officers are perfectly reasonable, but now and again one comes up against an officer who is not reasonable, and gives as much trouble as he can. I want the business community to have some safeguard against such a man. To give the Government the tremendous powers so often given them on the assumption that they will be wisely exercised is not a conciliatory way of conducting affairs. It is a serious matter for the manufacturer to part with his books. How is he to know that they will be properly looked after, or that all kinds of secrets may not be disclosed by the person who has them in his custody ? </para>

                    <para>. - This power, which is now spoken of in such awesome tones, has been operating to my knowledge for over a quarter of a century, and I have not heard a word of complaint about the way in which it has been used. It operates under . the Customs Act, and I venture to say, in all the Law Courts. Judges have the power to take books and impound them, and we never hear of the exercise of that power in such an arbitrary and reckless fashion as to cause trouble. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> has given an instance of the way in which Government Departments armed with such power exercise it. He says quite frankly that they exercise it in a very reasonable way. Why, then, should we expect that this Board, which will be so closely under the scrutiny of Parliament, will go to the uttermost extreme in the exercise of its power to wilfully annoy those people into whose affairs it is compelled to inquire? The constitution of this Board has been  approved by the Senate; much to the dislike of individual senators,. I admit, but I. ask. them to be entirely honest in the matter, and, having assented; to the creation of a. Board, not to emasculate it. and leave it without power to discharge the duties which the Senate has concurred should, be thrust upon it. </para>

                        <para>- When departmental officers are pondering over a man's books they have possession of. them, they are in a position to make copies of them, and in order to see. that the authority to do this is not in any way impaired or side-stepped, this Bill gives the power already contained in the Customs Act to take a book for the purpose of extracting from it such information as the Board may require In practice, this is not actually, done, because the person concerned, recognising the existence of this power, creates no trouble when the Department sends an officer along; but if no such authority is given; trouble might be caused. I ask my friends who have been raising bogies to instance one case of late years where any one has purposely and unjustifiably been inconvenienced by the exercise of this power to take possession of his books and documents. It is done every day in the Courts. Thispower to send for papers is given to Royal Commissions and to Committees of Parliament, and in an experience of twenty-five years. I have never heard of it being misused. </para>

                        <para>- It is. The scope of the Tariff Board's activities will be limited by the operations of the Tariff. If a section of consumers or of primary producers are of opinion that certain duties are too high, and oppress them unduly by diminishing their purchasing power or hampering their avocation, it will be the duty of the Board to inquire into their complaint; and if it be alleged of a protected manufacturer that he is charging too much for his goods, he must either assist the Board by giving evidence before it, or risk an adverse report. If, on the other hand, a set of manufacturers consider certain duties not high enough, and allege that their industry is being destroyed by foreign competition, the Tariff Board must investigate their complaint, and they would, as a matter of course, put before the Board all the information they could get to substantiate their case. </para>

If the period within which a prosecution under the clause might take place were limited to six months, there might not be so much objection to the clause ; but as the clause stands, an employer might not be proceeded against until twenty years had elapsed, when he could not produce evidence in rebuttal of the charge.

                    <para>. -  I support the amendment. There is a growing' tendency in legislation  to ignore the good old principle that no man shall be deemed to be guilty until he has been proved so. It is all very well to say that that principle has been violated in other Acts, such, for example, as the Gaming Act and the Insolvency Act. So much the more shame to the Legislatures responsible!. If a man is guilty of murder, whose duty is it to find him so? Is it his duty to come forward and confess? Is it not the duty of the Crown to search for evidence, and to tender it before a Court? Whereupon, if the evidence is not deemed sufficient or satisfactory, the accused is dismissed. In this clause, one is asked to assume .from the outset that the accused is guilty. The tendency of modern statute law is to ignore the old common law principle. Honorable senators should take a stand against that tendency. The Government should be required to accept the onus of proving that a person is guilty. And I am bound to say, in this connexion, that if the ..accused party can get out of it, good luck to him! </para>

                    <para>. - The concluding remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benny</inline> sheds light, perhaps, upon' the whole of his reasoning. But I ask the Committee to consider the facts. A Board is to be created, and it will be given instructions to inquire into certain matters. Power will be provided for the Board to call witnesses. Let me put the following hypothetical circumstances : The Board proceeds to call before it an employee. Unless this clause is retained, the employee will go before the Board in fear and trembling, realizing that if he tells what appears to him to be the truth, he may get into the bad books of his employer. All that is laid down in the clause is that an employer shall not dismiss or prejudice the employment of  an employee who has given evidence. The latter should be able to attend before the Board without fear of reprisal. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators talk about British justice. Provision similar to that contained in clause 34 may be found - framed in almost identical words - a dozen times in Commonwealth Acts. To throw the onus of proof upon the injured party would be tq invite the impossible. How could an employee who had been dismissed tender evidence concerning the reason for his dismissal ? The only man who could say why he had been dismissed would be the employer who had dismissed him. I remind honorable senators of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. In that Statute, in order to protect employees who are officials of unions, and others as well, from the disfavour of their employers, there are embodied these same words. The Bill will become a farce if the amendment is agreed to. No honest employer would dream of dismissing a man for haying given truthful evidence. But, unfortunately, there are employers who, not being honest, would do so; and those are the parties in respect of whom clause 34 should operate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benny</inline> makes no secret of the fact that he would kill the Bill by any means, at any stage. He has been seeking to remove every clause which would make it effective. </para>

Had I the time to undertake a search throughout the Commonwealth legislation of the past nine years, I would be able to find more than one duplication of these penalty clauses. What has happened, apparently, is that the clauses have been lifted from other Acts, and made to apply to the proceedings of the Tariff Board without perceiving, however, that they do not really fit.Isympathize with Senators Elliott and Benny, yet I am not sure that the amendment should receive support. In a fight between employer and employee the former always has the heavy end of thestick. </para>

                <para>SenatorREID (Queensland) [8.44].- Clause 34 has been inserted to protect any person who may be deliberately dismissed because he has given evidence of a certain nature. It has been pointed out that no employer would dismiss an employee for such a reason, so long as there existed provisions under which he could be haled before aCourt. If an employee is dismissed because he has given truthful evidence before the TariffBoard, British justice demands that he shall be protected. I support the clause as it stands, because, in all our legislation, we should give special attention to the party who is least able to protect himself. </para>

Frequently, when a technical breach comes before the Court, there is a refusal to convict, because the lowest penalty which could be inflicted is held to be altogether excessive. </para>

                        <para>- The clause originally provided for fine and imprisonment, whereas I now propose that it shall provide for a fine " or " imprisonment, or both. If the amendment be agreed to the Court, instead of being compelled on conviction to impose a penalty of not less than Â£500 and ordering imprisonment up to any term not exceeding three months may impose any fine it pleases up to Â£500, or imprisonment or both. I think it is very desirable to provide for imprisonment. Very often a short term of imprisonment would be more appropriate than the imposition of a large fine, which many people could not pay, and because of their inability to pay could be imprisoned. Under the amendment the Court will have power to take into consideration all the facts, and to inflict imprisonment if imprisonment be appropriate, or a fine should it think that an appropriate punishment, or both a fine and imprisonment where both areappropriate. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think the Committee has quite realized the point of view that might be taken up on a comparison of the offences dealt with in this Bill. I hope to satisfy the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> that it is not equitable to provide the penalty of imprisonment for a civil offence. We have already agreed to the penalty of imprisonment for offences such as bribery of witnesses, fraud on a witness destroying books or documents, preventing a witness from attending before the Board, or injuring a witness. All these can be more fitly described as criminal offences than can any of the offences dealt with in clauses 23 and 24, to which this clause solely relates. For what offence is the penalty of imprisonment proposed under this clause. The first is where "any person served with a summons to attend the Board when the summons is served personally fails without reasonable excuse to attend the Board, or to produce documents, books, or writings in his custody or control which he was required by the summons to produce." Cannot honorable senators realize that there might be an honest difference of opinion on such a question? It is conceivable to me that the members of the Board should not be entitled in certain circumstances to ask a citizen to produce certain books or documents. </para>

There are conceivable circumstances under which a man would have a right to refuse to answer a question put to him by the Board. Supposing two inexperienced commercial men or amateurs are appointed as members of this Board at a remuneration of Â£5 5s. a sitting, and that these in all other respects very estimable citizens become puffed up with a sense of their own importance, is it not possible that mistakes are likely to be made?

                        <para>. -  The people outside are anxious to know, one way or the other, what the Tariff is to be, and it has occurred to me that we might meet on Wednesday and Thursday morning at 11 o'clock. In this matter I am speaking for myself. If the Senate prefers to meet at 3 o'clock, well and good. Ministers say it is necessary for them to look after their Departments but another place is not sitting, and most of the Ministers belong to that Chamber. Of course, those in this Chamber would be very busy. While those of us who have to come from other 'States are in Melbourne, we might just as well be here dealing with the Tariff, on Wednesday and Thursday mornings. I  would  prefer that the Senate should meet at 11 a.m., and. rise at 6.30 p.m., rather than that we should be here in the evenings. </para>

It is possible that the Government may be able to oblige advocates of both courses before the Tariff is completed ; but that will depend entirely on the progress we make. I do not believe we can do more work in fewer hours. The hours we sit must depend on the work to be done. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> says, the people naturally desire to have the Tariff finalized. The Government do not suggest that reasonable discussion should be curtailed; but there is an obligation on honorable senators to get the Bill through as rapidly as circumstances permit; and I appeal to them to eliminate unreasonable discussion. That is what takes up the time. If we make reasonable progress on each day we sit, there will be no need to meet early in the morning or sit late at night. </para>

                            <para>- I thought it was an appeal. So far as the Government are concerned, we will go on with the present hours of sitting, see what progress is made, and stick to them if it is satisfactory. If it is not sufficient, we may have to appeal to the Senate to help us by sitting longer hours, in order to get on with the work. </para>
