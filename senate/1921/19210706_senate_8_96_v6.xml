                        <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister whether public complaint has recently been made that owing to the operation of the coastal-trading provisions of the Navigation Act the vessels of the Union Steamship Company hitherto engaged in trade between New Zealand, Sydney, and Hobart, will now have to make Sydney their terminal port, and cease running between Sydney and Hobart. Further, is the Minister aware, that it. is also complained that, in consequence of  other provisions of the same Act, all vessels trading in these waters, including river steamers of about 10 tons burden have to provide libraries for their crews&#39;. If aware that such complaints have been made, has the Minister any information as to the foundation of those complaints, and is it intended to take any steps to redress the grievances complained of, and to provide for Tasmania, the one isolated State of the Commonwealth, as good means of communication as she has hitherto enjoyed. </para>

I should; however, like to remind the honorable senator that the Commonwealth Government have always shown their appreciation of the difficulties under which Tasmania, as an island State, labours, and I think I may claim that they have done their best to meet these difficulties, </para>

I think, however, that we should have some explanation as to why we should be asked to consider to-day about nine pages of amendments which have been submitted, and which honorable senators coming from other States had no opportunity of seeing until 1 o&#39;clock this afternoon at the earliest. I think that we ought to have some explanation from the Government of the reasons which have prompted them to bring forward these amendments. </para>

                    <para>. - In reply to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> I merely desire to say that we have deferred the appointment of a permanent Public Service Commissioner because, quite three years ago, the Government made up their minds to submit to Parliament an amending Public Service Bill. Subsequently, we received reports from the Economies Commission, which made certain recommendations, and since then a Cabinet sub-Committee has devoted a good deal of time to considering those recommendations. Our sole desire has been to bring down a measure which will provide for the most effective Public Service to be found in any country. If we have failed to do that, it is not for lack of trying. I have accepted advice from everybody. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps I should have said that I have received advice from everybody, and that I have given that advice careful consideration. It was only last Thursday that I received, through the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, a long list of suggested amendments in the Bill from the Acting Public Service Commissioner&#39;s Department.&#34; I immediately called a meeting of the Cabinet sub-Committee, which sat till Friday evening at 8 o&#39;clock, dealing with these amendments in order that we might be in a position to forward them to honorable senators in Sydney before this Chamber re-assembled. However, it took the Committee until next day to finalize the amendments, the drafting of them occupied another day, and getting them from the printer absorbed still another day and a half. It was only yesterday afternoon that I managed to place a complete list of these amendments in every honorable senator&#39;s box. I could do no more. </para>

                        <para>- The entrance examinations seem to preclude any further examinations during the time that an officer continues in the Service. The amendment proposed by the Minister will not, therefore, be an improvement upon the Act. In common with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> I think it is scarcely possible for any honorable senator to become seized of the effect of the pages of amendments which the Government are bringing forward in the short space of one hour. I am not in a position to understand what is proposed except in regard to the first few clauses of the Bill. Some of the amendments are of so drastic and far-reaching a character that they require a good deal of consideration. </para>

                    <para>. - I recognise that the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> did all that he could to supply copies of these amendments to honorable senators as soon as possible after he had received them from the Acting Public Service Commissioner. But my contention is that somebody has erred in that the amendments were not in the hands of honorable senators earlier. It seems to me that the Acting Public Service Commissioner should have been consulted in connexion with the drafting of the measure. If he were consulted, and if he did not send forward the suggested amendments until the last moment, the blame does not rest with the Minister. I understand that the Acting . Public Service Commissioner sent along some amendments which were the subject of consideration at the hands of a Cabinet subCommittee upon last Friday afternoon. I should like to know, however, whether all the amendments suggested by the Acting Public Service Commissioner have been adopted by the Government, or whether they have deemed it wise not to proceed with some of them? If they have, we ought to be afforded an opportunity of knowing what amendments have been rejected. </para>

He has had a number of years&#39; experience of the working of that Act, and has never hesitated, when he found a weakness in it, to suggest to the Prime Minister&#39;s Department that it should be reviewed. Probably one- third of these clauses represent amendments suggested by the Public Service Commissioner in regard to the working of the Act.

There is no indication even that his duties shall be &#34; as prescribed.&#34; If, by means of a regulation, it were made quite definite who the chief officer was, the position would be clear - save that already there are so many regulations that to add to them would only further confuse any one in his search for information amongst them. I hold that the definition is no definition at all, and that that is proved by the subsequent wording of the Bill. I refer to that portion where &#34; chief officer &#34; is referred to. The first division includes the permanent heads and all chief officers of Departments, and the second division includes also permanent heads &#34;or&#34; chief officers. When reading that portion of the measure, and baking into account at the same time the definition of &#34;permanent heads,&#34; one wonders who is who. </para>

First, there is the head of a Department, who is responsible, in a sense, for policy; responsible for advising the Ministerial head, when required, upon matters of policy; and whose responsibility it is, further, to control the management and organization of the Department as a whole. Under him comes the chief officer, or several chief officers. I may cite the Defence Department by way of example. Its secretary is .
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trumble.</inline>
                    He is the head of the Department. Immediately under him there are quite a number of specialists, who are the chief officers of various branches. But they are not heads of Departments.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trumble</inline>
                    is the sole head of the Defence Department. In the Treasury, also,

                    the Secretary, is the head of the Department; but there are very many officers under him who are heads of branches, and who are actually the chief officers.. And they are&#34; by no means junior officers. I refer to such heads of branches as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ewing,</inline>

                    again, there are State  Deputy  Commissioners; and each of these is the chief officer of a branch. Each performs practically the same functions - with certain reservations - as

                        <para>- Yes, but honorable senators have had placed before them  139  amendments, coming from the Government at the last hour. Although. I have looked through these amendments, and perceive that they are largely formal and should require very little consideration, there is this additional factor : Honorable senators have received a pamphlet from the High Council of Commonwealth Public Service organizations. This body appears to have been very slow in setting forth its case with respect to the Bill, and if its proposed amendments dealt only with the Bill as originally introduced, I would be inclined to take little notice of them, for the reason that they should have been in our hands before now. But &#39;if - as is highly payable - the proposed alterations of the Council -are affected by some of the  139  amendments of the Government, the position becomes complicated. The Council represents the following associations : - </para>

I am sure the Government and honorable senators desire to make the measure as acceptable as possible to the Government and the public servants. We all desire contentment in the Public Service, and it is, I am sure, our wish that we should have a measure that meets with the approval of those who have to work under it, as otherwise we are not likely to secure a maximum of efficiency. It appears that these organizations have been rather tardy in submitting their suggestions. </para>

I have been looking over some of the amendments submitted by the associations, some of which were submitted to me in a typewritten form,, six weeks or two months ago. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has said that if the amendments submitted by the organizations have nothing to do with those brought forward by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> they are of little value. I have not had sufficient time .to peruse the amendments submitted by the associations, but I do not believe that they deal with those brought forward by the Minister. I have one or two amendments which I intend moving, based upon the suggestions of Public Service organizations, and it would appear that these organizations have had. at least two months in which to submit their- suggestions. </para>

                <para class="block">Commonwealth Departments. I have not been supplied with a list of the suggestions from Public Service organizations, but it appears that the representatives of these organizations are very slow in submitting their suggestions. Union leaders apparently are not men of the type we had in the early days, because I have not received a single letter in connexion with this Bill, and those interested appear to have interviewed every one but the Minister. A similar appeal was made for an adjournment two months ago, when there was a general request for senators to have time to peruse the measure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> has given notice of certain amendments, and I have introduced those which the Government favour. Many of those included in the printed schedule I have circulated are of a machinery character and have been prepared after consultation with the Acting Public Service Commissioner. New principles are nob involved, and one amendment to which exception was taken - which is quite inoffensive and of a machinery character - has been embodied in an Act seventeen years old. If there is a general desire to defer consideration of this clause I am prepared to accede to the wishes of honorable senators, because I desire the Bill to be clearly and intelligently discussed. </para>

The chief officer of the Home and Territories Department is not necessarily chief officer of the Electoral Branch of that Department. My object is to make the definition more clear. </para>

When we have the Public Service Act under revision, we should make a distinction between the head . of a Department and the chief officer of a branch of that Department. A question may arise in the High Court as to whether a particular officer is the head of a Department or the chief officer of a Department. </para>

We employ a great deal of female labour in the Commonwealth Service, and there is no reason why we should not give preference to the nurses who did such good work during the war as well as to the men who did such splendid fighting for us. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of the proposed new definition will cover men who formed the crews of vessels which rendered war service in getting supplies to our soldiers ; and it will not be forgotten that two vessels of our Fleet were torpedoed during the war, and went down.

                    <para>.- In the opening lines of the proposed new definition, the word &#34;satisfactory,&#34; as  applied to the record of a returned soldier, is used. It does not seem to me to be quite a good word in this connexion. Its use implies that some one should be satisfied with the record of the returned soldier. Will the person to be satisfied be the Public Service Commissioner or the commanding officer of the returned soldier? </para>

                        <para>- Very well. I pass now to another point. A number of returned soldiers are employed temporarily by the Post Office. They are maimed mainly in the hands or arms, and for that reason the Public Service Commissioner has given them letter delivery work, which is eminently suitable for them. Unfortunately, under the Public Service Act, the Commissioner is bound to make provision for telegraph messengers as they reach the age of eighteen. </para>

                        <para>- I am not referring to that at all. The Commissioner is continually appointing these boys to other positions as they reach the age of eighteen. At the present time he is bound to find them permanent employment or put them off. The result up to the present has been that the maimed returned soldiers to whom I refer have been pushed off the temporary list in order that permanent positions may be found for those boys. </para>

                        <para>- My point is that those boys are displacing maimed returned soldiers. Another definition relates to returned soldiers. I can show the Minister a letter from a man in Bendigo who has a shattered hand. He has been employed up to date to deliver letters, but writes to say that he has been displaced because&#39; a position had to be found for a boy who is just turning eighteen. I put the case before the Public Service Commissioner, who replied that nothing could be done, because he was bound by the Act to find places for these boys. It is right that the Government should consider the future of the boys in their employment as telegraph messengers, but where their claims conflict with - the claims of returned soldiers, particularly of maimed men, the Public Service Commissioner should be given discretion to retain the services of the maimed returned men, and dispense with those of the juniors. </para>

Later, another Appeal Board may be appointed for some other particular purpose. Or a permanent Appeal Board may be sitting in Melbourne. And, if the case of an isolated officer should arise, that Board may delegate its powers and authorities to a specially appointed Appeal Board, whose members are in the neighbourhood of the officer concerned, so that the evidence of the latter may be taken. If some such authority of delegation - thus involving the creation of another Appeal Board - were not provided, the Central Appeal Board might be called upon to travel all over Australia; and, thus, the main objective of economy would be lost. </para>

An officer&#39;s retiring allowance is calculated on the original salary &#187; allotted to him, and consideration is not given to the additional allowances to which I have just referred.

                        <para>- It appears there, and in other clauses, and by the wording of the clause, the Government apparently intend to allow the conditions which now exist to continue. An officer in receipt of. &#163;168 per annum receives in addition a cost of living allowance of &#163;62, and if he has three children, he receives &#163;39, bringing the total amount up to &#163;269. If an officer was in receipt of that salary when a retiring or any other allowance was being computed, it would be based on &#163;168 per annum, and not on the &#163;269. The special allowance for children may, or may not, be taken into consideration, but the cost of living bonus should be included when a retiring or any other allowance is being computed. I shall be glad if the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> will give honorable senators some information on this point. </para>

                        <para>- The word &#34;&#60;pay&#34; is used perhaps in other clauses. If there is any justification for an amendment such as this, we may have to deal with it before the Bill is finally disposed of. At the same time, I do not feel, inclined at this moment to support such an amendment when I realize that one of its consequences, at any rate, will be to make these allowances over and above the ordinary salary or wages subject to attachment by the Court by way of garnishee. </para>

                    pointed out that it was not fair to compute the retiring allowance upon the nominal salary without taking into consideration the cost of living allowance or the bonus in respect of children.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow</inline>
                    has suggested to me one difficulty in connexion with this proposal. One man might retire at a time when the cost of living was very highland the computation, in his case, would give him a considerable amount as retiring allowance. Another man of the same grade in the Public Service, and receiving the same salary, might retire at a time when the cost of living was comparatively low. The computation, in his case, would be proportionately reduced, and so two men equally entitled to participate in gratuity or retiring allowance might be very unequally treated. This is a matter which should not be dealt with hastily. I am not at present disposed to support the  amendment, but I might consider it acceptable if, later, the Bill is so framed as to prevent injustice arising under it, and adequate reasons are advanced in support of it. I suggest that the proper time to deal with the matter is when we come to consider clauses dealing with retiring allowances and gratuities.

I do not think there is much in the objection urged, on the ground that there might be a garnishee order against a retiring public servant. I am sorry to hear that it should be necessary to take garnishee orders into account in connexion with our public servants. They are men in receipt of regular pay, and it should not be necessary for .them to get behind with their accounts. </para>

                        <para>- I should say that there are from 25,,000 to 30,000 people employed in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, and I venture to say that the percentage of those affected by garnishee orders is very small indeed. I am not prepared to deny what I regard as justice to 30,000 people because a few amongst them may be affected by garnishee orders. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> objected that one man might secure a higher retiring allowance than another because he retired at a time when the cost of living was higher than it was at the time of the other officer&#39;s retirement. Honorable senators are aware that public .servants in remote districts are given a special allowance. In some portions of Western Australia, public servants receive an allowance in excess of the salary granted to men of the same grade in &#39;Perth. In the same way, men located at Broken Hill are given an allowance in excess of that paid to men of the same grade performing duties in Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- I did not know that there was a climate over there. It is more expensive to live in remote country districts than in the cities, and the public servants in receipt of these special allowances are no better off, and can save no more money, than those performing duties in the more settled districts. It seems to me, therefore, reasonable that those special allowances should be considered in computing gratuities or retiring allowances for officers who have been in receipt of them. For the purpose of computing gratuities and retiring allowances, the special allowances to which I have referred might reasonably be regarded as part of the officer&#39;s pay. </para>

                    <para>. - I want honorable senators to realize that the amendment refers not merely to retiring allowances, but to other allowances. Some public servants are required to travel from place to place in the performance of their duties, and while the travelling allowance is calculated on the pay of the officer the, allowance is not added to the salary for the purpose of computing it. The cost of living has increased, and wages generally have been increased; and I am of opinion that whether a cost of living allowance or a house allowance be granted to a public servant, the allowance added to his salary should be regarded as the equivalent for the services he renders to the Commonwealth.&#39;&#39; </para>

                        <para>- I think not. If a, man receives a travelling allowance it is not counted in estimating his taxable income. . Travelling allowance is paid according to the classification of the officer receiving it. But in many cases the pay of an officer plus his travelling allowance amounts to more than the minimum salary of an officer in a higher grade. If an officer is housed by the Commonwealth, as for instance, the caretaker of a building, whilst his salary may be.&#163;180 a year, quarters, fuel, and light, .allowed him may be calculated as worth another &#163;50. In my view that officer is in receipt of a salary) of &#163;230 per year. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sure that it is the object of every honorable senator to do what is fair and just by the Public Service, and also by the public. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has just referred to the travelling allowance. An officer may, while performing his&#39; duties, receive a considerable sum in the course of a year in the way of travelling allowance. If the amendment is carried as it stands that allowance will be added to the ordinary salary for the purpose of computing gratuity or retiring allowance. I do not think that that would be generally agreed to. The housing allowance referred to might be regarded as part and parcel of the remuneration of the officer receiving it, and might reasonably be taken into consideration in computing his gratuity or retiring allowance. But there may be allowances in the nature of travelling allowances, which honorable senators will agree should not  be  taken into account. It might by regulations  be  possible for the Minister, whilst endeavouring to give effect to the spirit of the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> in all reasonable cases, to protect the public at the same time against what might be called unfair appreciations of salaries. </para>

                        <para>- If the amendment were carried in its present form it would include them. We might be able to overcome such a difficulty by a provision giving the Government discretion to indicate by regulation, from time to time, what allowances should be considered, and what allowances should not be considered, in computing retiring allowances. That course would mean legislation by regulation, of which myself and other honorable&#39; senators have so often complained, but the regulations in that case would not escape notice; as many others do. There would be too many people throughout the Service interested, in them, and consequently a fairly good opportunity for either House  to annul any regulation which was unfair or obnoxious. </para>

                <para>Clause 53 provides that the Appeal Board constituted under that clause shall comprise, among others, &#34; a permanent  chairman,  who shall be an officer of the Commonwealth Service, and shall have the qualifications of a stipendiary or a police magistrate, and shall be appointed to the office by the Board of Commissioners.&#34; In that position the  chairman  would exercise judicial functions, and have to hold the scales of justice evenly between appellants and the Government. He should, therefore, be exempt from the provisions of the Public Service Act. </para>

                    <para>. - I was in favour of the amendment until the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> made his interjection. I understood that there was to be an Appeal Board, of which the  chairman  would be appointed permanently, but the Minister referred to the possibility of the officer going back to the Public Service. If he is to be appointed permanently, I am in favour of removing him from the control of the Board of Commissioners, because then he would be able to give a fairer deal to appellants. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that the deletion of the reference to the Repatriation Department is to give this measure a wide and general effect. There has been much complaint in the past six months with respect to officers who have been employed in the Repatriation Department and the War Service Homes Branch. I can quite appreciate that returned men who have filled positions in those Services probably failed to realize, when accepting the work, that they were Departments whose activities were bound to diminish and ultimately, perhaps, to cease. The gradual diminution of activities has necessitated the retirement of numbers of returned soldier employees, many of whom had originally considered that they were getting into permanent positions as Commonwealth public servants. There have since been complaints of services having been dispensed with unwarrantably. I am anxious to know if the amendment is likely to affect the situation and prospects of these men. Shortly before the visit of  Colonel Semmens  to Tasmania, I interviewed the Repatriation Commissioner, and put the case generally for a number of men in Tasmania concerning whom complaints had reached me. While, subsequently, in that State,  Colonel Semmens  came into direct communication with several of the complainants, and I understand that some satisfaction has been derived from his visit. Similar grievances, however, are common in other States. I do not overlook the fact that their own comrades warned many of the men who entered the Repatriation Department that they were taking work in a Service which was already overburdened; and, further, that the day must soon arrive when their jobs would end. Will the Minister give an assurance that the amendment is not designed to further prejudicially affect any officers who have obtained employment in the Repatriation Department and War Service Homes Branch ? </para>

                    <para>. - Returned soldier employees of the branches referred to have special privileges with respect to transfer. For example, they may obtain employment in - other branches of the Public Service without being required to undergo the ordinary Service examination; and they may avoid insurance obligations, if they have been for a certain period employed in the Repatriation Department. There are still further concessions. One of these, for instance, permits a returned man to enter the third division of the Service up to the age of fifty years. </para>

                    <para>. - The information just given is important,  and should be made widely known. Among returned soldier employees in the pay office of the Repatriation Department, there have been many recent notifications that their services are uo longer required. These men are not aware that the fact of their having been engaged in the Repatriation Department furnishes them with a recommendation and a preference whenever there may be vacancies in other spheres of the Public Service. I know that several ex-soldier employees in South Australia, who have  been dismissed, have experienced considerable difficulty in securing work, while, at the same time, men have been retained in the pay office who&#39; are not returned soldiers. I suggest that the fact should be generally made public that returned men whose services have had to be, or are likely to be, dispensed with, are entitled to preference in respect of applications for positions throughout the* Public Service generally. </para>

                    <para>. - I have given notice of an amendment which, if agreed to, will alter the whole character of the Bill, and, so far as I am concerned, a good deal depends on the manner in which this particular provision is considered. If this clause is carried, a Board of three Commissioners will be appointed to take the place of the present Acting Public Service Commissioner. I understand that transfers and appointments and a great deal of the work now performed by the Acting Public Service Commissioner will be undertaken by the permanent heads of Departments. Consequently, a certain amount of relief - some of which I do not favour - will be given to the proposed Board. On the other hand, a good deal more than is at present done by the Acting Public Service Commissioner will be undertaken by the proposed Board. As honorable senators are aware, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> introduced a Public. Service Bill providing for the appointment of a Board of Management, in which he pointed out what the duties of the proposed Board would be. Although that measure is not before us, the provision of the Bill relating to the appointment of a Board of Management is embodied in this measure. We are able to recall, not only the speech delivered by the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> on the second reading of this Bill, but also that of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> who introduced the other measure. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has said that  he  has received suggestions from various sources, and I would like  to  ask him who suggested the appointment  of  a Board  of  Control  to  .perform the work which  is  now being done  by  the Acting Public Service Commissioner? </para>

                    <para>.- This is one- of the most important clauses of the Bill. Earlier in the session I expressed my gratification at the introduction of a measure proposing some alteration in the management of the Public Service, because I felt that a great deal of dissatisfaction existed in the Service, and it might be removed under a new system. In some of the States, a Board of three Commissioners has _ been abolished, and a single Commissioner appointed, with the same object in view. The Commonwealth &#39; Public Service has been under the control of a single Commissioner during recent years, and it has not been as satisfactory as some think, it might have been. Whether there is justification for the dissatisfaction within the Service I am not in a position to say; but one cannot fail to recognise that throughout the Service  a  great desire for a change in its management has been expressed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> is not enamoured of the Government proposal, but I believe they are wise in suggesting the proposed new system. I think the time is opportune to say that they might go a step further than they have gone, and -in order to make the Public Service a satisfied Service, decide that one member of the Board of Management should be a representative of the public servants themselves. Many objections are urged against such a proposal, but I do not think they are sound. Throughout the commercial world to-day in the case of business concerns employing thousands of men, artisans and employees generally are given representation on the Boards which control them. There is provision made in this measure for representation of the public servants on Appeal Boards, but they have asked honorable senators to urge that they should be represented on the Board of Management. The public will be sufficiently protected by a majority representation on the Board. The Service would only have minority representation, but their representative would have an intimate knowledge of every matter with which the Board was required to deal. Direct representation of the public servants on the Board of Management would go a long way towards smoothing over difficulties, and would tend to make the Service more contented. </para>

The taxpayers would be amply protected because the other two members of the Board would be appointed without any reference to the Public Service. I trust that honorable senators will express their views .on this matter. I am sure that they are all anxious&#34; to see the Public Service as contented as possible. We shall get better service from our public officers if they are contented, and if we can do anything to make them mere contented than they are to-day, without jeopardizing the finances of the Commonwealth, we&#39; should certainly do it. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator will agree that the Acting Public Service Commissioner has. a tremendous number of papers submitted to him. I raise the question whether the Board of Management to be appointed under the Bill will have more time to deal with the question of the efficiency of the Public Service than the Minister in charge of the Service has. It is proposed that some of the work now done by the Acting Public Service Commissioner shall not be done by the Board of Management. </para>

                <para>Under this Bill a permanent head will be able to appoint an officer, subject to appeal. Under the existing Act he cannot do so. I venture to say that under this Bill there will be many more appeals than there have been in the past. It must be obvious that the Board of Management will have more work to do in connexion with appeals than the Public Service Commissioner has had to do under the existing law. Under the existing Act, if a man was to be appointed to a position in the Public Service, he would be appointed only after the Public Service Commissioner and the head of the Department concerned had talked over the matter. If any one objected, he would have to make good his objections against the combined judgment of the Commissioner and the permanent head of the Department. What may happen under this Bill is that a man may say : &#34; The permanent head has done this, and not the Board of Management. I have a right to appeal to the Board of Management,&#34; and he will do so. Under the existing Act, the appeal is from Caesar to Caesar, but under this Bill the appeal will be from the permanent head to the Board of Management. </para>

                <para>The Board will have less time to deal with the matters arising under clause  15  of this Bill than the Commissioner has had to deal with matters arising under section  11  of the existing Act. The Board will be unable to give the time required to look into contracts and such work as the Minister anticipates, because it will be fully occupied in other ways, and very largely in connexion with appeals under this measure. In a memorandum which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> and  I  had an opportunity of considering some time ago, the Auditor-General did not complain that the Public Service Commissioner occupied an undue time in providing a staff, because he had so many other Departments to deal with. But he did complain that he did not secure the staff he required as quickly as he ought to have done. Although he ultimately obtained the staff he wanted, there was unreasonable delay, and consequently he had to work with temporary hands, to the disadvantage of the Auditor-General&#39;s Department. </para>

                        <para>- Not exactly. In Victoria there are three Railways Commissioners, but I venture to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clapp,</inline> the  chairman,  overrules the other two. In New South Wales there is only one Railways Commissioner and two assistants, and the Act provides that the Commissioner can have his own way, in spite of the two others. He need not argue a point with them. They can send to Parliament a protest against anything he does, but his administration goes on in spite of it, and the only way that he can be checked is by Parliament indorsing the protest of his two assistants . - At one time, New South Wales had three Commissioners of equal standing, and the result was that they did not speak to one another except in their offices. That Board had to be abolished by Parliament, although they were three able men. I read with considerable interest the statement made recently in Sydney by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> to the Cockatoo Island. Dock Royal Commission. These were his words, as reported in the press:- </para>

                <para>We should have one man responsible, and we should not mix up two entirely distinct matters - the efficiency of the Departments, which is a very good thing, and the control of the Public Service. The Economies Commission, in their final report, say that it is impossible for. one body of men to look after those two things. They point out that if. we are to have economy in a Department, we must have people who can go into that Department, and who are not responsible for the appointments in it. Clause 15 contains proposals for bringing about efficiency in the Departments, but so little confidence have the Government themselves in the ability of the proposed Board of Commissioners to bring about economy, that recently, as I noticed with a good deal of astonishment, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook, the Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister , detailed to the press a new economy scheme for the appointment of certain financial authorities to overlook each Department. </para>

                    <para>. -  I have followed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas&#39;</inline> remarks with considerable interest. As the proposed Board of three Commissioners will have under this Bill to deal with this clause, and also with clause  15,  we are. putting on them an extremely big burden. A great deal of good could be done if we had one Commissioner, as at present, and also created several Departments under him, letting him&#39; have an overriding influence over the whole of them. When clause  1,5  is reached, I shall propose the addition of an efficiency department, that will be controlled by efficiency engineers, and that&#39; certain laboratories shall be created and certain records kept for the whole of the great Public Service. of the Commonwealth:. If we have one man in control, and place these arrangements under him, a great deal of good can be done. I cannot see how we are to get the efficiency for which the Government are looking with three members of the proposed Commission. It seems to me that- we shall have divided control and a great deal of difficulty. There must be a definite head. The Commonwealth Public Service is a very great part of the machinery of  gOrvernment.  It has grown to enormous proportions, and we must consider whether there is any possible way of introducing an efficiency system that will bring about better results, and give a greater return for probably less money, while, at the same time, creating in the Departments a feeling&#34; of security in regard not only to tenure, but to promotion. There have been many instances of men who  were  extremely useful in Departments &#39;being compelled to &#34;resign because they could not see .before them any tangible promotion in the near, or even in the distant, future. We must introduce some system of efficiency and record,  bo  that each man can be promoted according to the work that his card shows that he is fitted to do. This will create amongst the officials in -the Department&#39;s a feeling that they will receive recognition  if they can show that they- are willing and worthy.  I  propose to elaborate the question of efficiency at length on clause  15.  At present I shall content myself with supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator&#39; Thomas&#39;</inline> , proposal to have one Commissioner at the head of the Service, instead of placing it under three heads. </para>

                        <para>- Further, the Minister was a member of the Government which reappointed <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller, and which, in so doing, set the&#34; seal, .of approval upon the choice of one man having full control and authority. In the present instance it is highly necessary that there shall be one authority instead of three. Less time will, be wasted, and less money will be spent. . The Public Service Commissioner to-day has the assistance of an inspector in each State; but, on account of the growth of the Service, I understand, the inspectors are required to spend a great deal of their time in their offices rather than in making inspections. That, of course, is not the fault of the inspectors. Under the Bill, however, there are to be no inspectors whatever. The Government propose, apparently, to thrust on the Board of Management all the present inspectorial duties. </para>

We have ascertained-, even during the course of this debate, that it is a great advantage to have in  the  Senate honorable senators&#39;&#34; who have been closely in touch with administrative- work, more particularly in connexion with  the  Public Service. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> is able to speak with authority on certain phases of administration in the Commonwealth Public Service, because he was for some time the Minister&#39; controlling an important Department. The clause has been drafted  in its present form to insure that there shall always be one member of the Board of Management who will be conversant, not only with what is happening at the time, but with what previously has been the policy of the Board. Sub-clause 3 of clause 9 provides&#39; that the Commissioners shall in the first place be appointed for varying periods to insure that all members of the Board shall not retire at the same time. In the event of a* member being appointed when a vacancy occurs, the appointment shall be for a term of five years. </para>

                    <para>, - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> has asked what the Board of Management is going to do. The Board will be appointed to deal with matters of importance affecting the Public Service. It will have very considerable powers of delegation. It would be useless, for instance, for the, three members of the Board to go across to Tasmania and remain there for a long time when they might be employed in the other States upon duties&#39; of far more importance. There is no reason why the Board should not consist of specialists. One should be a specialist as an organizer. One might very well be an expert in connexion with telephony and telegraphy, and the third might be a specialist in some other line. There appears -to be a general assumption that inspectors of the Public Service will be done away with under this Bill. I do not see why that should be so. In view of the wide area of the Commonwealth, and the many duties which they were called upon to perform, I think it is not too much to say that, in the past, they have not been able to do themselves justice. One of these men might be very suitable to take charge of the Labour branch, and others might undertake work for which they are specially qualified. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> D. Millen has had something to say on the subject of the employment of specialists, and in this connexion may I remind honorable senators that this year the taking of the census has been quite a revelation to a great many people? -This- kind of work is done automatically to-day by machinery; and much of the calculating and indexing was carried out in that way. We have in the past been paying high wages to clerks to make bond slaves of themselves, poring over papers all day long, when a machine might be employed to do the same work in a fraction of the time. I can congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> on the good work which he did whilst in charge of the Post and Telegraph Department, but during that time no man was the subject of more bitter criticism than was the honorable senator because of the reforms which he sought to introduce in connexion with the telephone service of the Commonwealth. I have no hesitation in saying that I believe that we are losing thousands of pounds every year in the employment of. useless clerical labour. Only quite recently, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clapp,</inline> the present Victorian Railways Commissioner, has been criticised for sending men to America to investigate the conduct of railway services there. It has been suggested that he has only recently come from America himself, and should know what is done there. But the men whom he is sending to America are young men;, he recognises that they are men of promise who have displayed energy, courage, and intelligence, and he has no doubt that they will return from America in a position to render more efficient service to the  Victorian Railway Department as the result of what they will have learned during their visit to the United States on .questions of organization, system, and transportation. </para>

                        <para>- I -was merely giving illustrations to indicate &#34;the value of specialization on the Board of Management. I have put in ten or twelve hours each day in the public service for a good many years now, and it would be quite impossible for me after such a day&#39;s work to take up any particular subject for special study .c-&#39; Our Public Service Commissioner and his inspectors have worked very hard. Amongst our inspectors are some men with brilliant academic careers in law and letters, but if we required to inspect a shipbuilding yard, we must have a man who understands shipping and engineering. If we require to inspect the branch of the Public Service dealing with wheat, our inspector must have a knowledge of wheat, and of up-to-date means of handling it. The members of the Board of Management will not carry out all the necessary expert inspections themselves. They will keep a strong hand on the business side of the Service, and will call for special reports from efficient men who will be called upon to do the actual work of inspection. Some inspection work must be continuous for months in order to bring about a thoroughly efficient system. There is no reason why we should continue to carry out clerical work in Australia by the methods adopted fifty years ago. If the Board of Management, with the co-operation of specialists, gives its attention to the work which has to be done, it will find that there is plenty of scope for its activities in the re-organization of the whole of the Departments of the. Public Service. In my experience, I have been confronted with many problems to the solution of which I should like to have been able to devote a little time, but I was never able to do so. If Ministers were called upon to work not more than four or five hours at the routine work of their offices, they would have some time in which to study methods of modern progress and might be able to initiate valuable reforms. We Want fresh men and new ideas in all our public Departments. </para>

                        <para>- I am free to admit that a Minister may become stale, and as a Democrat I hope I shall always be ready to accept the verdict of the people. I do not believe that Ministers give their best services to the country by slaving over -papers all day and reading until they are blind. If a man in the most remote district in &#39;the Commonwealth is dismissed, it is whispered that it is the Minister who has sacked him, and it is suggested that he has treated him unfairly and that there is something wrong with the moral character of the Minister. These trivial complaints have to-be answered, but Ministers should hot have to come in contact with such matters at all, if they are to give their best services to the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> made some reference to a contract which it took a Board connected with the Defence Department six months to deal with. The contract was a very important one with the Colonial Ammunition Company, and it covered matters of great complexity. The Board sent accountants and costing clerks into the offices of the company, not because of any suspicion, but because the contract was toconver five or seven years, and contained a provision under which the Commonwealth might acquire the works of the company on certain conditions. Costing clerks and experts went through the company&#39;s factory. If the factory turned out 20,000,000 cartridges, one year, and only 2,000,000 in another year, the price could not be the same. It is the turnover that determines prices in almost every big undertaking. All these matters had to be carefully analyzed and investigated if the works were to be taken over by the Commonwealth later. It is not desirable that the manufacture of munitions should be in the hands of a private company, because under such conditions there may be a. tendency to bring about war merely for the sake of the manufacturers of munitions instead of to defend the liberties of the people. The contract in question was not an ordinary contract, but one which required- the careful investigation of every detail, and the cost of every cap and grain of powder and piece of copper used in the manufacture of cartridges. The reports of the investigation are. in possession of the Defence Department to-day and are invaluable. What could the Minister for Defence have done in that matter without the assistance of these specialists? I have said that our inspectors have done good work ; but recently the only inspector who could be sent to investigate conditions at a dockyard, though a brilliant man in his own line, admitted that be was paralyzed by the wonderful work he found carried out in the dockyard. He gave a very favorable report, which was of little or no value, because he had no special knowledge of shipbuilding. Any ordinary man visiting a large industrial undertaking to-day will be surprised at what he sees. I frankly admit that my inspection of the Newcastle Ironworks under an expert guide was an eye-opener to me. We do not know everything in Australia, and we should he prepared to adopt the best methods in the civilized world. The Board of Management will have the special function of organizing a good business system for the Commonwealth Public Service. I believe that their work will be beneficial to Australia, and will result in considerable economy. According to their capacity, our public servants have rendered good service, but we desire to help them to attain higher standards. I do not believe that the abolition of the present system will result in dispensing with the services of valuable officers. I have no doubt that if they are qualified for special offices, they will receive every consideration and their claims to employment will be sympathetically entertained. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING</inline> (Tasmania) &#163;8.29&#93;. - I listened with interest to what the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> has had to say, but it had no relevance to the question before the Committee. For about twenty years we have had in&#39; the Commonwealth a Public Service administrative system, at the head of which was one man as Commissioner. This Bill proposes to put there three men instead of one. That is a substantial alteration of the past policy of the Commonwealth. It is a radical departure from the existing system, and it behoves the Government who are introducing it to offer some justification for the change. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> has said, however interesting .it may be, has no hearing oh the question of whether there should be one man or three at the head of the Public Service. I do not suppose he argues that because we shall have a Board instead of a single Public Service Commissioner the members of that&#39; Board will step into the offices qf Ministers and relieve them of purely administrative work. </para>

It is quite competent for us to give the Public Service Commissioner .power to engage specialists for the different Departments where special skill, knowledge, or ability is required. Are we to assume that the members of the Board will travel round, and that one of them will inspect, for instance, dockyards or naval arsenals ? If we are to assume that, we  must also assume  that he will have the qualifications which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell&#39;s</inline> friend did not have. He might not have those &#39;qualifications. Then there are other activities which the Commonwealth will embark on, and which may require for anything like proper supervision of them, or proper check of their operations, special technical knowledge or skill. Are we to assume that the individual members of the Board, or any one of them, will have those special qualifications? The whole question before the Committee is whether we are to have one man as Public Service Commissioner) carrying out this Act. or &#34;whether we are to have three.

I fail to see that any justification has yet been given for such a radical departure from the practice and principles of the past. I have kept an absolutely open mind on this matter. Discussing it with honorable senators during the adjournment, I have frankly said that I have not made up my mind, and that I was waiting to hear what justification the Government had &#34;for departing from management by one Public Service Commissioner to management by a Board; and I must confess to a feeling of great disappointment in what has bean put forward by the Minister.

                <para class="block">Service by a Commissioner as by a Board of three. There is one feature in the appointment of a Board which we. cannot overlook. It will need increased cost of administration. The  chairman  of the Board will, at any rate, receive as much as the Public Service Commissioner has done in the past, if not more, and, I presume, the other two members of the Board will receive as much as the Public Service Commissioner has received in the past, if not more. Are we going to get value for the extra expenditure? </para>
                <para>SenatorThomas  pointed out that </para>
                <para class="block">Boards have been appointed before now in many big undertakings or enterprises in connexion with the Government, but that in most instances the principle of one-man responsibility has been reverted to. It is all a question of responsibility. When the responsibility is divided amongst the members of a Board, there is not the same means afforded to those who are aggrieved by the administration to &#34;sheet it home&#34; to the proper quarter. The system generates discontent. I have little doubt that if we adopted the principle of a Board for the Public Service, before twelve months had gone by we should have from many quarters in the Service urgent demands for the abolition of the Board and a return to management by a Public Service Commissioner. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> referred to New South Wales, where for some years the railways were administered by three Commissioners. Those three reached such a stage in their relations with one another that they spoke only when they met officially on the Board. The honorable senator also quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen,</inline> the ex-Minister of the Navy, as having recently said in evidence in Sydney, I suppose upon oath, that those carrying on Naval administration - the members of the Naval Board would not say &#34; Good day &#34; to one another in the street. What sort of organized administration could we expect from discordant units like that, when their normal attitude is one of antipathy and antagonism to one another, and when they work in unison only when they come to the Board table, and then do so under compulsion because they are bound to do it as a matter of duty?. I do not say that the three members of this </para>
                <para class="block">Board will necessarily behave in this way ; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> has given us two concrete instances where such discord and want of harmony existed. There is no means of &#34; sheeting home &#34; the responsibility. Sometimes, in connexion with Boards of this kind, one member takes one division of the work, and another another division, and so on. If a matter concerning a certain branch of the administration is referred to one of the members of the Board who does not take particular responsibility for that part of the work, he may frankly say, &#34; I really do not know very much about that; A attends to it;. I only attend to so-and-so.&#34; We have had that arrangement in connexion with railway management. One Railways Commissioner will probably confine himself almost entirely to transportation, while another devotes himself largely to the question of lines and equipment, and a third will deal with the officers themselves or with the general public. </para>

                        <para>- There is in this Bill no specific allocation of divisions of work and responsibility. I have waited to hear what was to be said in justification of this proposal, and I feel that, on what has come before us, we should hesitate before we submit the Commonwealth to the increased expenditure that it will necessarily entail, unless we are satisfied that we shall get from it something that we would not get without the appointment of a Board. I do not think the appointment of two extra men, making three in all, will lessen the employment of the staff of the Public Service Commissioner. I am inclined to believe that the official staff of the Board will be very much larger than the staff of a single Commissioner. I do not think we shall get a proportionate advantage from the new departure. Unless some more solid prospect is presented to us as likely to result from the adoption of the new principle, I shall feel compelled to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas&#39;</inline> amendment to leave the control of the Public Service administration in the hands of one officer - a Public Service Commissioner, or whatever he may be called. </para>

                    <para>. - I listened with a great deal of interest to the Minister&#39;s remarks. He spoke of the efficiency that a Board would command. I have had a considerable amount of experience with various Boards, and I know that Boards usually end in cliques, not only in the Public Service, but elsewhere. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> said that probably one man would deal with telephony and telegraphy and another with organization. In my opinion, it would be utterly futile and impossible to deal in that way with organization, which is an extraordinarily big question. If you have a machine, you employ experts to handle it, and that machine is designed specially to deal with the problem in hand. At present the Government are not going in for any system of scientific employment, nor do they put the same amount of care and thought into the engagement of men that they put into the buying of a machine. Is it thought that any one man on the Board can take up the question of organization? If we are to deal with organization in a thoroughly scientific manner, we must have laboratories, and efficiency engineers, and testing rooms. That system has been carried out in many of the great American corporations, and has produced phenomenal results. It can produce results equally phenomenal in the Public Service of Australia, if it is properly applied. Experts must first be appointed to deal with the question of scientific employment. I can quote the result in the case of one corporation in America. The clerks were tested, and it was found, after grading them, that a man had been getting &#163;500 per annum for ten years who was worth only &#163;200 per annum. That represented a waste of &#163;3,000 over that period. It is impossible for any one .Commissioner to do all this. In America, in carrying out this -system, they take first the weight and height; and, if the Blackford system is adopted, the colour of the hair, the colour of the eyes, and the width between the eyes. They learn also the lung pressure by the use of a spirometer. Each man tested has to blow into it to show exactly the quantity of air that he is capable of exhaling. This has been found of great practical use. For instance, a man cannot get into the United </para>

                <para>States Navy unless he can show 256 cubic inches pressure of air. </para>

                        <para>- -It is utterly impossible. The honorable senator is perfectly right. I am mentioning these matters to. show the futility of expecting any one man to deal with the whole of the organization. A considerable number of laboratories and of experts in those laboratories will be required, and the data obtained there will have to be collected and recorded. All those tests are necessary to ascertain physical qualities which are essential in certain members in various portions of the Public Service. Then you come to the psychological problems, and there you require&#34; psychological laboratories and experts. You must find out how much concentration a man can show. You must ascertain how dexterous he is. You ask him to take up pointers with one hand, and put them into holes in a board like a cribbage board, and next to do the same with the other hand, and then with both hands, and plot the results. You can then divide the number of people you have to deal with into those who are dexterous, or otherwise. Do honorable senators think that any one man, as Public Service Commissioner or as one member of a Board of three, or of five or six, can conduct work of that sort? Having got that far, a further step must then be taken. If the whole project is to be conducted by an organized method heads of Departments must also come within its scope. It would be futile to imagine how, if the head had not the energy, the personality, the reasoning power - the &#34; push,&#34; in fact - to conduct his administration, the Department itself could be  a live one. In the United States of America a series of tests is given in this direction. First, twenty simple questions are put, each requiring only one word for answer. The intention in this instance is to investigate the subject&#39;s speed of thought. Then further questions are given which involve patient analysis. Other tests follow which probe one&#39;s gifts of concentration, using deliberate interruptions with a view to ascertaining ability to concentrate. Dictation tests are given, with sudden stoppages, to require the person undergoing the test to  add up a sum, which, indicates concentration and  recovery from interruption. Efficiency is the one field in which the Government possess opportunities far and away beyond those belonging to private enterprise. If there is one man at the head, of affairs, or if there are fifty, there must still be laboratories and efficiency engineers, who will record and report. As for the merits of efficiency tests, seeing that they can provide mathematical results of human capacities and gifts of specialization, it must be seen that every member of the Public Service would have his fair opportunities of promotion, and of earning rewards in keeping with his qualifications.. One of the difficulties in the Service today is the Jack of efficiency, the absence of real organization, and the dearth of opportunities for brilliant young men to advance. Men of this latter type cannot see daylight ahead of them, in serving the public. The result is that, if they have any ambition, they get out and enter the ranks of private enterprise. They get away from the Public Service, which affords opportunities of advancement practically only by way of the retirement&#39; or death of seniors. In private employment, however, efficiency tells. Merit, however youthful, may make itself felt. A great opportunity is afforded the, Government to inaugurate efficiency tests and laboratory investigations. Only the Government can expend the necessary money upon the establishment of such a system. All that the Minister has said in support of the clause was perfectly .correct, but his arguments were more correctly applicable to the selection of one man than of three. With one man at the head, and ha vin sr an efficient card system so that he could lay Iris hand on any member of the Service, and. say with emphatic exactitude. &#34; Such and such are your. qualifications, and such and such is &#39;the position which they entitle you to hold,&#34; there could be brought about genuine efficiency and, at the same time, satisfaction throughout the Service. I support the amendment because I believe that to depart from the principle of having a single official at the head of affairs would not be for the benefit of the Commonwealth Service. </para>

                    <para>.- I have .listened with considerable interest to the two previous speakers, and I agree with a great deal of what has been said. I shall vote for the clause as it stands, however, because I believe that to have a number of men in control of the Public Service is better than to place authority within the autocratic power of one individual. One of the greatest needs of the Service is to foster contentment among its <inline font-style="italic">personnel.</inline> Such a sentiment does not exist to-day. Only by creating a general feeling of satisfaction can we hope to secure the greatest degree, of efficiency. Whether there are three or four or seven members of the Board it will be impossible for any one of them to become, or be regarded as, an expert in any of the various Departments and Branches of Departments. With a Board of three, however, there should be a better chance of bringing about good feeling towards the administration than in the case of one mau being given sole control. The reference to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company does not supply a fair illustration. </para>

                        <para>- That argument, of course, applies whether there be a Board of three or one .Commissioner. My chief point is that if there are three members, discussing questions affecting the Public Service their decisions will probably give greater satisfaction than a decision by one man. The appointment of three, therefore, will prove best in the interests both of the Service and of the general taxpayer. There is another consideration, namely, that if the Board is to consist of three, one of its members should be a. direct representative of the Public Service organizations. I do not suggest that this representative should be selected by popular vote, but that he should be the nominee of the High Council which, itself, is appointed by the Public Service Associations. There would certainly be a better feeling if the Service were given such a direct voice in its own affairs. I oppose the amendment, and shall endeavour to have the clause amended to provide that one of the three members of the Board shall be the nominee of the Public Service organizations. </para>

                    do not intend doing that; but I think it must be patent to every one who watches the progress of various Departments that more effective organization and better control would be the means of producing better returns. The Service has been under the control of a Public Service Commissioner or an Acting Commissioner for many years, and the Government are justified in introducing a. proposal which they believe will be an improvement on what we have had in the past. If the proposed Board does not do all we desire, I believe it will be the means of improving the Service in many directions, particularly if the Public Service has a representative on the Board. I listened with interest to the remarks of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline>
                    D. Millen, and I trust that the day will arrive when his desires will be gratified. Although his suggestions are very useful for future consideration, we have to act immediately if we desire to improve the Service, and that could not be done if we adopted the honorable senator&#39;s suggestion. At the entrance to this building a visitor is at once confronted with these wise words, &#34; In the multitude of counsellors there is safety.&#34;

                        <para>- I endeavoured to show that it was impossible for a Board constituted in this way to do what is intended. The Minister for Defence (SenatorPearce), in discussing a similar measure some time ago, said it would require the ablest business men in Australia to undertake the duties outlined in clause 15 of this measure; but, in addition to those duties, the proposed Board will also have other matters to control. A Board such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> D. Millen suggests would be absolutely hampered if it had to carry out the duties enumerated in this measure. We have been informed that it is practically impossible for Ministers to deal in detail with the multifarious duties they are expected to perform; but their duties are nothing when compared with those of a Public Service Commissioner. The Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> said that up-to-date methods were required in the Service, and that calculating and adding machines have been of inestimable value in compiling the census. I had the pleasure of introducing adding and multiplying machines in the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department in 1911, and, shortly afterwards, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fraser</inline> recommended the purchase of some more, so that eventually close on &#163;4,000 worth of machines were introduced in the Department. </para>

                        <para>- I was referring to the final report, in which the Commission replied to criticism. If, under  the Government proposal,  the <inline font-weight="bold">chairman</inline> of the Board is paid more than the other members, we may have two inferior men out voting the superior  chairman.  If the members of the Board are of equal ability, and are equally paid, they will differ amongst themselves. I strongly object to the proposal, especially if the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> is carried. I would have no objection to a direct representative of the public servants occupying a seat on the Board, but he should not be the nominee of any executive. He should be appointed as the result of a straight-out vote in his favour by the whole of the members of the Service. </para>

                        <para>- That is a matter of opinion, and I would not leave it to the organizations. If a member of the General Division, as the result of a vote of the whole of the Service, is appointed to the Board, he may have been a man previously in receipt of a salary of &#163;220 per year, but he will then be given the position of a member of the Board and will have an equal vote with the  chairman, who will be  selected,  it is  assumed, because he is the best and ablest man that the Government can find in Australia for the position. No mining company or big corporation desiring to secure efficiency in carrying on its operations would think of appointing three general managers who must discuss every proposal made until two out of the three are. of the same opinion. The Government proposal has been tried in Australia again and again&#34; and has been abandoned everywhere it has been tried. </para>

                        <para>- That would be autocracy. If one member of the Board  were  made supreme and  the  other  two were  merely  his  assistants, I should not have so much objection to offer, though I think that, in that case, we should be paying one assistant, practically, for nothing. If all three Commissioners are to have equal voting power and equal pay, the same man should not be chairman of the Board all the time. A big conference takes place every three or four years in America, known as the Methodist Episcopal Conference. There are only thirteen Bishops at the Conference, and each is allowed to occupy the chair for only one day. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that he has it at present. This proposal would give the Government an opportunity to associate with a man of good organizing power two men who have been successful in the business world. At present, the Commissioner may seek the advice of the heads of Departments, but they are concerned with their own particular work.I regard the Government proposal as an advance on the existing system, and I shall be prepared to vote for it, leaving myself free to support an amendment which would prevent any clashing or dissension between the members of the proposed Board. </para>

The Government in attempting to grapple with the difficulty invite constructive criticism, and if Senators Thomas, and J. D. Millen consider that the members of the proposed Board are likely to get at loggerheads amongst themselves, it is up to them to submit an amendment to obviate that difficulty. If they will not do so, I must support the Government proposal. </para>

                        <para>- From the talk we have heard about the Economies Commission&#39;s report, and the need for efficiency-, one might suppose that there was a general impression that no attempt had been made under the existing <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> to bring about economy. In the report of the Economies Commission, I find an account of a pile of papers comprising forty-nine foolscap pages containing numerous reports as to the existence of rats in various offices. There are reports of the rats and mice caught on various occasions, as well as a few suggestions to meet the trouble. A man appointed to catch rats in the General , Post Office in New South Wales was dismissed - according to a minute by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oxenham,</inline> which appears on the papers - because it was pointed out that this man was employed as a rat-catcher at 9s.7d. per day, that the number of rats he caught during 234 working days, was 814, equal, approximately, to 31/2 rats per. day, which works out at 2s. 9d. per rat. </para>

It will be impossible for the Board to do what is expected of them under clause 15, if they have appeals of that kind to put up with. It will be impossible for them to do what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator John</inline> D. Millen wants done in order to bring about efficiency in the Departments. I, therefore, ask that we should have one Commissioner to deal absolutely with the Service. If, then, another Board is suggested, which will in no way deal with the Public Service, but will have the right to go into the Departments and do what is required under clause 15, that is a different matter altogether. </para>

It has been pointed out that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company has a general manager. Above him there is a board of directors, but the directors do not individually take part in the details of management, although possibly certain directors take a special interest indifferent divisions of the company&#39;s activities. </para>
