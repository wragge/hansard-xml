            <para>- I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether his attention hasbeen called to a paragraph which appeared in yesterday morning&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> wherein the Premier of New South Wales is reported to have said that the closing down of the steel works at Newcastle, and the consequent throwing out of employment of between 300 and 400 men, was due to the studied indifference of the Federal Nationalist Government? I should like to know also whether it is a fact that, owing to the callousness of the Commonwealth Government, the steel industry of Australia is being crippled by the unrestricted importation of German steel disguised as the manufacture of another country, for which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dooley</inline> is reported to have said that the Commonwealth Government are responsible? Further, I should like to ask whether &#34; the soulless retrenchment &#34; of the Commonwealth Government is responsible for unemployment in New South Wales ? </para>

              <para>- I should have expected <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> to be one of the first to do so. I should like to remind the Senate of the fact, with which I have no doubt they are quite familiar, that the Government have made an effort to pass the Anti-Dumping Bill, and are continuing with that effort. Therefore, whatever responsibility attaches to any one in connexion with the matter, it cannot fairly or honestly be attributed to the Government for attempting to do the thing which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dooley</inline> condemns them for not doing. May I add that, if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dooley</inline> felt as sympathetically with regard to those who are unemployed as his words would suggest, he might, at least, have relieved some of the unemployment in New South Wales by reinstating in the State Government works at Walsh Island the men who were dismissed from those works a little time ago? </para>

            <para>Sergeant Stott received instructions to destroy all citrus trees under Plants Diseases Ordinance. Authorities are not considering distance Darwin here. Most of residents strongly protest against instructions issued. Your Committee seen trees and had fruit. All trees wonderfully healthy owing climatic conditions. These trees give our kiddies only fresh fruit available. If this drastic action necessary, why not give us same privilege as given Darwin residents? </para>

            <para>- Representations were made during the absence of the Prime Minister in England by the British Acting Consul-General at Batavia to the effect that a contract which had been let in Australia for a supply of castiron water pipes to a private firm in Java had to be cancelled owing to the serious delay which occurred in the delivery of the goods. As the contract was one which had been entered into with the Government Dockyard, Newcastle, the attention of the Premier of New South Wales was drawn to the matter. A reply was re ceived to the effect that the reasons for the non-completion of the contract were not within the control of the Dockyard or the Government. There had been a series of strikes and stoppages, and the same general industrial dislocation, as existing elsewhere, affected the State of New South Wales. There have been complaints regarding the supply of inferior material under the above contract. </para>

            <para>.- When the debate was adjourned last week I was venturing to criticise the Government for the expenditure of loan money from the Consolidated Revenue in comparison! with the amount which had been spent for a similar purpose in the previous year. I directed attention to the fact that under the statement of the Treasurer on the 30th June, 1921, there was a sum of &#163;8,114,000 available for works from money which had already been voted by Parliament, asd that of that sum &#163;7,000,000 was to be paid into the Consolidated Revenue. I want now briefly to refer to one or two matters in the Bill. According to the Treasurer&#39;s statement, on the 30th June there was &#163;1,114,000 in excess of &#163;7,000,000, about which I asked for information, available for works which had already been voted by Parliament, but under this Bill the W given as already available under appropriations previously made is &#163;669,000, a difference of &#163;400,000. It occurs to me that either one of two things is possible. Either the &#163;400,000 representing the difference between the amount available under former appropriations has been spent since the beginning of this year, or that the money was voted for works which the Government do not intend to proceed with this year. Whichever it is, it seems to me that under this Bill, which provides not only for a further appropriation of over &#163;8,250,000, but also for the &#163;669,000 previously mentioned, we should ascertain exactly what our loan expenditure is likely to be this year and what has been done with that &#163;400,000. I admit that my question may have been dictated partly by ignorance, but I defy any one to reconcile the Treasurer&#39;s statement on 30th June with the amount mentioned in this Bill. There are two or three other points on which information could be given, one of which is in connexion with the appropriations which have been made for land for the Post and Telegraph Department and for defence purposes. The Treasurer&#39;s statement to the 30th June shows that &#163;67,737 has previously been made available for the purchase of land for the Post and Telegraph Department; but in the second column of the schedule a sum of &#163;25,000 appears. In connexion with the Defence Department it is shown in the Treasurer&#39;s statement that the money &#39;available for land was &#163;11,285 15s. 4d., and under this Bill it appears as &#163;11,286. The difference is only small, but it makes it difficult for one to compare the figures. In the same statement an amount of &#163;402 is shown as being available for quarantine purposes, and under this Bill &#163;100 is being appropriated. The latter amount may be for some specific item, and the intention may be to spend only &#163;100 out of the &#163;400 previously mentioned. In view of these circumstances it is difficult to make a comparison, and I trust that, when the Bill is in Committee, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> will be able to give information on these points. </para>

A number of statements have been made in connexion with the agreement between the Commonwealth and the British Government. I understand that the British Government have now expressed their willingness to withdraw from the agreement, and thus allow the Commonwealth to continue the operations on their own account.

            <para>. - The amount represents a subscription to capital of the Refining Company in accordance with the Oil Agreement Act of 1920. An arrangement had been entered into <inline font-style="italic">vnffy</inline> the British Government to develop the oil fields in Papua, but the British Government are now anxious to withdraw from the arrangement, because the prospects do not appear to be satisfactory. A rich discovery of oil has recently been made in Dutch territory, and as there is only an imaginary line between that territory and the land on which the Commonwealth representatives are operating, there is every prospect of oil being discovered. The Dutch are actually producing oil in commercial quantities. If oil is discovered, it will belong to Australia, and not to the partnership which previously existed. </para>

            <para>. - It is quite necessary that the Commonwealth, Government should do everything possible to encourage desirable immigrants. There is a considerable staff established in the Old Country for the purpose of advising people desirous of proceeding to Australia, and I understand that the Government have officers in some of the States for the; purpose of seeing that immigrants are looked after until employment is found for them. In certain States, however, the State Governments have declined to permit Commonwealth officers to have anything to do with the immigrants. That is a very unsatisfactory position. The Commonwealth should not throw its responsibilities upon the States. </para>

              <para>- That does not improve the position. The Commonwealth should be responsible for them, for at any rate one year. It is true that the Commonwealth Government have no land, unless the immigrants are placed on Federal territory, and there is apparently no effort being made to do that. The States may not do the right thing towards the immigrants, and so the Commonwealth is nc* relieved of its responsibility. We hear of families and of individuals, who have not been very hospitably received as immigrants, and they have returned to the Old Country at the first opportunity. The States are not recognised in Great Britain, the Commonwealth authorities being entirely responsible. Immigrants who return dissatisfied give a very unfavorable report concerning Australia, and such people will do much to damage the reputation of the Commonwealth. I do not suggest that  the  States will not do the best they can, but it is the duty of the Commonwealth to see that the States do the fair thing towards immigrants in the matter of accommodating them en arrival, and assisting them to find employment. This work devolves as much, if not more, upon the Commonwealth than upon the States. </para>

            <para>. - No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland&#39;s</inline> absence for some time in the Northern Territory and in Central Australia accounts for his remarks. There are certain difficulties to be contended with in connexion with immigration. In the first place the Commonwealth has practically no land, and will have none unless millions are expended in opening up out-back country by railway communication and by other means. We are entirely dependent upon the States. Before launching out on the scheme we held conferences with representatives of the States. The conditions laid down were that the Commonwealth Government was to bring the immigrants out and pay the overseas expenses and the cost of their passages. They were to be received at the different Australian ports by the State authorities, who undertook to settle them on the land. There was a second condition that the Commonwealth should obtain immigrants according to requests made by the States. Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia have made requests, but New South Wales and Queensland have not done so, and they say, quite candidly, that they have enough unemployed in their States already, and that they da not think the present time is opportune for bringing immigrants out. This means that immigration is confined to three States. If a State decides that it does not want immigrants because of unfavorable industrial conditions, or for other reasons, it would be foolish to attempt to force them to take on the responsibility. They are as much interested, and are as much Australian, as the rest of us, and they have as much right to express their opinions. The Commonwealth cannot settle immigrants on the land. We have no lands to open up suitable for agriculture, and I am not in favour of dumping people down in this country in an irresponsible way. </para>

              <para>- That is so, but we have some powers in that connexion. We have the power to tax land within the States, and that taxing power may be used to compel the States, even against their will, to make land available for immigrants. I am not saying that in a threatening way. It is a difficult problem, and all the States are not co-operating. It has to be remembered that there is not now a War Precautions Act, and therefore legislation has to be framed in accordance with the Constitution. The Commonwealth has not the power to take land from the States, The only power it has is the power of taxation. The Government is as much worried by this proposition as are honorable senators. We think that we have not had a fair deal from some of the States, but we are determined to get more people to Australia in order to lighten the burden of taxation and assist production. </para>

The matter needs careful thought and investigation with a view to bringing special knowledge to bear to overcome the difficulties. With regard to the immigration staffs in the different Australian ports, the Commonwealth have none except at Fremantle, where we had to appoint officers. A vessel may come out with a mixed load, destined partly for Western Australia and partly for the other States. The agents of the Western Australian Government take charge only of those immigrants who are intended for Western Australia. The Commonwealth Government, therefore, had to place some one at Fremantle to take charge of the immigrants for the other States. The Western Australian Government could not be expected to look after men and women who were going to South Australia or Victoria. </para>

              <para>- We cannot ask the Western Australian Government to look after people who are intended for Queensland. If the States will do the work the Commonwealth is quite prepared to get out and let them do it; but they are not doing it. Some one has to bring the immigrants to South Australia, or to Victoria, where they are officially handed over to the control of the State Governments. It has been said that certain immigrants have returned to the Old Country, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland&#39;s</inline> remarks in that connexion were, I think, unfair to Australia. All these allegations have been investigated, and it has been found that the allegedly dissatisfied immigrants were people who had come out here and prospered, and were returning for a visit to the Old Country. During the war period, when very high fares were charged, they could not make the trip. Investigations have shown that large numbers of these cases were immigrants who caine out to this country ten or twelve years ago, and, so far from being &#34; grizzlers &#34; or &#34; growlers,&#34; they had prospered so well that they were able to take a trip to England to see their friends and relatives. It was stated that on one boat there were &#34; hundreds &#34; of immigrants returning home.&#39; There were, but they were not disappointed immigrants, but men and women who had done well. </para>

Then it is anticipated that there will be 7,000 advances of an average of &#163;10, making a total of &#163;70,000. It is estimated that repayments in the first year will amount to &#163;34,000. The balance of &#163;36,000, with the amount of &#163;126,000 for passages, makes up the amount of the vote - &#163;162,000. </para>

              <para>- Yes. The immigrants will be taxpayers and producers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> pointed out what is being done at Mildura, Merbein, and Red Cliffs in the formation of new settlements. The land at Merbein cost &#163;10 per acre, and to-day it is worth &#163;200 per acre. Most of the settlers are returned soldiers. The Commonwealth might very well undertake to back settlers in those places with &#163;20 or &#163;30. To-day Red Cliffs is being irrigated from the Murray, and a most important centre is being established there. </para>

              <para>- It is a public duty to encourage immigration, and we cannot at present pay for everything out of revenue. Every country in the world has borrowed money to obtain immigrants. New South Wales and Canada have both borrowed money for that purpose. The Government propose to carry out  a  deliberately considered policy, with which the State Governments promised full co-operation. I do not say that the scheme will be  a  wonderful success, but we are endeavouring to secure some direct control which will enable us to give effect to  a  policy which I am satisfied is indorsed by the great majority of the people. I do not advocate bringing to Australia the unemployed of London  or  other places, but I do say that every worthy citizen who desires to come to Australia should be encouraged to do so. </para>

              <para>- Yes. The Act makes provision that if the Commonwealth Government can supply indigenous oil to the Refinery Company, they must do so, but until they do so the Persian Oil Company must supply the refinery with a certain quantity of oil annually. I should like to know what steps have been taken towards the erection of the refinery, which  is the first step in the &#39;business. It is in theRefinery Company that the Commonwealth Government is the largest shareholder. They hold the balance of voting power, in order that they may control the operations of the company. If the proposed vote is for the erection of the refinery, I am satisfied. </para>

          <para>I should like to say a word or two on the immigration: question. I listened attentively to what was said by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> and also to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland.</inline> I agree with a great deal that has been said. Care must be exercised with regard to the class of immigrants who are induced to come to Australia. I was very sorry to hear to-day that the Commonwealth Government are not being given the whole-hearted cooperation of the State Governments which they expected would be given in carrying out their joint immigration policy. I find it difficult to understand why the Governments of two States, which offer as good &#39;facilities as any other State in the Commonwealth for the settlement of immigrants, have gone cold on the pro- posal. I hope that an effort will be made b y the Commonwealth Government to bring about another conference with representatives of the State Governments at the earliest possible vmoment to deal with this important question. It is vital to the Commonwealth that its immigration policy should be a real, and not merely a paper, policy. The carrying out of a progressive policy of immigration should be very helpful in enabling Australia to meet its obligations. Some reference has been made to the payment of expenditure upon immigration out of loan money. I am not satisfied that the policy which the Government are adopt ing in this regard is a good one. I think that we should devote . loan money to reproductive works as they are generally understood. </para>

              <para>- It has been said that other countries have borrowed money to give effect to their immigration policies, but I think it cannot be shown that they have paid the passage money of immigrants out of loan. I think the Minister will find, if he investigates the matter, that loan moneys appropriated for the furtherance of immigration policies in other countries have been expended in preparing land for immigrants. That is a sound business undertaking. </para>

              <para>- I have no desire to throw cold water on the immigration policy of the Government, but one may criticise the methods adopted to give it effect. I think that if loan moneys were more extensively used in carrying out public works we should be able to find sufficient money from revenue to pay for assisted passages of immigrants. We have hitherto been hampering the progress of the Commonwealth by imposing unnecessarily heavy burdens on the taxpayers to find revenue for the construction of public works, which ought to be constructed from loan. I believe that close investigation of our finances would disclose the fact that we could meet the cost of assisted passages of immigrants from revenue. When I was a member of the Tasmanian Parliament some time ago, the State Government launched out upon amoderate immigration policy, but not a single penny was borrowed by Tasmania to pay assisted passages of immigrants. </para>

              <para>- That does not affect the principle. I admit that a passage may cost twice as much to-day as it did some years ago, but our revenue is twice as large as it was a few years ago, and our taxpayers are paying very much more than twice as much taxation as they paid a few years ago. </para>

              <para>- I am not suggesting that we should have increased taxation to pay for immigration. I believe that we could easily find the money required out of revenue if we carried out more of our reproductive public works with loan money than we do to-day. In this connexion I might say that I would regard the construction of Commonwealth offices as a reproductive work. They would be worth so much each year to the Government since, without them, rent would have to be paid for the accommodation they would provide. I hope that during the recess the Government, will look into the question of financing their immigration policy, outside of land development, from revenue as far as possible. </para>

            <para>. - I do not know that I would have taken part in this debate if it had not been for the speech delivered by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell).</inline> It is quite possible that the honorable senator would deny the interpretation I put upon his remarks. It seemed to me that he metaphorically patted &#34;Victoria and the other stagnant States on the back because they are prepared to take immigrants, whilst progressive States, such as Queensland &#39;and New South Wales, are not prepared to take immigrants. If there is one thing that is injuring Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania more than another, it is that attitude of mind. They think that because they are not increasing their public debt they are doing splendidly, whereas if they look facts in the face they must realize that dry rot has set in, because they are not attracting additional population. Compare the position of a business man who went on increasing his overdraft, filling his warehouses with goods, and with customers crushing into his retail establishments to purchase his commodities, with that of another complacent business man. satisfied not to add to his overdraft, and happy in the thought that it was not costing him any more to run his business now than twenty years ago. The former, of course, would be progressive and prosperous, whilst the latter would be on the high rood of decadence. And that is the position of these States which are not adding to their population. </para>

That cannot be said of the other States.

In 1881 Victoria had a papulation of 861,000, as compared with New South Wales 749,000- well over 100,000 ahead of the Mother State; but at the end of the race, that is, on 4th April this year, New South Wales had 2,099,000 people, as against Victoria&#39;s population of 1,500,000. Not only had New South Wales made up the heavy leeway, but had really outdistanced Victoria with all its wealth, because it is well known that the speculative &#39;wealth in Australia has been largely centred in Victoria. </para>

              <para>- Although one is inclined to laugh at such an argument, still it requires answering. Therefore, I shall compare South Australia and Queensland, two representative States, because prior to the Commonwealth taking over the Northern Territory the area of South Australia was greater than that of Queensland. During the period 1881 tb 1921 Queensland not only picked up her deficit in population of 66,000, but is now leading South Australia by practically 300,000. These facts speak for themselves. South Australia, too, we are told, has all the culture, and Victoria all the wealth and business ability. Those responsible for the government of these States should look for the reasons for this state of affairs. Apparently they think that because they are not heavily in debt they are running along progressive lines. I am trying to show that they are poor, and do not know it. </para>

              <para>- I am glad of the Minister&#39;s explanation. It bears out what I have said. Tasmania, which, I believe, is a most beautiful spot, and altogether a very desirable place in which to live, is not at all in a satisfactory position. I find that the natural increase of population for the last census period was 36,000, but departures exceeded arrivals by 13,000. There is only one reason for this deplorable state of affairs, and that is bad government. Make no mistake about that. Men who come to this country from any other part of the world will settle in the most desirable part of the Commonwealth - the place that offers them the most advantages. The other States, as I have shown, are not progressing from a population point of view at the same rate as New South Wales and Queensland. Of course, representatives from those States will say that we want immigration, but it is significant that the States which are not asking for immigrants are attracting people there all the time.. I venture to say that a considerable portion of the 13,000 people representing the excess of departures over arrivals in Tasmania are to be found in New South Wales. </para>

            <para>. - When previously dealing with the question of immigration I must have expressed my thoughts somewhat indifferently, because the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(&#39;Senator Russell)</inline> quite misunderstood my meaning. I would be the last to damage Australia in the eyes of other people, or to say anything to injure any particular State. The progress of one portion of Australia really means the success of the whole Commonwealth, and while we are anxious to see every uninhabited portion of Australia settled by desirable immigrants, I am not going to advance the claims of one State as against those of another., The Minister was evidently under the impression that I was confusing &#34; trippers &#34; with immigrants. I know that quite a large number of people journeyed to Great Britain after the cessation of hostilities as soon as passages could be secured, and by no stretch of imagination could they be regarded as returning immigrants. It is true that many of them had been in Australia and had achieved success, as is common to all who devote their ability and energies to their work. Many desired to visit their Old homes, and, perhaps, some intended to return later, in which case, of course, they would have to find their own passage money. These were not the type of men to whom I referred. I was dealing with those who came to Australia, and who remained only a few weeks. I have been informed that in some instances whole families have returned within a short period of their arrival. </para>

              <para>- That may be so, but half-a-dozen farmers in a progressive country district would be of more use in placing immigrants on the land. I am&#39; particularly anxious that the Commonwealth should keep in touch with the Local Committees so that immigrants may know where there are possibilties of finding employment. I do not believe in coddling and spoon-feeding men who come to Australia, because those who are seeking fortunes in a new land should be prepared to &#34; battle &#34; their way and face adversity as others have done. It is very difficult, however, for those who land here, where there is more or less unemployment in the cities, to gain any knowledge of the vastness of the continent and the direction in which to seek employment without some assistance. I cannot be accused of coddling immigrants merely because I suggested that they should be directed to centres where they can find work, and where they can also find people who will treat them as desirable citizens. </para>

            <para>. -  The point originally raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> had reference to the overlapping of the Commonwealth and State activities. The Federal Government endeavoured to place Commonwealth immigration officers in every State, including South Australia, but the Government in that State resisted, with the result that no Commonwealth immigration officer is stationed there. The work, however, is being very thoroughly performed by a South Australian official, who meets the immigrants on their arrival and sees that they are properly cared for. To place a Commonwealth officer where a State officer is already doing the work is a duplication of service and quite unnecessary, and it is such duplication which we should endeavour to avoid. </para>

            <para>.- In connexion with the question of immigration I desire to refer to the boys from the Barnardo Home in Great Britain, from which institution a number of lads recently arrived. These boys, many of whom were war orphans, were brought to Australia in charge of an official attached to that institution, and while the vessel was in port I had the pleasure of inspecting the boys. The lads were very much above the average, and, in my opinion, are the type of immigrants who should be encouraged. I have had a good deal to do with young people, and, after carefully studying these boys, came to the conclusion that they were, not only  a  credit to the Barnardo Institution,  but  would, in all probability, prove a credit to Australia. These youths comprised the first batch despatched by the institution, and I do not know why a large number should not settle in Australia, as many have done in Canada. The reports from that Dominion show that the boys have made good, and that during the war a. large number volunteered for active service. </para>

              <para>- Yes; and the institution could send as many to Australia. During the war period the incomes of a majority of the people in Great Britain were heavily reduced owing to increased taxation, and consequently the contributions to the institutions are much less than they were previously. Those in charge of the Barnardo Homes are anxious that the boys should leave the institution at an earlier age, because of the lack of funds at their disposal. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roberts,</inline> an officer attached to the institution, was in charge of the youths, and when he approached them there were expressions of animation and apparent delight, instead of fear. They regarded him as a father, and not as an official. I believe the authorities in control of the institution are anxious for arrangements to be made under which large numbers can emigrate to Australia, and it is to be hoped that the Government will do all they  can  to assist. In New South Wales, a farmer has given his farm and homestead to the institution, and when it is taken over by, I presume, a Local Committee, the boys will be moved direct from the ship to the farm, where they will be trained under Australian conditions, and found homes and employment on adjoining farms. If work of this character is extended, thousands of boys could be brought to Australia and made useful citizens.&#39; The boys soon adapt themselves to the new conditions, and they have no desire to return to Great Britain. It would be advisable for the Commonwealth authorities to get into touch with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Barnardo&#39;s</inline> Institution, for the purpose of securing a regular supply of these useful immigrants, who would quickly become thorough Australians. I have heard of several instances of ex-Imperial Servicemen coming out with their families and returning disgruntled. They had a certain amount of money, and after remaining in Australia for a while, they expressed dissatisfaction with the- conditions here. A certain number of them never had any intention of making Australia their home. I know of no State that has so much suitable land available for the settlement of immigrants as Queensland. The Burnett scheme is a good one, because that land is of exceptionally good quality,  and is close to the railway and to ports; but there is plenty of other land which is equally, as suitable for settlement. My principal reason for rising was to point out the wisdom of encouraging the bringing out of the Barnardo boys. </para>

I have no objection to loan money being expended on immigration. It would be just as good a revenue-producing proposition as many of the so-called reproductive works that areconstructed out of loan funds. </para>

            <para>. -  Owing to the unfortunate standing order which prevents one from speaking for more than a given length of time at one period, I have to address the Chair again for the purpose of continuing the comparison I was making between thepopulations of the various States. A State must either progress or go back,, and we have the unfortunate spectacle of South Australia and Tasmania losing headway. The most common-sense, virile,, and enterprising people will make towards the most prosperous States. In the ten years from 1911 to 1921, 13,880 more, people left Tasmania than went into it. Considering that that State is, perhaps,, the most beautiful spot in Australia, and has a wonderfully fertile soil, such a loss in population is most serious. The island is rich in minerals and natural resources,, and the climatic conditions are as good as are to be experienced anywhere in the world. </para>

              <para>- Yes. While that State lost 13,880 persons, the excess of arrivals over departures in New South Wales for the same period was 134,273. Queensland and New South Wales are progressive States. Although Victoria&#39;s population in 1911 was 1,315,334 as against Queensland&#39;s 605,664, the excess of arrivals over departures in Queensland was 30,891 for the ten-year period referred to, as against Victoria&#39;s excess of 35,447. What is helping Queensland and New South Wales is that the best settlers have gone there, and the best are still going there. The stay-at-homes are those who say that what was sufficient in matters of government for their fathers is good enough for them. The general drift of population used to be westward, but now the people are going to the northern States. It is not a question merely of finding land ; there are other reasons why New South Wales and Queensland are progressing, and one of those reasons is the industrial conditions. </para>

              <para>- The pendulum is swinging the other way now. The latest figures show a decrease in Western Australia, and the population is drifting to New South Wales and Queensland. This morning I travelled for nearly 200 miles through rich fertile country in Victoria. I saw towns along the railway line, but scarcely a human soul. So far as the eye could reach there was not a man to be seen at work. </para>

              <para>- Yes. Sheep are more profitable than human beings. The sheep and cattle are all very well in their way, but I venture to say that a rich State like Victoria, instead of saying &#34; We are happy that we are not increasing our taxation,&#34; ought to be ashamed of itself. It is like a business man being happy because he is not stocking up his warehouse and increasing his debt to put new &#39;goods in. If Victoria continues along that road, it is ruined. I want to quote a word or two from a high authority in the Labour movement a few years ago - from <inline font-style="italic">The Case for Labour,</inline> by W. M. Hughes, M.H.R. He deals rather pertinently with this question, and not in a party spirit. It is an excellent argument in support of the Labour case, and it ought to be put. One could almost put the Labour case on any question likely to be discussed in this House by quoting this book. The man who knows most about the case on the other side will know best how to defeat &#34;the other&#39; fellow,&#34; so I suppose <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> talents will now be directed to putting the clock back. Under the heading of &#34; Immigration arid Unemployed Men,&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> in March, 1910, said - </para>

            <para>I am not now concerned with the wisdom of such a policy in itself, although, as something has been recently said about the attitude of the Labour party towards it, I propose in another article to make clear what that attitude really is; but nothing can well be more inconsistent with the advocacy of immigration than the neglect to utilize the whole of the available labour an the community. To cry for more men and decline to employ those already here is folly, or worse. The argument used by those who advocate immigration is that population is essential to prosperity. Their contention that every normal man, woman, and child are most valuable assets to the wealth of any country, and, in particular, to new ones, seems at first sight undeniable, and under right conditions is so. But it does not fit in with facts as we know them. The unemployed man is everywhere. He is the disease of modern civilization. He is, likewise, its paradox. All wealth comes from labour, yet the richer the country the greater the number of unemployed men. Recently, in America, there were estimated to bc 5,000,000 unemployed. Last week, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Winston</inline></para>
            <para class="block">Churchill, President of the Board of Trade, admitted there were more unemployed in Great Britain than in Germany. In Melbourne, last week, a number of unemployed men burst into Parliament House in order to compel attention to their distress. </para>

          <para class="block">That statement is true to-day. We have to face the question of bringing men to this country side by side with the problem of employing them when they get here, and of employing the men who are already here. If we had the same social organization and the same powers directed to settling people in this country that we employed to organize men for war purposes, we could absorb with ease 100,000,000 people, who could be prosperous and well employed. When it comes to employing people, we are up against that section of the community which say9, &#34; These things must be left to private enterprise.&#34; </para>

Although he may be misunderstood and not understood, and although his official position may bring him into disagreement with people in authority, we have to judge him on the work he is doing, and he is doing that work extremely well. If he were not doing it so well as he is he would not annoy the honorable senator so much. We are told that we must have more people in order to hold this country. If chat is so, and if it is really a defence proposition, why does not the Government put the necessary money into it? Why does it not say, &#34;We will have 100,000 more men here next year, and we will have them employed, and until we get them, we will employ the 100,000 who are now unemployed in Australia.&#34; It is for the Government to do these things, or fail. If they fail, another Government must come along and take their place, and the sooner that happens, the better I will like it. </para>

There are Government offices scattered all over Sydney, and enormous rents have to be paid fox them. It is considered that it would be much cheaper and much more comfortable to concentrate all the offices in one building. It would be an enormous saving as compared with the rents we are paying to-day. The sum of &#163;25,000 is the total purchase money for the block which it is proposed to acquire in Philipstreet. The position in Melbourne is even worse than in Sydney. The Government is wasting large sums of money that ought to be put into buildings in the Federal Capital. The land referred to in the Federal Capital Territory is land which contains limestone suitable for making cement. It is known as Fairy Meadows, It is not actually part of the Federal Territory, but is adjacent to it. A lot of cement will be required for building the Capital, and the land is necessary to provide the limestone required for the manufacture of the cement. We have arrived at a settlement in regard to three blocks, and negotiations for three other blocks are pending. When the Commonwealth has acquired the land, it will be made part of the Federal Territory. The land has been the subject of a complicated case in the Courts. The Commonwealth Government claimed to be exempt from paying for minerals, but both the High Court and the Privy Council have determined that the Government must pay for the limestone, in addition to paying the ordinary value of the land.

            <para>.- I must again raise my voice in protest against the proposed vote of &#163;200,000  towards  the cost of the establishment  of  the Federal Capital at Canberra. Last year we passed a vote of &#163;150,000 for this purpose, which, I believe, was to be paid from revenue. This year we have descended to borrowing money in order to push  on with works at the Federal Capital. This will mean that) we shall be called upon to pay an annual sum for interest on the borrowed money expended there. I think that the action of the Government is quite unjustifiable in proposing  in  a time of financial stringency to borrow money for this purpose. I am aware that, in the absence of my fellow senators representing Victoria, I cannot expect to get much support in my opposition to this vote. </para>

            <para>.- The proposed vote for works to be carried out under the control of the Department of Works and Railways is a very large one. It covers many important items about which we should be given the fullest information. The sum of &#163;272,476 is proposed to be expended this year at Canberra, but this amount includes &#163;72,476 appropriated last year-. I do not adopt any antagonistic attitude towards this particular item, but I want information as to how the money is to be expended. If it can be shown that this sum is absolutely necessary in order to carry out works which have been undertaken, and which must be completed, if we are to prevent heavy loss to the Commonwealth, there will be no opposition to the item from me. I have visited Canberra twice, and have been very much interested in the work going on there. Some excellent preliminary work has been done. If the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> is provided with a statement showing how the proposed vote is to be spent, I hope he will give the fullest information on the subject to the Committee. I shall defer remarks upon other items covered by the total vote until the Committee has been given information as to the way in which the vote proposed for Canberra is to be spent. </para>

            <para>. - I may say, iti answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> request for information concerning the Research Laboratory at Maribyrnong, that in former years there used to be a good deal of talk about the building of an Arsenal in the centre of Australia. The experience of the war has shown that it would be a mistake to attempt the establishment of a new industrial city for any such purpose. It has been shown that it is much better that we should have complete records of all factories in the Commonwealth which might be made available in war time for the manufacture of munitions of war. That is the practice which was followed&#39; in Great Britain, and it is now proposed that it should be adopted here. Such works must be established where labour is available. We have decided that these works should in the first instance be established at a very suitable site, adjacent to the Cordite Factory. Part of the vote proposed is required to finish works undertaken, and to pay for machinery that has not yet been delivered. This vote really represents the second year&#39;s instalment required to give effect to a programme making provision for the manufacture of munitions, which it is anticipated will take five years to complete. It should be borne in mind by honorable senators that the proposed vote for this purpose is subject to review, as a consequence of reductions of expenditure promised in another place, and amounting to nearly &#163;500,000. </para>

            <para>. - From the statement made by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> it is quite clear that if we agree to the proposed vote for the Maribyrnong Factory for the manufacture of high explosives, we shall be committed to such additional expenditure for this adjunct of defence as may, from time to time, be shown to be necessary. The policy of the Government has changed in recent years. Some years ago we sent a. Commission to India for the purpose of studying the very latest practice, and the advice tendered by that Commission was that the Arsenal should be established in the Federal Capital area. Exhaustive inquiries were made by the Public Works Committee, of which I was a member, with the result that a substantial sum was voted on the Estimates for the erection of the Arsenal and munition works at Canberra as against the Maribyrnong site. Judging by the proposed outlay at Maribyrnong it is clear that the policy of the Government as <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the location of the Arsenal has since, been reversed. The Minister has told us that the experience of the war is responsible for this. Perhaps it is, but I should like to know if. the Maribyrnong area is within range of heavy gun fire from the open sea. If it is the danger is twofold. We know that wherever the Arsenal may be placed it may be attacked from the air, but if it is  within range of big-gun fire from sea then we shall be exposing ourselves to a double risk. </para>

              <para>- In that case it should be quite safe from attack by sea, for the present, at all events, and I shall have nothing further to say on that point except that if the Arsenal could be established in the Federal Territory without disadvantage from the point of view of the Treasury, or any interference with economy in operation, there is no reason why it should not be located there. We shall be spending a large sum of the taxpayers&#39; money on this establishment, and if it is at Canberra the expenditure will tend to enhance the value of Commonwealth property, not property in the hands of private individuals, as may be the case at Maribyrnong. The late David Syme, in his earlier years, figured out what it would mean to the people of Victoria if the whole area upon which the city of Melbourne is situated were public property and not privately owned. If, some years ago, the reasons in favour of establishing the Arsenal at Canberra were sound, they ought to be equally sound to-day. But the Government are committed to a change of policy. Unless there are strong reasons why the Arsenal should not be erected at Canberra, I do not approve of the change. </para>

            <para>. -  I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that wherever possible Commonwealth activities should be located at Canberra, because the enhancement of Commonwealth property by the expenditure of Government money will be very important. I may point out, however, that the Cordite Factory was established at Maribyrnong in 1910. It is really one of the  be6t  sites that . could have been selected. It is on what is known as the old Maribyrnong race-course, is surrounded by hills, and the Commonwealth own the land on both sides of the Saltwater River. On the right hand there are paddocks for exercising remounts, and on the other side is the Common.wealth military horse-breeding station, known as the old C. B. Fisher Estate. It will be seen, therefore, t&#62;at expenditure of money at Maribyrnong will enhance property already in the hands of the Commonwealth Government. As the result of experience gained during the war, the Government deem it advisable not to establish an expensive Arsenal at Canberra. In practice it has been found that the best way to insure a steady flow of munitions in time of war is to organize all private engineering firms and have an accurate record of all classes of suitable machinery that may be made available for the manufacture of mum-  tions. </para>

Notwithstanding the recommendation made by the Public Works Committee that the Arsenal should be established at Canberra, the Government have deemed it essential, as a result of actual experience gained during the war, to have such works  in  proximity to a large industrial population; otherwise, when labour is most needed, it will be unobtainable. </para>

              <para>- I am placing my views before the Committee, and not endeavouring to answer the honorable senator&#39;s questions, as that is the duty of the Minister. In regard to the expenditure on the Maribyrnong Factory, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> referred to a report submitted by certain officers  9ent  abroad to investigate work of this description. At that time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> was a member of the Public Works Committee, and, speaking from memory, I think the Committee, after investigating the site at Canberra, recommended that the Arsenal be erected on the M&#39;urrumbidgee, in the Federal Capital Territory. A few years later I was a member of the Public Works Committee which inquired into the&#39; construction- of a railway to the Arsenal site on the Murrumbidgee, and the line was recommended. I do not know if the Government have ever given a satisfactory reason for deciding to erect the Arsenal at Maribyrnong instead of at Canberra; but it would be futile to consider the construction of munition works in the Federal Territory until a reasonable population had gathered there. Probably the erection of a plant will follow reasonable settlement at Canberra, but that would mean delaying construction and the provision of the necessary munitions until Canberra was well established, which is impracticable. </para>

In moving the second reading of the Bill I submitted a list of the various works to be undertaken to honorable senators representing Western Australia, because I thought they would be particularly interested. Eight new homes are to be erected at Port Augusta, and twenty-two others at various points along the line for the accommodation of the staff. It is intended to pursue that policy as funds permit. Ballasting is also being done, and a large stretch is being undertaken this year. That work will also be continued as rapidly as money is available for the purpose. </para>

              <para>- That is not a suburb of Sydney. There is an item of &#163;5,000 for the construction of engineering factories at Maribyrnong. We already have a Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, which is a huge establishment, replete with almost the whole of the engineering devices necessary for the manufacture of machinery or anything the Defence Department may require, and I remind the Minister that the Government recently discharged a large number of returned soldiers working there on the plea that there was insufficient work available at that Factory to employ them. Although the Factory is complete, men are being discharged, and on top of that the Government intend spending an initial sum of &#163;5,000 for the establishment of an engineering works elsewhere. </para>

              <para>- The establishment there could be reached within fortyeight hours after an invading force had landed. To reach Lithgow or Canberra would be an entirely different proposition, and one of the chief reasons for selecting Lithgow was that it was peculiarly adapted for the purpose from a defence point of view. It would be practically impossible for an invading force to interfere with the production at the Lithgow Factory, and supplies would be available at all times. If the Government were in earnest in this matter, they could extend the Factory or utilize the plant already lying idle. It is said that Maribyrnong is adjacent to a large centre of population, and that it will be unnecessary to send men there. </para>

              <para>- An engineering factory is not a chemical laboratory, and, moreover, there is another item relating to chemical establishments. The Government are making a mistake in constructing a factory at Maribyrnong or at any other centre adjacent to our already overcrowded cities. The Minister must not forget that the establishment of Government works at Canberra and the employment of men adds to the value of the land which the Government own. It would also be assisting the policy of decentralization and improving the value of the asset which the Government possess in the Federal Territory. &#39; The Minister disclaims any political &#39;&#39; pull,&#34; but I  ami  inclined to believe that there has been a good deal of political influence brought to bear in connexion with the decision to establish works at Maribyrnong. The curse of our Commonwealth administration to-day is that there is too much centralization in Melbourne. In the other States it is almost impossible to get anything done, unless the &#34;king pins&#34; in Melbourne are of the opinion that it ought to be done. </para>

            <para>. -  I would like some information regarding the proposed expenditure  of  &#163;335,000 under the River Murray Waters Act. Is that amount for any particular work?

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator RUSSELL</inline>(Victoria- VicePresident of the Executive Council) | 5.56&#93;.  -  A complete scheme has been developed by the Murray Waters Commission, and has been approved by the different States. The Commonwealth  originally promised to contribute &#163;1,000,000, &#39;but that was when contract work was much less costly  than it is to  day. The States interested are South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales, and the Commonwealth has joined as a fourth partner. Our contribution is one-fourth of the cost of the scheme, and the amount of &#163;335,000 is our proportion for the ensuing twelve months. I do not think there will be any objection to loan money being devoted to this work, because the development of the River Murray is a national undertaking which will prove reproductive. </para>

            <para>. -  I am astonished at the statement of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> that we still have dual control on the island, which, we were assured, would be run -dcn the most up-to-date commercial lines. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Redd</inline> very wisely raised the point, and we discovered that it was the intervention of outside Departments that opened the gateway to all the corruption, abominable administration, and tremendous and wicked waste of the taxpayers&#39; money&#39; that took place. I have no two opinions on that matter. Every expert who was examined admitted that the dual control was the loophole in the administration. I thought the dual system had been wiped out for ever, and that the Board now had absolute control of every man employed on the island and of all the work carried out on the island. </para>

              <para>- The island was going to be run, so we were assured, on up-to-date, commercial, business lines, hut in this Bill we have an item of &#163;8,380 to be spent on works to be carried out by the Works and Railways Department. If my memory serves me rightly, it was agreed that when the island was taken over by the Board it should be capitalized at a certain amount. I believe the amount was in the vicinity of &#163;400,000. It cost the taxpayers, as nearly as we could estimate, after very careful investigation, considerably over &#163;.1,000,000, or nearer to &#163;2,000,000. </para>

              <para>- The Commission&#39;s estimate was approximately what has been agreed upon. It was set out in the original letter sent to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> by those who had charge of the island. That letter was written as far back as March, 1920. The letter was to the effect that the island should be taken over and capitalized at &#163;1,000,000. On very careful investigation, in which I took an  active part, it was discovered that the general manager, the accountant, the foreman, and everybody else who had a right to speak with authority admitted that they could not go on paying depreciation, insurance, &#38;c, on that sum of money. It has been agreed that the Department should be run on commercial lines by the new Board, on conditions set forth by the Government,&#39; and agreed to by the Commission. The capital of the undertaking was then fixed at &#163;400,000. How are public men to ascertain whether the undertaking is holding its own ? How can we know whether we are justified in voting an expenditure of over &#163;8,000 in the present Bill? We have already thrown &#163;1,500,000 into the sea as a war  relic,  and the capital has. been written down, and yet as soon as anything is required on the island the Government wants to borrow money. * Are the Government going to increase the capital of &#163;400,000? When the huge concern was handed over it was admitted by all those who had a right to express an opinion on oath that they could realize on some hundreds of thousands of pounds&#39; worth of stores &#39;alone. They admitted that they could still carry on after reducing &#163;300,000 worth of stores by a half. Have these stores been sold ? If they have, what has been done with the money? Has it gone back into the general revenue? Has the Government a proper bookkeeping system, with a debit and credit, showing the working capital of the island ? If every time the Government wants a new machine, or an alteration made at the island, it raises another loan, the difficulties of the past will recur. </para>

              <para>- If my honorable friend had only followed what I had said he would not make that observation. It is admitted that there are &#163;200,000 worth of goods that can be turned into ready money, and yet the Government is asking for authority to spend &#163;8,000. Is it not possible -to carry on the island with a capital of &#163;400,000, after having thrown the balance of the expenditure into the gutter? If it is not, honorable senators have a very serious case to consider. I personally will nob be prepared to allow the vote to pass unless we can getdown to &#34; tin tacks &#34; in this matter. We have had an unfortunate experience, and the taxpayers have paid for it. If any one outside the Board goes on to the island I will raise, my voice in protest on every opportunity. It was the action of Departments in doing work on the island against the desire of the controlling forces on the island that opened the door to all the loss and waste that took place. Unless the Minister can assure me that the expenditure of this money is necessary, and can be justified for the working of the island, and that the work is going to be carried out under the supervision of the Board, I will move that the item be struck out. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> seems to fail to understand that these works are being carried out at the request of the authorities on the island. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> has laid it down that certain things have been done, but they are still under consideration. The Government have not decided to capitalize the undertaking at &#163;400,000. I want the amount to be much less than that, so as to give commercial shipping a good opportunity to prosper. I have been putting up a fight to get the amount as low as possible. I know something of what can be carried in overhead charges on commercial shipping. We have had ships built at &#163;30 a ton and then sent to the Shipping Line to operate. We want boats built as cheaply as possible, and that cannot be done if we have unreasonable overhead charges that are not in proportion to the amount of business done. In assuming the figure of &#163;400,000j <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> is assuming more than I would assume. I do not want the figure to be placed higher than &#163;250,000, which, I think, is a fair and reasonable overhead charge for the building of ships on commercial lines. It will be ridiculous if the two boats that are being built have to carry a charge of &#163;400,000. </para>

I played some part in the settlement of the dispute on the island, and I had a big hand in cutting off &#163;84,000 of overhead charges. I did not go round with a trumpet; but it was done.

The individual items are small, widening the slipway, &#163;4,000, being the largest. The slipway had to be broadened, and the crane tracks relaid to provide for the construction of the big 12,000-ton boats. That work has been completed and must be paid for. </para>

            <para>.- The Minister&#39;s explanation of expenditure proposed at Cockatoo Island does not touch the most important question that has been raised. I know that it was necessary to widen the slip before the keels could be put down for the larger steamers, and I am glad that work has been completed. What I most desired to know was whether the Government intended to continue the policy of divided control in the carrying out of works at Cockatoo Island. We know that it is the practice to have all works required by any Government Department carried out by officials of the Department of Works and Railways. I decidedly object to the Works and Railways Department carrying out works on Cockatoo </para>

They gave evidence before the Royal Commission that they carried out works for every Department of the Government. There is a great deal to be said in favour of public works being carried out by officials of the Works and Railways Department, but the conditions at Cockatoo Island are of a, special nature, and all works carried out there should be under the control of those charged with the management of the island. </para>

            <para>.- I have elicited from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> information to the effect that of the total of &#163;10,000 proposed to be expended on the Port AugustaOodnadatta railway line, &#163;3,800 is required to provide the necessary barracks for the workmen at Quorn and Maree, and &#163;5,635 is the proportionate cost for the replacement of the line with heavier rails. That information was perfectly satisfactory, as far as it goes, but I should like to know if the Department is justified in incurring this expenditure on a line upon, which, I understand, there is but one train a fortnight each way. Are not the present rails good enough to carry that traffic for some years to come? If the line is in fair order, additional expenditure should not be incurred, in view of. the present condition of our finances. Last year the line showed -a dead loss of &#34; &#163;124,660, made up of interest and sinking fund &#163;71,550, and loss on working, over &#163;53,000. That is the estimated loss this year. It is surprising that if traffic is not increasing there should be Any  necessity to spend &#163;5,000 or &#163;6,000 for replacement with heavier rails. Clearly, the Department does not anticipate any additional traffic, otherwise they would not estimate this annual loss on working expenses. </para>

            <para>. - Honorable senators will perhaps understand the position when I remind them that the section of the Oodnadatta railway from Port Augusta to Quorn carries the east-west traffic this side of Port Augusta. It is possible that the Department deems it necessary to replace some portion of this section with heavier rails in order to handle the traffic with greater safety. It is hardly fair, I think, that the Oodnadatta railway should be regarded merely as an incubus. Honorable senators should bear in mind that it is only the first section of what was intended to be the direct railway line to Port Darwin; and that cattle travelling from Queensland to the Adelaide ana Melbourne markets are conveyed over this line from Oodnadatta. If the Port Augusta-Quorn section is not kept in good order, passengers on the East-West railway travelling through to Adelaide and the eastern States would probably be inconvenienced, because there would be, so to speak, a weak link in the railway chain. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">.- Senator Senior</inline>is usually fairly correct in his statements, but I should like to remind him that cattle travelling from Queensland to the Adelaide and eastern markets are not trucked at Oodnadatta at all, but at Maree, which is about 200 miles south of the head of the line. I suppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> and the other representatives of South Australia have no objection to Queensland cattle providing freight for this particular railway line and, incidentally, meat for the people of that State. The returns on this railway are governed largely by the price of meat. Recently there has been a tremendous slump in beef, and consequently the traffic is not as great as it has been when higher prices are prevailing. Moreover, the season in the north has been good, and the stock routes from the Queensland border down.&#39; to Maree, which in drought periods are impassable, are now carrying good feed, and stock is driven even as far south as Dry Creek instead of being trucked. </para>

              <para>- I shall show the honorable senator. Last year about &#163;75,000 was expended, and there was a surplus remaining of a&#39; similar amount. So that if we vote &#163;150,000 this year there will still be &#163;225,000, or approximately three times the amount spent last year, on which to operate. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> on behalf of the Government, said that every effort was being made to exercise economy,&#39; and this is a direction in which expenditure can be avoided. In certain States taxation is being increased, and if unnecessary expenditure is to be incurred Federal taxation will also have to be higher. I think I can speak for a majority of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth when I say that the burden they have to carry is already sufficiently heavy.

I believe, the  president  of the Federal Capital League, and evidently one of the gentlemen who whispers into the ears of New South Wales senators, said - &#34;There is little doubt that sufficient pressure can be brought upon the </para>

              <para>- Yes. Alderman Brooks, after congratulating <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> and others on their efforts to further the progress of the Federal Capital, went on to say that New South Wales has a right to demand that the Government shall spend during&#39; the present financial year the extra money suggested by the Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> said that I was prepared to tear up the &#34; scrap of paper.&#34; Surely he was not serious; because I desire to see the compact honoured, but I do not think that unnecessary expenditure should be incurred at the present juncture. When this arrangement was entered into no one realized that we would be engaged in a lengthy and costly war, which would increase our responsibilities and place&#39; additional burdens upon the producers and people generally. When money is required for urgent public works, is there any justification for rushing forward with this project? Expenditure has been reduced in other Departments, with the assistance of representatives from New South Wales, but when it is a question of reducing . the vote for the Federal Capital - we are getting on very well withoutit - there is no opposition from them. I do not wish the work already undertaken to deteriorate, or to suggest that absolutely essential expenditure should be curtailed. The time, however, is inopportune, and we should not, therefore, unnecessarily incur further liabilities. </para>

            <para>.- I do not think the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> call for a lengthy reply; but when an honorable senator suggests reducing the vote in the interests of economy I desire to ask him, if he does not intend to tear up the &#34; scrap of paper,&#34; when he intends the Capital to be &#34;built and Parliament to assemble there? The economy suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> could be compared with that of a farmer who cleared and ploughed his land ready for cropping, which would give him a return for1 the labour, but who refrained from putting in the crop because it would cost him money. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> call that economy <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The &#163;2,000,000 to be expended in establishing the Federal Capital would within a very short time be returned in rente, whereas if the Seat of Government is not transferred- the Capital is lying idle. As there is a possibility of taking a vote, I shall not detain the Committee longer. </para>

              <para>- The Minister should not dodge my question. I agree with the Government that there is no necessity to start such industries in the bush, and it will be very difficult to ask any secondary industry to go there. The difficulties of States like Western Australia and Queensland, through being so far removed from the Federal Administration, would be intensified tenfold if Federal head -quarters were at Canberra. We have enough capitals already. There is centralization from one end of Australia to the other. &#39; I will name the time when we should go on with the Federal Capital ; it is when we have done justice to this island continent in the direction of developmental work. Queensland, which has vast possibilities for settlement, is virtually undeveloped. South Australia is not fully developed, although it has no great area of land suitable for subdivision. Reductions have been made - in the proposed expenditure in many Departments, and even if we cut down the Canberra vote, as I have suggested, we shall be agreeing to double the expenditure of last year. </para>

              <para>- The Government, probably, realized that there would be a lot of people who would be pleased to have the amount cut in halves. I am still of the opinion that the sum of &#163;150,000 is in excess of what should be voted. I appeal to honorable senators to realize the responsibility which rests upon them to decide whether the proposed expenditure on the Federal Capital is justified. </para>

            <para>.- The attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> on this question is rather peculiar. He suddenly finds himself posing as a champion of economy, but I have heard no complaint from &#39; South Australia regarding the expenditure of Commonwealth money on the Murray Waters scheme. When the Federal Government undertook certain liabilities in that direction, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> thought they were doing a fine work. I have yet to learn that there was very serious opposition from him to the East- West Railway. He likes to pose in the limelight as a great champion of economy when it is proposed to spend money in any State other than his own, but with regard to expenditure in South Australia he is discreetly silent. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator made a very lame attempt to do so. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> is a real, advocate of economy, let him move that the whole of the item be wiped out. What appreciable difference is there between a wasteful expenditure of &#163;150,000 on Canberra 1 and a wasteful expenditure of &#163;200,000 on the same project? To my mind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> put the case in a nutshell when he pointed out that a large amount of money has been spent at Canberra, and is not earning any interest. I claim to be just as keen an advocate of economy as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> although I do not stand up and make so much, noise about it. I maintain that economy does not consist in the amount of money spent, but rather in the way in which, it is spent. If the further expenditure of several hundreds of thousands of pounds at Canberra will make the money already spent there of some value to Australia, it will be justified. I hope the work a&#39;t Canberra will be carried out as soon as possible, and that Parliament will move there at the earliest opportunity. </para>

            <para>. - I rise to support the amendment that the vote be reduced by &#163;50,000. The economy advocates who are rampant in another place have very materially reduced the vote for the defence of Australia. What is the use of building another capital when we have not the adequate means of defending it? What is the use of building a capital in the bush at this stage of the proceedings, when the economists demand such alterations in the Defence Estimates that four hundred returned soldiers have had to be thrown out of employment in the Defence Department? </para>

            <para>- BROCKMAN. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> as a member of the Public Works Committee, knows that there is very little probability of the amount voted being spent this year. Probably a reduction of &#163;50,000 will . not affect the amount of work done at Canberra in the next year. Nevertheless,, there is a principle at stake. The most important function of Government in Australia is the protection of what we have, and if we cannot afford to do that we cannot afford to build bush capitals. That is the attitude I take up, and, therefore, I support the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> that the vote be reduced by &#163;50,000. </para>

            <para>. - I was challenged a few moments ago regarding the amount set down for die River Murray Waters scheme, and, not being parochial, I desire to refer to it now. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toll</inline> directed attention to the amount of &#163;259,193 set down in the schedule for that scheme. By interjection, while the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> was speaking, I indicated that I was not satisfied with the River Murray agreements, or with the expenditure on the scheme at the present time. We have had experiences of dual control, and the public have paid dearly for them, but today we have made no progress whatever towards securing that the whole of the money spent shall go through one authority. South Australia is spending so many millions, and Victoria and New South Wales are doing the same, while the Federal Government are operating at the Hume Reservoir. I understand that there has been some delay in the appointment of the Commission. When is the Commission needed - after the money has been spent, or before? Surely it is required to insure that the money will be wisely spent? </para>

              <para>- There are South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales controlling different sections of the work, and a Commonwealth Board on top of them. A Bill for the appointment of a Commission has been passed by this Parliament and by some of the State Parliaments, but it is hung up, I understand, in New South Wales. Why has not the new Commission been appointed? I am somewhat alarmed at the prospect of not getting anything like the results that we are entitled to from the expenditure incurred. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> is in this matter of the Murray River water scheme disputing only with himself. At first the powers of the Commission appointed were confined to supervision, . and the various works were carried out by the Governments of the States concerned. That has been found to be unsatisfactory. In the construction of one dam, about 9 miles from Albury, the workers on the New South Wales side of the river were being paid 2s. per day more than those on the Victorian side, with the natural and anticipated result that the Victorian workmen went on strike. The members of the Commission have since agreed that full powers in connexion with all construction should be enjoyed by the Commission if such incidents are to be avoided  in the future. There is only one State - New South Wales - which has not so far expressed its agreement with the new proposals. The New South Wales Government have suggested one or two technical amendments of the agreement in which the representatives of the other States on the Commission have concurred. It is now only a matter of formally signing the agreement under which the existing Commission will have complete powers to carry out all construction work directly. </para>

              <para>- To have two Commissions in charge of construction would probably be more inconvenient than to have the construction carried out under four authorities, as has been the case until recently. The existing Commission is charged with construction, and its functions will cease when the River Murray works are completed. No doubt a Business Commission will then be appointed to take charge. </para>

            <para>. - I wish to say a few words with regard to the amount of money the Commonwealth Government propose to spend in subsidizing aerial mail services between the different capital cities. In another place the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has informed honorable members, in answer to questions, that it is proposed to establish such services. In my opinion the capital cities are already sufficiently well served in this regard by their express train services, and the money proposed to be spent on aerial mail services between the capitals could be much more usefully applied to affording better facilities to people resident in the centre of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> and I recently travelled through Central Australia. </para>

              <para>- I am aware of that. It is proposed to spend this year &#163;1,500,000 from both loan and revenue on the extension pf telegraphs and telephones, but that amount will be materially reduced by what has been appropriated and expended already. The expenditure really proposed for this year will not be anything like &#163;1,500,000. Some of the money is to be devoted to the construction of conduits and the laying of wires underground; and in my view that is quite foreign to the extension of telegraphic and telephonic communication. The construction of conduits and the  undergrounding  of wires is necessary for the convenience of people in large centres of population, but it is a vastly different matter from telegraphic and telephonic extension in the interior. When the total vote provided for these purposes is reduced by the amount to be expended on conduits and undergrounding of wires, and by the sum of &#163;195,000 available under previous appropriations, it is clear that not a great deal of money will be available for telegraphic and telephonic extension in the back blocks-. It should not be forgotten that telegraph and telephone lines are largely selfsupporting. I protest against the Government, who profess to be progressive and to desire to promote the interests of the rural population, going about this work in so parsimonious a way. </para>

              <para>- That will mean that there will be, roughly, &#163;300,000 for expenditure on telegraph and telephone extensions in the country districts. The expenditure should be at least &#163;1,500,000. No work can more truly be said to be developmental than the construction of telegraph and telephone lines in the country districts. If we want progress in the country we must make the lives of the people resident in the interior more attractive than they are at present. That can only be done by a substantial expenditure on works of this kind. I should like the Committee to insist upon the Government bringing down, if necessary, Supplementary Loan Estimates to make more money available for this purpose. Any second-rate municipality in the country will undertake greater expenditure upon progressive works. The proposals of the Government are not progressive, and they do not set a good example to the people who are engaged in the hardy enterprise of developing the interior. When we compare what is proposed in this regard by the Commonwealth Government with what is done in New Zealand, we have reason to be ashamed of ourselves. I find from the last Budget presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey,</inline> the Prime Minister of New Zealand, that, owing to the nonarrival of a large quantity of material required for telegraphic and telephonic construction and maintenance works, a sum of &#163;200,000 had to be- carried over into the year 1921-22. He proceeded to say that the total amount to be expended last year out of the vote for telegraphic and telephonic extension was &#163;326,000, and that, also, a sum of &#163;143,000 was to be expended in maintaining in efficient working order the existing telegraph and telephone lines. The New Zealand Government, charged with the administration of that comparatively small area of country, were willing to spend no less than &#163;526,000 on telegraph and telephone line extensions, and &#163;143,000 on the maintenance of existing services. The population of the Commonwealth is about four and a half times as great as that of New Zealand. If we were to be guided by the expenditure in New Zealand on these services last year the Commonwealth Government would propose an expenditure of &#163;2,400,000 on telegraph and telephone lines. We do not even know how much of the money proposed to be appropriated under this item will be expended on main trunk lines, but it would appear that a despicably paltry balance will be left for expenditure in the interior. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator is quite right, and I have already said that the telephone system is practically self-supporting. Compared with what has been done in New Zealand, we are proposing to spend a most paltry sum upon this work. Some of the contemplated expenditure in other directions  might very well be curtailed in order to make available a large amount for telegraphic and telephonic extensions in outback districts. If honorable senators would, in the interests of our pioneers, point out to the people what a makebelieve this effort on the part of the Government really is, some good would be done. I am disappointed. The Government should come down with Supplementary Estimates to greatly extend this work, which, after all, will involve the country in no material loss, because the outlay will, in a great measure, be repaid to the Treasury. I should like to hear, what the Minister has to say upon this matter. Possibly what has been done in New Zealand has escaped his notice. I hope the Government will take heed of the situation, and that something of a practical nature will be done to anticipate our future needs in the matter of telephonic and telegraphic facilities in the interior. </para>

            <para>. - There is a good deal in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has said as to the advisability of the Government doing all they possibly can, by telephonic communication, to link up remote settlements with the rest of the community. I should like to know just how  faT  the estimated expenditure on country telephones will meet the requirements of people as disclosed by the applications received. The people who are most anxious to get telephonic or telegraphic communication are those who have been isolated. The district in which they live has not, perhaps, progressed so rapidly as would have been the case had these facilities been provided. The more we encourage land settlement, especially in our out-back districts, the better it will be for the community. Consequently, I should like to see the adoption of some scheme whereby every little settlement would have its telephone. Very often the cost of erecting telephone wires and installing the telephone is prohibitive, when the number of people to be served is taken into consideration; but once the facilities are provided there will be every inducement for an increase in settlement, and thus the difficulty will be overcome. Those who are prepared to take their wives and children back into the bush 10, 15, or 20 miles from .the nearest town deserve every possible encouragement. Portion of the substantial profit which the Department anticipate making, from services in the cities and towns might very reasonably be used as a set-off against losses that may be incurred in giving these facilitiesto out-back settlers. I am not referring to my own State particularly, but to the pioneers in any part of Australia. We want our waste lands peopled. This is one way to encourage settlement. I hope the Minister will bear in mind the representations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> I am not prepared to indorse all that he said as to a comparison with New Zealand, because we do not know what were the conditions there prior to the expenditure of the sum mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to provide these facilities for the people of &#39;that Dominion. </para>

            <para>. -  No&#39; question has received greater consideration at the hands of the Government than that of providing improved postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities throughout &#39;Australia. We are anxious to do all we possibly can in this direction; but we believe that as much as can be spent within the year has been placed on the Estimates. It is not at all easy to procure material, but I hope that we shall have plenty available before long. The Government feel this matter keenly, because we are getting thousandsof requests from all parts of Australia for more telephonic and telegraphic conveniences. Our present difficulties are the outcome of the war. If we can spend the sum placed on the Estimates this year we shall do very well, provided we are able to make adequate arrangements to get plenty of material next -year. The world is getting back to normal conditions again in the matter of supplies of telephone cables and instruments; and I think that about two years should see us out of our difficulties. We cannot do more at present, because we cannot get the material, which, I regret to say, has to be imported. </para>
