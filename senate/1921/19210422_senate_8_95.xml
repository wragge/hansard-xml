He said - </para>
          <para>He had many sad recollections of the war, but none more sad than the recollection of an episode prior to the operations in August at Gallipoli, in which ourgreat attack at Suvla  and our operations  at  Lone Pinewere carried out. He remembered seeing some men who had arrived only  a  few days before  as  reinforcements. He . remembered one of the men saying to him, &#34;Do you think this is  a  fair thing? &#39;! He replied, &#34; How do you mean? &#34; The answer was, &#34; Do you think it is fair to put us into action with the amount  of  training we have had?&#34; &#34;Bow much training have you bad?&#34; he asked. One man informed him that he had five weeks in Egypt, bad fired his rifle only once, and had never thrown a bomb. Another man had been six weeks in Egypt, and, according  to  his story, had fired his rifle only twice. Upon  all  of them in authority, proceeded the lecturer, there rested an enormous responsibility. </para>

Nothing was further from my thoughts. I understood from the honorable &#39; senator that he was only quoting the words of some other person. I must admit that I did not know that men had actually landed at Gallipoli who had only fired one or twoshots. That never came under my notice. That class of man nevercame to me, and I had command of a regiment there for a great portion of the time, and command of a brigade for some months before the evacuation. I would not on any account insinuate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was telling a lie. I knew that he was quoting some other person for the statement he made. Although a man is said to have stated that he only fifed one shot, that is not to say that he had not fired one before, or had not handled a rifle, in Australia. </para>

            <para>.- When the debate on this Bill  was adjourned I had been referring to. the fact that persons who believe in peace at any price are entitled to have their opinions respected and considered, but the defence of Australia must necessarily overshadow their objections. Yesterday we heard a great deal about defence matters. It is high time that the Government seriously consider a scheme under which men who are retired after serving a number of years in the Defence Department, may have some provision made for their future. The quicker the Government establish a system of pensions or of superannuation for them, the better it will be for all oncerned. It was indicated during the course of the debate yesterday that men who are admittedly incompetent are being retained in the Defence Department because it is felt that an injustice would be done by placing them upon the retired list .after many years of faithful service, when they are practically unfit for any other occupation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Bill provides that certain men shall be retired from the Air Force at the early age of 40 years. In any other occupation a man at that age would be in his prime. But, as the Minister has remarked, the Air Service is essentially a young man&#39;s job, and the earlier an individual enters it the better. But unless some other position in the Air Force can be found for them, these men will be retired at the. comparatively early age of 40 years, and at a time when it will be too late for them to qualify for positions in any other calling. Personally, I believe that no branch of our Military Service has greater claims to a retiring allowance than have the members of our Air Force. </para>
          <para>There is just one other matter to which I desire to direct attention. We have at Duntroon a Military College, and at Jervis Bay a Naval College. Today, the parents of young men in Australia are asking themselves what there is ahead of their boys who may desire to enter cither of these institutions. If I had a son who was eligible for admission to Duntroon and who desired to take up a military career, I am inclined to think that I would use my influence to prevent him doing so, simply because there is so little inducement offered to members of the military profession at a later period of their lives. I quite agree with the Minister that it would be unreasonable to expect the nation to incur the expense of preparing a young man for a military career and then to part with his services immediately he had finished his course of training. For that reason every inducement should be held out to the best young men in the Commonwealth to enter our Naval and Military Colleges, and that object may best be achieved by making provision for the future of those who take up such careers. </para>
          <para>I have little further to say upon this Bill. I recognise that an Air Force must become a necessary adjunct to our defence scheme. I recognise too, that such a force will cost the people of this country, in the years to come, a very considerable sum of money. But I believe that they are prepared to pay that money cheerfully. It is idle for us to pretend that the establishment of an Air Force will not add to the cost of the military machine in Australia. It will do so, and the only thing which this Parliament can do is to see that it does not unduly add to that cost. We have to face the problem of effectively defending our country and also of training a certain number of young men in this particular arm of our Defence Service. The only way in which the expenditure can be kept down to a reasonable figure is by the encouragement of civil aviation, by offering inducements to private individuals and firms to engage in that particular form of transport. The men who did engage in it would provide the military authorities, should the necessity ever arise, with a large number of experts in the handling of flying machines. I can see no advantage in delaying the consideration of the Bill until the return of the Prime Minister from England. We have to deal with it, and we might as well deal&#39; with it now as later on, thereby permitting the military authorities to get the aviation branch of  out  defence scheme into working order as soon as possible. </para>

            <para>. - There has been a-fear exhibited amongst quite a number of honorable senators that  the passing of this Bill will of necessity involve the Commonwealth ina very large additional expenditure from the standpoint of the administration of the Defence Department. But during the week-end I went very carefully through the measure, with the result that I am perfectly satisfied that the statements made by the Minister himself are correct. The honorable gentleman told us that the administrative cost of this new branch of our Defence Force will be infinitesimal, as he intends to utilize for administrative purposes the services of officers who axe already in the employ of the Commonwealth. Nobody can question the necessity for bestowing special attention upon this branch of our defence. During the great war we were all satisfied that the Air Services of the Empire were practically the yes of the Army and Navy. But for them the Empire would have cut a very sorry figure indeed. Thanks to the energy displayed in bringing those services to the perfection which they reached, we were able to emerge from the great struggle victoriously. A few days ago I was told that I had only to look at one of the Melbourne newspapers to seethat a large expenditure had already been incurred upon the aviation branch of our Defence Department. But reference to the journal in question merely served to show that the appointments which have been made are confined to those who are engaged in the practical operations of the Air Service. I have the list before me now. Lest any honorable senator should be under the impression that these are administrative appointments at large salaries, I wish to say that they comprise the the appointment of a wing commander, a squadron leader, flight lieutenants, a flying officer, an observer, and squadron leaders. All these appointments affect only the practical operations of the Air Service. </para>

              <para>- Exactly. I intend to support the second reading of the Bill, chiefly because, in the present condition of the world&#39;s affairs, we must recognise that we are far from having reached a position in which the need for maintaining our armaments to a reasonable extent has disappeared. The suggestion that we should delay the passing of this measure until the return of the Prime Minister from the Imperial Conference is a most dangerous one, because nobody can foresee what may happen in the course of a few months. I amnotpessimistic enough to believe that we are likely to be plunged into a great war in the immediate future. But as long as there are threatening clouds it would be folly for us to neglect the maintenance of our Defence Force. Before the outbreak of war, we in Australia had been paying an annual insurance premium in respect of both our military and our naval defence. We are now asked to pay an annual premium upon a policy connected with the Air Branch of our Defence Force. No reasonable person, no matter how anxious he may be to economize, particularly at a time like the present, will be foolish enough to suggest that we can afford to rub along without taking out an insurance policy in connexion with our air defence. In his remarks upon this . Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> seemed to entirely ignore the statements which were made by the Minister for Defence in moving the second reading of the Bill. Practically the whole of his observationswere directed to the very large expenditure which he affirms will be involved in its passing. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Minister has pointed out that through the generosity of the British authorities we have been presented with a large number of aeroplanes, and it would be folly on our part if we did not utilize them in times of peace in such a way as to bring into existence a really efficient Air Force that would be exceptionally useful in any future hostilities. I heard reference made the other day to the enthusiasm which had been displayed by the Minister regarding Defence matters. One remark was that the Minister was so saturated with this enthusiasm that he had no time to think of the financial obligations entailed in carrying out defence operations.I am pleased that we have a Minister who is saturated with Defence, and so enthusiastic as to throw his whole heart and soul into these great questions. Although I hold no brief for the Minister it is only fair to remember at this time of peace the fine work putin byhim during the war. If we had not had a Minister who threw his whole heart and soul into the work intrusted to him there, we should probably not have had such a fine administration of the Defence Department during the war period. </para>
          <para>Some honorable senators have expressed the view that we are not holding out sufficient inducement to those who might be capable of proving themselves very good officer&#39;s and men in our flying department,, because we are making no provision for their position in life after they reach the age of forty. I indorse a good deal that has been said in this connexion, and am hopeful that the time is not far distant when, not only in this and all other branches of the Defence Department but also in all Departments of the Commonwealth, ample provision will be made, by the establishment of a Superannuation Fund based on a sound foundation, to insure that any man who enters the Public Service of the Commonwealth shall have something to keep him when age &#39; forces him to retire. </para>
          <para>I think we are all satisfied that, having voted a large sum of money, as we did last year, for Air Defence, the time has arrived when we should see to it that the Air Defence Department is properly administered. During the interval between the time the money was voted and to-day, the Air Defence Force has been administered by the Naval and Military authorities, but the branch has grown to such an extent  quite  recently that it behoves us to see that we have a thoroughly efficient administration of it in regard to the operations to be carried out in the future. I give my hearty accord to the second reading of the Bill, and trust that any feeling that may exist that it will entail for administrative purposes heavy expense on the people of the Commonwealth, who are already very severely taxed, can be swept away for the time being. Surely the Parliament of Australia will be able, if any effort should be made by the Minister to increase the administrative costs unduly, to put the brake on. At the present time there is no necessity to do so, because I am satisfied, as I think most honorable senators are, that the administrative portion of this Department will not add any material burden to our finances.  If  in the future an attempt should be made to overburden the administration by making a very large number of appointments at high salaries, we shall have it in our power to enter our protest, and that will be the right time to do it. </para>
          <para>At present we can do &#34;no more than support the second reading of the Bill in order to give the Minister the power he requires to make this new branch of our Defence as permanent and as satisfactory as possible. </para>

            <para>. - There seems to be confusion in the minds of some honorable senators as to the use of an. Air Forde for the defence of a country in time of war. Some have suggested that a properly equipped Air Force might take the place of modern battleships in defending the Commonwealth. The records of thu war, however, show no case where a battleship suffered material damage from an air ship. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> can bear out my statement that, particularly in the desert warfare in Palestine, troops suffered very severely in open spaces from attacks launched from aeroplanes either with bombs or machine gun fire, but it is utterly ridiculous to suppose, as one honorable senator suggested, that air craft might be useful in stopping the advance of warships upon these shores. No one would suggest that aeroplanes caused any material damage in the trenches in France either by bombs or machine gun fire. When it comes to using them as an arm of the Service, either for offensive or defensive measures, their usefulness may be summed up in the phrase &#34; the Air Force is the eyes of the Defence Scheme.&#34; Their great usefulness is in finding the disposition of enemy troops or enemy positions. With my. limited knowledge I shall not criticise the attitude of the Government in establishing an Air Defence Force for Australia, whether it costs &#163;500,000 or more, nor do I think the time is opportune for postponing the. measure, seeing that Parliament has already voted the money to be expended for this purpose, that a certain amount of preliminary work has already been done, that negotiations have been entered into for the purchase of certain seaplanes, and that applications have been called for from officers for this Force. Numbers of our returned airmen have been waiting for a year or more for finality to be reached regarding their possible applications for positions. It is, therefore, necessary for the Government to go on with this scheme. We recently passed a skeleton Act dealing with Civil Aviation, which is being administered by regulations, of which a couple of hundred have been &#34;gazetted. The Controller of Civil Aviation is to have a seat on the Air Council. I much regret that the Government have not gone beyond the stage of expressing hope, and have not given actual assistance to civil aviation. </para>

              <para>- I was about to point out that it was found necessary recently in England to subsidize the Handley -Page Co., who were &#39;running the London-Paris aerial service. The company were able to show the .British Government that they could not compete successfully with the French companies who were running an  aerial passenger service, because the French Government were subsidizing the latter fairly heavily. There is in Australia a number of companies, established principally for the purpose of carrying passengers, although one or two attempts have been made to carry freight, and for some time the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. &#34;Wise)</inline> has been talking about seeing whether an aerial  mail delivery could be established for certain isolated districts. I have no knowledge of what the Minister for Defence refers to when&#39; he says the Government have done certain things to assist civil aviation, but .as the hope has been expressed that civil aviation may become more useful and extensive in Australia, it would be a good thing if the Government were to subsidize in some measure either pilots engaged in civil aviation or machines which, being used for civil purposes in times of peace, might automatically pass under the control of the Air Defence Department at a time of war. </para>

              <para>- The Minister gave us some useful and valuable information the other day, when he told us that certain work was being done in that direction, and that municipalities lying on the possible routes of aeroplane services, particularly on certain North-South and East-West journeys, had been asked to supply information about landing grounds, and the possibilities of establishing hangars and aerodromes. But when one knows, as I know, that the Australian companies which have been endeavouring to establish civil aviation on a commercial basis are having a very hard go, and  have had  ta put up a very hard fight to make their enterprise successful, one cannot help thinking that something more needs to be done from the Government stand-point. I was inclined to agree with the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> that it would be a fine thing for Australia if the Government subsidized or undertook on their own behalf the manufacture of aeroplane engines in Australia. A great deal has been made in some quarters of the fact that Great Britain presented us with a number of aeroplanes, but it is alleged by some officers, who are supposed to know, that some of those. machines are years old, and will very shortly become absolutely out of date, if they are not so at present. I want it to be distinctly understood that in saying this I am not decrying in any way the wonderful gift made to us by the Mother Country. I am merely endeavouring to look at the facts squarely. </para>

              <para>- I was going to say that they may be useful for the purpose of instructing pilots and mechanics, but it is wrong to assume, as apparently some honorable senators have assumed, that these machines are of any great value, even at the present time, for defensive purposes. I agree that the idea of establishing, in times of peace, the nucleus of an Air Defence Force is a wise one. But supposing that the aeroplanes which have been presented to us are efficient for modern requirements, and supposing that if not actually at war we were, at all events, in the war zone, we might be in a very awkward position indeed, if we had to depend upon sea transport over thousands of miles for the replacement of our aeroplanes which might be lost by accident or through war. The suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> .that more consideration should be given to the question of manufacturing aeroplane engines in Australia is an excellent one. I realize also that it is advisable for the Government to have available a certain force for policing the air, just as to-day we employ policemen and other officials to look after and deal with law breakers. In urging the wisdom of subsidizing civil aviators and the manufacture of aeroplanes in Australia, I remind honorable senators that Germany&#39;s success in so quickly assembling all its forces for war purposes was due to the fact that the men engaged in occupations which might be extremely useful in war time, were properly looked after in time of peace, as for example, all those men employed in chemical research in connexion with the dye industry. Their services were of immense commercial value to Germany prior to the war, and during the war they were very quickly organized for the manufacture of chemicals for high explosives and other purposes. I hope, therefore that the Government will give this matter their attention at a very early date. </para>

            <para>. - I desire to say a few words to the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> D. Millen, that consideration of the Bill be postponed until after the return of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> from the Imperial Conference. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> made a very sensible  suggestion. One very important reason why it should be given effect is that the Prime Minister in another place has announced that only the Tariff will be dealt with during; his absence.^ I take it his absence will commence from Wednesday next, and that being so, why should the Senate be called upon now to deal with a measure of this character <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> A definite promise -made by the Prime Minister should be held sacred. The Senate should not do anything that might, possibly, cause the Prime Minister embarrassment, and give some irreverent people an opportunity to scoff at his promise. </para>

              <para>- I agree with the honorable senator, but I remind him that quite a number of persons in this country, if they have the opportunity, will scoff at the Prime Minister, and to some extent, in an attempt to belittle this &#39; representative assembly, they will direct &#39;their criticism at members of Parliament generally. I suggest, therefore, that the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would meet the case quite well. For my part, I should take good care, in the event of a division, not to do anything that would harass the Government, by taking the business out of their hands. We know what trouble this caused in another place, and so we should be on the alert here, and not take any risks. But if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> amendment be carried, I sincerely hope the Minister will not take it so seriously as somebody else took something else somewhere else. There is, as I have shown, sound reason for the postponement of the Bill. The Prime Minister, on his return from the Conference, may be in a position to give us uptodate information on the question of aerial defence. Of course, it will be secret. No one will know anything &#39;about it but himself; but he will have the information, and with the utmost&#39; secrecy he may communicate it to the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> and, then, perhaps, we may have presented to us a measure for air defence even more effective than the Bill now under discussion. This point, I suggest, is well worthy of consideration. I realize that in the matter of war preparations, the inner circle of a Cabinet frequently possesses information not available to the rest of the community. I hardly like to venture the statement, because it is one that may be easily denied, and is not capable of proof in an assembly like this; but the thought having occurred to me, I should like to say that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and other Ministers visited Great Britain in 1911 or thereabouts, they were advised of the view held by certain high authorities that Germany&#39;s preparations for war would be complete in 1914, and that when.- they were complete, war might be expected. If this statement is anywhere near the mark, I would be satisfied if certain people of authority in this country had valuable information enabling them, we will say, to address themselves to this important question of the defence of Australia. I take it that when he returns to Australia in October or November next, the Prime Minister may be in a position to advise us upon a more perfect defence scheme! Perhaps he will - hardly as passenger&#39;s luggage - bring us some machinery for the manufacture of aeroplanes. At all events, he may have the specifications by means of which we may improve the present scheme. </para>

But I was rather amused that the Minis-&#39; ter should endeavour to put that aspect before the Senate. It is quite true that the money was voted by Parliament, and, therefore, the Government were entitled to spend&#39; a portion or the whole of it; hut honorable senators, I think, were not aware, when the Estimates were rushed through at the last moment, that this would be done. </para>

              <para>- The Minister now says that he drew particular attention to this expenditure. I leave it to honorable senators themselves whether he left an impression in their minds that expenditure on a scheme of this magnitude was to be confined to &#163;500,000.He did not in mine. This is only the initial . expenditure of a large sum of money, because the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> practically agrees that &#163;500,000 per annum is only the estimated cost of the Air Defence Branch he is bringing into existence, I suppose it will be only a little while before &#163;1,000,000, or even &#163;2,000,000, will be required;, and the Minister, in starting a scheme of that character - because he practically started it on last year&#39;s Estimates - will have to carry the responsibility. I am not excusing myself by saying that I should have been informed, because I should have been sufficiently alert when the Estimates were under discussion to havedemanded a detailed explanation. On the next occasion I trust that I shall be alert enough to seek an explanation on every item. After the estimated expenditure has been passed, we are informed that the money has been expended - I say it advisedly - upon a branch of the Service that, with the exception of the Minister for Defence, other honorable senators know very little about. </para>

              <para>- Very little timeremains, as the financial year ends in June. The proposal to postpone the Bill appeals to me, and I think the Minister for Defence will be well advised if he accepts the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> D. Millen, because, after all, it is only a matter of a few months. If a portion of the money voted has been expended, as was quite justified, it will not interfere with the arrangement he has to make for the establishment of an Air Defence Force. Everything is favorable to the further postponement of the Bill. I have been addressing myself to this question at greater length than I intended, to give an opportunity for the mover of the amendment to be present. I do not intend to debate the matter at further length, but am prepared to let the question go to a vote, if necessary. </para>

            <para>. - Several arguments against the Bill have been brought forward during the discussion on the second reading, and one that has been given some prominence is that of economy. That has been submitted as a strong reason why we should not go on with the Bill; but, after placing &#163;500,000 on the Estimates for this particular Service, it became absolutely necessary to establish an Air Branch to give effect to the vote which was carried. Not only in our Australian newspapers, but in those published in other parts of the world, information is given to the effect that, as a nation, we are standing in an exceedingly precarious position. If we look back to the period before the great war, which has happily been brought to a satisfactory termination, we must realize that the position then was not as serious as it is to-day. We cannot say, and we dare not even attempt to prophesy, what will take place. In these circumstances it is unreasonable to suggest that one of the most useful and necessary adjuncts to our defence, scheme should be held over until a more convenient time, because to postpone it would endanger that which is primal in connexion with the nation&#39;s safety. If a nation&#39;s safety is endangered, its wealth, happiness, and prosperity are of little value. If we look at this proposition from the stand-point of the danger which surrounds us,and the condition of affairs in the world generally, we must admit that, if there is one arm of defence that should be more active than another, it is the eyes of the Army and Navy. As the aeroplane was so useful in assisting in scouting during the great war, an efficient Air Defence Force should be created before anything else; and in connexion with the arguments adduced on the question of economy; it must be admitted that aeroplanes would be much more economical than Dreadnoughts. Scattered as the Australian people are over a very wide area, and difficult as it may be to move our naval vessels around our lengthy coastline, there is always the possibility of being assailed at any point, and the establishment of a well-organized and equipped Air Force should have first consideration. Even the keenest pacifist could not object to the proposal, because to be forewarned is to be forearmed. If we neglect to use the opportunities we possess of acquiring knowledge that is absolutely necessary, and if we endanger our security, we are leaving ourselves absolutely at the mercy of a marauding nation which may desire to attack us. Apart altogether from the question that we may or may not be attacked, the international conditions are such that, although we may not actually be involved in a struggle with any nation, we may easily be swept into the vortex of conflict. In whatever direction we may stay our hands, this &#39; important problem should have immediate consideration. A little while ago we passed a skeleton measure to create such a Force as this, and it is only within the last few months that statutory rules and regulations, ten times more voluminous than the Bill itself, were adopted. For the first time we are creating what we consider necessary for effective defence, and, before we have commenced, the cry of economy is raised. But all true economy depends on whether the organization is efficient. If it is inefficient, it is not true economy. </para>

              <para>- I admit that; but, seeing that the arguments advanced may have some weight with honorable senators, and that inadequate defence may jeopardize the well-being- of Australia, we have to discuss it now. Of what use would be our prosperity, the wealth we accumulate, or the happiness we so much seek, if, after all, any nation, however small, could deprive ns of the privileges we now enjoy? As a nation, we should at least provide the means to enable ns ,to be apprised at the earliest possible moment of the approach of enemy forces. It is for this reason, and not because I desire to see &#163;500,000 expended, that I shall sup port the Bill, rather than the expenditure involved in constructing another vessel such as the <inline font-style="italic">Australia.</inline></para>

              <para>- I thank the honorable senator for the interjection, as his suggestion helps to justify expenditure on a branch of the Service that is admittedly weak. To the eternal honor of Australia we have demonstrated how rapidly our troops can be made from what is, from -a military point of view, the rawest of material. The Australian has given evidence of splendid valour, and has shown how loyal he is at heart not only to his own country, but to the Empire of which Australia is a. part. It would&#39;, therefore, ill become Australia, at. such a juncture as the present, to neglect to provide against one means by which an enemy might cloud our vision and approach so rapidly that we should not know of his coming. &#39; I do not wish in any sense to be an alarmist, but I do say that there is need for careful consideration of every arm of defence that will serve to make Australia safe. The argument is advanced by some that we should pass this measure because the money required to give it effect has already been voted by Parliament. That argument is not sound, but it is still safe to say that the contingency upon which the money was voted six months ago is more imminent to-day. I am so impressed b&#39;y the present condition of international affairs that I should be prepared to-day to vote for an expenditure of &#163;500,000 for this purpose, and, indeed, double that sum, more readily than I did six months ago. The arguments which justified the voting of the money six months ago have been immeasurably strengthened by the present condition of international affairs. We should not close our eyes and consider that we are safe because the wide ocean sweeps around Austraia. We should keep in touch with what is passing around us,&#39; and, if we do so, we shall feel that, in the matter of defence, the&#39; essential thing is to be ready, and, not necessarily to be aggressive. </para>

          <para>I have carefully gone through the provisions of the Bill. It may appear simple to the Minister for Defence; who  understands the position, and merely the ABC to military members of the Senate who have had practical experience of the operations of an Air Force. The Bill, however, is not a very simple measure when we take into consideration the fact that it is related to many other measures, and that, in its consideration, some regard should be had for the Imperial Air Force.

            <para>. - I wish to reply briefly to the criticism that has been passed upon the Bill. I desire first of all to make a slight correction of what I said in moving the second reading of the measure. I gave the Senate some information about the Air Board, and when I was asked whether its establishment would involve any additional expenditure, I said that the only additional expenditure- 1 knew of was an allowance of &#163;100 per annum to the finance officer. I find that I overstated the amount of his additional remuneration. The allowance madeto him is only &#163;75. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">The honorable senator also said that &#34;the world is waiting for a lead in disarmament.&#34; I quite agree with that statement; but when the honorable senator refers to this particular Bill as one proposing enormous expenditure, and then asks that we should give a lead in disarmament, I am justified in directing his attention to some figures respecting naval and military expenditure. Great Britain, in policing as she does about onehalf of the world, is spending, I understand, 10 per cent. of her revenue. The United States of America, that has not the responsibility of policing vast territories, is spending, I understand, 12 per cent. of her national income. And another country, Japan, that has no colonies beyond a few island possessions, and no- responsibility for mandated&#39; territories, and for occupied countries, such as Great Britain has, is spending 33 per cent. of her national income. In view of these figures, the lead in disarmament should not come from a country like Australia, which is spending a comparatively insignificant sum, but from those countries which are spending: such huge sums as I have indicated. We hope that the lead will come from those countries. During the course of the debate, I was asked a question as to the number of machines there are in Australia. The Air Board has now. in its possession machines as under, for units provided on the first year&#39;s programme for the Australian Air Force :  - </para>

          <para class="block">It will be seen from the above that our reserves in D.H. 9&#39;s, and S.E. 5 Ay&#39;s, are below 50 per cent. ; those for D.H. 9 Ay&#39;s are above 50 per cent. This is owing to the fact that we must make the best use of the machines given to us by the Imperial Government; and it is not proposed that we shall purchase more D.H. 9&#39;s and S.E. 5 Ay&#39;s, as these machines are obsolete in theRoyal Air Force, and should be replaced with new types when reserves get so low as to warrant the re-equipment of these units. That is not to say that these machines are obsolete for certain purposes, nor that the Air Force, which will be an effective arm, is equipped with obsolete machines, because the other machines are up-to-date. In the meantime, as the reserves get low in any squadron, a Flight might be replaced with D.H. 9 Ay&#39;s. In this way we can keep somewhere near our 50 per cent, reserve for service units, make the best use of our machines, and save a certain amount of expenditure. It will be noted that in the training units we have ample reserves, but in these units in time of peace the reserves required will probably be much greater than those required in service units, and a much larger reserve than 50 per cent. of the establishment must be maintained in the preliminary training machines, that is to say, Avros. In this case, we are well provided for from the gift equipment. The general principle being worked on, however, is 50 per cent. reserve of establishment in service units, and at least 200 per cent. in reserves in preliminary training machines. At the moment we have a reserve of 300 per cent. in these machines, and experience may show it to be necessary to maintain such a reserve. In ordering flying-boats and ships&#39; seaplanes for service units, the principle of a 50 per cent. reserve has been maintained, that is to say: Flyingboats - Unit, 6; Reserve, 3; making a total of 9. Snip&#39;s Seaplanes - Unit, 6; Reserve, 3; making a total of 9; with an additional 3 Seaplanes for finishing training, or 12 altogether. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline>in his criticism said that in this Bill we were laying down a war basis, and that&#34; the Air Force proposed to be provided is equivalent to what we had in the Australian Imperial Force. I have had the figures looked up, and I find that they do not bear out his statement. We had with the Australian Imperial Force, one wing headquarters, four squadrons, and one repair section in training, and we used the Royal Air Force depots. That is to say the Australian Air Units which were on active service had no depots, but used the Australian Imperial Force depots. Under this Bill we propose to establish one flying training school and one Air Craft depot, including the repairs, so that the comparison works out at four squadrons with the Australian Imperial Force as against one squadron here. Upon service with the Army we had four squadrons, one of which was with the corps. We had none with the Navy. Under this scheme we are proposing the same strength, namely, four squadrons, two of which will be permanent, and two citizen squadrons. We are proposing to establish a flying boat squadron, and a seaplane squadron with the Navy, which we did not have during the war. The <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Air Squadron during the war was over 500 officers, and 2,500 officers and other ranks. What we now propose is a force of 160 officers and 1,500 officers and other ranks. Of this number 145 will be permanent officers, and 1,100 officers and other ranks. </para>

              <para>- That was not the point of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> criticism.  His  statement was that this scheme was upon a war basis, and it is that statement to which I am now replying. Then it must be remembered that during the war we did not have with our Forces an Air Force which&#39; was proportionate to those forces. Our Air Force was not at any time proportionate to the forces we had in the field, and to a very large extent we used the Royal Air Forces supply and repair depots. During his speech upon this Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> dealt with the same matters in regard to the supersession of officers as he dealt with when he was discussing the Defence Bill. He will not, therefore, deem it discourtesy on my part if r do not reply to his observations, seeing that I have already done so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> contended that the Bill is merely a skeleton measure.  His  statement is correct, because the Bill must be read in conjunction with two Acts passed by this Parliament, namely, the Defence Act, and the Naval Defence Act. But it is not advisable to repeat in this measure all the sections of those Acts which apply to &#39;the Air Force. In this Bill we incorporate all the sections of those Acts which are applicable to that Force. </para>

              <para>- Then we are quite in agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> raised an important point regarding the type of seaplane which is being obtained. I can only assure him that any seaplane or other plane that we may secure in the future will be of the latest and most uptodate type. We have an officer attached to the &#34;Air Ministry, who will look after our interests in that regard. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> raised the question of the expenditure which will be involved under this Bill. He is satisfied that there is no extravagance in the proposals of the Government provided that there be no increase in the expenditure, and that we save what&#39; we can during the balance of the financial year, so that when we come to review the position next year we may be able to reduce the expenditure. I find that the position to-day is that of the &#163;500,000 which has been voted for this scheme we shall not spend more than &#163;400,000, and the probability is that we shall not even spend that sum. I can definitely assure the Senate that there will be &#163;100,000 of the vote unexpended at the end of the financialyear. </para>

              <para>- No; it will cost more than that in the full financial year. I think the amount will be nearer &#163;600,000. This &#163;500,000 was for certain expenditure onquipment, and also for the establishment for a portion of the year, and it is obvious that the same establishment for a whole year it will cost more. The control, however, will still be in the hands of the Senate when we re-assemble, because the Senate will be able to determine how much we are to spend in the next financial year. Nothing done this year will prejudice us in that regard. </para>

              <para>- I do not know how I can make myself clear to the honorable senator. I have just said that it is not so, and that all Parliament is committed to is the setting aside of &#163;500,000 in this financial year for the Air Force. I said that owing to the late period at which this establishment is being appointed we shall not spend more than &#163;400,000 of that money, and that when the next Estimates are presented to Parliament they will be for the establishment which we assume will then have been completed. That will obviously be some figure higher than &#163;500,000, and I should nob think it would be more than &#163;600,000. If Parliament, in view of the circumstances that are then before it, decides that it is not prepared to spend that amount of money, Parliament will be free to take that course. It will mean ultimately simply reducing the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> and the establishment. </para>

While I hold this office no one would be more happy than I should be if such a scheme could be passed through Parliament. It is the intention of the Government at the earliest possible opportunity to ask Parliament to agree to such a scheme. That scheme has been drawn up, and is now before the Treasury for their consideration, because it has a very important financial aspect. It will mean that a considerable sum of money must be found by the country, even under a contributory scheme, and, therefore, it has to be seriously considered by the Treasury, but as soon as possible Parliament will be asked to express its opinion on the question. </para>

The fact of such an early age being fixed has already been taken into consideration in determining the rates of pay. Rates of pay for these officers are considerably higher, especially in the lower ranks, than the rates of pay for officers of similar rank in the Military Forces. They have been based on the rates of pay for officers in the submarine branch of the naval service. That applies particularly to the lower ranks, and this fact is regarded as some compensation for the earlier retirement. </para>

It is obvious that we could waste a lot of money if we said to every company that came to us with a proposition connected with civil aviation, &#34; We will give you what you ask.&#34; I have had one proposition put before me that a firm to carry mails in one part of Queensland should be subsidized to the extent of &#163;58,000 per annum. For that sum we could buy the machines, pay the pilots, and run the ser vice for the whole year. That is to say, they are asking us to put up, in the shape of an annual subsidy, not only the cost of the service, but also all the capital required to start it going. Any Government that, under the guise of assisting civil aviation, agreed to hand over such a subsidy might make itself extremely popular for a little while, but before long Parliament would have something to say about the way Ministers were scattering the money about. </para>

              <para>- I do not wish to indicate that. I merely mention the case as a proposition put up to us. There are companies in this country that we are desirous of assisting to the utmost on sound lines. One of them has already received from the Government assistance which has enabled it to keep going. We are also assisting them in preparing surveys of aerial routes and landing grounds ; but in many cases this means the acquisition of land, and it is not desirable at this juncture to say too plainly what we are doing in that regard, because land values have an uncanny knack of going up when the Government is known to be in the market ae a purchaser. </para>

          <para>On the question of manufacture in Australia, negotiations have been entered into recently, and a proposal which was placed before the Government is now before the Air Board, from a Sydney firm, for the manufacture, not of engines, but of machines in Australia, of Australian timber. I am assured by the representative of this company that they have had exhaustive tests made of Australian timber, and that weight for weight, and size for size, the Australian timber has given 20 per cent. better results than the spruce which is generally used in the aeroplanes made overseas. If that is so, it is very satisfactory, and we shall do all we can to assist that or any other company in any way within our power consistent with proper regard for the finances. We can- . not be expected to squander money. </para>

            <para>. - In view of the importance of this measure, it would have been as well if the Minister, instead of proceeding with its second reading, had merely introduced it, and allowed members of the Public Service, who certainly are the most interested parties, full opportunity to peruse it and supply honorable senators with information as to its probable effect on the Service. Naturally they possess information which it would be almost impossible for any honorable senator, not closely identified with the Public Service, to have. The Bill is essentially a machinery measure. Frequently in this Senate, I have complained of the tendency to legislate by means of regulations, but, as I scan this measure, it appears to me that in it are to be found provisions for many matters that could very well have been dealt with by regulation, while, on the other hand, more important matters which might well have been provided for are overlooked. Interested people might be justified in saying that they have been deliberately omitted, because the minor matters to which I have referred are mentioned in the measure. </para>

              <para>- As the Minister has stated, the question of appointing an expert in some particular business might arise, and so, on these grounds, the words &#34; other things being equal &#34; may be retained; but I venture to say that there will be no such difficulty about the constitution of the Board of Commissioners, for which men of character, capacity, and fitness, but not necessarily experts in some particular business, will be required. I usually pride myself that there is not much of the hypocrite about me, and so when I say that I think returned soldiers and sailors are being fooled by this pretence at preference in employment they will know what I mean. The sooner they realize that they have to take their chances with the rest of the community, and that fitness alone will be the qualification for a position in the Public Service, the better it will be.&#39; I am not afraid that, given a fair chance, they will not be able toprove their fitness for any post that may be made vacant; but I protest at this pretended preference, for it is only so much pretence so long as this loop-hole for the evasion of the principle is retained in the Bill. In connexion with the appointment of the Board, there is a first-class opportunity to establish this principle, but I have noticed that usually in appointments of this nature, preference is given to returned soldiers for positions that involve a good deal of hard work and little pay, and for positions with large pay and little work it is quite another matter. Everything will depend upon the interpretation to be placed on the words &#34; other things being equal &#34; in the sub-clause to which I have referred. </para>

          <para>  Let me come back to the considera tion of the constitution of the Board of Commissioners. This will be a highlypaid body, and, therefore, men of great capacity and integrity will he required to fill the positions. I am not an opponent of good pay. I believe that if a man is called upon to shoulder a large amount of responsibility, and to display&#39; marked ability in the discharge of his. duties, he should receive a remuneration commensurate with his services; and here, I repeat, is a splendid chance to establish the &#39; principle of preference to returned soldiers. </para>

              <para>- If a doubt exists in my mind as to the interpretation of a clause, it is my duty to state the position, to see if other honorable senators agree with me. If the position is as the Minister states, there can be no objection to striking out the words &#34; other things being equal &#34; in sub-clause 2 of clause 9, so that in the making of appointments to the Public Service, preference shall be given definitely to returned soldiers and sailors. I venture to say that out of the 450,000 men who went from this country to the war there are many capable of filling every position in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- I know, but we are being asked to pass a Bill which, so far as ordinary positions are concerned, establishes the principle of preference to returned soldiers, while for the highly-paid positions this principle may be ignored. The clause is worded in such a manner that, to me, this principle of preference appears to be merely a pretence. The time has gone by for showing preference to any section of the community. </para>

              <para>- Not at all. I am showing the difference between preference to unionists, and the so-called preference that is offered to returned soldiers. Preference to unionists leaves the positions open to every man in the community, but preference to returned soldiers deprives men with an excellent &#39; record of being employed, and shuts out quite a number whose qualifications are in every way satisfactory. It is now nearly three years since the war terminated, and we have to consider the prospects of the young man who was, say, eighteen years of age, and could not go to the war. A public position becomes vacant, and he is nearing the age of twenty-one when he applies in competition with the returned soldier for a position. Although the returned soldier may be less efficient, less capable, and, shall I say, less worthy, he has no possible hope of success. I do not intend those remarks to be regarded as a reflection on the soldiers; but I say openly and publicly that in such an enormous number as went abroad, it was only natural that there were many who were not angels. </para>

              <para>- I believe it does. The point I desire to make is that, under the policy of. preference to unionists, no man is debarred from employment altogether. We have to take the case of a young man who was under military age at the termination of the war, and ask why he should be debarred from obtaining a public position because he has not seen active service. Why should he be opposed by a man who has rendered glorious service at Horseferry Bead for a period sufficiently long to enable Mm to return to Australia, and wear a soldier&#39;s medal? Why should he be debarred, as this Bill debars him? The worst shirkers, in my opinion, were those who were employed in the administrative offices at different centres, and who never risked their life, or anything else, but who returned to Australia flourishing a medal. </para>

              <para>- If preference is to be given to soldiers, justice must be done to those who were unable to go. There are many whose health prevented them from enlisting, although they were willing to fight, and their cases should be considered with those who actually saw active service. There were many apparently healthy young men who offered, but found, on visiting the medical officer, that their physical fitness debarred them from enlisting. I ask honorable senators if they consider it absolutely fair &#39; that men placed in such a position, and who were not permitted to enlist, irrespective of their capacity, should be treated in this way? I know that some honorable senators will say that I am using a double-edged argument, and that if we are going to have preference to soldiers, there must be preference for the higher offices as well as those of the lower grade. </para>

              <para>- I believe that in a growing community such as ours the ex-soldier will find himself at a great disadvantage - and very soon - by this pretended preference; because, after all, that is what it is, and the sooner we realize that the soldier having done his share is anxious to be treated as other members of the community, the better it will be. Honorable senators can say what they like, but when a man has returned to Australia after fighting for his country, he has received a reward which cannot be taken away from him. He has the knowledge that when the occasion arose he was prepared to face danger, and even death. </para>

              <para>- The best thing for the Government to dowould be to submit a practical proposition, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> suggests, so that the child of an ex-soldier shall never want, because his father is out of employment. There are many returned soldiers seeking employment, and they do not wish to be regarded as paupers. Unemployment falls as much upon the ex -soldier as it does upon any one else, no matter how popular he may have been when the war was in progress. When hands are being dispensed with we do not find employers saying,. &#34; You fought for your country, and your services will be retained.&#34; In the railways, the tramways, the mines, the warehouses and workshops nothing of that kind occurs. If we are in earnest in giving preference or making provision for the soldiers, let us do it in a fair, honest, and straightforward way, so that real preference shall be given, and no man who fought for his country will ever have to seek employment or be compelled to make his children suffer. It should be the duty of the Commonwealth to find positions for these men. It is a very simple proposition, because the Australian Commonwealth provides ample scope for the useful employment of all the men in our community. I know some honorable senators would say that it would be a disastrous proposition for the Government to undertake the responsibility of finding work for all the soldiers who have returned. But it would not be nearly as costly as finding the interest on the money borrowed to pay those soldiers and keep them in food and clothing while they were fighting. </para>

          <para>I understand that the Government do not intend to press the second reading of this measure to a division to-day, so that honorable senators will have ample opportunity for discussing its. provisions. Here is a simple little phrasing which may be likened to the straw which shows the way the stream is flowing. Clause 34 reads -  (1.) Any male person who has successfully passed any prescribed examination for admission to the Commonwealth Service, and who on the thirteenth day of September, One thousand nine hundred and fifteen, was eligible for appointment to the Commonwealth Service, shall continue to be so eligible until nine months after the declaration of Peace. </para>

              <para>- Very well. I know of a young man who had been in the Public Servicefor some years, and who was secretary to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen when Leader of the Opposition. When a change of Government occurred, and I became Leader of the Opposition, the present Minister for Repatriation strongly recommended this young man to me, who then became my private secretary. He had been temporarily employed in the Public Service for six years, and, but for the war, would have been permanently appointed. The Government have, in an underhand, way, put him out of the Service, but they pay the Leader of the Opposition an amount sufficient to cover his salary. Any one can be engaged for the position, and the salary does not enter very largely into consideration. My secretary is a young married man with a family, and should now be a permanent officer. The Minister has asked for a case and I Have given him one. </para>

              <para>- The Leader of the Opposition is allowed to do that; but I am speaking of a man who was temporarily employed in the Public Service for a number of years and who cannot be made a permanent member of the Service. His present salary may be more than he would receive as a permanent Public officer, but he has lost the right to a permanent engagement because of the war. The Public Service Commissioner will not appoint him because he did not serve at the Front, but no inquiries were made as to why. He had served in the Public Service sufficiently long to secure a permanent appointment. It is well known that a temporary employee can only be engaged for a certain time, when his service has to be broken. Men could not be made permanent officers during the war, because of the decision to make no new appointments to which  I  have referred. </para>

              <para>-  I certainly am, and every month the Government send me a cheque to pay whomever I may be employing as private secretary. That is a roundabout way of doing the business, and I contend that to all intents and purposes the gentleman to whom I refer is an officer of this Parliament. He had been employed in the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. He was transferred to the service of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milieu</inline> to me, and then the war being over the regulation which prevented him being made a public servant prevented his continuance in the Service. I say that it is a most unfair thing to take four years out of this young man&#39;s life when he might have been improving his position in the Public Service of thecountry, and then to put him out of the Service altogether. </para>

              <para>- He is, . absolutely. He came here from South Australia; but he was not transferred from the South Australian Public Service. The point I make is that a man under the Public Service Act cannot be continued in temporary employment beyond a certain period. He should then be given a permanent position. I am sorry to have referred to a somewhat personal matter: but I have done so in reply to a challenge to state a case in support of my contention. I say that the Public Service authorities in this case took a miserable, narrow view of the position, and had it been any one but myself for whom the gentleman to whom I have referred was working,  I  believe he would have received a permanent appointment in the ordinary way. </para>

          <para>We have a great Public Service, consisting of a huge number of men. and a considerable number of women. It will be an ever-growing Service, and it is important that in passing this measure we should make provision, so far as human foresight can do so, for the remedying of all the grievances of the Public Service. If half-a-dozen young men. enter one branch  of the Public Service, and by their attention, ability, and qualifications, reach the highest office in that particular branch, in the ordinary course of events it will be a very great number of years before there will be any chance of their promotion. I believe that one of the disabilities of the Service is that after men reach certain positions in one branch of it, no facilities are afforded them to get into another branch in which there might be openings for their advancement. Any Service that keeps able, competent men from progressing is not doing justice to those whom it employs. We should be on the lookout for our progressive men to see* that they are given fitting employment, and they should not be continued in watertight compartments because half-a-dozen of them may have reached the same grade. The wholeof the Commonwealth Public Service should be open to every man in it. </para>

              <para>- That is what I mean. As a member of Parliament I have to listen to the grievances of a good many people. I take the case of an officer who has reached a particular grade, and sees no possible chance of further advancement in his particular branch. There may be another branch of the Service, in which he would have a chance of advancement; but when he makes an application for a transfer to that branch, the head of the officemay say &#34;There is no officer of your grade here, but I have men here already who understand the business of the office, and I do not think it would be of any advantage to have you transferred to my branch, because you would take a certain time to become as efficient as men of even lower grade who are already in the branch.&#34; I confess that there is much force in such an argument, but I go further and say that such an officer as I have referred to would, in a very little time, become an efficient officer of the branch to which he might be transferred. I believe that provision should be made in the Act to make such transfers easy. </para>

              <para>- I am aware of that. I wish they were under the Public Service Act, because a Board of Appeal is provided for under that Act, and if we have a Board of Appeal for the benefit of members of the Public Service, we should have such a Board also for those employed in the military service. To illustrate the matter to which I wish to refer, I take the case of an officer who has been acting as a colonel. He has been efficient, and has done his work well. There is a reconstruction of the military service under which there is no position for this particular officer commensurate with his rank and pay as a colonel. After twelve months his pay is reduced to that of a captain. I say that the Commonwealth is sufficiently wealthy to pay every officer a salary commensurate with his industry and qualifications. </para>

              <para>- That is so. If, when an officer who has been reduced passes out of the Service the Government admit the justice of giving him compensation on the basis of the salary of the higher position which he filled, surely they must admit the justice of continuing to such a man retained in the Service the salary of the higher position he occupied, instead of degrading him, and I say it advisedly, in the eyes of his fellow public servants by compelling him &#60;to work for a lower rate of pay than he may have been receiving for years in another position. I hope that honorable senators will nob lose sight of the need for some remedy for this grievance. I trust that when we come to the Committee stage&#39; they will regard this as a Public Service Bill, and not merely as a measure submitted by the Government, and will endeavour to improve it. I hope, also, that before the measure again comes up for our consideration the members of the Public Service will give it serious attention, as they must know more of the conditions of their service than honorable senators can possibly know. </para>

            <para>. - I am loth to delay honorable senators who have to catch trains for the other States. Fortunately, the debate on the Public Service Bill has ended for the time being, and this gives me an opportunity to say a few words on a matter in regard to which I addressed a question to the Minister representing the PostmasterGeneral. The matter is of such importance, in particular to the State which I have the honour to assist in representing, and to the Commonwealth in general, that I make no apology for offering a few observations upon it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>For many years past the people of Tasmania have been anticipating some improvement in the steamship service between the mainland and their State. Unhappily, a project which would have given them an improved service, and which took the form of a contract between certain shipping companies and the Postmaster-General, was interrupted by the war. &#34; The new steamer,&#34; as it was called in the text of the contract, was named the <inline font-style="italic">Nai,&#39;ana.</inline> It was built in the Old Country, and fitted out for the purpose of what might be cai ed the Inter-State Ferry Service. The exigencies of the war caused the Imperial Government to commandeer the vessel, and use her for carrying aeroplanes in the North Sea, or as an auxiliary to a mother ship associated with aeroplane operations. Since the close of the war the vessel has been re-furnished for passenger traffic, has been brought out to Australia, and, as recently as the 16th of this month, took up the running between the mainland and Tasmania. I am net disposed at any time to take advantage of the immunity which attaches to a member of the Senate to make observations of a caustic character which cannot be replied to in this Chamber by the person who may be the subject of them. But it would have been imagined, and certainly was anticipated by the people of Tasmania, that the improved service to which they might reasonably look forward in the terms of the agreement entered into between the shipping companies and the Postmaster-General, would have been inaugurated with some decent regard for the opinion of mankind, which the great men who formulated the Declaration of American Independence said was always necessary, and should be observed by civilized organizations. That consideration should have caused shipping companies to refrain from an immediate overt act which, I think, can be legally established as a breach of the terms of the contract entered into by them with the Postmaster-General. I am credibly informed that such an overt act in breach of this agreement has already taken place, although the new vessel only took up the running as recently as the 16th inst. Some of my colleagues may desire to say something in reference to this matter, and, therefore, I shall not trespass unduly upon what they may legitimately consider their opportunity to offer some observations in respect of it. The Postmaster-General&#39;s reply to my question, .as conveyed to me through the responsible Minister in this chamber, is very general; but it certainly sets forth that the steamship companies have approached the Government for a variationof the agreement under which the Tasmanian people expected to secure an improved mail service. It may be that the condition of things now does not offer such good prospects of remuneration and profit to the companies as were present when the agreement was entered into. But it comes with singularly bad grace from these companies to breach the agreement within a few days of the period when it annie into operation. I apologize to them if they have not committed this overt breach of the Covenant, but they certainly contemplate doing something which, beyond doubt, will be a variation of the terms of the agreement. I am informed that during the next few days we shall see not three trips per week run to Tasmania, which the people of that State expected under the provisions of the contract, but only . two trips per week. I believe that there are pains and penalties .attached to any breach of the agreement, but public utilities which are still in the hands of private corporations, should, in my judgment, be worked with a decent respect for the opinions of the people who are immediately concerned. The State of Tasmania because of its insular character, has suffered acutely during certain economic, labour, and other convulsions which have occurred during the tourist season of the last few years. Its people, therefore, are not disposed to regard with equanimity any breach of the terms of the contract which was entered into with a view to providing them with an improved steam-ship service. This question concerns not merely the people of Tasmania, but the convenience, and, indeed, the profit, of quite a number of persons on the mainland. If it be definitely shown that Tasmania is not to get the improved service  which the Government endeavoured to secure for her under the agreement, there will undoubtedly be a roar of disappointment and indignation from the whole of the people of that State. As one of its representatives, I feel that they will be justified in declining to submit tamely- to any&#39; improper variation of the contract which has been entered into. Therefore, without any mealy-mouthed apology, I demand that the Commonwealth authorities shall see that the agreement is complied with, and that the improved mail service which Tasmania expected shall be furnished to her people, or very good reason shown why it is not. The steam-ship  companies and the Government may rest assured that there is the closest collaboration between the representatives of that State upon this matter, and that we regard it as so important that no variation of the agreement - particularly a variation undertaken in an arrogant spirit by the companies themselves - will be tolerated by the people of Tasmania or by their representatives in this Parliament. </para>

            <para>.- I am very grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> for having afforded me an opportunity to say a few words upon this matter that is so important to the State which I have the honour to represent. Tasmania, because of her insular position, has suffered materially in many ways, especially during the past twelve or fifteen years. </para>

              <para>- Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> nor I ask for any favour in its consideration. It is a question which not only affects the people of Tasmania, but which must also seriously affect commercial people on the mainland, because, to a very great extent, . our trade is done with them. It came as. a shock to many of us to learn only yesterday that the steamship companies which have contracted to carry the mail between the mainland and Tasmania have, as far as one can judge by the press report, already broken their contract. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has stated that a report is current that the service of three trips each way weekly, which is provided for under the contract, is to be&#39; reduced to two trips each way weekly.  I have here a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> newspaper, in which I find in the sailings which are advertised for next week verification of that report. The contract provides that a steamer shall leave Melbourne for Launceston with the mails every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but the advertisement sets out; that the <inline font-style="italic">Nairana</inline> next week will sail from Melbourne only on Wednesday and Saturday. </para>

              <para>- The contract provides that there shall be three sailings weekly of these two vessels, or by one of them, showing plainly that the boats are considered capable of carrying on the service singly should either of them be required to do so. I enter my protest against the possibility of Tasmania being placed in the unfortunate position of having a mail service in the future, which will be inferior to that which it had in the past, despite the fact that that State has made very great progress commercially, and that her population has considerably increased during the past few years. Since the inauguration of certain undertakings in Tasmania, a great deal of capital has been attracted to that State. By reason of the natural facilities which have been given to Tasmania by an all-wise Providence, works are now in progress there which are at once the admiration and the envy of the rest of the Commonwealth. These undertakings having been commenced, the people of that State realize that it is of vital importance that their mail service shall not be interfered with in the way that the newspapers reported yesterday they are to be interfered with. I trust that the authorities will look very carefully into the question, and that as a result Tasmania will not be made to suffer. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator may &#39;think so. There are lots of vessels for sale in England, but they would probably cost more for repairs than would be involved in the construction of entirely new ships. Many of them are practically only hulls, with neither boilers nor fittings. If they were brought to Australia in the hope that they might be repaired we should find that it would pay us better to build entirely new vessels than to touch them with a. forty -foot pole. It is the desire of the Government to provide greater mail facilities than  we  at present possess, and we are moving in that direction as rapidly as possible. The Postmaster-General, I can assure honorable senators, will do his best to see that every condition in the Tasmanian mail contract is complied with. But we cannot always insure that. In the contract for the carriage of our over-sea mails we cannot get anything better than a fortnightly service for some six or eight months to come, because suitable vessels are not available. Moreover, the shipping companies say that no vessels of a suitable character can be purchased, and that, consequently, new ships will require to be built. </para>
