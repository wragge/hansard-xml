              <para>- This Bill was received in the Senate only last evening, and it is quite unreasonable to expect that it shall be put through to-day if fair discussion is to be allowed of the various matters with which it deals. I may be somewhat slow in grasping matters of such magnitude, but I object to being asked to consent to the voting of nearly &#163;5,000,000 in so short a time. During the war we learned many lessons which should be of great advantage to us; but, because of it, I am afraid that we have got into a number of very bad habits in dealing with public expenditure. It is quite time that the Senate gave reasonable consideration to the de tails of public expenditure. If honorable senators had been given an opportunity to thoroughly discuss the details of expenditure in the past a great deal of money that has been wasted might have been saved to the community. Last night I was informed that this was merely a machinery Bill, and that it was not necessary to discuss its details as most of the matters with which it is concerned have alreadybeenconsidered.Iremindhonorable senators that the Bill covers the expenditure of nearly &#163;5,000,000, and though the items may have been previously considered in different circumstances, that is no reason why they should not be subjected to close criticism now. </para>

          <para>Thisis virtually a wages Bill, and in this connexion we might give some consideration to the appointments which have been made within the Public Service within the last twelve months. Honorable senators are aware that some little time ago I asked for details of appointments made in the Commonwealth Public Service during the last twelve months. Those details were supplied, and I am sure that every member of the Senate was as astonished as I was myself at the enormous additional expenditure involved in the appointment of officers to higher positions than those which they previously held. Some of these increases of salary given to officers passing from one Department to another, run into hundreds of pounds. I do not intend to be personal in my references to  this matter, as honorable senators have been supplied with a list of the appointments to which I refer. </para>

              <para>- I think that we should give serious consideration to the growth of public expenditure in this country with its small population. Honorable senators listened to the disclosures made last night by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen).</inline> It is regrettable that the Commonwealth should have been involved in so many unfortunate undertakings. The results should teach us that it is quite time that the Government confined themselves absolutely to the functions of Government. The attempts that have been made to engage in trade and commerce have been quite outside the scope of the proper duties of an Administration. On every occasion upon which a Government has invaded this field of operations we have had eye-openers at the finish. </para>

          <para>The methods adopted in the handling of public moneys by the various Departments require considerable tightening up. The practice is to issue Treasury warrants to the different Departments. These warrants are issued for lump sums from time to time, and I am of opinion that the sooner the Commonwealth Treasurer controls details of the expenditure of public moneys, the better it will be for this country. I might, as an illustration, mention a Department that has the spending of a great deal of money. The manager has certain duties to perform, and is answerable to a Board, the Board to the Minister, the Minister to the Treasurer, and the Treasurer to the Cabinet. That was our experience of a spending Department in connexion with an inquiry recently held. It was almost impossible to hold any particular officer responsible for excess expenditure. In view of the disclosures in connexion with the administration of the War Service Homes Department, it is evident that there has been considerable leakage there, and a real necessity for the tightening up of the system in order to prevent any one individual being in a position to enter into contracts involving huge expenditure without being answerable to some one at an early date. If the Treasury had been fully protected, that kind of thing could never have continued in the War Service HomesDepartment as long as it did. Are honorable senators aware that, in respect of the examination of the accounts of some Departments of the Commonwealth Public Service, the Auditor-General is from eighteen months to two years behind with his work ? How could any ordinary business be carried on on such lines? How could a business man expect to carry on his business successfully if, for eighteen months or two years, he did no auditing of his accounts to discover where he was? If a private concern were carried on on those lines, and the owner of the business was found to be insolvent at the close of such a term, he would probably have to &#34; do time &#34; under the laws of his country. </para>

          <para>In a statement which he made in another place the day before yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook admitted that he had not seen a balance-sheet of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers for two years. Cynthia sort of thing go on? It is absurd that the Line should have its head office in London. The proper place for the head office, and for those who govern the shipping of this country, is here, at the Seat of Government, so that the whole business may be under control, and we may be able to obtain a reply at any moment to any question we desire to put. Instead of that, all that the Treasurer can assure us is that he has been sending Treasury warrants to carry on, and the system has grown, through the war, into such a condition of laxity that the sooner we tighten the whole business up to prevent the wicked waste that is occurring in connexion with our public administration, the better it will be for all concerned. I sympathize with any Minister who has to try to carry on and do his best in the public interest under conditions of this sort. </para>

          <para>Recently we had the experience of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook being the final referee in regard to a long routine of public expenditure, passing from the general manager of a big concern in Sydney, through different Boards, and through another Minister, until it reached him, -and he took a definite stand. He said the amount of his warrant had been exceeded, and stopped further expenditure. I am very pleased that we have men like <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook in office who are prepared to accept the responsibility, on occasions of that sort, of taking what may be a very unpopular, but at the same time a very justifiable stanch, and one which it was his duty to take, on behalf of the taxpayers. A great deal of opposition has been expressed to the action of the Treasurer in that matter, but where shall we find ourselves unless there is absolute and complete authority at the head of our affairs ? Those who are answerable directly to Parliament must know the whole of the: facts regarding the. expenditure of all public money. </para>
          <para>To me a Bill of this sort coming before Parliament opens up what is the foundation of responsible economic, and successful government. We must put the peg in with our public expenditure, but, at all times, with due regard to efficiency. I am not an economist gone mad. I am an economist who says that the public are entitled to20s. worth of value for every &#163;1 of their money. All the laxity that has grown up must end, and so must the ambition that exists in many Government Departments to make them larger. I tell the men in those Departments frankly that if I were there I would do the same as they do. If a Department is started, the natural ambition of the man placed in charge of it is to build it up into a huge concern to make his own position bigger and better. It would be mine, at any rate. </para>

I am not going to take the -responsibility of &#39;saying whether the time  is ripe to build the north-south railway with the present high cost of labour and enormous cost of material. A Committee has been . sent through the country to make the fullest inquiries about the best route, and when its report comes before  the Senate I hope honorable senators . will be big and bold enough to treat the question on its merits as one of developmental  policy for the whole Commonwealth, and not get down to the petty, bickering idea of &#34;You give us Canberra, and we will -give you the north-south railway.&#34; To me that system of settling public questions is most objectionable. </para>

              <para>- I thank honorable senators for the &#39;consideration extended to me, and I trust that, on the next occasion when a Supply Bill is submitted to this Chamber, we shall have sufficient time to discuss the items in the schedule, because there -is every justification for a tightening up of the present &#39;system in an endeavour to effect economy wherever possible. I do not wish to leave an impression in the minds of honorable senators that I have been criticising the administration of individual Ministers. My remarks have been directed mainly towards the; administration generally, because we appear to have been following a very loose system. The Auditor-General&#39;s report is eighteen months behind, and I nave been making these comments in an endeavour to assist the Government. </para>

            <para>. -  I have always considered it somewhat futile to discuss a partial financial statement such as - is embodied in a Supply Bill. I understand that the Estimates for the present financial year are to be submitted some time in September, and any comments I may offer will be in an endeavour to assist the Government in framing the Estimates, and making them as palatable to the electors as we possibly can, because there is every probability of the Government having a very rough passage when they are submitted. As a member of the National party, and a supporter of the Government, it is my wish to make the task of Ministers as easy as possible, -and I am endeavouring to do that by asking them to frame the Estimates in accordance with what they know to be the wishes of the people. </para>

              <para>- The money expended in this and other directions has been contributed by the taxpayers, and the balance-sheets should be published as is the case in connexion with private business concerns. The Government are merely managers for the people, and I trust that the Minister will give &#39;consideration to my request, so that the taxpayers who have to shoulder these liabilities may-have some knowledge of how th&#39;e money is being disbursed. </para>

          <para>I felt very much discouraged after the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> had made his statement concerning the administration of the War Service Homes Department. I have always felt that Governments were quite incapable of undertaking huge enterprises of this character, and the disclosures of the Minister last night proved my assumption to be correct. If the Minister for Repatriation, whom I look upon as an able politician and business man, cannot successfully administer such a huge public undertaking, nobody can. What did the Minister do when he started this great Department? Soldiers were returning from abroad in very large numbers, .and the feeling amongst the community was that everything should be done to assist them in being repatriated, and established in comfortable homes. Parliament directed the Minister for. Repatriation to build houses for these men, and at the outset he had to construct offices. He then had to select a Commissioner, who was to receive a comparatively small salary, to handle a very large sum of money. </para>

              <para>- Yes,- and the salary allowed, was only &#163;1,500 a year. The Minister for Repatriation was further handicapped because the head of the Department had to be a returned soldier, and it was difficult to secure from a number of comparatively young men one who had sufficient commercial and administrative experience to successfully control the work. Notwithstanding this difficulty, the Minister had to delegate important powers to the officer selected. Apparently, the Minister had everything against him, because many of his officers appeared to be working in opposition to him, and even deceiving him in every possible way. There is no doubt that in those days we did not, and we do not now, desire to apply hard business principles to returned- soldiers who have done so much for us, -but to treat them in a humanitarian way. But in endeavouring to help them, perhaps, some injustice has -been inflicted, and, personally, I would rather have been. an umpire at a football match than have undertaken such a difficult task. I do not think the Minister for Repatriation will say, on looking back, that he has always been right, because we all make mistakes. But he has made less than most men would have made. The Minister has numerous duties to perform, and he has also the responsibility of leading the Senate, which, in itself, should be sufficient for one man. </para>

              <para>- Yes. It is a most strenuous task. It is time the Government realized that much of the work that has been undertaken by Governments should be left to private enterprise. When I heard the Minister&#39;s statement I naturally asked what the Treasury could have been doing, because the Minister said that in passing the Estimates we had allowed &#163;160,000 for the purchase of houses, and nearly &#163;3,000,000 for the building of new residences. </para>

If such acts had been committed in the employ of private enterprise, dismissal would not have been the end of it, because they have been diverting funds and using them under false pretences. The instructions of the Minister have been ignored, and money wrongly spent. Some of the officers are responsible for criminal acts, and I trust the Minister for Repatriation will secure legal advice to see if definite charges cannot be laid: against those who have ignored his instructions in this- regard. </para>

              <para>- We have had reports from time to time; but I do not thank they have made any reference to the financial position of this institution. I have heard it said that it is costing &#163;7,000 a year. In ray opinion, it might very well be amalgamated with the Board of Trade, the functions of which are similar. I hope the Minister will take a note of the suggestion, because if we could show that some of these big Departments are being amalgamated, and if proper balance-sheets were published annually, we would be able to assure the public, perhaps, that their money was being wisely employed. A little while ago the Bureau of Commerce and Industry attempted to launch an ambitious woollen-manufacturing scheme, but without success. A number of private companies have been established of late, and I doubt very much whether such a scheme as that suggested by the Bureau is now required at all. The Minister might inform us of its activities, and say whether, in his opinion, it could be amalgamated with the other Department to which I have referred. The head of any Government Department, if he is energetic at all, is always endeavouring to enlarge it, so if, by amalgamation of some of these Departments, we could deal with only one instead of four or five heads, there would be a much better prospect of effecting economy. The natural instinct, even of members of Parliament, is to induce the Government to spend public money; but I think I can say that I am one of the least offenders in. that respect. I do not recollect ever having asked the Government to spend public money in this State, and so I am a true economist. </para>

He drew attention to the fact that there were teeming millions of people to the north, just a little way off, and used that as an argument for the construction of the line; but these teeming millions have been there for thousands of years. If they had wanted to occupy the Northern Territory they could have done so thousands of years ago. The Javanese have come down several times, I believe, but they have never stayed there. </para><interjection>

              <para>- I have heard the construction of the line advocated from a defence point of view; but I think that to construct it for that purpose would be the worst thing in the world to do, because if any enemies landed in the Northern Territory, the railway would enable them to come south. This argument reminds me of the story of. a woman, who, frightened of burglars, got her husband&#39;s golf stick and placed it alongside the bed at night, hut. her husband advised her to &#34;Put it away, because a burglar would probably hit them with it.&#34; The same may be said of this railway. If it is built, and if any prospective enemy is foolish enough to land in the Northern Territory, he will use the line to enable him to come south. </para>

              <para>- From a defence point of view, to build that line would be the worst thing we could do. I know, of course, that honorable senators from South Australia have to push their barrow a little bit, and, therefore, we need to treat this matter seriously for the next: twenty years, anyway. Some day, no doubt, the agreement with South Australia with regard to the railway may have to be carried out. I was a member of another place when the Northern Territory was taken over from South Australia, and did my level best to prevent the. Commonwealth from completing the agreement, because I felt that South Australia was managing the Territory quite as well as the Commonwealth was likely to do; but the reply always was - &#34;We want to spend money up there, in order that the Territory may be developed properly.&#34; If the Commonwealth had not taken over the Territory, it is highly probable that the agreement then being negotiated with a large English company for the construction of a line and the development of the Territory, on the lines of the Canadian-Pacific Railway Company, would have been completed, and the railway constructed years ago. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline>referred to the question of the tightening of the Treasury system in relation to warrants. As he himself pointed out, he&#39; has been anticipated by the action of the Treasurer. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook has taken action to introduce the practice of a continuous audit which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> alludes to, and which, I suppose, most people with any business knowledge approve. </para>
          <para>I only want now to deal with a matter which I find is uppermost in the minds of all honorable senators, and that is the insistent demand for economy, and in this connexion I venture to say that deeds speak louder than words. The Government also have said that it believes in economy, and has done something to show that its belief is not a mere fictitious one. &#39; When moving the second reading of this Bill I pointed out that the Government had effected a reduction in the Estimates of &#163;4,250,000 on last year&#39;s expenditure, notwithstanding that the Estimates had previously been pruned severely by the Treasury. </para>

              <para>- When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> makes that suggestion he very much under rates the capacity of a Department to spend money. Any Department I know of that is worthy of the name can, I think, spend all the money we care to give it. The fact that there has been a saving of &#163;4,250,000 on Estimates that had been previously pruned indicates, I submit, a sincere desire on the part of the Government to cut down public expenditure. </para>

              <para>- Many Departments submit estimates in which provision is made for various projects which are afterwards deleted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> as an ex-Minister, must be familiar with the natural desire of Departments to meet all their possible needs. It is the duty of the Treasurer to check that tendency, and I submit that he has done so. Whether he has done it to the extent which some persons who are not charged with responsibility consider that it should have been done is another matter. But the substantial saving which has been effected during the year that has just closed may be accepted as an indication of the policy which the Treasurer will pursue in the future. </para>

Whether the Government have achieved the impossible by satisfying everybody I cannot say; but they have at least given evidence of a genuine desire to reduce expenditure, as far as is compatible with efficiency.

            <para>. - I should like to know what custom obtains in connexion with the auditing of the accounts of our Commonwealth Departments. So far as I have been able to peruse the official reports from the Auditor-General, my impression is that he is behind with various audits ; in some cases, to the extent of a year or eighteen months. In view of the report of that officer himself, and of the disclosures which have recently been made in connexion with the activities of other Departments, I think that the Auditor-General&#39;s Department should be strengthened - irrespective of the cost that may be involved - to such an extent as will enable him to carry out continuous audits of the accounts of Departments which are responsible for heavy expenditure. It is not in the interests of true economy that we should stint the Auditor-General of any expenditure that may be necessary to provide him with the assistance that be requires. </para>

              <para>- I am coming to that. It is a fact that two years ago the Auditor-General stated that he was handicapped by reason of an&#39; insufficient staff, and complained that his requests for assistance had not been complied with. But that complaint has since been met.  His  staff has been increased. The Government are also meeting the complaint in another way. In the Public Service Bill which is now before the Senate, provision is made that the Auditor-General shall become a permanent departmental head, and he will, therefore, have control of staff matters himself. Consequently, the Government have recognised the wisdom of the course which has been advocated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> They have provided the Auditor-General with an increased staff, and they propose to vest in him the power to appoint and control his own staff. </para>

              <para>- Precisely. The report of the Auditor-General, which I laid upon the table of the Senate to-day in connexion with the Commonwealth factories is for the year ended 30th June, 19.20, and it may, at first glance, seem as if that fact is indicative of&#39; delay. But the Auditor-General, it must be remembered, cannot commence his audit of the accounts of any Department until the financial year has closed. Consequently, his report cannot be presented to Parliament until some months later. The increase which has been made in his staff, and the granting to him of the power to control that staff, for which provision is. made in the Public Service Bill, will bring about a more desirable state of affairs. </para>

            <para>. - It seems to me that the expense involved in the conduct of the Maternity Allowance Office is very heavy. It is equivalent to &#163;12,000 a year, and, compared with the expenditure incurred in the conduct of other offices under the control of the Treasury, it seems to be somewhat excessive. I am gratified to know that last year a larger sum was paid in maternity allowances than was spent during the previous year. The expenditure under this heading for the financial year which has just closed was &#163;70,000 excess of the estimate. ? </para>

I have entered my protest time after time, since I have been a member of the Senate, against the continuance of the maternity allowance under existing conditions. It is not fair that persons in the community, who find it difficult to meet existing taxation, . should have to contribute to a maternity allowance for people whose financial position is such that they are in no need of it. This matter should be considered at the earliest possible moment, with a view to curtailing, as far as possible, the  expenditure involved in. the payment of the maternity allowance under existing conditions. </para>

            <para>. - I do not think that the particular vote to which the honorable senator has. referred can be cavilled at. It covers contingencies, as well as salaries, and represents an average annual payment of &#163;11,400. A great deal of work has to be done in connexion with this particular branch of the Department of the Treasury. Money orders have to be sent throughout Australia, and amounts checked. The staff is administering a total expenditure of &#163;630,000 annually, and the vote for salaries and contingencies represents an office expenditure of only13/4percent. That cannot be regarded as a high percentage for administration of a scheme which operates throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>I do not propose, in discussing this schedule, to deal with the general principles on which the finances of the Commonwealth should be administered. But I do wish to refer to another matter of administration connected with the Taxation Office, and, to some extent, with the Crown Solicitor&#39;s Department. I refer to the indefinite position at present existing with regard to the attempted taxation of bonus shares. I have gone into this question, because it is agitating the whole; of the commercial community of Australia. I am referring to the matter now in order that my remarks may be recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> for the consideration of the Treasurer at his convenience. The position, so far as I can ascertain, is that the Commissioner for Taxation thinks that under the present law the action he is proposing, is mandatory. If the action proposed by the Commissioner for Taxation is carried to the conclusion to which he suggests it should be carried, I am afraid that tragic injustice will be inflicted upon thousands of shareholders in New South Wales. A period of inflation has been followed by the present period of deflation. So far as I can see, the commercial community, as a whole, will scarcely be able to retain, and, in fact, will lose, during the present period of deflation the profits, if any, which they made during the period of inflation. As an illustration- of the unfair and unjust effect of the taxation of bonus shares, if carried out as proposed, I may refer to some shares in which I am indirectly interested as a. trustee. I think that a year or two ago about one share in ten was given in the capitalization of reserve profits that had already paid a flat rate of taxation. The whole of the shares in the company, the one in ten given, -and those paid for at. par, are now valued on the market at 3s. per share, and I am doubtful whether they will ever bring any more. </para>

          <para>I find that, under the heading of &#34; Miscellaneous,&#34; there is a vote included for the maintenance of persons admitted into charitable institutions and hospitals.

The matter has been referred to on more than one occasion by more than one member of the Senate. It would not cost very much to do what is suggested, and it would add to the alleviation of the conditions of life of elderly people who, in accordance with nature&#39;s laws, have not very much longer to live. I feel sure that if these remarks are passed on to the Treasurer he will, in view of the large surplus that has resulted from the. year&#39;s transactions, be in a frame of mind to consent to earmark the few hundreds of pounds required to comply with the suggestion I have made. </para>

            <para>.- The provision in the Constitution for the re-distribution of seats according to the census figures operates automatically, but I believe we suspended its operations during the war, although the population figures had altered, because so many of our men were away. The census has since been taken; but although various statements have appeared in the press as to the population figures, the Electoral Department cannot act until it receives figures which are officially certified to be correct. The initial preparations are now being made, but the Department cannot act, because it has not received the figures officially certified by the head of the Census Branch. Immediately the Department is ready, arrangements will be made for the appointment of Commissioners to re-allot the seats according to the proportional figures under- the Electoral Act. We aim at equal electorates; but there is always a margin allowed on each side, in order to enable the Commissioners to consider what is known as community of interest. </para>

            <para>.- I should like a little light on the item of &#163;800 for the development of oil-fields in Papua. Nothing appears to be provided under Papua for salaries, and I am at a loss to know how the development of the oil-fields is being carried out. I read the last report on the subject carefully, and the only impression I could gather was that the whole of the management might almost be termed illusory. It is impossible to pin things down, or to know what is being done. There . is no doubt that there are prospects of oil in Papua, but the method of development that has -been adopted seems to call for careful examination. I am not satisfied whether this item is to be charged to a separate account, or to go under &#34; Contingencies &#34; in the expenditure on Papua. If &#163;800 will be sufficient for the operations for over two months, I cannot believe that they are really in earnest in their search for oil in Papua. </para>

              <para>- They put down eight or nine bores in Papua in a comparatively short space of time. I admit that the depth is not great, but if the work is continued on that scale, &#163;100 per week will not cover it. I do not think it is sufficient to provide for satisfactory exploration. If it is intended only to conduct a scratch search, we should be told so. This money may be intended for the survey, or for trial bores, or for officers&#39; salaries, or for the repairing of machinery ; but no definite information is given in the Bill. </para>

            <para>.- The item represents the payment for the boring which is now going on. Some time ago the Government was conducting the boring operations in Papua, but later it was decided to change the system and get the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, in which the Commonwealth is a shareholder, to do the boring with its experts. The Company is doing that work, but not for itself. Any oil which it strikes will belong, not to it, but to the Commonwealth Government. This money is to pay for two months of that work. </para>

            <para>. -  A number of matters have been brought under my attention by rifle clubs and associations, but I prefer to place them privately before the Minister for his consideration. In the circumstances, that perhaps will be the better way; but it would be well for the Minister, at. his convenience, to make a general statement, for the information of the people of Australia, about what the Department is doing in the direction, of building up manufacturing activities so as to make our home defence self-contained. On several occasions the Minister has stated, by interjection, that the Department is doing that ; and I. think that there is a growing feeling among members of Parliament in the direction of making Australia self-supporting so far as concerns munitions, explosives, rifles,&#39; munition parts, and so on. </para>

            <para>.- The course suggested by SenatorPratten. is not only desirable, but it represents a. duty which, the Minister, owes to Parliament. The honorable senator, however, will recognise the difficulty in. which I. find myself. At present, the policy- is. embodied in. a proposal which is before: the Treasurer, and. until I know the fate, which it will meet at the hands, of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph. Cook),</inline> and the, Cabinet, it: is impossible, for. me to say what is going to. be. done in. the ensuing twelve months. I made a statement the other day to the Senate on the important; question, of munitions, supply, and produced a sample of what the Department had initiated in the way of shell fuses. It will. be. sufficient to say at this juncture that, for. the last year, of which I can speak;, one-third of our total expenditure was on. the munitions, supply branch. In that way we are endeavouring to establish factories to supply our requirements. It is&#39; the intention of the Government, to, establish works such as they have in Great Britain - of course, not to the same extent - so that, in- the event of war, we would have a nerve centre and factories&#39; that could be turned over for war production. It would be most uneconomical to build factories and have idle plants and staffs on our hands. The policy adopted during the war was to convert factories into establishments for producing war material, and we are. laying our plans in that direction. The. munitions supply branch will be the nerve centre, and, during times of. peace, stock will be taken of existing factories, and their possible production of war material. Where necessary, plants will be-, installed for peace purposes,, which can be utilized for the manufacture of war material should the occasion arise. Briefly, these are the lines on which we are acting. It is economical, and the experience of : war shows that it can be done. In Great Britain, even gramophone factories were converted into establishments for the production of war material, and when the Estimates are submitted in September;  a  statement will be submitted to Parliament indicating the steps we propose taking during the ensuing year. </para>

            <para>. -  I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Wilson</inline> has raised this, question, as it gives me an opportunity of explaining, the apparent disparity between the number of officers - not merely, at the Military College, but also at the Naval College - and the number&#39; . of cadets undergoing training. This, information was asked for in Parliament,, and -a return was laid on the table of the Senate. At this, juncture the position . appears much worse than it would in any other year, because last year there was a falling off in the  number of cadets. The number at present attending that institution is between thirty and forty, which is below the average ; but it has to be remembered that both these Colleges are isolated from any town, and consequently we have to provide certain conveniences which civilized people require. If honorable- senators will refer to page 10000 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> they will find a return giving details concerning the staff at the Military College. It has been stated that there is a staff of 170, but, as a matter of fact, the actual staff of instructional officers at the Military College numbers 31. There are, however, 107 others, making a . total of 138, who are paid &#39;by the &#39;Government. But there are thirty-two who are not paid by the Government, although their names appear on the staff of the institution. </para>

              <para>- The cadets and officers at the College. There is a chief steward and thirteen other employees in the . cadets&#39; mess, and their salaries are paid by the cadets, and not by the Government. Those employed in the laundry are . also paid by the various messes. If the Colleges were situated in a city, we would not have to provide a hospital ; but I am sure honorable senators would be the first to censure the Defence Department if, when cases of sickness occurred, a hospital was not available. We have . to provide a medical officer and two nurses, and these, of course, have to be included in the <inline font-style="italic">personnel.</inline> Houses also have to be provided for the staff. Those honorable -senators who have had the opportunity of visiting Duntroon will realize that there are a large number of buildings to be maintained, and to keep the buildings and grounds in order, tradesmen and labourers have to be employed, and naturally they appear as on the staff. No private &#39;business establishments are allowed at Duntroon , or at Canberra, and, in consequence, the Government have established a canteen, from which the residents can. purchase stores. The canteen is in charge of the quartermasters, who are members of the College Staff. All the employees in the different Departments have to be under our control  and that is why the list appears some what long. </para>

              <para>- I have always insisted that the staff shall be kept at the lowest possible level. Those in charge of the instructional duties have assured me that all the members of the staff are fully and necessarily employed, and I must accept their statement The College is inspected by the Inspector-General, and by others, who are making investigation in an endeavour to effect economy. The committee at present making investigations will in time visit the Military College to see if the services of any of the staff can be dispensed with. The committee appointed to inquire into the administration of Government Departments also visited the College, and made inquiries concerning the number employed and the duties they were performing, and as it did not recommend any reduction, I must assume that the work there compares favorably with that of the Naval College, particularly as the annual cost is &#163;10,000 less. </para>

            <para>. - I am indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> for allowing me to make a statement on this matter at this  juncture. The Government do not believe that the subsidizing of &#34; joy-riding &#34; is in the interests of civil aviation, and although considerable pressure has been brought on the Government to subsidize aviators flying for ordinary purposes, we have said that it cannot be done. We believe that- if civil aviation is to be of any use to the country the subsidizing of those who merely fly round our big cities, and from capital to capital, will not have the desired result. No advantage would be gained by subsidizing those who fly between points where there is already speedy means of communication, and the Government believe that if the aeroplane is to be of any value it ought to be used for the development of the out-back country, particularly in the direction of. rendering speedy medical service in remote centres of population. Tenders will be due on the 30th July for conducting services between Gerald ton, in Western Australia, and Derby, and Sydney, and Adelaide. Although the last-mentioned are capital cities, the intervening country is sparsely populated, and an air service would assist in its development. </para>

              <para>- It is all to be taken from the Air Services vote. Tenders have also been called for a service between Sydney and Brisbane, and particulars for one between Toowoomba, Charleville, and Longreach, linking up with the interior country of Queensland, are being obtained. That is the best type of service we can render to Australia, and it is our intention to proceed along those lines. We are co-operating with the Western Australian Government in an endeavour to be of assistance, particularly to women in the out-back districts who are living long distances from any medical officers. The Western Australian Government have undertaken to arrange for medical officers to attend at certain points on the route, and to bear the cost incurred. </para>

              <para>- I agree with the honorable senator. I had proposed to discuss three or four matters, including the question of exchange in foreign countries, about which I made remarks that stand to-day, and are contained in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 12th May, 1920, pages 1979 and 1980. Another question I proposed to deal with, but which can conveniently be raised on the Tariff Bill, is the administration of the Excise Department in relation to both home-made and imported spirits. The increase in the cost and number of employees in the Quarantine Department is a further matter that may be discussed on another occasion. The fourth question, upon which I had intended to speak was the incidence of the Navigation Act in relation to ferry steamers in Sydney Harbor. </para>

This matter was discussed yesterday in connexion with another Bill, and I can easily understand that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> representing the Minister for this Department is not fully acquainted with all the details. For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> said yesterday that , the functions of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry were not in any way comparable with those of the proposed Tariff Board. But both Departments will be administered by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> and if honorable senators will examine the functions assigned to them they will sec that they are. similar in many respects. The amount provided in this Bill represents two months&#39; expenditure, or a total of about &#163;4,000 a year. I understand that the  chairman  receives &#163;1,500 a year, and, as the Bureau does not meet very often, it is comparatively expensive. The Minister, I think, would be well advised to give attention to the desire of the Senate and&#34; see if these two Departments cannot be amalgamated. </para>

              <para>- Yes. A gentleman I met wanted to buy some of the Government tip trucks for the salt company in South Australia, but he became so disgusted with the delay in the negotiations that he bought elsewhere, although the Commonwealth trucks would have suited him much better, and he was prepared to pay market rates for them. I do not know what value the departmental officials place upon these tip trucks, but I sold some myself recently at &#163;20 apiece. Without exaggeration, I can say that I saw hundreds of picks exposed to the weather. All this material should have been sold upon the completion of the railway, because a few years ago there was a great shortage of all such &#39;requirements throughout Australia, and fair prices would have been realized. I even came across a number of railway motor tricycles still exposed to the weather. </para>

              <para>- That &#39; only emphasizes what I say. Of course, we do not expect the Minister to bo riding about the country in order to get acquainted with all such details of administration, but they have their officials, and should be informed. Senators, also, have their responsibilities. It is their duty to bring these matters directly under the notice of the Government, so. that the position may be remedied. There is a ready sale for this material to-day. I hope the Minister will direct the attention of the Minister for Works and Railways to the matter. </para>

            <para>. -  I have one matter to mention under this Department. It is  an  old  grievance, one that has been raised before, but without any great amount . of satisfaction, either to the Department concerned or to the firms who are continually complaining. I refer to the registration of telephone calls. In this connexion I have been supplied with certain information by the Australian Mutual Provident Society, of Sydney, whose complaint is supported by a great number of leading firms in Sydney today. The Society protests against what it considers is undue laxity on the part of the Department in this matter, as a result of which it is being mulct in the payment of certain moneys not owing by it to the Department. The Sydney office of the Australian Mutual Provident Society has kept a careful record of its telephone calls from 1st November, 1913, to 30th April, 1921. During that time, according to the record, the calls numbered 9,247, whereas the departmental charge is for 13,668 calls, representing an overcharge of about 50 per cent. In a communication to me, the Society states - </para>

            <para>As a result of a protest, in the half-year ended October, 1910, the line was &#34;observed&#34; by the Postal Department, and the result for that and the succeeding half-year suggests that our protest had some effect. -Before, and subsequently, however, there has been a considerable overcharge. Our record is carefully kept, but, while it may not be absolutely accurate, I am loath to believe that there can be so many mistakes as the comparison of calls recorded and charged would suggest. You will notice that this record has been kept for a period of over seven years. I may also add that since the end of 1918 the telephone switchboard is locked up during non-business hours. </para>

          <para class="block">It will be seen that it is not possible for any one to get at the Society&#39;s switchboard outside of actual business hours. In a subsequent letter the society points out that the record of the calls made upon the ordinary department telephones is not so complete as is that of the calls made upon the industrial department telephone, but the figures for the last three half-years are as follow: - For the half-year December, 1919, to May, 1920, the society was charged &#163;28 17s. 4d, whereas by its record it should have been charged only &#163;238s. 5d. For the half-year June, 1920, to November, 1920, the society was charged &#163;33 18s. 3d.; whereas by its record it should have been charged only &#163;25 12s. 6d. For the half-year December, 1920, to May, 1921, the society was charged &#163;38 9s. 2d.., whereas by its record it should have been charged only &#163;266s. 7d.

            <para>If when a line was placed under observation a list of the numbers called were made and at once supplied to the subscriber, with the date, there would be some . sort of a check on the subscriber&#39;s list; but simply to say that the line has been under observation and that everything has been found in order, is most unconvincing and most unsatisfactory. It is not suggested that there is any wilful fault  or neglect on the part of the officials, but that the system under which they work might easily be made to conform a little more closely to the requirements of the subscribers, and probably, would be made to do so -if those requirements were better known to the responsible officials. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>If the complaint of the Australian Mutual Provident Society can , be established - and it seems to me that upon the facts it does establish a pretty fair case - it is extremely probable that quite a number of other subscribers are resentful of what they believe to be imposition on the part of the Postal Department. It is not in the best interests of the Commonwealth that such a feeling should exist. There should be some means of keeping an official record of the calls actually made- </para>

              <para>- There should be some method of keeping an official record of the calls made which would be satisfactory alike to the telephone subscriber and to the Department. In this connexion, the Australian Mutual Provident Society makes a suggestion which the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> may well convey to the Postmaster-General. It suggests that some method might be adopted whereby the society could, be immediately made aware of the calls being registered against it, so that it might have some better check upon those calls than it has at present. </para>

            <para>.   -  When the toll telephone was introduced quite a number of subscribers entertained the idea that they were being charged by the Department considerably more than they ought to have been charged. Where complaints were made,, we placed the line of the aggrieved subscriber under observation, and we- almost invariably found that the record kept by the Department was an accurate one. In. all such cases we were in a position to. tell subscribers the day upon which certain calls were made, who made them,, and who did not. I recollect that, amongst the complainants were the International Harvester people. We- were able to demonstrate to them that the departmental, record, of their calls, was correct, and they actually thanked us for doing so,, because our action led to the discovery that the clerks and others employed in their offices were- using the telephone for other than business purposes.&#39; Thereupon I made an offer that the line of any aggrieved subscriber would be placed under observation conditionally that he undertook to gay for the cost thus- incurred, if his list of calls, proved to be wrong, whilst the Department would defray, the cost if its <inline font-style="italic">tiym</inline> record turned out to be inaccurate.

            <para>.- We have heard a good- deal lately about the need which exists for- the exercise of economy. I have a proposal to put before the Committee which I think will lead to that result. I am very sorry that there are no Victorian senators present with the exception of the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> . I notice that&#39; in the Postmasters-General&#39;s Department the amount set down for &#34; Contingencies &#34; in Victoria is- &#163;71,000,. whereas in the great State- of Queensland the amount provided is only &#163;22,000. Similarly, for the large State of Western Australia it is proposed to appropriate under this&#39; heading only &#163;21,000: I do not know exactly what the item &#34; Contingencies&#34; covers; but as an example of economy, and knowing that I&#39; shall&#39; be backed by the Australian Legion and the Taxpayers Association- of Victoria, which is trying to- convert New South Wales- to the same theory; I&#39;move - </para>

            <para>- I have no desire to instruct the- Department as to how it. shall conduct its business. All I say is that under the heading of &#34; Contingencies,&#34; Victoria ought to receive &#163;5,000 less than it is- proposed to appropriate for that purpose. It is a compact little State, and the- people of the- other States are not yelling for economy in the same way as are the people of Victoria. We have not an Australian Legion in Queensland whose members are running round the country trying to cony.ert the heathen. In Victoria, these young men are anxious to instruct&#39; this Parliament in the matter of how it shall ruu the country. Probably we shall have a deputation from them to the Senate to thank, us&#39; for our action in this connexion. I trust that Victorian senators, who are absent&#39; from the chamber, will be sent for, so that they may give me their support. </para>

            <para>. -  I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> to withdraw the request, first assuring him that, in common with the Australian. Legion and other useful institutions of Victoria, I am entirely with him in the demand for economy. This proposal, however, is going at it in a rather blindfold fashion. The honorable senator admits that he does not know what is covered by &#34; Contingencies.&#34; If he did, I should say that he was the only man who had that knowledge. When he draws a comparison, between the amounts of contingencies for the various States, he overlooks the important fact that the amount allowed for contingencies in each State bears, roughly, the same proportion to the total for that State, and obviously  mu3t  do so. The amount for contingencies ranges between one-third and one-fourth of the . total amount for each State. The honorable senator will have a full opportunity, when the Estimates come up, to go more fully into this question, because, with the Estimates, the Budget-papers will be presented, and he will find all the details set out. In view of the understanding arrived at for the early passage of this Bill, I ask the honorable senator, as he has made his point quite clear, and it has the universal indorsement of the Senate, to withdraw his motion. </para>

            <para>. - I should like a little more information regarding the &#34; savings &#34; referred to by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> in his speech in reply on tha second reading, as having been made for the last financial year. We are all anxious for economy, and I understood the Minister to say that economies had been- effected. He said that, when the Estimates were presented to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> they were cut down by at least &#163;4,000,000. Was that economy, or a reflection on his fellow Ministers? I take it that the Treasurer cut down Estimates which had been approved, not only by the heads of Departments, but also by Ministers in charge of Departments, and which, therefore, went to the Treasurer with the <inline font-style="italic">imprimatur</inline> of his own colleagues. The Minister for Repatriation tells us that, not only- did the Treasurer do that, but that the Government discovered, at the end of the financial year, that another &#163;4,000,000 had been saved, or, in other words, that the money provided in the Estimates had not all been spent by &#163;4,000,000. Is that economy, or does that sum represent unexpended balances <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Does it indicate that the Departments asked for more money than they could reasonably expect to spend? It has been said, with a certain amount of truth that, in times past, Departments always asked for more money than they expected to get, because, no matter what Estimates they submitted to the Treasurer, the Treasurer always cut them clown. I should like to know whether, instead of these &#34; savings &#34; representing real economy, Departments did not ask for &#163;8,000,000 more than they expected to get, and whether the Treasurer gave them &#163;4,000,000 more than they had anticipated obtaining from him? How much of the second &#163;4,000,000 has been saved by means of economies, and what proportion of  it  represents unexpended balances?For instance, the ex-Postmaster-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster,</inline> complained with a certain amount of justification that, at a certain time he did not get all the money that he asked for. As it was wartime, I do not blame the Treasurer for diverting all the money possible to defence purposes, but it is not always the truest economy in certain circumstances to refuse to grant money that is required. I should be glad of further information about the &#163;4,000,000 which the Government now tell us has been saved, because it is quite possible that the Treasurer might, in certain circumstances, refuse to grant money, and find, in the long run, that he had not been exercising true economy. </para>

              <para>- That is so. The Treasurer&#39;s position is very different from that of other Ministers. They are not responsible for raising the. money. They do not tax the people. The Treasurer has to find the money, and it is much easier to spend it than to find it. Does the following case of a &#34; saving &#34; represent real economy? Money&#39; was placed on the Estimates for the Postal Department to spend, for instance, in purchasing telephones. The amount was ear-marked for that purpose. The telephones were ordered from England, but they bad not arrived by the 30th June, and, therefore, that money could not be spent, and we wore told that it could not be diverted to the purchase of other telephones, because at any moment those which had been ordered might arrive. Is that what the Government call an &#34;economy&#34;? The Minister for Repatriation says the Government are anxious for economy, and that the fact that &#163;4,000,000 less than was voted has been spent is an evidence of economy. </para>

              <para>- That is. what I should be glad to know. Can the Minister tell us whether in any Department it has been discovered that work could be done or material purchased for less than the amount of money voted by Parliament for the purpose, while securing the same efficiency? If so, that would represent real economy. I have asked a number of questions which the Minister possibly would be able to answer much more easily if he were allowed &#39; a &#39; little more time. That reminds me that it is unfair to rush Supply Bills through in this way. Honorable&#39; senators want a certain amount of information, and if a Supply Bill was. submitted for its first reading&#39; on one day, its second reading on the next day, and the final stages on the third day, they could ask questions and get the information they wanted. Is this Supply Bill for two months based upon the Estimates that were submitted last year, or on the Estimates lees the &#163;4,000,000 saved? </para>

            <para>. - I am afraid that the somewhat awkward questions put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> arise from my presumption . in giving the Senate more information than was actually required on this Bill. The opportunity which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> desires to ascertain whether the economies are . real or not will be provided on the Estimates, but . there was no obligation on me to give as full information as I did give regarding the finances on a Supply Bill which is merely to pay the ordinary running expenses of the Government. </para>

              <para>- In this Chamber it is always difficult to know whether one has a majority or not. It is a case of&#34; save me from my friends.&#34; It appears that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas&#39;</inline> line of argument is that if the Government spend all the money voted on the Estimates they are to be accused of not endeavouring to economize. </para>

              <para>-I have already given the&#39; honorable senator some particulars. Whether the saving was a general one or postponed expenditure, the one item I have given will &#39; answer the question.Asum of&#163;713,000 was actually saved in the working of the Department, apart from the question of the purchase of telephones. That cannot be deferred expenditure but general expenditure. Regarding the other item in which a saving is expected, I am unable to give the honorableSenator the information he desires; but on the presentation of the Estimates I shall come, as Ioughtto, properly armed with all the details. </para>
