                <quote>
                    <para>The reasons thus advanced for abolition of the existing system of control demand some consideration, seeing that this proposal involves a complete reversal of the policy hitherto existing, and a return to a system of departmental management now considered by all Public Service authorities as archaic and unsatisfactory. From a careful review of the evidence submitted to the 'Royal Commission, it is found that no sufficient arguments had been adduced which would lend weight to the conclusions arrived at. In its recommendation on this subject, apart from the statement that divided control is undesirable and unnecessary, no reasons are furnished for such expression of opinion. It must be assumed that the Parliament, in placing the control of the personnel of the Service and the disposition of officers in the hands of the Public Service Commissioner, had in view the desirableness of some separate authority which would regulate the classification and advancement of officers throughout the Commonwealth, instead of their being subject to the caprice or prejudice of officers in charge in the several States. </para>
                    <para>As an illustration, it is only necessary to cite the unsatisfactory condition of Western Australian officers subsequent to Federation, and prior to the operation of the Public Service Act, when they were placed in the invidious position of being transferred to remote districts, merely because they happened <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> have incurred the displeasure of some one in authority, and when cases of manifest injustice towards officers were numerous. And, indeed, the indications are not wanting even to-day that a return to departmental control of staff matters would result in the inauguration of a system of favoritism and patronage. Officers of the Department have frequently expressed appreciation of the fact that their rights and interests are protected under the Public Service Act, and that they have been freed from domineering and unfair local control. It is most desirable that in determining matters affecting the official welfare, the controlling power should not be influenced by close personal association with the officers affected. The Royal Commission lays, the greatest stress on merit as governing promotion; but experience has proved that too much reliance cannot be placed on the opinions of responsible officers coming into direct contact with their subordinates, and, therefore, subjected to the disadvantages of local environment. It follows that under the proposed new system, while efficiency and meritorious service are to be the factors of advancement, all independent judgment as to relative merit is to be removed. Such a condition of affairs would undermine - if not absolutely neutralize - the merit provisions of the Act, and prove disastrous to the morale of the Public Service. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; during those six months they would be "only acting officers. In the report of the Commission very great emphasis is laid on the fact that there are a large number of officers acting in positions to which they have not been permanently appointed. I agree with the Commission that the period of probation should be less than six months. There is to be an appeal to the Board, but there is no provision for inspectors, and I do not know how the Board can tell what is the right thing to do without the assistance of inspectors. An officer, in making an appeal, may have behind him the permanent head of the Department, who may clash with the Public Service Commissioner. The official would have great support in having the permanent head of the Department behind him. An officer in the "backblocks " may appeal and have practically no one behind him. The head of his Department may be in favour of another officer, and if there were no inspectors the Board would be in a hopeless position. </para>

                        <para>- That is a very brilliant idea. An officer in the backblocks may appeal, and there may be other appeals from persons in Tasmania and Western Australia. It would be necessary to get three different people to find out all about those officers. Under the present system we have a Public Service Commissioner, whose duty it is to know all the officers in the Service. Inspectors would know more about them than the heads of Departments. A man at the head of one Department would not know anything about the ability of an officer of another Department, but the Public Service Commissioner does. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> might have brought his information up to date. The very first line of the report of the Public Service Commission for 1919 states - " The following procedure should govern the making of promotions." The Commission called the Public Service Commissioner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McLachlan)</inline> as a witness, and his first recommendation was that promotions, other than to the first division, should be made by the permanent head or the chief officer. I remember discussing the report with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> who was very strongly opposed to the arbitrator being the supreme authority. It was pointed out that that was more democratic,' and that the objection to the Commissioner was' that  he  would  be  the court  of  appeal from his own decisions. Subsequently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> changed his mind, and gave full support to the principle  of  appeal from the Commissioner,  or  from the Board,  to  the Arbitration Court. He showed that with his experience he had become more broadminded. At first the Public Service of the Commonwealth was a very limited body, but it now comprises many thousands of men, and one Commissioner cannot now effectively control all the Departments, as he did in the early days. I believe that the Public Service Inspectors have, in the circumstances which have surrounded them, done very good work. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> seem to be under the impression that the clause will not give applicants for promotion the opportunities accorded by the present Act. This is a misapprehension, as the new clause gives advantages not previously open. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> says that at present all vacancies are advertised, and all officers have an opportunity to submit applications. This is not the practice. As a general rule only an original vacancy is advertised, that is, a vacancy which may be caused by death or retirement of an officer. Such a vacancy may be in one of the higher positions in the Service, say, the first class of the Clerical Division. The filling of that vacancy by the promotion of an officer of the second class would leave consequential vacancies in the second, third, and fourth classes. As a rule, these vacancies are filled without advertisement upon a nomination by the permanent head or chief officer after consultation with the Public Service Inspector, who submits an independent report to the Commissioner. "Under the present system, the permanent head makes his nomination. He will not do more under the proposed course; but the material difference is that at present before any officer has an opportunity of appeal the 'Commissioner has already given a decision. Under this clause the permanent head will be required to publicly notify, in the case of every vacancy, the name of the officer he has selected for the position.

                        <para>- I have just stated what is the practice. As honorable senators will see,, the final court of appeal will be the Board. Exception has been taken by some honorable senators to the possibility of promotions being provisional for a period of six months. That term, I take it, will be the maximum period. The time within which appeals may be lodged is to be prescribed, and probably in practice it will be about a fortnight. </para>

                        <para>- In practice, I said about a fortnight. Sub-clause 5 provides that promotion shall be provisional, and notified in the prescribed manner, and be subject to the right of appeal within such time as may be prescribed, by any officer who may consider he is more entitled to promotion for the vacant office. The time allowed for appeal will depend, I should say, upon circumstances. The provision must be more or less elastic in order that officers situated in different parts of the Commonwealth may be allowed sufficient time within which to state their case.

                    <para>. -  I am rather opposed to this amendment. I recognise that if I call for a division I shall probably stand alone. There has been some doubt as to whether the Government have the power to make these appointments, but I understand that it has decided, on legal advice, that it has the power. The amendment will make it certain that Ministers will have the right to appoint their permanent secretaries. There was a time when I favoured that practice, but some appointments made recently have been ' somewhat unsatisfactory, and it is mainly because of them that I am not in favour of the amendment. Some people have  wondered why certain recent appointments have been made. </para>

To the extent that the appointments will be made by the Cabinet, they will be political appointments. The man who has got the ear of the Minister will probably receive the appointment. </para>

                        <para>- Members of Parliament do not always voice their objections, but there have been one or two appointments made lately which have caused people to talk. If a National Government can make appointments that are not altogether satisfactory, other parties, if they get into power, may do the same. It would be all right if the Minister were to be Minister for his life-time. I can understand that the permanent head of his Department is the one who has to carry out his policy, and it would be undesirable that such an officer should be opposed to him. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is speaking of many years ago. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan's</inline> ideas have evolved considerably since ' that time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> has not followed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan's</inline> mind as I have. I have sat on a Committee with him. I can challenge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> to show me any recommendation by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> in his most recent report against the principle incorporated in the amendment that I have moved. I remember at one time, when I was in the Defence Department, I asked an officer to do something, and he replied, " Don't you think you had better do that yourself, sir? " I said, " Get out of the room." He got out, and did not come back. When an officer commences to interfere, and will not take instructions, it is time for him to be shifted. I knew that I had no power to dismiss him, but he did not enter my office again. </para>

                        <para>- I get a deputation once a week from returned soldiers contending that officers responsible for the administration of Departments are not giving effect to the Government's policy of preference to returned soldiers. Sometimes this is due to misinterpretation of the Government's policy on the part of the officers, and sometimes to carelessness. I find that in regard to the appointment of radio-telegraphic operators on Commonwealth ships, a contract was entered into with the Marconi Company which made no provision for preference to returned men. The company is not employing returned men in some cases in the radio service. The omission in that case was an accident, and I am taking steps to correct it. In nearly all constitutional countries the heads of the Departments are appointed by the Government, and I think it is advisable to continue that practice in Australia. The amendment is in conformity with a recommendation of the Economies Commission. </para>

                    <para>. -  I did not intend to obtrude myself into the discussion of this complicated measure, for the sufficient reason that I know very little about the intricacies of the Public Service. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> asks for some specific reason for a policy in which he himself at one time believed, I submit that there is an absence of that frankness which is ordinarily a characteristic of the honorable senator. As he believed in the theory at one time, I decline to assume that he believed in it without having carefully considered the reasons for it ; and he therefore knew, and must have in his mind now, the reasons which caused him to attach himself to that theory. The same reasons obtain to-day. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator will possess himself in patience, I will do my best to refresh his memory as to the reasons which at one time convinced him. There is in the Public Service, and perhaps there always will be, a conflict between two principles. With the idea of preventing any favoritism creeping in, a Commissioner has been appointed, who pays attention to loyalty of service, and, among other things, to seniority. I venture to say that, as a result of that practice, full recognition is not given to merit. -In the case of permanent head of a Department, it is admitted by everybody that all other considerations should be swept aside in the presence of the necessity of getting the best possible man for the position. In order to secure that best possible man, I submit that the ordinary conditions which rule the Public Service should be swept on one side; otherwise, the other factor, which may be necessary as a safeguard in the Service generally, becomes not a safeguard, and the Department may not secure the best possible man. I submit that, in giving this right of appointment not to an individual Minister but to the Cabinet, the Senate has a right to assume that an honest effort will be made to secure the best man. The best man is not always the one who would come next in order of seniority. </para>

                        <para>- Nevertheless the selection is made by the Minister from the very best men available anywhere. The question, however, is whether it would be better that the person concerned should be selected by the Cabinet, with full appreciation of the responsibility, or whether the choice should be handed over to a Board, which, after all, is largely guided by regulations. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator expects that, he must have greater faith in human nature than I possess. One hears talk of securing the rewards of merit. The Public Service is largely routine-controlled. Men receive promotion by way of seniority, plus, in many instances, records of reasonably good service. But, with respect to the rapid advance of certain others, the suggestion underlying such progress is that the Government, having free choice, have selected and promoted men who have revealed outstanding merit. </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of actual practice, the power of veto can be exercised to produce positive results. It can be so used as ultimately to secure one's own individual selection. In many years' experience I have not heard of any great evil arising from the present practice, but I can readily conceive of some unfortunate appointments being made if the system of Ministerial selection did not prevail. I ask honorable senators, therefore, to permit matters to remain as they satisfactorily exist. </para>

I do not know that there is such specific provision - whether, for example, it is set out in clause 46  -  but, if the Bill does so provide, I desire to amend it. I should like to have it made perfectly clear that the Government shall have, and continue to possess, an absolutely free hand in appointing heads of Departments. Departmental efficiency depends in a very great measure upon the ability and character of the permanent head. </para>

                        <para>- Machinery is provided for ridding the Service of inefficient officers. If a Minister has availed himself of that machinery, and brought 'about the dismissal of an unsuitable man, he should have a free hand in the appointment of a successor. The Government are responsible, and ' should possess control over the appointment and continuance in service of those who are administering Departments. So far as permanent heads are concerned, the power of selection, 1 maintain, should be in the hands of the Cabinet, and not a matter for any Board. </para>

                    <para>, -  I invite honorable senators to consider the position upon the retirement or death of a permanent head. The Minister controlling the Department could appoint any qualified individual to fill the vacancy, and the selected person would become permanent head of the Department. There might be a change of Government, however, and an incoming Minister might not like that permanent head. To-day he cannot dismiss him, however. If this clause provided as wide a scope as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> advocates, there would be something in his arguments; but it does not do so. As for the policy of changing heads of Department with every change of Administration, even if the matter of an officer's efficiency carried some weight, it should not be overlooked that the recognition of his qualifications might become a matter of purely personal consideration. I must admit, however, that there is a good deal to be said in favour of the practice - upon a new Minister taking over the administration of a Department - of permitting him to appoint one who was sympathetic with his policy, and would govern the affairs of the Department in accordance therewith. The Public Service is,' in the main, absolutely loyal to the responsible Ministers. It has been said of the British Public Service that its <inline font-style="italic">personnel "</inline> served both parties with equal fidelity, and, probably, with equal contempt." I shall make no allusions to the local relevance or otherwise of the latter phase, but I am sure the Government are very deeply indebted to their heads of Departments. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to make it quite clear that I do not in the least approve of the introduction of any such system into the Commonwealth Public Service. I wish to make it quite clear also that, in my opinion, it is very desirable that where new appointments of permanent heads are being made, Ministers in charge of the Departments concerned should have a say. In this connexion, I have had a little personal experience. I came into command of a Brigade on active service. It so happened that three of the commands within that Brigade fell vacant, and three, names were sent to me of persons who were to be appointed to those commands. I knew those three men, and my opinion of them was that they were not suitable for commands under me. It was pointed out to me that some one else had recommended them as being fit for the command of battalions. I then said, "Let those people have them. I do not want them. They are not suitable, in my opinion." I was then told that I must take them. Then I said to my Divisional Commander, " Who is responsible for the efficiency of the Brigade; am I responsible, or are you?" He said, "You are."I replied, "Very well, sir, I am going to have men in command of my battalions whom I consider efficient, and in whom I have confidence. If I am head of the Brigade and responsible for it, I cannot have men under me whom I consider incompetent to manage my subordinate departments properly." I got my own way. </para>

                    <para>. -  We have been told that a Minister is not able to choose even his own private secretary, but that he can exercise a power of veto, 'which, if he exhausts it sufficiently, may enable him to secure the type of assistant he desires. We  have  had considerable discussion and inquiry in the Senate concerning the difficulties of dealing even with junior officials, irrespective of whether they merit the positions they occupy or not. I understand that Ministers have not the power, to get rid even of their private secretaries or officers closely associated with them, whether efficient or otherwise ; and I want to raise the question of the power of  a  Minister or the Board to get rid of any inefficient officer. We shall enter shortly upon the consideration of clause 53, which may be regarded as the Army Act of the Public Sex-vice. It isa very long clause, providing punishments for offences, and we shall need to consider it very carefully as operating throughout the Service. The power of the Board or of the Minister to remove an inefficient permanent head should be defined when we come to consider that clause. </para>

                    <para>. -  I direct attention to the very wide range of paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> and e of sub-clause 1 in connexion with penalties for offences by officers other than those of the first and second divisions. Under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> it is provided that an officer who " uses intoxicating liquors or drugs to excess " and under paragraph e an officer who "is guilty of any disgraceful or improper conduct, either in his official capacity or otherwise," shall be liable to the penalties provided in the Bill. So far as the use of intoxicating liquors or drugs is concerned this is a very sweeping provision. lt takes into consideration the actions of an officer whether on or off duty, and whether in or out of office hours. I am not going to contend that there is not a good deal to be said in favour of the provision, but* a tyrannical, arbitrary, or harsh administration of it might in certain conceivable circumstances and conditions be extremely unjust. </para>

If deliberate injustice is perpetrated, an officer should have every opportunity to remedy it. Clause 53 will really be the Army Act of the Service^. It will apply to the privates, but not to the high officers. </para>

                    <para>. - I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that the Act which has been in operation since 1909 makes exactly the same provision in regard to offences. It is provided in section 46 of that Act that officers shall be liable to be dealt with by the head of the Department for being guilty of any disgraceful or improper conduct, or using intoxicating liquor to excess. Therefore, the clause we are now discussing is not an innovation. We should inquire whether the Act has been effective in maintaining the status of a body second to none in the Commonwealth, from the point of view of cost and importance. </para>

No business organization or firm throughout Australia would tolerate improper conduct on the part of its employees out of office hours, or the excessive use of intoxicating liquor. Every officer in the Public Service must recognise that he is expected to be a gentleman outside of the Service, as he must be within it. Until I am shown that the present law is oppressive I shall support the clause as printed, so far as the first portion of it goes. </para>

                    <para>. -  It is not the practice to penalize an officer for a technical offence, but very often a small penalty will prevent an offender from giving trouble in future. I have met a number of public officers, who, on their way to work, appeared to be quite unfit for it. Sometimes officers in very responsible positions have been seen on duty in anything but a fit condition. In one instance, an officer was unable to do his work properly for years, and he was eventually dismissed; but such cases as that are rare. The Administration deals with such men in a generous spirit, but when an officer repeatedly offends there should be some power to remove him from the Service. I recollect the case of an officer who was suspected of stealing £2,000 in notes from the Post and Telegraph Department, and was suspended. He applied for his pay, but did not receive it. He was tried three times, and the jury failed to agree. Then he was sent before the Public Service Board and was dismissed. I cannot say that he was guilty of the offence, although I had no doubt of it in my own mind. I know that the £2,000 was never returned to the Department. </para>

                    <para>. -  I can see the force of the Minister's argument" as applied to minor offences, particularly if the appeal means an objection to the (penalty imposed, or a lodgment of the equivalent to "not guilty." But as I read the clause, the context imposes an obligation upon the appellant, not only to appeal within forty-eight hours of the notification of his punishment or offence, but also to complete his appeal. That is the gravamen of the objection to the time limit of forty-eight hours. Even the imposition of such a small fine as 5s. presumes an offence against some regulation or other, and it would be extremely objectionable to  a  sensitive public servant if he felt that he were not deserving of the infliction even of a minor penalty. It is not fair to limit an appellant in this way. He may elect to seek legal assistance. Even a minor offence may be complicated in its nature. I hope the Minister will consider the point I have raised. There can be no objection to an extension of the time so far as the drafting of the clause is concerned. </para>

                    <para>.- While I admit that the time within which appeals may be lodged is not so important in connexion with the offences referred to in sub-clause 2, dealing with minor offences, for which  a  small fine may be imposed, I am not prepared to pass the general question of the right of appeal in the case of major offences. If, on the arguments of the Minister, the Committee allows the time for appeal in minor cases -to be fixed at forty-eight hours, the same objection may be used against any extension of time for the right of appeal in the more serious offences. I am not insisting upon an extension of time for appeal in minor offences, (but I hope the Minister will realize that for major charges more time should be allowed. </para>

                        <para>- When an officer is fined, the incident is closed. It would be unreasonable after the expiration of, say, twenty years to take into consideration a minor offence which had been committed, and penalize an officer on that account. It is not proposed under this Bill to keep any official record of offences, although they may be kept in the Departments. </para>

                        <para>- There is no statutory provision to that effect. A public servant may have committed a minor offence many years ago, and subsequently, in addition to rendering good service to the Commonwealth, may also have been on active service. It would be unreasonable and unjust to raise the point that he had been fined for a minor offence many years ago. Although no official records are kept, offences are very often recalled. There is no special provision in the Bill, but reference is made in subclause 4 to appeals being made to the Appeal Board on the ground of innocence of the charge or excessive severity of the punishment, when the previous record of the officer will be considered. It is not the desire of the Government to penalize officers who committed a minor offence perhaps many years ago. </para>

                    <para>.- I think it will be  admitted  that, whether offences are recorded or not depends to a large extent upon the attitude of the officer in charge of the Department in which an offender may have served. We cannot very well prevent an officer being even ridiculously vindictive if he should, be so inclined. Quite recently, a striking instance of this character was brought before the Senate in connexion with the lift boy. </para>

                    (Queensland) relation to offences, particularly minor offences committed by officers of the Service, the Government are inclined to take a kindly view. I am of opinion that to have too rigid, hard-and-fast, and " ironclad" clauses and regulations often leads to the commission of offences rather than exerts any restraining influence. I remember that when the Railway Regulation Bill was before the Queensland Parliament a clause was put in to wipe out the record of all past offences. That clause had a good effect on the morale of the railway service. This Bill is a thoroughly humane and truly democratic Bill, for it is seeking to advance the truest interests of the Public Service. The Minister
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline>
                    in accepting amendments, and in his pronouncements in relation to airmen, returned soldiers, and naval men, shows that the Government are anxious to place on the statute-book an Act of the most humane kind. I think that is what we want to aim at, particularly at a time like the present. We have had plenty of blood-shedding, hard discipline, and "iron-bound" rules, and we now want something humane to appeal to the better nature of men. I have listened to the discussion as carefully as I could - I am under a disadvantage in some respects - and I think that it has been of a high order. Many things have been made clear to me. I have not had a chance of reading carefully and minutely the Commonwealth Public Service Act, although I have read the Queensland Act. In future I hope to be able to take a , more decided part in the debates in this Senate than I have been able to take foi some time past. I am thankful to members of the Senate for the kindly way in which they have treated me during the last fourteen months. They have been terrible months to me; and, probably, only I know how terrible they have been. I want to do what I can in the future for the country that has done so much for me, and I hope I shall be able to do more than I have done in the past.

                    <para>.- I have listened carefully to the explanation given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie of the true meaning of the clause. Honorable senators ought to be grateful to him for having discovered the true meaning, and for having explained it to the Committee. He has shown us that we have been somewhat misled, perhaps by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> regarding the true intention of the clause. The clause clearly shows that in regard to minor offences for which the fine does not exceed 5s. there is absolutely no appeal; but when we come to the major offences, for which a fine not exceeding £5 may be imposed, the officer may appeal to the  chief officer, but he must lodge the appeal within forty-eight hours. For- other penalties imposed for major offences it is provided that an appeal may be made " as prescribed." That means that a regulation will be made prescribing the form of appeal and stating" the period of time that will be allowed for lodging it. </para>

                        <para>- I will confine my remarks to the fining of an officer a sum not exceeding <inline font-style="italic">£5,</inline> in connexion, with which he has the right of appeal to the chief officer. I do not think that a period of forty-eight hours is sufficient time to allow for lodging the appeal. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> was speaking some time ago regarding the advisability of extending that period the Minister said. "This is only for minor offences for which the fine cannot be more than 5s. Surely forty-eight hours is ample time to allow in such cases for an officer to. appeal." We have discovered now that the- stipulation, relates not only to minor offences, but also to major offences. </para>

                    <para>. - I was extremely pleased to hear the considerate utterances of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> regarding minor offences. All honorable senators are extremely glad to have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Adamson</inline> again in active participation in the business of this Senate after his long and very trying illness. He, also, uttered sentiments that we all agree with in regard to the desirability of acting humanely towards, at all events, those who commit only minor offences. From my own knowledge, records of offences committed in the Service are kept, in some way or other. I am going to ask the Minister, in view of his utterances with regard to minor offences, and in view of the almost unanimous desire of this Senate to be reasonably humane towards the poor, frail members of humanity who sometimes make a slip, that is not serious, to accept an amendment to sub-clause 2.

The records of offences are, indeed, kept, and this amendment will place a limit upon the time during which reference may be made to a minor offence committed by any officer. </para>

                        <para>- I am obliged to the Minister for pointing that fact out. It seems to me to be an additional reason for incorporating my amendment in the Bill. There have been instances in the administration of the Service when minor offences of many years' standing have been brought up against officers in connexion with boards of inquiry, appeal cases, and the like. I have been informed of this on the authority of the high council of the Service, and I hope, after all that has been said, that the attempt I have made to give practical effect to the admirable, humane sentiments uttered in this Senate this afternoon will be unanimously approved. </para>

                    <para>.- May I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that he ask leave to insert his amendment after the words, "five shillings," in sub-clause 2. The amendment would then come at the end of the reference to minor offences. The amendment deals only with the record of minor offences, and if inserted where I suggest, it would separate effectively the portion of the clause dealing with minor offences from the portion dealing with major offences. It would thus meet the wishes of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie to a certain extent, by placing something between the references to the two classes of offences. Sub-clause 2 deals with appeals by an officer who has been fined for the commission of a major offence. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to refer to the time within which an officer shall reply to a charge made against him. The time provided for under the clause is forty-eight hours, even in connexion with a major offence, which might, and probably would, necessitate consultation with a legal adviser and with friends, the collection of evidence, and a somewhat exhaustive inquiry into the circumstances under which the officer charged might successfully appeal against a possible act of injustice. We have considered the time allowed for an appeal against a fine or reprimand, or other minor penalty imposed by an officer other than the head of a Department, and during the consideration of that matter the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> agreed that that time might not be long enough for the preparation of an appeal in the case of a major offence. I have discussed the Bill in a somewhat cursory way with one or two officers of the Commonwealth Public Service in my own State. They suggested to me that in the case of major offences four days would be a fairer time to allow for an appeal. The high council of the Commonwealth Public Service that has gone very minutely into this Bill, has suggested that seven days should be allowed in which to lodge an appeal where an officer is charged with a major offence. We have to decide as between forty-eight hours, four days, and seven days which would be the fairest time to allow. </para>

                        <para>-  I suggested omitting "as prescribed," and inserting " in such manner and within such time, not Jess than seven days, as may be prescribed." An extension from forty-eight hours to seven days is a big increase, and I think it is very generous. </para>

                        <para>- Then the question is whether we shall omit or retain the words in the proviso to sub-clause 3, " be other than fine." There is  a  feeling in the Service that, inasmuch as State awards provide for a direct appeal to a Board, over the head of an officer who has imposed a penalty, the same provision should be made under this Bill. It is for the Committee to say whether an appeal against such a finding shall be adjudicated upon by the chief officer or by the Appeal Board. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot find anything in the clause providing for the imposition of a fine between 5s. for a minor offence and £5 for a major offence. I want to know what constitutes a minor and what a major offence. Am 1 to understand that if an officer is fined 5s., it is a minor offence; and if he is fined any other amount up to £5, it is still a minor offence? .  </para>

                        <para>- If a- man receives a notification to appear before the chief officer, is that, a formal charge? Subclause 3, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> shows that officers may be charged with certain offences, and, they are not so charged unless they are considered to have committed major offences. If an officer is charged with, <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> major offence, and is fined the nominal sum of ls., there should be some definite understanding as to whether that automatically becomes a major offence. </para>

                    <para>. - To have two sets of offences is an excellent idea, but we should make the question clear, irrespective of whether they are major or minor offences. It would be absurd if the Bill did not provide for trivial offences to be dealt with by the permanent head of the Department. Therefore the clause, so far as it relates to minor offences, should be adopted. Offences which are dealt with in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of sub-clause 3 would be of such a serious nature that the officer charged would probably be deemed not fit to continue in 'the performance of his duty, and would be suspended until the charge had been investigated. </para>

                        <para>-  Suppose an officer were charged and suspended on what appeared, on the face of it, to be a major offence. Upon appeal the Board might declare that the offence was not one punishable with a fine of £6, and might fine him only ls. The mere fact that he had been charged on a major offence would leave a black mark against his record. </para>
