                    <para>. - I should like some information from the Minister in charge of the. Bill regarding the position of the trade in brandy from South Africa. We had some kind of reciprocal arrangement governing the importation of brandies from South Africa, and I understand that allowing for the difference between the Excise and Customs duties on brandy, there is  a  protection of about 4s. per gallon in favour of the manufacturer of brandy in Australia. Some Adelaide distillers have spoken to me in connexion with the matter and have expressed the opinion that they are in a worse position to-day than they were in some time ago. I am led to believe that there is some dumping of brandy from South Africa. I believe it is under Government control and that a certain amount is allocated for the authorities and the remainder is dumped. There is rather an abundance of brandy in Australia at the present time. I was talking to one of the big. distillers from Mildura recently, and he said that he had supplies of brandy which he&#39; found it difficult to dispose of, because he has to compete against the importation of French brandies which can be sold at a price which is 2s. per gallon less than the price at which he can afford to sell brandy. A certificate is given in France which is represented by a white label and that is accepted by the Customs Department here as an indication that the article is a pure grape brandy. Perhaps the Minister is in a position to explain the position, so far as South&#39; Africa is concerned. </para>

                    <para>.- The position in regard to South Africa is that the reciprocal arrangement is to be repealed by the Customs Tariff Bill now before Parliament. The clause of the measure which annuls that reciprocal arrangement will not come into operation until the Bill is finally passed and assented to.  It  is not in that respect like Tariff resolutions which become operative immediately they are tabled. On the Customs Tariff Bill being assented to, negotiations will be opened with South Africa to enable the present or a like arrangement to continue under the conditions of the intermediate Tariff. The question which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rowell</inline> raises in connexion with brandy will be a matter for negotiation in deciding upon the terms of the arrangement. The Customs officers inform me that,  at  present, under this arrangement very little brandy is coming in from South Africa. </para>

                <para class="block">French brandy, being accepted by the Customs officers on a. certificate of the local mayor, was coming into competition with the local product which is made from the purest grape spirit. This handicap on the Australian industry is very considerable, because the local manufacturers have to supply the genuine article whereas the light French brandies are not made from grape wines at all. The Minister then in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> was good enough to say that he would satisfy me on the point I had raised. I believe efforts are being made to overcome the difficulty, and that in future the certificates must be furnished by a properly authorized officer of the Department. I have been in conversation with several of our growers on the Murray where over 700 settlers are producing Doradila grapes, and I am advised that it is essential that the industry should be adequately protected. The Doradila grape produces the purest brandy in Australia. In view of the. fact that the Committee would not give this protection when this matter came before us in connexion with the Tariff, I suggest that the Minister should move to reduce the Excise duty. This would place us in a better position. Instead of 27s., the Excise should be 2s. less. The difference between the Excise and the Customs duty would probably have the effect of giving security to our growers.. </para>

                    <para>. - I have one or two questions to ask with regard to the varying rates fixed for different classes of spirits. Under sub-item (d), whisky, distilled wholly from barley malt by a pot still or similar process, carries a duty per proof gallon of 26s., and under sub-item e, the Excise on blended whisky is 28s. per proof gallon. In sub-item f, rum distilled wholly from sugar, sugar syrup, molasses, or the refuse of sugar cane, bears&#39; a duty of 28s., and blended rum a duty of 29s. per proof gallon. Varying other rates are mentioned. For instance, in sub-item j, which deals with spirit for fortifying Australian wine, subject to regulations, the duty per proof gallon is 6s. This is a big drop from 23s. and 28s., but one can understand it when one realizes that spirit under sub-item j is regarded as part of the raw material for another industry, namely, for fortifying Australian wine. Then in sub-item k  there is a duty per proof gallon of 2s. on spirit for making vinegar subject to regulations. This is a very small Excise, and it is obvious that these differential Excise duties are intended to encourage the manufacture of Australian wine and vine- gar. A little lower down in the schedule we find that the manufacturers are not treated quite so well. For instance, in sub-item  l,  spirits for the manufacture, from Australian products exclusively, of scents and toilet preparations, carry an Excise duty of 23s., and in the following sub-item, spirits for the manufacture of scents and toilet preparations, subject to regulations, duties of from 17s. to 20s. </para>

                    <para>. - It will not be necessary to rectify any anomaly. If honorable senators will look at these sub-items they will see that it would he most unwise to alter them. Sub-item  j  fixes the Excise duty on spirit for fortifying Australian wine, and sub-item  k  the Excise duty on spirit for making vinegar. It is a most important matter to provide cheap spirit for fortifying Australian wine, thus assisting a primary production, and for the making of vinegar - an important commercial requisite - the production of which it is desirable to encourage in Australia, especially when our own health regulations can be applied to it. However, sub-item  l,  which provides the Excise duties upon spirit used for the manufacture of scents and toilet preparations, refers to what are essentially articles of luxury. In dealing with the Customs Tariff, the Committee agreed to a request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> the effect of which was to make the Excise paid by the local manufacturer on his spirit equal to the fixed rate of duty payable on imported toilet preparations, scents, &#38;c, containing spirit. </para>

                        <para>- I think so. The concession has only been in operation for a short period, but as time goes on the little encouragement given in this sub-item will probably be the  means  of developing a perfumery trade absolutely  all Australian from the perfume itself to the finished article. I want to say a word or two upon sub-item d, whisky. Honorable senators will remember that I mentioned  the matter when we were discussing the Customs Tariff. The British Immature Spirits Act provides that no whisky or similar liquor can be liberated in Great Britain for human consumption unless it has been stored in wood for a period of three years. There is similar legislation in New Zealand and Fiji, but our Commonwealth Act provides that spirit may be liberated for human, consumption in Australia if it has been matured in wood for two years. Australian whisky and other spirits exported to Great Britain cannot be liberated there under three years, but French and British spirit and Scotch whisky can be sent out here and liberated for consumption after having been matured in wood for two years. I am not quite dear as to whether anything can be done in the direction of securing uniformity, but if it can be achieved it ought to be in the direction of having the longer period, because the leading distillers of the world consider that the longer spirit is stored in wood before being liberated for human consumption the better it is. It might&#39; be &#39;advisable to amend our legislation governing this matter, and extend the period for which spirits must be stored in wood before they are permitted to be liberated for human consumption in Australia. What is good enough for England and Scotland ought to be good enough for Australia. This matter may have some bearing upon the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benny</inline> in reference to the importation of French brandy. . It is quite possible that French brandy, certified to by the local mayor or official as having been stored for two years, may be sent to Australia for immediate consumption here. Surely this is an anomaly. In the interests of the health of the community, I think we should bring our legislation into conformity with that of Great Britain. </para>

                    <para>. - If there is an anomaly it does not occur in our legislation. Sections 11 and 12 of the Commonwealth Spirits Act, which provides for the storage of spirits in wood for two years, are consistent with the Excise Tariff Act, which stipulates that spirits imported into Australia or exported from Australia must have been stored in wood for two years. The inconsistency, if any, is between our legislation and&#39; that of Great Britain, which provides that the spirit must be stored for three years. I am not prepared to express an opinion, offhand. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> suggestion, would be a very proper matter, I think,, for inquiry by the Tariff Board, for there are such considerations as the effect upon, our export trade, and upon local manufacture generally. , The longer the spirit is stored the longer the capital involved lies idle - although, of course, it is being enhanced. To that extent - namely, the tieing up of capital - a tax is imposed upon local industry. It would be unwise to make an alteration of a vital principle without? very serious consideration, following upon full investigation. Experts should be called upon to consider the whole effect upon industry, after which the policy of Customs administration could be adjusted, if deemed desirable, to secure conformity with the British law and practice. </para>

                        <para>- Some do, while other physicians hold contrary views. Some honorable senators will object, no-  doubt, that, if the duty on spirit for scientific purposes is further reduced, advantage may be taken of it in illegitimate directions. Other countries deal with that difficulty from a common-sense point of view. A very low duty is imposed, but regulations are gazetted which practically prevent improper practices. In Great Britain rectified spirit, when supplied for potable purposes, pays duty at 74s. per proof gallon. The same spirit, when supplied for pharmaceutical purposes, pays duty at the rate of 14s. 9d. per proof gallon, which is equal to a rebate of 69s. 3d. per proof gallon. It ought to be possible to prevent the illegitimate use of spirit by the adoption of any or all of a number of suggestions furnished by the Pharmaceutical Council. One of these is based upon the limitation of supply, the average &#39; quantity per pharmacy being fixed after consultation with the Pharmaceutical Society, as is done in the case of opium, cocaine, &#38;c. Another suggestion has to do with the keeping of records on the same lines as those required to be kept by perfume manufacturers and by chemists under the Opium Smoking Prohibition Proclamation. A third suggestion is for supervision by officers of Customs, similar to that in operation under the Spirits Act regulations. </para>

                        <para>- The suggestions are alternative, and are all worthy of consideration. The last mentioned might be discarded, and ample provision still be made to prevent abuse. One other suggestion is for securities and sureties in the form of monetary bonds, and another is for the cutting off of the concession on proof of illegitimate disposal of spirit. The view will be taken, perhaps, that hospitals can be more easily supervised than pharmacies and friendly societies&#39; dispensaries. Difficulties must always be expected when comprehensive steps are taken to prevent wrong practices and evasions. But if a great benefit can be conferred upon suffering humanity, as is here sought, honorable senators should be sympathetic. I move - </para>

                    <para>.- This matter has been brought under the notice of honorable senators, and it is one which, of course, appeals to our sentiments; but we must have regard to other things as well, as we are the guardians of the taxpayers&#39; interests. This matter has been fully considered since representations have been made, and the question has been thoroughly investigated by the Department. In the Excise Tariff, as introduced, the rate was as at present, viz., 25s. per proof gallon. On 17th September, 1920, it was raised to 28s. but it was subsequently reduced in the other House to 25s. on and after 8th July, 1921. In considering the rate on this item, it must be borne in mind that the spirit is used by chemists and many other manufacturers scattered in remote districts throughout the Commonwealth. Reference has been made to the conditions prevailing in the United Kingdom; but the comparison is not a good one, because Great Britain has a population of 48,000,000 people spread over a comparatively small area. When we consider the number of chemists that are scattered far and wide over this vast continent, it will be easy to realize the difficulty in administering such a provision. The Department would view with  alarm any reduction in the rate, as supervision of the uses to which the spirit might be put is quite out of the question, owing to the wide distribution of the users. A substantial increase in the number of officials would be necessitated for the purposes of supervision, and even such increase would not furnish adequate protection against abuse. It is true that spirit free of duty is given to public hospitals, but in this case, owing to the comparatively few institutions involved, adequate supervision is possible. Supervision is possible because the spirit is delivered to and held under heavy bond by the principal hospital in the State, or by State Government Drug Depots, as in New South Wales, which is responsible for safe custody and proper use. The distribution by the principal hospital or State Depot is measured out on a fixed scale strictly proportioned to the ascertained monthly, or, in small hospitals, quarterly, requirements, and complete records are kept of the quantities required and distributed. It is therefore impossible for the hospitals concerned to use the spirit for other than the specified purposes, as any increase in the quantities delivered would be at once detected and immediately investigated. In the case of spirit delivered for use in fortifying wine, sub-item j, or in making vinegar, sub-item x, or for the manufacture of scents, sub-item l, the spirit is treated in the presence of an officer in such a manner as to make it practically impossible to use it for any other purpose. In the case of fortifying wine, an officer has control of the spirit until it is actually mixed with the .wine, and sees the operation done. The same procedure applies to spirit for making vinegar or scents. It would be impossible to apply this control and supervision to the thousands of chemists scattered throughout the Commonwealth. In taking this view no reflection is cast on the integrity of chemists. But it is a matter of ordinary human experience that, were a concession of this kind to be given, the inability to exercise anything like adequate control would inevitably lead to abuse. The Committee has passed requests for increase of duty on medicines which practically compensate chemists for the duty charged on the spirit they use. The rate on Excise spirit is 25s. per proof gallon, and in item 285 a, additional duty under the general Tariff on medicine and medicinal preparations equal to 25s. per proof is the effect of the Committee&#39;s request. The request, therefore, provides for a duty practically sufficient to compensate for the Excise duty collected on the spirit used in the preparation of medicines. The substantial advantage granted te* chemists under this Tariff as compared with previous Tariffs will be evident from the fact that under the 1914 Tariff, as amended in September, 1918- that is, the Tariff in force at the time the present Tariff was introduced - chemists paid. 24s. per proof gallon on Excise spirit, while the duty on imported medicinal preparations containing spirit was based on a rate of 25s. per proof gallon. There was, therefore, a margin of ls. per proof gallon only in favour of the local manufacturer of medicines. Under the present Tariff, as modified by the Committee&#39;s requests, Excise duty on the spirit is 25s. per proof gallon, whereas the duty on imported spirituous medicines is <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> 30 per cent., 35 per cent., and 40 per cent., with the addition of a rate of 20s. per proof gallon under the British preferential and 25s. per proof gallon under the general Tariff. As regards spirituous extracts and tinctures, there was a margin of ls. per proof gallon only under the 1914 Tariff, whereas under the present Tariff there is a margin of 5s. per proof gallon under the British preferential Tariff and of 6s. per proof gallon under the general Tariff. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne&#39;s</inline> request is carried, we shall have to review what the Committee did last night in regard to the spirit contents of medicinal preparations and reduce them accordingly </para>

                        <para>- We have not prohibition here, and there is less necessity to suspect thebona <inline font-style="italic">fides</inline> of chemists than there is in, say, America. The rate has been increased from 13s. in 1913 to 25s. This is really a tax upon the sick and infirm section of the community. We are all likely to develop sickness, and as most people are not opulent, a tax of 25s. per gallon must bear severely upon those who fall by the wayside. I quite realize that public hospitals receive special treatment; but they are the only medium through which the community can be reached. Many have to depend upon the chemist&#39;s shop around the corner, and, in most instances, there is an hotel on the other corner, where whisky can be obtained for 9d. a nobbier. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. If he prefers the chemist&#39;s whisky to  a  good glass of whisky obtainable at an hotel. This duty has been nearly doubled during the last few years. It is now 25s. per proof gallon, whereas in Great Britain it is 14s. 9d. per proof gallon. In New Zealand, for 60 over-proof, the duty is 20s. per gallon, so that the tax on this commodity in the sister Dominion is very much below that which we are imposing. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators will see on reference to the schedule that the duty proposed on hand-made strand tobacco represents an increase of 8d. per lb. on the duty as originally submitted by the Government. For the moment, I do -not remember the margin between the Excise and Customs duties on tobacco, but I am aware that it is substantial, and that full protection is given to the local manufacturer. What I am concerned about, and what I think the general public are concerned about, is the inordinate rise in the price of tobacco. What might be purchased a little time ago for1s. has now to be paid for at the rate of1s. 5d. , or1s. 7d. The price often varies from day to day and from place to place. You may purchase tobacco in one shop at1s. 6d., and be asked1s. 7d. for the same thing in another shop. I have had the experience of leaving a shop in which I was asked 1s. 7d. for a certain quantity of a particular tobacco, and then found that a person who entered the shop immediately afterwards obtained the same quantity of the same article for1s. 6d. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that, but the retailer of tobacco complains that the manufacturer has put up the price, and the manufacturer says that he has raised the price because of the duty. The course which is followed in the trade is going a long way to&#39; make Australian tobacco unpopular. I am constantly hearing complaints on the part of the public of the prices charged for tobacco, and just as constantly the Federal Parliament is blamed for what has taken place. Judging by what prices are to-day, it is impossible to say what they will be next week. Prices vary in the different States for the same article. One can purchase in Melbourne for1s. 3d. what costs 1s. 6d. in Sydney, and <inline font-style="italic">vice vers&#226;.</inline> I have found Sydney-made tobacco sold here at 2 ounces for1s. 3d., and in Sydney within the same week I have been charged1s. 6d. The same thing prevails in regard to Melbourne-made tobacco, but not to the same extent. There should be publicity given to the way in which the public are unduly and unwarrantably charged by those interested in this local, industry. If what is taking place to-day is to be attributed to the heavy protection afforded local manufacturers of tobacco, then a great many Protectionists will have to reconsider their attitude with regard to the tobacco duties. I should like the Minister to say upon what grounds the increase of 8d. per lb. in the Excise duty is considered necessary. He might also inform the Committee of the quarter from which the demand for this increase upon the Government&#39;s original proposal came. He might say further whether in the opinion of the Government the increase of 8d. per lb. in the Excise duty has warranted the considerable enhancement of the price of tobacco to the public which has occurred since the introduction of this Tariff. </para>

                    <para>. - The increase referred to by the honorable senator is not merely in the Excise, duty. An equivalent increase has been made in the Customs duty. In the circumstances, if we reduce the Excise duty, we shall only be making a present of so much more protection to the local manufacturer, and no one can say that he is not adequately protected at present. </para>

                        <para>- The Customs duty is 4s. 8d. per lb., and the Excise duty 2s. 4d., so that the margin is 2s. 4d. I am informed that the actual protection amounts to1s. per lb. The Excise duty has been increased entirely upon revenue considerations. In view of the heavy financial liabilities of the Commonwealth, I think that this article might pay a higher amount to the revenue. I am a smoker myself, but I think I can justify that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has referred to the vagaries of those engaged in the tobacco business, and every member of the Committee must have noticed them. We have also noticed the uniformity with which the Tariff is blamed for the increase in price. There could be only one alteration of duty when the Tariff resolutions were tabled, but there have been five or six alterations in the price of. tobacco since they were tabled. </para>

The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> speaking at Bendigo, declared that, if Australia is ever to became a great nation, its greatness must rest upon a basis of land settlement. The Prime Minister&#39;s references to that subject occupied no less than 24 inches of newspaper space, whereas his remarks on the Tariff occupied only about 4 inches. I should like to add that the lot of these citizens has been made infinitely harder on account of recent events- </para>

                    <para>. - I was rather pleased at the remarks made by the Leader of the Government in this Chamber <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> concerning the work of the session, and the prospect of a short recess. I have no desire to complain of. the work done by the Senate during the session, although much of it has been in opposition to my principles. It was excellent work from the Protectionist stand-point, and I do not forget that the whole of the country has become Protectionist. But if the Government think that this fact justifies them in voting out preferential duties- </para>

                        <para>- I realized that I would not be, and I have no desire to add anything to what I have already said. But surely I would be in order in commenting on the election, by the people, of a Protectionist Parliament, and its effect on the Tariff. However, I have no desire to do so now. I shall conclude by joining in the good wishes expressed by the Leader of the Senate. </para>
