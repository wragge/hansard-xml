                        <para>- She still possesses huge iron resources, and, as figures which I quoted yesterday, which were accepted by honorable senators who were opposed to me then, clearly show, the cost of production is materially falling in. Belgium. The Committee has decided that pig iron shall be admitted at as low a rate as possible, and that no further restriction than that in the Tariff as it stands shall be placed on British imports of pig iron. But we should insure that our consumers, if they are not desirous of purchasing Australian iron, shall buy British iron. It is not the duty of the Committee to encourage the foreigner at the expense of the local manufacturer, or at the expense of the British manufacturer. We should see that our manufacturers are protected by proper duties, and our next consideration should be for those of the Homeland. It was pointed out yesterday by honorable senators that the iron trade of Great Britain is now passing through a period of depression, and that that depression is likely to be accentuated in the near future. It is from Great&#39; Britain, therefore, that we are likely in the near future to draw our heaviest supplies of iron. We should, then, give that country a substantial preference by practically prohibiting importation from other countries, if we cannot supply our own requirements. I am confident that we shall be able to supply most of our own requirements, and the fact of British importations competing with the output of local manufacturers will insure to the local consumer reason able prices. Australians do not want to favour Japan. I pointed out yesterday that Japan has recently come into possession of a new system of producing the raw material which may revolutionize the market. </para>

                        <para>- -Not in the present connexion, at any rate; and not  until finally driven to do so. It was due to Germany&#39;s vast resources, and to the huge industries which Australia, by heavy importations, had assisted that country to build, that our late enemy was able to hold out for so long during the recent war. The dreadful facts of that situation convinced me that I, at least, should never take any action to again assist Germany to rebuild her enterprises in order that she might once more, perhaps, embroil the world. The time is bound to come when, in certain directions, Australia must trade with Germany ; but, for the present, Australians should not be desirous of encouraging Germany to regain her lost trade. &#34;We should be far more ready to establish our own industries, and to assist Great Britain to readjust her industrial affairs after a period in which all her energies were devoted to war purposes. My request, if agreed to, will insure that, so far as our own requirements cannot be met by local manufacture, the necessary importations shall come from the Mother Country. If Great Britain is not able to furnish the demand- the time will then have arrived to seek elsewhere. Several Melbourne manufacturers waited on me only yesterday. They use the materials under consideration in their iron works, and they are as desirous as any one to give preference to British manufacturers. But they fear the competition of the foreigner with his cheap labour and, in many directions, his cheaper raw materials. </para>

                        <para>- It is a pity that the honorable senator has obviously not gone into the matter. To use the case of Germany as an argument in order to debar foreign products by the imposition of an unreasonable rate of duty should not be tolerated by this Committee. There are countries with which Australia is friendly - countries which were our allies - but which will be crushed if such an enormous general duty as 120s. per ton is imposed. After having fought side by side with France and Belgium against Germany, are we now to prohibit a rod of French or Belgian iron from being brought into Australia? Germany is not going to be the great exporter of iron that she was before the war. </para>

                        <para>- Of necessity, she must do so. She is bound to become a .great iron-producing country, because of the enormous deposits of iron and coal which she has acquired by postwar settlements in Alsace-Lorraine arid in the Saar- Valley. France was more dreadfully crippled by the great conflict than any other country, and I am positive that it is not the wish of the Australian people that she should be discouraged and prevented, indeed, so far as Australian trade is .concerned, from <inline font-style="italic">re-</inline> instating her industries. As for the cheap foreign production referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> that comment has not the application which some honorable senators may believe -to be the case. In the June files of the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> I noted that French foundry iron, which is the basic material for the making of rods. and the like, was actually quoted at a higher figure than the British market price. It was &#163;7 per ton. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> one can say that such a quotation for raw foundry iron is low. It is, in fact, &#39; extraordinarily high. A country which&#39; is quoting its raw product at such a figure cannot be said to threaten the Australian market with cheap material. The proposal to make the general duty 120s. is utterlyabsurd. </para>

                    LARGIE . Middlesborough, which is the greatest iron producing centre in the United Kingdom, quotes it at &#163;6 15s. per ton, and the American quotation was$26.50 for foundry iron. I do not know whether the figures were correct, but the&#39; rate seems unusually high considering that the exchange is not operating against us. French iron was quoted at &#163;7 per ton, and the Middlesborough product at &#163;6 15s. per ton, which proves that these countries are not producing at very low rates.

A similar proposal was submitted to the House of Representatives, where the impression existed that we were endeavouring to impose duties with the object of meeting the exchange difficulties. Although we have to keep that matter continually before us, a distinct measure will be brought before Parliament for overcoming, as far as possible, the position which at present exists, and which, as I mentioned yesterday, was of more importance than the Tariff itself.

                        <para>- Yes; but I am not committing myself to the exact form. Conditions may not be normal for a year or two, and in the meantime we shall have to legislate accordingly, and, incidentally, to keep in view the difference in exchange. I am glad to be able to report that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company has now succeeded in producing more of these articles than we previously consumed. In 1913, a record year, we imported 2,633,847 cwt., and for the following years the figures were - 1914-15, 1,667,000 cwt.; 1915-16/1,728,000 cwt.; 1916-17, 1,329,000 cwt.; 1917-18, 293,000 cwt. ; 1918-19, 276,000 cwt. ; and 1919-20, 367,000 cwt. The production for Australia in 1920 was 2,264,666 cwt., as compared with 2,633,847 cwt. imported in 1913. Australia is to be congratulated on her production, which shows that the industry is now firmly established, and is able to meet the local demand. As I mentioned last night, the duties imposed on pig iron regulate to a large extent those which are to be levied on iron in manufactured form. In 1920 the Broken Hill Proprietary Company were charging &#163;17 10s. to &#163;21 for round and square iron, whilst the United Kingdom&#39;s price on 1st May, 1920, was &#163;26 f.o.b., and the United States of America&#39;s price on 2nd March, 1920, was &#163;21 13s. f . o.b. </para>

                            and I. agree upon many questions. I believe with him that given a reasonable opportunity, and freedom from unfair or unnatural competition, Australia can produce iron and steel with any. other country in the world, and certainly our workers are well able to do their part. The price of angle iron in Australia was from &#163;19 to &#163;20 per ton, and in the United Kingdom &#163;29. For tees the prices were respectively &#163;23 and &#163;29. per ton.. Conditions have changed in recent times, , and the alterations in the matter of exchange have revolutionized the position. That can be dealt with only by another measure. The object of the Tariff proposals is to, tide us over the transition to normal times. As a consequence of the. changing conditions, it may be found necessary to review the Tariff more often than has been the case in the past.

                        <para>- We. want to prevent dumping, which may be attempted by reason of the difference in rates of exchange. Taking the duties: on pig-iron as a basis, the proposed duties on bars, rods, and tees exceed the duties on pig iron by about 100 per cent. There is a sufficient reason for this. In August, 1914, American prices for basic pig-iron and steel bars at factory were respectively $13 and $26.43 - a difference of over 100 per cent: In January, 1919, the respective values were $30 for pig-iron and $60.48 for steel bars, representing again a difference of over 100 per cent. In March, 1920, the respective values at factory were $41.50 and $78.40, a difference of approximately 90 per cent. Honorable senators will see that&#39; the duties proposed in the schedule are regulated by the difference in price in the world&#39;s market between pig-iron and&#39; iron in more advanced, stages of manufacture. The difference in duties represents a fair adjustment in view of the difference in value of the articles covered by the two sub-items. The increased duties on this sub-item represent a reward for the extra labour put into the more advanced manufacture.Onthe1stMay,1920, British small steel bars were quoted at &#163;26 per ton, and on this value, with the addition of the statutory 10 per cent. the rate of duty proposed, 44s. per ton, is equal to 8 per cent. Estimating that the price will fall by 50 per cent. within the next two or three years - which I regard as somewhat optimistic - the. proposed rate would be equal to only 16 per cent On the 2nd March, 1920, the American f . o.b. quotation for merchant&#39; steel bars was $84.44, equalling &#163;21 13s. at the rate of exchange on 17th June, 1920. On this price, after the addition of the statutory 10 per cent., the rate of duty proposed - 80s. - is equal to17 per cent. Honorable senators will see, therefore, that these duties are not very high. </para>

                        <para>- They are based on the work involved in each stage of manufacture. I ask the Senate not to attempt to meet the difference in exchange by any adjustment of these duties, because we purpose dealing with that matter as effectively as we can in another measure. We have not yet got back to normal conditions of industry, and we must make some provision for the transition stage. When normal conditions have been reached, it may. be found necessary to review many of these duties. </para>

                    <para>. - The request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> opens up a very wide range for discussion, because it requires to be looked at from many points of view. The honorable senator proposes an increase in the duty on this sub-item in the general Tariff from 80s. to 120s. per ton. I wish to deal with the question from an Australian point of view. We must first of all recognise the necessity of imposing duties adequate to the industrial requirements of the Commonwealth. I take it that in framing this Tariff that was kept in mind. After the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> and his officers had conferred with those able to express opinions worth having on the subject, they eventually arrived at conclusions as to the duties which would meet the industrial needs of Australia. To-day we are asked to especially impose an exceptionally heavy burden on two countries for which in the past we have professed the greatest esteem. Time after time, when necessity arose, we have come to the assistance of those countries by giving what we could of our means to help them tide over the terrible ordeals through which they were called upon to pass. </para>

In dealing with these Tariff items we ought to allow a certain amount of sentiment to play its part. We cannot hope to progress if we adopt a policy of isolation, because, for very many  years,  we shall be dependent on other countries for many commodities necessary for the proper development of the Commonwealth. </para>

On this item we have a duty, in the general Tariff, of &#163;4 per ton, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan&#39;s</inline> request is for an increase of 50 per cent. The honorable senator now says that France and Belgium may enjoy the benefit of the intermediate Tariff, and, consequently, they need not be affected by his request. But what does the Bill say about the matter? It provides that the application of the intermediate Tariff shall be by means of a proclamation, which shall not be issued until the Minister has referred to the Tariff Board the question whether, having regard to the probable reciprocal benefits, it is desirable in the interests of the Commonwealth to issue the proclamation. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it would ; and&#39; it is possible that Belgium, owing to her peculiar position, without any intention of being unfriendly, would not be able to satisfy the Tariff Board that the reciprocity offered was adequate. Therefore, the principle would not be applied. We should not seek to place France or Belgium in the same position as Germany. 1 remember the sacrifices Belgium made during the war on behalf of the Allies, and I remember that when an appeal was made on her behalf no country responded more liberally than did Australia. I hope we shall never forget what we owe to Belgium. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, it is a matter of sentiment; but surely a difference of practically 100 per cent, between the British and the general Tariff ought to be a sufficient margin to insure British supremacy in the Australian trade for all time. The margin is ample, in my opinion, and, for that reason, I feel compelled to oppose the amendment. </para>

The honorable senator has no hope of carrying such , a request, but his object is to induce those honorable senators who may be wavering between two opinions to come to a conclusion that it is just as well not to seek a reduction, but to pass the sub-item as it stands. This is not the first occasion on which such tactics have been adopted. Some of us think that it is not the duty of the Committee to say, meekly, &#34;We concur in everything that is. put before us by the Government.&#34; We believe that the Senate is entitled to express an independent opinion with regard to the Tariff just as the House of Representatives has done, but up to date we have not had sufficient back-bone to express it. </para>

                        <para>- But not the majority. Up to date, the decisions of the Committee on the Tariff items have been but a blocked reflex of the opinion of the House of Representatives. The Government has taken its cue from another place&#39;, and having labelled as &#34; Government policy &#34; the decisions of that House, it asks us to swallow them. I realize that the Committee is somewhat embarrassed by the fact that it agreed last night to exorbitant duties on pig iron. This division may be compared, for  argumentative purposes, to a palatial edifice, erected upon substantial foundations. Sub-item  a,  relating to pig iron, represents the &#39;f foundations, and on those foundations we are piling story after story. In the opinion of its designers this is a beautifully worked-out division. It is a kind of mosaic, and one cannot put a&#62; needle-point into any joint of it without disturbing the relation of the parts and disarranging the whole scheme. That has been the plea advanced on behalf of the Government, sp that the move made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> to secure an increased duty under paragraph c must have that effect if he succeeds, in spite of his effort to be serious.  11008 <inline font-style="italic">Customs Tariff</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Bill.</inline></para>

                <para>The duty of 20s. per ton on pig iron under the British preferential Tariff is the foundation upon which we build a many-storied Tariff building, with 15-ft. ceilings, in the shape of the duties on blooms and ingots. Then the Government come along with successive stories of 15 feet, in the shape of duties of 44s., 65s., and 80s. per ton under subitems. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> now wants to add another 10 feet to one story by requesting the House of Representatives to increase the duty under paragraph c. My proposal yesterday was that we should . so lay the foundations of this division that we should not need to curtail or enlarge the structure proposed to be raised upon it. My desire was that we should so lay the foundations of the division that our decisions with respect to the remaining items would be in keeping with them. That, however, was not done. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> seems to think that those who are opposed to the item as it stands cannot read or write. The Government also appear to hold the view that those who oppose it are incapable of passing an intelligent vote on the Tariff. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has asked us to agree to his request so as to bring the duties under sub -item c into line with those operating under the Tariff of the &#34;United States of America. Has he read that Tariff? </para>

                        <para>- I knew that the honorable senator would fall back upon that argument. When he, and those who think with him, are driven from one strong-post they retreat to another. They are always in the rear. They are pelted from every post they take up. The trouble is that the arguments are all on our side and the majority of the votes on the other. The Canadian iron duties were never so high as those contemplated in this division. We cannot afford to ignore the wonderful progress and advancement made by Canada, which has set us an example that we might worthily emulate. The Canadian duty upon steel and iron bars, rods, and so on is 12s. 4d. per ton, as against the proposal of the Government in this case for a duty of 80s. per ton under the general Tariff. Canada built up her iron industry under a low Tariff. I am not advocating a low Tariff. I am prepared to give adequate protection to any industry really in need of help. But when the Tariff wall is sufficiently high to afford ample protection I am not prepared to add an extra brick to it. When that is done the practice of local manufacturers is to make their prices just a shade below those commanded by the inflowing commodities. We are asked to add an extra brick to the Tariff wall in this case, without regard to the interests of the people throughout the Commonwealth, who have to buy, in their multifarious forms, the materials covered by the sub-item. This Tariff, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has said, is designed to aim a blow at rural, as compared with urban, production. I say, advisedly, that in its present form it is a finger post to rural stagnation. The reports of the Inter-State Commission arc never mentioned by the Government or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> unless they suit their purpose, but whenever they lend themselves, even colorably, to the policy of the Government, they are put before us by them in a lavish manner. In a report issued in 1916 the Inter-State Commission stated that - </para>

                <para class="block">Of course it would. He did not ask for the duty, but he said that if such a duty were passed it would be of great assistance to his company. Men will naturally take these high duties if they are flung a t them. If I were offered such monumental advantages I should feel that nothing remained  for mo to do but to accept them, and. I do not blame the manager of the Lion Boiling Mills for his attitude. According to the Inter-State Commission, Messrs. C. and G. Hoskins Limited &#34;were the only applicants for a Protective duty. What is wrong with their concern? I do not want to pass an opinion upon it, because I .am not acquainted with its operations, but I am entitled to ask in what respect it differs from those of other firms carrying on the same industry,, seeing that no one else in the same field has asked for an &#39;additional duty except them. In such circumstances. I am entitled to conclude either that Messrs. Hoskins Limited are asking for excessive protection, or that they have not brought their works up to date - for which the consumers have no right to pay - either one or the other. Fair play is bonny play the world over, and when I see that men engaged in this industry side by side with Hoskins Limited do not raise their voices in the demand this firm has made, I must conclude that something is wrong about its position. </para>
                <para>What protection have the primary producers ? Nothing. They take their products into the markets of the world, jostle there with producers of every shade and colour of the human species, and beat them to earth, winning through simply by the exercise of their own native energies. They do not come to this chamber and ask for anything they do not want. There are 200,000 of them producing wheat in Australia. Compare their number with the paltry 10,000 persons engaged in the iron industry. </para>
                <para>I respect <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Delprat</inline> for the attitude he has taken up. But, as a matter of fact, this Senate has gone out of its way  to tell him that he does not know his own business. I will not take that responsibility upon myself. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Delprat</inline> knows, his own business a million times better than does any member of this Senate. However, let us get down to brass tacks, tin tacks, or any other kind of tacks, and ask ourselves what is happening in this country. Those who are engaged in producing wealth from the auriferous mines of Australia, and particularly those who have jostled in the world&#39;s markets with so much success amongst&#39; outside competitors, ask no favour, but are ready to submit their products in competition with those of India, Argentine, or the Balkans. They are of the stuff of which the country is in need, and not of the stuff of. those who come to this Parliament whining for assistance which, when given, causes them afterwards to be the &#34; slackers &#34; of industry, and make no call upon those natural reservoirs of energy which alone will enable them so to establish their industry that they may stand four-square to the competition, of the world. . There are two sections in this country - one which cannot live unless it has protection, and another which, lives without asking for anything of the kind from this Parliament. Our big dailies deplore the manifest tendency, of the people to drift fr.om country districts to the city. What is the cause of this? If anything is directly responsible for it it is this iniquitous Tariff. I want to hold &#39;the scales fairly. My action in respect to this schedule is not to be interpreted as meaning that I am against the people who are engaged in the particular industry sought to be protected by the duties attached to this sub-item. I am anxious to put a handicap upon foreign competition, but only so as to make the race even at the end with perhaps a slight shade of advantage to our own men. But where are honorable senators when I ask for this? Every time they are to be found voting blindly with, the Government without rhyme or reason for what they are doing, I have taken the trouble to find out the relative position of the population of the cities and rural areas&#39; in other parts of the world, particularly in Canada and the United States of America, which countries are comparable to ours. </para>

                        <para>- A certain standing order provides that an honorable senator is . not permitted to speak in Committee on the Tariff for more than fifteen minutes at one time, and another senator cannot rise and. practically defeat the object of the order by saying that &#39; he wishes the senator who has preceded him to continue his remarks. He must address himself to the subject-matter under discussion by the Committee for an appreciable period of time. Otherwise it would appear to me that I would be allowing the standing order which governs our procedure to be contravened. </para>

This Tariff does not attempt to encourage the primary producers or in any way protect the consumer. Its sole purpose, it seems to me, is to encourage spoon-fed, hothouse reared manufacturers, and turn millionaires into multi-millionaires. It is a magnificent Tariff for that purpose, and I should think it was drawn up by the Chamber of Manufactures. However, I am not prepared to present my facts and figures to the Senate at this juncture. </para>

He makes tilings for any one who chooses to buy them, but he always fixes his price about the width of a sheet of paper below the height of the brick wall of protection built up for him. I intend to point out what is happening in other countries in the matter of distribution of population. It is recognised by public men that it is not in the interests of the Commonwealth that the population should congregate in the cities. That has a bad effect from every point of view, economically and politically. In the United &#39;States of America, the four leading cities are New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and St., Louis, and combined they have in the House of Representatives thirty-nine members. In Canada, the four leading cities are Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg, and Vancouver, which combined have a representation in the House of Commons of thirty-four members. </para>

                <para>SenatorLYNCH. - On the item of steel, they are practically Free, Trade countries. However, in Australia, the four leading cities have a representation of twenty-eight members in the House of Representatives. This shows that, while in the United States of America the four leading cities command one-seventh of the political power, and in Canada one-eleventh, in Australia the four leading  cities command one-third. In this respect, Australia is the shocking example of the world; and yet we have members of the Government outwardly and professedly approving a Tariff which inwardly they condemn and deride. </para>

                        <para>- But this Tariff is intensifying the tendency; and I wish to call a halt. If we take only the two cities of Sydney and Melbourne, we find- them exercising political influence that is bad and baneful for the future prosperity of the country. Let that fact be borne in mind, for some day the people of the Commonwealth will rise in revolt against such conditions. As I have- said, the figures quoted show that Australia is the one example of the world as regards the unequal distribution of population; and the policy of excessive Protection is calculated, not to arrest, but rather to aggravate the evil. If this were a country of old and impoverished lands,&#34; such as Belgium or Holland, I could, perhaps, understand the position; but, as a continental country of vast resources, we ought to so regulate our political management as to give the whole of the Commonwealth a chance, instead of confining our attention to the mere coastal fringe. Of course, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and other newspapers, deplore this drift to the cities, and yet I suppose they would not have a friendly word in support of what I am now saying. </para>

                        <para>- I dispute that entirely. The proposals for increased duties are only the result of an effort to introduce a Protectionist Tariff, based on the most vapoury and shadowy foundations, the effect of which must be to bring our primary industries to a standstill, or cause their decay. The 200,000 wheatgrowers of Australia are entitled to some consideration; but, so far from&#39; their getting any, they are faced with high duties on pig iron, blooms, ingots, bar iron, and so on to harvesters. All these duties are calculated to increase the cost of the tools of trade, and of the necessary commodities for opening&#39; up the interior of this country; there is a concatenation of Tariff proposals all depending on each other, and combining to add to the cost of the harvester and other implements required by the man on the soil. If this goes on, it means that in the long run the primary producers will have&#39; to come into the city and find a job in the ironworks. If they cannot live in the country they must drift to the cities, perhaps to starve there. The Tariff is imposing, for the protection of Australian manufacturers, duties far beyond those of Canada, under the pretence that we are in danger of being inundated by importations from other countries, although, as a matter of fact, we are exporting to other countries, and the returns show that the &#39;balance of trade is in our favour. Honorable senators who have always an ear open to the appeals of the manufacturers, no matter how flimsy their pretext, show no inclination to listen, to the protests of those in. the back-country, who could not, if they wished to do. so,, and would not, if they could, waylay Min.insters and members to ask for exorbitant imposts for their own benefit. A false step ha3 been taken in this matter, and we shall have; to pay. for. it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan&#39;s</inline> proposal is an ingenious device, like that presented during the discussion of the sugar duties, the intention, of which is to get the Committee to vote for a middle course, and. thus to maintain the Government&#39;s proposals. I intend to propose a reduction, although I have not the least hope of carrying it. I stood for Protection at a time when many of the representatives, of this Chamber were against me, and the result was to throw hundreds of thousands of pounds into the coffers of the manufacturers of the eastern States. What did my State gain thereby? Nothing. But I stood for the policy that was calculated to advance the interests of the Commonwealth on rational lines. Now, without abandoning my earlier Protectionist principles, I ask for consideration of the, interests of a State whose area is that of one-third of the Commonwealth. These have hitherto counted for nothing in this Chamber. The appeals I have received from persons in urban centres, asking for higher duties, would fill a horse-stall; but to the credit of Western Australia be it said, that although it has some young industries, no appeal has co&#39;me from the people of that State. That shows their independence. They are prepared to stand alone, instead of whimpering, cap in hand, for duties that are not required. Some honorable senators are saying to the iron-masters, &#34;You do not know your business when you do not ask for higher duties, but we intend to give you them.&#34; Of course, under1 those circumstances, the duties are accepted. I intend to move for a duty of 34s. per ton, which will be an advance on the Inter-State Commission&#39;s recommendations. </para>

                    (Western the eloquent appeal of the able gentleman who is my colleague in the representation of Western Australia. He is right in saying that the people of that State have not asked for high duties, such as the manufacturers of Victoria and New South Wales are constantly demanding. We find, their representatives in the galleries, and standing about the lobbies, imploring assistance in a way that the people of Western Australia could not imitate even if they wished, to do so.

                        <para>- I have no intention of discussing now the items that we have not yet reached, but in considering the item before us, we must remember items that follow, and the manner in which the secondary industries for which the industry to which we are now devoting attention provides raw material may be affected by our present decisions. Appeal after appeal has been made to me from a firm doing business in New South Wales, which says that, because of the high duties imposed on its raw material, it may not be able to continue the manufacture of galvanized iron. That is a strong reason for reducing the duties under consideration, and for reducing other duties contained in the item; because it is desirable that the secondary industries, the taxation of whose raw material we are now considering should be able to make a profit without placing undue burdens on the men on the land who use their productions, such as galvanized iron arid agricultural machinery. You cannot consider this item without regard to its connexion with subsequent items. I resent strongly the assertion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> that I have taken advantage of private conversations with senators. I have not made reference to any such conversations. </para>

                        <para>- It was obvious. A New South Wales firm is whining for more protection, and, therefore, the representatives of the State, following their usual practice, will demand more protection. That would be plain to the veriest fool. Probably the firm in question is justified in asking for more protection for its industry, if the absurd duties proposed in the schedule are to be adopted. The Committee must consider whether it will pass the item in its present form, or reduce the rates, and it must have regard to subsequent items. </para>

If the Senate is a reflex of the opinion of the people, as it must be presumed to be, Australia has gone protection mad, and must pay dearly for it in the future. Of course, the voting power of the Commonwealth is concentrated in the cities, whose voice is more easily heard, and more quickly influences honorable senators than the voice of the country.

                        <para>- I will not argue concerning whether or not Germany was first, but during the past ten years the volume of iron produced in the United States of America has been greater than the production of any other country, and the progress of the industry&#39;s development has been extremely rapid. Forty or fifty years ago, the output of iron and iron products in the United States of America was negligible. In 1874 very heavy import duties were imposed, for the first time, upon iron. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but our distance from the world&#39;s markets, and our geographical position in relation to the Pacific, make it much more urgently Accessory for Australia to be self-contained with respect to iron production than is the case with any other country. With respect to the duties decided upon by the United States Congress, in order to build up an industry which to-day is of vaster dimensions than that of any other nation, the rates imposed in 1890 upon iron of a value of from 3 to 4 cents. per lb., amounted to &#163;7 9s. 4d. per ton. There was, in addition, a super duty of 1 cent per lb. - another &#163;4 per ton. The Tariff imposed in 1909 on the same item was a reduction upon that of 1890. Still, however, the duty was equivalent to &#163;5 2s. 8d. per ton. As the industry developed and became more self-supporting,  Congress, in its wisdom, began to reduce the duties; until, to-day, America is an exporter against the whole world, and the imposition of duties would not help her for the reason that her iron industry requires no measure of fiscal encouragement. </para>

                        <para>- I have just pointed out that, as an outcome of the imposition of duties, the industry has grown so strong that no such form of encouragement is required to-day. With the materials which Nature has given to Australia, the iron industry can be developed in this land, and it may so expand within a decade or so that Australia should become, comparatively, as strong in relation to her iron industry as the United States of America. Of course, with a population of 6,000,000, the industry cannot be expected to grow so rapidly or to the dimensions existing in a country which has a population of more than 100,000,000. Something has been said with respect to the drift to cities. Such a thing is regrettable, but it is going on all over the world. </para>

                        <para>- I am not at all sure that this Tariff will do so. The development which is taking place in regard to Australia&#39;s woollen industry is in the country and is spreading over the Continent. The iron industry is responsible for the formation of expanding centres outside of the big cities. There are numbers of other industries which will tend to decentralize the population as an outcome of the encouragement afforded by this Protective Tariff. All these factors will almost entirely counteract any drift to the cities which is now occurring owing to circumstances over which the Commonwealth Parliament has no control. I have certain fixed principles. One of them may be stated thus : I shall do everything in my power that will safeguard and develop the secondary industries of Australia. It is just as important to get a ton of iron out of Mother Earth as it is <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> grow a ton of wheat or wool upon Mother Earth. </para>

                        <para>- If such a duty could be, it would be imposed. But what  this Committee is now discussing is really the question of producing further wealth from the soil, and the undoubted fact is that the more we can produce the more independent shall we become, and the better will it be for Australia. In the course of dealing with items yet to be reached, I propose to set down in terms of pounds, shillings, and pence what the Tariff will mean to the farmer. And, if Parliament is found to be imposing undue burdens upon producers, I shall be agreeable to try to devise some means by which such imposition - it may be called an extra tax - can be reduced. </para>

                        <para>- My votes shall be cast in the direction of giving fair play to the farmer. No country was ever1 great unless, besides its primary activities, lt possessed practically self-supporting secondary industries. No country ever became great by way of agriculture solely. While primary production amounts to the greater part of the total production of Australia, this Committee . will not be justified in &#34; hitting up&#34; every secondary industry, which also produces wealth from our own soil. </para>

                    <para>. -  Some important facts are being overlooked. Honorable senators declare that it is their desire to do that which is just; but, directly an industry begins to draw about it a group of individuals, a charge is laid that an unhealthy concentration of the population is, being encouraged, and the industry responsible is branded, as not being of a primary character. The production of iron is as much a primary industry as the production of apples, or wheat, or wool. It is the raw material upon which other industries depend, just as wheat is the raw material on which the miller and the baker must rely. </para>

                        <para>- What is primary in one man&#39;s view is a finished product in the case of another. When coal mining was begun at Newcastle, the countryside was barren; few people lived in the neighbourhood. To-day, however, Newcastle is a city. When gold was discovered at Ballarat, there was no city of Ballarat. The population followed, and grouped around the industry. The effect of the inauguration of the iron industry has been to open up mining activities in Tasmania and South Australia; and if Western Australia should develop similar deposits of iron ore, and should there be coal discovered in that State, Western Australia would undoubtedly become a rival of the eastern States. </para>

                        <para>- No; because in 1916, even if the prices had been exceptionally low, foreign manufacturers could not enter into competition with Australian manufacturers owing to the scarcity of freights. I have carefully considered the figures relating to our output, and as our production is within 300,000 tons of our consumption I do not think we are justified in increasing  11016 <inline font-style="italic">Customs.Tariff</inline> &#91;SENATE..&#93;. Bill. the duty. On the other hand, if we reduce the protection already provided we shall be placing foreign manufacturers in a position to dump. The Tariff will not prevent dumping to the extent that the proposed Anti-Dumping Bill will. America can land iron here cheaper than we can produce it, and in the absence of adequate protection to our&#39; own iron industry we would be largely at the mercy of the producers in Japan and in America. I cannot support the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> because. I do not believe increased duties are necessary, and I have yet to be convinced that it would be wise to reduce the proposed rate.. Reference has been made to the disabilities; experienced by primary producers in consequence of the duties imposed to protect local industries; but it must be remembered that owing to the improved methods of cultivating and harvesting the costs incurred by the primary producer are much less than they were some years ago. In addition to the advantages derived from the use of modern implements the primary producers have also benefited: by improved carrying and marketing facilities. Farmers have now gone further afield, and we have to seriously consider at this juncture whether, in imposing duties, we are to follow those who are developing country on the outer fringe. If such important undertakings as the iron industry are squeezed out of existence,&#34; others will follow, and we shall then be depending upon the products of foreigners, which, in effect, is the policy of Free Traders. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, and the Minister has given a promise of the early passing of the Anti-Dumping Bill, which I consider will go a great deal further in the -protection of the Australian industries than, perhaps, any duties we might impose. Some honorable senators may consider that the duty for which I ask is rather high, but if, in the opinion of Parliament, (conditions in the industry throughout the world change so much in the next twelve months that the continued imposition of so high a duty would be unfair, the matter can be referred to the Tariff Board, and upon its recon amend at ion Parliament could take action, if that were found desirable, to reduce the duty. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that he did. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> emphasized very strongly the fact that our people are drifting into the large cities to a very great extent. That is undeniable, but I. should like to remind the honorable senator that so far as agriculture in Australia is concerned it is confined to a more or less limited fringe along , our coast. In Canada the conditions are otherwise. Because of the fall of snow and the climatic conditions generally, interior districts of Canada have the benefit of a sufficient rainfall throughout the year. That cannot be said of Australia. One reason why I am in favour of a Tariff to build up our secondary industries is that they may serve to attract population to this. country, and until. we have a much larger population than we have now we cannot expect that Australia will be developed as it should be. </para>

                        <para>- As one who knows something of the interior of Australia, I regard its settlement and development as one of the most gigantic problems with which we have to deal. Until we have a very much larger population than we have at present we shall not be in a position to undertake the work of water conservation and irrigation in the interior of Australia, which must be carried out before it can be closely settled.&#39; Until we have done so we can only expect that it will be occupied in huge areas for the depasturing of stock. I am not anxious that wealthy industrial Combines, should be established here. I do not regard the production of wealth as the most important thing. In my opinion the greater the variety of industries we have the better it will be for our people. </para>

                        <para>- I do not object to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> defence of the primary producers; but if all our people were primary producers it would not be good for the country. We must have secondary industries to supply the tools pf trade required by our primary producers, and it is better for them that we should have a large population to consume their products. Many of the secondary industries which have been built up by Protection have been of very great benefit to our primary producers. It is true that Protection may hamper more or less some branches of primary production, but we have to consider the interests of Australia as a whole. We must offer inducements to a greater population to come here, and the primary producers must bear their share of our burdens. A good, deal has been said about consideration for our Allies and about preference to Great Britain. I take second place to no one in Australia in my anxiety to preserve the connexion between ourselves and the Old Country, but our first duty is to Australia. We have no right to do anything which would injure Australia in order to benefit the Old Country or our Allies. &#39; The first duty of every father is to look after his family, and this nation should look after its own industries before it talks of being generous to other people. I would not go out of my way to injure the Old Country; but the first consideration with me is the protection of Australian industries in the interests of the young people who are growing up amongst us, and in order to attract a larger population to our shores. I have said that the most gigantic problem with which we have to deal is the settlement of people on the millions of acres of comparatively unoccupied territory in Australia inside the coastal fringe. The introduction of population and the reduction of our debt will enable us to enter upon schemes for the development of the interior of this great continent. Some honorable senators have been pessimistic about the effect of the imposition of Customs duties; but I have heard their jeremiads so often that I do not now take much notice of them. </para>

                        <para>- Then the honorable senator&#39;s reference was to comparatively recent times. I am going back to the period when the position of the United States of America approximated rather remotely to the circumstances of our own time, as regards population and development. This attempt to fasten high protective duties upon a community that is not commercially or industrially highly developed is much like putting a suit of clothes designed for a fully-developed man upon a schoolboy. America, when she imposed these protective duties, was much ahead of the position in which Australia finds herself to-day. In 1850, only four years after the passage of the Tariff Act to which I refer, she had a population of 23,000,000 people, whilst we have little more than 5,000,000; and yet the wisdom of the time, in a country very near to the manufacturing centres :of the world as compared with Australia, suggested a 30 per cent, duty in die case of iron manufactures, and 25 per cent, in the case of &#39;cotton goods. </para>

                        <para>- No. I am merely considering the natural effect of a protective policy, and pointing to the experience in America. Let us consider the process of development of all our flourishing towns. Let us take the history of Toowoomba, Ballarat, Bathurst, Lismore, or almost of any other town. The country exists before the towns. I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> to remember this elementary fact, because he seems to be under the impression that towns come first and must be catered for accordingly. As settlement in country districts proceeds, the first step in the establishment of a town is the appearance of a blacksmith&#39;s shop, to which, afterwards, is added the business of a wheelwright. Then we may find an engineering shop, and as business grows, many branches of that technical trade may be added to meet the increasing requirements of the district. This is the history of all towns. They grow in proportion as the district for which they cater develops. It would be just as foolish to plant, in a town like Toowoomba, in Queensland, a high-class engineering and manufacturing establishment from Birmingham as to apply this Tariff to the needs of Australia until we have developed to a greater extent industrially and economically. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator, I notice, is always lolling about in his seat in this chamber. He now says, &#34; Put it.&#34; I am not prepared to do that. I speak on behalf of people who represent two-thirds of this continent, and I say that up to date their interests have &#39;not been fully considered in this Tariff. If anything is calculated to&#39; arouse my resentment. it is the consideration given to this Tariff schedule. I come here to exercise my independent opinion, and I am not prepared, by my rote, to do anything towards shovelling into <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> coffers of any great industrial enterprise millions of pounds at the expense of our primary producers. The maws &#169;f these .great industrial enterprises are ever ready to get something from the producing interests of this country. They remind me of ia huge, insatiable vacuum pump, &#39;everything movable or  mortgagable  in the Commonwealth being drawn into its insatiable vortex, and, feeble though my voice may fee, I intend to do what I can on behalf of the people who are carrying out the development of this continent. There are two sets of people in this country - the one set that goes out and does things ; that does not seek any advantage from Parliament, or expect any of the largesse that is being ladled out; that stands erect and prefers not to lean on the Government for protective patronage of any kind. This is the class that has made Australia what it is to-day. The other class is . represented by certain manufacturers - and the host of <inline font-style="italic">claqueurs</inline> surrounding them. We are almost told that no industrial enterprise will grow in Queensland unless a big lump of protection is planted at its root. These people have been too long sheltered by a Protective Tariff. But we do not require any such assistance in Western Australia. Our manufacturers there, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> will testify, are .not to be found on the door-mat of this Parliament, pleading that without protection they cannot grow. The United States of America, with four times the present population of Australia, were satisfied with a 30 per cent, duty on the manufactures of iron ; and under this stimulus the business of manufacturing steel rails increased from 24,000 tons in 1S49 to 184,000 tons in 1856; while under a protection of 25 per cent., the number of cotton spindles employed in the United States of America rose from 3,000,000 in 1840 to over 5,000,000 in 1S60. I recognise the hopelessness of submitting any proposition having for its object the lightening of the burdens of the men engaged in metalliferous mining and other forms of primary production. Throughout the Tariff debate they have received the least consideration. Their voice is inarticulate. The only voice that echoes and re-echoes through this chamber is that raised on behalf of the manufacturer and that section of the primary producers who say that they cannot grow anything without the stimulus of Protective duties. This Tariff will put a. heavier burden on the backs of those who are- already bending under the load they are carrying. It will strain to the utmost the muscles of\ those who do not ask for Tariff assistance, while it will make flaccid and flabby the muscles of the men inside the Tariff barrier. I do not want to see that sort of thing. My desire is that the race shall be maintained with some semblance of sport. This is not sport. The Government are imposing a handicap on. the whole community,, so that those sheltered behind the Tariff wall may gaze at their shelter and say, &#34; We will go slow, there is. no need to extend ourselves like the people outside.&#34; The primary producers, who enjoy no protection,, but are exposed to the unfriendly blasts that blow from, every quarter on, the markets of the world, will have to pay for this assistance. They are the men for whom I am speaking. We have before us a proposal to increase, by more- than 100 per cent, the duty of 40 per cent, recommended by the InterState Commission. We are told that since that recommendation was made wages and manufacturing costs have- increased; but, since they are- rising, to. a correspoaiding, . if not to. a greater, extent in the competing countries, that argument falls to the ground. The Government set off with a duty of&#39; 20s. per ton on pig iron under the- British- preferential Tariff; and, if we follow the steel and iron produced from that pig. iron until it is put into the harvester or. the battery - and gold mining is fast becoming only a memory in Australia - we shall find that, having regard to. the duties imposed on the various commodities employed in the manufacture of those machines, the users of them will have to pay upon them a tax of over 100 per cent. These increased duties are passed on. to the primary producers, because the- manufacturers working inside the Tariff barrier raise their prices to the very edge of the protecting- wall. I intend to move a request that the duty be reduced, but that it shall still be above the rate recommended by the Inter-State Commission. I shall submit such a request for the reason, that the- various stages in iron production,, from the crude ingots, slabs,, and blooms- to the bar iron and angle iron, can be carried out in the same works  iti  which those ingots and slabs are.  pro  duced, so that we may reasonably reduce, the duty in this case. We should hesitate to take another false -step, immediately following- that taken by us in,  rC  gard to the duties on  pig  iron, and when the proper time comes I shall move, a request on the lines I have indicated. </para>

I agree with that view, but would add that it. will have also to be- paid by- the wage earners and salaried men of the community. Public servants who, having regard to the increased, cost oi living-,, are, perhaps, the most underpaid section of the community, will be . among those who will have the privilege of paying more if this duty is increased. </para>

                        <para>- There may be a slight fall in the price of a few commodities, but no one. will contend that the cost of living has returned to the level of pre-war days. Public servants, the coal and metalliferous miners,, primary producers on the land, and wage-earners employed in industries that cannot be protected, will have- to pay this increased duty. That being so, I, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> raise my feeble voice in protest. The Government have brought down what they describe as a scientific Tariff, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> thinks he can improve  upon it by securing increased duties in respect of this sub-item. He hopes, by protecting a very small section of the community, to make the position better for the rest of the people. According to the figures produced by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> the iron industry in New South Wales is practically producing all the iron required in the Commonwealth. That being so, it cannot be said that these duties are designed to induce others to enter into the industry. There is no room for any one to set up in the industry in competition with those already engaged in it. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company have from &#163;2,000,000 to &#163;4,000,000 invested in the industry, and Messrs. Hoskins Brothers Limited may also have a capital of &#163;1,000,000 or &#163;2,000,000 invested in it, so that these increased duties are designed, not to induce others to come into competition with those two companies, but really to enable those companies to charge an increased price for their products. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has produced balance-sheets showing the enormous profits which have been made year after year by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company&#39;s steel works.&#39; That a new industry should pay well from its very inception is quite an extraordinary experience. The profits made by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company&#39;s steel works are altogether beyond what the promoters of the industry imagined they would be. Free Trade England will be our chief competitor in the iron trade. For over seventy-five years England has been easily first, and is still first, in the manufacturing industries of the world. She has achieved that success without taxing the rest of the community, despite the fact that she has to obtain iron ore from Spain and elsewhere, and that the price of coal there is higher than it is in Australia. It is said that the increased price of coal in the Old Country is due to the reduced production of the coal miners. The real explanation may be that the coal mines there have been worked, in some cases, for centuries, so that the coal is obtained, perhaps, at greater depths than here, and that the machinery used is not so up-to-date as that employed in coal mining in America and Australia. The fact that the tonnage of coal produced per coal miner in Australia is double that produced in Great Britain is, no doubt, due to our coal seams being wider, as well as to the energy of our workmen and to the up-to-date machinery employed by us. </para>

                        <para>- I acknowledged that in my reference to the larger seams. With all these advantages, added to the fact that there is no room for others to enter into the industry here, since those already engaged in it are producing all that we require, why should we go out of our way to increase the profits of the two companies ? This industry was established by them, before they had anything like the protection for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> asks. Honorable senators may inquire what is going to happen when we get back to normal times - when prices fall, and Belgian iron is obtainable here at &#163;7 or &#163;8 per ton? When that time comes, Protective duties will be of no avail to the local industry. If the iron-masters in other parts of the world can develop more intelligent methods of production - and, as I said last night, the chief factor in the economical production of iron is the use of up-to-date plant and machinery - a Protective Tariff will not help the industry in Australia. Rather than impose additional taxation in order to keep the industry going when it cannot legitimately compete in the open market, it would be better for us to install in these works the very latest machinery. I do not think those engaged in the industry are unable to do that for themselves, but it would be cheaper for the Government to put in such plants than, for the rest of the community to be called upon to pay additional taxation to keep the industry going. The larger the profits made in some of these industries, the greater is the demand for protection. If it is beyond the capacity of those engaged in the industry at present - and I do not think it is - to install in their works the latest and most scientific machinery, let the Commonwealth do that for them. That would be described as Government interference, and some honorable senators think that Government interference in production means disaster. </para>

                        <para>- I can tell the honorable senator with a great deal of pleasure. When the war had been raging for two years, the  Government  were able to reduce the cost of each overcoat worn by our soldiers, in the case of mounted troops, from &#163;2 0s. 7d. to &#163;.1 13s., and, in the case of infantry, from &#163;1 12s. to &#163;1 10s., and these reductions were only made possible by reason of the fact that we -owned this Factory. Further than that, every garment made by private enterprise for our soldiers was first made in the Clothing Factory in order that we might ascertain what it would reasonably cost to make it. </para>

                        <para>- I am arguing that it is much better to use the people&#39;s money for the development of an industry by putting it directly into that industry, and I am using this Factory as an illustration of the huge success that has followed the adoption of the method I propose. If this Factory could make the profit I have mentioned in ten years, what could be done by Government enter prise in the manufacture of iron? The profit ought to be greater, because the return would come more from the use of machinery than from the employment of labour. My illustration may be long drawn out, but I contend that it is perfectly in order. At any rate, it serves to uphold my point, that before I would apply one shilling of the public money to any industry I would see that when the profit-making period arrived the public would get a return. On the other hand, when private enterprise gets into difficulties and cannot be carried on without assistance, the hat is taken around, and the people of the community at large are even compelled to put their money into it, but when the profit-making period comes the dividends earned are not taken around and distributed to the people, but go to the individuals who control the industry. </para>

                        <para>- I am asking your ruling; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> in accordance with my usual practice not to permit any irregularity to pass unchallenged. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> while asking questions as to his position, also stated that the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> and his own intended proposal represented the extremes of this question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> having made that statement, he, to my mind, had addressed himself to the Committee in such a way as to entitle me to challenge the ruling of the  Chairman.  I call your attention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> to the first part of&#39; the standing order which deals&#39; with proceedings in the House,&#39; and permits a; senator to speak for one hour, a period which may be extended by thirty minutes on motion to be put forthwith. The second portion of the standing order deals with proceedings in Committee, and provides that a senator shall not speak more than a quarter of an hour at one time on any one question. I did not speak for more than a quarter of an hour, at the expiration of which I was properly called upon to resume my seat. I did not rise to resume that quarter of an hour&#39;s speaking, but to commence another one, and I hold that it will be an interference with debate in Committee if the ruling of the  Chairman  is upheld. </para>

                        <para>- In my question to the Chair and the remarks thereon, I was referring especially to the fate of my proposed request. Previously I had addressed myself to the proposition on its merits, but when I spoke at the time referred to by the <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman (Senator Bakhap),</inline> I was referring particularly to my proposed request, which was of equal, if not more, importance than the question previously discussed. Whether or not my reference to the fate of my request is to be taken into account and described as speaking to the question, is for yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to decide, but, so far  as I am concerned, the information I was trying to elicit was quite as important as were my previous efforts in discussing the merits of the proposition. </para>

                        <para>- It appears to me that the new standing order was framed with a specific object. In the ordinary business of the House, a certain length of time is allowed to a senator to address himself to the question, and it will be observed that that time is much longer than that allowed in Committee. Evidently the framers of the standing order recognised that it would often occur that an honorable senator in Committee would not be able to express himself fully in a quarter of an hour, and provided that he might speak more than once - no limit being placed on the number of times a senator may speak. The object appears to me to have been to compel honorable senators to confine their remarks to a quarter of an hour, so that every senator might have  opportunity  to take part in the discussion. When an other senator had thus taken part in the discussion, the senator who had been unable to complete his speech within a quarter of an hour was intended to be allowed to continue. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> contention is admitted, to what position are we brought ? If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> were speaking in Committee, and his quarter of an hour had expired, and I rose simply to express a desire that the discussion might be adjourned, not being prepared to continue it, and my request was refused, would that give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> the right to continue for another quarter of an hour? </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that such a claim is opposed to common sense. I take it that something must intervene between the time when one honorable senator&#39;s time has expired - something in the nature of the continuance of the debate - before that -senator can be permitted to occupy the floor again. This seems to me to be the intention of the standing order. I have no desire to curtail any of the privileges of honorable senators, but at the same time we must regard the Standing Orders from a commonsense point of view, and endeavour to ascertain the intention of those who framed them. In my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> contention ought not to be sustained. </para>

                        <para>- I almost feel I ought to apologize to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and to the Senate, for taking part in this discussion. It seems to me that the discussion is for the purpose of assisting you to arrive at a decision, and I am afraid 1 am not able to render much assistance. T,o me, the point is not so simple as, apparently, it seems to those who have addressed themselves to it. Let me remind honorable senators that this is a standing order of which we have not had much experience, and that if, in the light of what has taken place here to-day, we were called upon to draft another with the same object, we should probably employ different verbiage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> himself admits, that when he addressed the Chair he did so not on the item itself, but on a matter of procedure. What that matter was is immaterial to the argument; the honorable senator did not speak to the item, and therefore, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> rose, he was resuming, so far as the discussion on the item is concerned, a continuous address. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> view were to be maintained, that any one speaking in between, however briefly, restores his right to speak again, it would be possible to destroy the continuity of an honorable senator&#39;s remarks by a mere interjection, or by one of those friendly or unfriendly altercations which occasionally take place even in this well-ordered Chamber. On the other hand, it is well known that no one may do indirectly that which he has not the right to do directly. Here we have direct prohibition against honorable senators speaking more than a quarter of an hour at any one time on any one question; and I submit that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> claim were upheld, it would enable a senator to do indirectly that which is prohibited by the standing order. The standing order is for the purpose, not merely, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> suggests, of giving other honorable senators an opportunity of speaking, but of placing a restraint on unlimited debate. That purpose could be defeated by a mere interjection, or series of interjections. </para>

                    <para>- The Minister for Repatriation is right in saying that this is the first time that the point on which I am asked to rule has arisen. In my opinion, the Standing Orders are clear regarding it. They say that in Committee no senator shall speak for more than a quarter of an hour at any one time on any one question, the object being to prevent the making of long speeches on questions in detail. In Committee it is to matters of detail that discussion is directed, and this necessitates the making of frequent rather than of long speeches. The  Chairman  of Committees says - and it has not been contradicted - that on this occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> addressed him, not on the question before the Chair, but on a matter of procedure - that is, that he simply asked for information. It is obvious that, were such an intervention taken to constitute a break of the discussion sufficient to enable a previous  speaker  to resume, the Standing Orders could be defeated by an arrangement with senators that they should occasionally intervene with questions of procedure. This would allow a speech to be continued for an hour, or even longer. The rule, if it is to have any force, must be respected in the spirit as well as in the; letter, and I hold strongly that it is the  Chairman  who must be the judge of whether any interruption was sufficient to permit of a senator again having the right to speak. If a casual remark or two in the nature of an interjection were regarded as a sufficient break, the object of the standing order would be defeated. I am certain that honorable senators have sufficient confidence in the  Chairman  to feel sure that he will give fair, play and due consideration to every member of the Committee. </para>

I uphold the ruling of the  Chairman. </para>

                        <para>- To expedite the business of the Committee, I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> request. We should trade freely with Great Britain in the iron industry, if in no. other. We have been informed that our own iron works make nearly all our requirements, and we might well go to Great Britain to make good any deficiency. In the Old Country the manufacture of iron has reached the height of perfection, and neither the wages, nor. the conditions there warrant us in. handicapping British manufacturers should they wish to trade with us. It has been, said that iron may be brought out as ballast. That would occur only now and again, but even when it did, British iron would not be in free competition with the local manufactures because it would be- handicapped, by the cost of transport from, the works to the ship and from the ship to the store. At the present time, Australian manufacturers are at an advantage of 25 per cent, in this market in comparison with their British rivals; because of the shipping charges, and the preferential duty is equivalent to about 33 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> so that our iron manufacturers have an advantage of something like 58 per cent., against their British rivals&#39;. The Minister has told us that our workmen are superior to all. others in the world, and that being so&#62; our industry cannot need such an advantage. I support the request, because if is better to have the British Tariff 34s. per ton than to have it 44s. per ton ;: but I think  there  should be absolutely Free Trade with Britain in this, as in other commodities. It is the links of trade that hold&#39; the Empire together. A Tariff war. is one waged between different trading, sections of the community, and I have no desire for a Tariff war with Great: Britain. All our interests lie in maintaining our- connexion with that country. I do not know what the normal, price- of &#39; iron will be in the future, but if Belgium, as has&#39; been said, can put iron on the market at about &#163;T per ton, British iron would cost about the same price&#62; and, therefore; even the lower duty proposed would be a heavy tax on British importations. Whilst there may be 10.000 persons employed in the iron industry here, there are possibly hundreds of thousands&#39; who use manufactures- ! of iron. I have heard grievous and well founded complaints by persons who-&#39; can not get in Australia the iron goods they require. Near where I live, at Waverley, there is a man in the iron business- who travels to buy iron wherever it is to- be obtained, but he cannot get sufficient in this country of the particular kind, he requires, and must therefore import. Ac* cording to- his statement, the local iron works prefer to turn out bigger classes of iron, which they can manufacture more profitably. We ought not to say to Great Britain, &#34;We are an independent nation,&#34; thus&#39; severing the link which binds us. The preference given to the Old Country in this instance is not very great.. It will be only 21s. if the proposed request be agreed to. The Tariff on iron imported from cheap-labour countries is- only 80s. per. ton. I know that present prices are abnormal,, and will drop, but the drop is not likely to be sufficient to seriously affect the price per ton at which iron can be produced in Great Britain. I&#39; believe that our industries, now that they are established, would prosper under Free Trade, and as we have factories sufficiently large, to produce nearly the whole of our requirements, we should not increase the price of these iron goods by 44s. per ton. Nothing will&#39; unite the peoples of the Empire so firmly as trading for mutual benefit. I am not prepared to sacrifice the links, of Empire to please those who think that industries are- to be -built&#39; up only with the protection of high Tariffs. I have not seen a successful industry so built up. The iron industry, in my opinion, does not require the protection of a high Tariff. I regret that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> did not move to make trade . with Great Britain free. </para>

                    <para>.: - What. I said when speaking on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan&#39;s</inline> amendment applies, to the present- proposal; but there is one matter that needs- to be- emphasized, and that is that. before moving to increase a duty in this; item,, it will be necessary to pave the way to? further action-: The Inter-State Commission reported - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <quote>
                    <para>The item covers a great variety ofl sizes; shapes, and sections, used in iron and. steel structural work, and,, with, the exception of galvanized and corrugated sheets, and steel rails, is the principal item of general and widespread demand, connected- with any progress that may be expected in &#39; iron and&#39; steel manufacture in. Australia. </para>
                    <para class="block">I would like that  paragraph to  sink into the minds of honorable senators in order that they may understand how their future actions will square with their lack of action at the present moment. The rates of duty upon these -commodities, which had previously been free, and which are now about to bear heavy imposts, are of special importance in that the materials themselves enter into the manufacture of almost every finished article of iron ware. At later stages I shall endeavour - if other honorable &#39;senatorsdo not see their way clear  to  consistently do so - to reduce the duties upon those -finished articles&#39;;  but  I would not be able to take such action with justice and  reason  unless I were to move similarly &#39;in respect of &#39;the raw material grouped in the present sub-item. The proposal of the Inter-State Commission was for a &#39;30s. preferential rate , and 40s. general ; but in the schedule those rates have been -raised in the case of the general Tariff one hundredfold, and very nearly . as much with respect to the British : duty I do not know . that I can more strongly impress honorable senators. I have quoted the Tariffs of the United States of America . and Canada. I urge that if honorable senators desire intelligently to remodel the schedule they must begin straightway upon raw materials. The Australian firms which supply . the commodities under review . are exactly . the . same firms which make the original raw material, namely, pig iron.; and, while . there . has been far too much protection given in connexion &#34;with sub items a and b, there is still the present opportunity to even matters down to a fair average. In view of the fact that the processes concerned in turning out the articles mentioned in sub-item care conducted in the same factories and under the same management as those- which produce the pig iron itself, I press my . request as already moved. The proposed preferential rate of 34s. per ton represents an, advance&#39; of 4s.  upon  the recommendation of theInterStateCommission, which examined the whole of the circumstances in1916. Honorable senators should be glad to note that there has actually been some export of these commodities. </para>
                    <para>SenatorRUSSELL (Victoria -Vice-  President  of tha Executive Council) &#91;4.5&#93;. - The Government cannot support the request. . There is. an important relationship between the matters covered by sub-items&#39; a, b, and c. The rates of duty in respect of the two first-mentioned have been fixed on the basis of those imposed on pig iron, which is the raw&#39; material for the commodities now under consideration. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;srequest</inline> were accepted, and the schedule amended accordingly, the rates would be thrown out of proportion. </para>

                        <para>- Plate and sheet iron is required in the manufacture of all kinds of articles, including galvanized iron, and at this juncture we have to seriously consider the position in which subsidiary industries will be placed if unnecessarily high duties are imposed upon this material. The operations of manufacturers will be seriously interfered with, if not altogether retarded, if we impose high duties, because the cost of the raw material which they have to work up will be unduly high. Unless we are very careful, we will be making a false step in imposing high duties on this material. </para>

                        <para>- There is always the same excuse - that it is only a little one; but these so-called small sums amount, in the aggregate, to a good deal, and prevent manufacturers producing articles at a reasonable price. As values recede, these fixed duties will become higher than at present, and, although the duty after 1st January, 1922, is set down at 65s. per ton, when values recede the Protective duty will be much higher. This particular proposal should receive very careful consideration, because our decision as to the duty to be imposed on this material will largely affect the question of the duty upon galvanized iron, which is to be considered later. The proposal of the InterState Commission was a British preferential duty of 40s., with a special proviso that the duties should not operate until the manufacturers were &#39;in a position to guarantee to supply a large proportion of our requirements. </para>

The duties we are asked to impose would considerably enhance the cost of raw materials required by subsidiary industries, and are based on visionary arguments, which have not been supported by facts. I am positive that they are not based upon the applications which have been made by men engaged in the industry, because we have had the evidence of at least one man who said that he did not require protection by the imposition of duties.

                    <para>. - I am afraid <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> is labouring under a misapprehension in moving for an extension of two years. The time at which the proposed duties will come into operation &#39; depends upon when the manufacturers will be in a position to supply the Australian requirements. During the war period, when raw material of this type was particularly scarce, a representative of the firm of Lysaghts paid a visit to Australia to inquire into the conditions then prevailing. Prior to that time sheet iron had been selling at &#163;15 and &#163;16 per ton, and as large supplies were required for the erection of wheat sheds, and we could not obtain British iron, we had to purchase an inferior article from America at prices ranging from &#163;55 to &#163;60 per ton. When a representative of the British firm came to Australia, we gave him information concerning our requirements, and after fully considering the matter, and hearing representations from the Board of Trade, he submitted an estimate of the time required to produce plate and sheet iron. After further consultation and investigation, the firm expended &#163;100,000 in establishing a plant in New South Wales, and commenced the manufacture of sheets for making galvanized and corrugated iron. When production commenced the Government granted a bonus based on shipping freights. When freights on black steel sheets were 50s. or under, we allowed a bonus of 30s. per ton, and when the freight exceeded 50s., a bonus of &#163;1 10s. per ton v was paid, less the amount by which the freight exceeded 50s. per ton. When the freight on galvanized sheets was &#163;2 10s. or under, we paid a bonus of &#163;2 per ton, and when the freight exceeded 50s. per ton, a bonus of &#163;2 per ton, less the amount by which the freight exceeded &#163;2 10s. per ton. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Protection is based on the ruling freights. The firm is now producing a fair quantity of iron, and is, I believe, able to meet our ordinary requirements. When the proposed duties are imposed, the payment of bonuses will cease. I am informed that since the 1st May last the company has  been in a position to supply the whole of our requirements of galvanized and corrugated iron. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> has submitted a request to extend the period from 1922 to 1924, but the whole question is governed by the rapidity with which the firms&#39; works can be completed. They failed to do what was promised within the period first suggested, but we saw that they were honestly endeavouring to carry out their undertaking. We have declined to put the duty into operation until they are in a position to meet Australian requirements. </para>

                        <para>- I can assure honorable senators that if the manufacturers are not ready to carry out the virtual contract which was .made with them, the operation of these duties will be suspended, if .not by .the intervention of the  Tariff Board  as provided for in this &#39;Bill, then &#34;by some other means. If the &#34;Tariff Board is not in a position to deal with the matter, the &#39;Government will accept the responsibility of deferring the operation of these duties if, in &#62;order to do so, it may be necessary to submit the matter to Parliament. The firm to which I have referred is extending its buildings, and putting in a plant costing many thousands of pounds, and the Government will take no action which might lead to the destruction of an industry the establishment of which in Australia has been due to the encouragement they held out. We are glad to have this important industry established in Australia. If it had been established long before it was, we should have saved an immense amount of money which .had to be spent upon imported galvanized .iron during the war period. Under the Government proposal these materials were to be free from Great Britain and dutiable in the intermediate and general columns respectively at 5 and .10 per cent. &#39;On and after the 1st January, 1922, subject to the manufacturers complying with the condition to which J have referred, of  ability  to supply reasonable quantities, plates and sheets up to and including l-16th inch in thickness will be dutiable at - British, 65s. per ton; intermediate, &#39;82s. 6d. per ton; and general, 100s. per ton. As the  Tariff  was first introduced, plates -and sheets exceeding l-16th inch in thickness were free from Great Britain, and dutiable in the intermediate and general columns at 5 &#34;per cent, -and 10 per -cent, respectively; and on &#39;and after the 1st January, 1922, it is proposed that they shall be dutiable &#39;at, -per ton, British, 4&#39;8s. ; intermediate, .68s. ; and general, 85s. &#39;We promised these people that if they established their industries here they would receive a bonus .during the transition period, and when they were in a position to supply these goods in reasonable quantities we would give them the protection of Tariff duties. Some honorable senators may suggest that that has the appearance pf .a prearranged -affair, but we were .compelled to make such arrangements during the war period in order to make provision for necessary supplies. I would not be prepared to support such arrangements in &#39;normal times, but we had. to do &#34;many &#34;things during the war period that -we&#39; would not do under normal conditions. &#39;We. committed ourselves to a promise of &#34;their -protection -if these people, established their industry here; Australia has greatly benefited by the introduction of the millions, of. capital that has followed upon the inducements offered to important British firms, to establish industries here. The firm to which I have referred has rendered very important service to Australia, and, whilst the Government will see that they do not secure the benefit of a duty until they are entitled to it under the conditions which have been agreed upon, we will keep our promise to these people by , a direct appeal to Parliament if we cannot do so under&#39; this. Bill. On the 1st May, 192.0, British steel sheets were quoted for export at from &#163;46 to &#163;47 15s. per ton. </para>

                    <para>.. - I have to confess that I do not entirely appreciate the justification for a deferred duty. At one stage of the Minister&#39;s remarks I thought I was beginning to learn something about its justification, but before he concluded that belief was dispelled. The honorable senator has pointed out that the date of operation, of the deferred duty depends upon the readiness of the local manufacturers to reasonably supply Australian requirements for these goods. </para>

If a proposal were made to immediately impose duties on galvanized iron, I should support it, because the Minister has informed us that local manufacturers of the article have been in a position to supply .reasonable requirements of it since May last. For the reasons I have given, I do not on principle support deferred duties. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister says that it is arrived at by a consideration of the period within which the local manufacturers will be in a. position to reasonably supply the requirements of the local market. They were in the position to do that in respect of galvanized iron as far back as May last, and that would have justified the imposition of these duties on galvanized iron since that date. The danger in connexion with deferred duties is the invitation they offer to the world outside to send in goods during the period before which they come into operation. For this reason I cannot see my way to support a proposal to defer the operation of these duties beyond the date indicated in the schedule, and so I am unable to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman&#39;s</inline> request to defer their operation to the later date. In my view, it is quite foreign to the principle of Protection to defer the operation of a duty for one day longer than can reasonably be avoided. </para>

                    <para>There is another suggestion of considerable importance I would like to make, and that is that the duties on black sheets and galvanized iron should come into operation immediately upon being passed by the House of Representatives, instead of as now proposed at 1st January, 1922. In the latter case, the Australian market will, before the end of the year, be swamped with imported black and galvanized sheets from England, the Continent, and America, as every importer in Australia will do his&#39; utmost to have all the stock on hand possible before the duties come into operation. We anticipate by the end of the year to be turning out black and galvanized sheets at Newcastle at the rate of 2,000 tons a month; but I am afraid that, unless the alteration suggested by me is made, we shall have the greatest difficulty in disposing of our output. Even to-day, when we are only turning out half of what we shall be doing in two or three months&#39; time, we are finding considerable difficulty in making sales. </para>

                <para class="block">This matter may be dealt with in another way under the Anti-Dumping Bill, which authorizes the prohibition of undue importation with the object of defeating the intention of Parliament. The Inter-State Commission recommended that the local manufacturers should be given protection when they could guarantee the supply of rolled plain steel sheets. Last year our importations in these lines totalled in value &#163;1,743,590. This is material which the Australian manufacturers are in a position to produce. The galvanizing process itself is quite simple, but hitherto there has been difficulty in the production of the thinner sheets required for tin plate manufacture. Experiments are now being carried out at Newcastle in this direction. If successful, the industry will mean a great deal to this country. </para>

                        <para>- No. It is twelve months later than the original date, but there has been no attempt at evasion of responsibility on the part of the manufacturers. Delay is due entirely to coal strikes, shipping strikes, and other industrial troubles in Great Britain, over which the Australian manufacturers had no control. They are now prepared to defer the date upon which the duty shall become operative until they are in a position to supply Australian requirements, and it is estimated that they will be ready by 1st January of next year. It will be necessary to. take action Under the Anti Dumping Bill in order to protect the home market for Australian manufacturers, otherwise there will probably be heavy stocking up on the part of importers of black sheets and similar material, and our manufacturers will be unable to market their produce until all this surplus material shall have been &#39;disposed of. I think the  power  under the  Anti-Dumping  Bill will be adequate. The industry was established in 1915 at the invitation of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> and after full consideration had been given to the proposal by the Board of Trade, which approved of a system of bonuses. I trust that the Committee will now support the action of the Government by agreeing to the sub-item. </para>

                    <para>. - With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> I am very much concerned at the possible incidence of some of this deferred duty. This, I think, is the first time we have had the opportunity to discuss the principle, and, therefore, everything connected with it should be very fully considered.- There are two proposals before the Committee, one the request foreshadowed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to reduce the duty by 10s. per ton, and the other a definite request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> to make the date of operation of the deferred duty 1924 instead of 1922. I understand the Minister has power, if satisfied that the deferred duty should operate on the date fixed, to issue a proclamation declaring the duty ; if not satisfied on the point, he may defer the operation of the duty till some future date. The spirit of the provision implies that the deferred duty shall not become operative until the industry concerned is fully developed, and prepared to supply a good portion of Australian requirements under the protection which Parliament says should be afforded to it. As the Minister has told us that a full supply of black sheet made from Australian material will be available before 1st January next, I feel that this deferred duty should be fixed as and from 1st November next, because, if the manufacturers will be in a position to supply our requirements by that date, and the deferred duty is not operative, then, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> put it very lucidly and logically, we- shall be inviting importers of black sheets and such material to stock up before the duty becomes operative. If they cared to speculate with regard t&#171; the world&#39;s parity for the next year or two, they might import sufficient stocks, under the lower duty now operative, and thus practically prevent the Australian manufacturers from disposing of any of their products for a year or two, notwithstanding their ability to supply. I should like the Minister to consider the advisability of asking the Committee to agree to the principle that the duty should apply at some future date, say when supplies are available, and whether it is not better to fix the date as from 1st November, next. </para>

                    DE LARGIE  (Western Australia) &#34;(&#34;5.5&#93; . - We are making in connexion with this industry a very interesting experiment, which, so far, has met. with the general approval of both schools of fiscal thought. We have repeatedly heard Free Traders say that where it can be clearly shown that a new industry may be established by the payment of a bounty upon its production, the assistance so given prevents anything in the nature of extortionate prices for the product, since it leaves the industry still exposed to the tempering influence of the importers. The system of setting the wheels of new industries going by means of the payment of bounties is an admirable one. As. has been pointed out again and again, a bounty is paid by the whole of the people,, and that section of the community which uses the article in respect of which if is paid is not called upon to bear any greater burden than is placed upon all other, sections.. These black sheets are undoubtedly used to a very large extent by only one section of the people, and I am afraid that if these duties were imposed that section alone would have to pay - and perhaps&#34; &#34; pay through the nose &#34; - for the establishment of the industry. Capitalists have been induced, as the result of a promise given by the Government, to engage in the industry. The. proposition was no doubt acceptable to the. company concerned because of the greatly enhanced cost of bringing iron to Australia. Shipping freights have gone up sky high during the last few years, and are likely to be very high for some time to come. In such circumstances, why should we not continue the application of the bounty system, to this industry, and so lead to its complete establishment without imposing any burden on the users of its products? Under the bounty system, the burden is distributed over the whole community.

                    <para>- I do not think the Government could1 find the funds necessary to permit of the general application of the. principle, but as we have gone a certain distance along this road I fail to see why we should not&#34; go still further. I would postpone indefinitely the coming into operation of these deferred duties, and would bring them into operation only when it was demonstrated that the bounty system had failed. Let us make this experiment in connexion with the sub-item immediately before us. Both schools of fiscal thought have often suggested: that it is the best way of establishing new industries. If the local market were swamped by imports of the cheaper products- of other countries, we should be able to protect, the industry from such dumping by means of the Customs Tariff (Industries. Preservation)&#39; </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Bill. If the Parliament is- sincere in the. desire to establish this industry on a firm basis, it can demonstrate its. sincerity by applying the bounty system to it, and that, together with anti-dumping legislation, should prove effective. I see but. little prospect of any dumping taking place. The world-wide changes brought, about by the. war make dumping practically impossible. That being sO, I think we have an excellent opportunity to experiment in the way I have suggested. We can do&#39; so feeling sure that no. harm! will result to those who have put their capital into the industry, inasmuch as we shall be able to step in at any moment and protect them if undue advantage is taken of the free market. I shall therefore support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman&#39;s</inline> request. It is time that we . resorted to some new . means of establishing industries. We are all anxious, I am sure, to increase the opportunities of employment for Australian workmen. The bounty system has received the support of the Free Trade section, and I am satisfied that the Protectionist element in the community will indorse its application&#34; in this case. My experience in this Chamber leads me to the- conclusion that the longer protective duties are imposed, the greater is the demand for increases. Rightly or wrongly, that conclusion has been forced upon me as the result of my experience as a senator. Here we have an opportunity to institute a new means of establishing industries. I hope that the Committee will avail themselves of it by agreeing to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Drake-Brockman&#39;s</inline> proposition. We can then continue the application of the bounty system to this industry until we are satisfied that it is a failure.&#34; My view is that a good deal of success will attend its application, and I hope that this experiment will be made. </para>

                    <para>. -  I find myself for once largely in agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. I do not favour the payment of bounties, but if I have to choose between a- bounty and the imposition of a protective duty, I prefer it as the lesser of two evils.  It  is better to encourage a new industry by giving a bounty on its output than by imposing a protective duty. My own view is that we should remove any: obstacles in the- way of tha creation  of new industries, and . that, having done so much, we should allow those Concerned to manage their own businesses. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> proposesto postpone for two years the coming into operation of these deferred duties; and that, if carried, will give the Governmentanopportunity to apply the bounty system to the industry. I prefer a direct contribution from the people in the shape of a bounty to an indirect contribution through a protective &#39;duty, which makes goods costly, whether they are produced locally or not. The bounty system is the lesser of two evils, ; and certainly does not make goods more costly. . I can quiteunderstandSenator Pratten foreseeing a danger of the manufacturers of the would rushing their ships here laden with galvanized iron, so that -when the local manufacturer <inline font-style="italic">(does</inline> commence operations he may find himself handicapped by stocks already in. hand and awaiting distribution to the rpulic. I do not believe that the manufacturers of the world, working rapidly as they &#39;have been doing since thewar -ended,have been : able ito build up huge stocks, or that if they have done so, they can get ships to carry them. </para>

                        <para>-Relatively wages were practically as good then as they are now. But what would happen . even if there were a reasonable amount of this iron in store when the protected local industry began to put its product . on the market? It would simply have to wait until the stocks in hand were sold out, rand then it would reap the full benefit of the protection afforded to it. And what isthedifferencebetween <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> proposal and that of the Government? Merely a matter of two months.&#34;. Is it not too late to lock the door now? This proposal for a. deferred duty has been before the people since March of last year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> proposes to prevent goods coming in at a reasonable rate as from the 1st November next instead of from the 1st January next. Why cannot he be consistent ? I am afraid that he &#39;cannot be consistent ; nor can any person saturated with Protectionist ideas, because as soon as he comes to deal &#34;with a practical business proposition he finds that Protection fails, as it &#39;has failed in this case. Eighteen months ago the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> with &#34;a . &#39;knowledge of all &#34;the facts relating to the people proposing to engage in this business, said that the duty which was . to afford them protection was to commence to operate on a certain date. And now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> gets. up in a hurry to&#34; do something for the manufacturers, whose interests he is always willing to serve. I wish he would turn that&#39; . great intellect of his to doing something of advantage to the hundreds of thousands of workers who have sent him here. He will not do for them what he is willing to do for one or two manufacturers who watch him when he is at work here. He jumps quite readily to the crack of the whip of the manufacturers, but is blind to the interests of the people who sent him to this House, and never sees the conditions under which they toil and suffer. </para>

I was absolutely wrong in saying that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .</inline> Pratten jumps to the crack of the whip . of the manufacturers. They do not need -to crack -a , whip. They . have simply to click the tongue, and he will go full pace ahead, without . the application of any whip for the . simple . reason that. their interests and those of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> are almost identical. They are the interests of the classes as against those of the masses; of the few against those of the many. I really was offensive when 1 said that the manufacturers crack the whip  over <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> There is no need for them to do so. They have merely to guide him. When he sees that their interests are affected, he is always in his place, anxious to do the very best he can for them, quite forgetful of the fact that he ought to be looking after the interests of the hundreds of thousands of working-class people who have sent him here. I recognise the honorable senator&#39;s great ability. All I complain of is that he exercises it in the interests of the few. </para>

So far, I have waited for eleven years in this Senate to see any signs of the &#39;honorable senator&#39;s conversion to Free Trade. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt that the two countries referred to have suffered a very great loss. Scotland, no doubt, has suffered much by losing the services of a gentleman of such great ability. As for New South Wales, it is being rapidly populated by thousands of his countrymen, and by thousands of the sturdiest of the citizens of Free Trade Victoria, so that his loss has-been made good. Furthermore, the speeches made by honorable senators representing Western Australia would indicate that there is a great Free Trade development in that State, and I cannot see how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de:</inline> Largie has gained by his change from one State to the other. I rose to speak to this sub-item because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has put forward a proposal which, on his part, is a mere pretence. What use can there be in discussing whether this duty shall come into operation in November or January, seeing that eighteen months ago the Minister made known to the manufacturers of the world that a duty would be imposed upon this iron at a certain fixed date? </para>

                    <para>.- I think honorable senators are quite entitled to consider a request for an amendment of the date upon which this duty shall come into operation. Some development may have occurred in connexion with an industry affected by a deferred duty necessitating an alteration to the date. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> proposes that the date upon which this deferred duty shall come into operation shall be extended for two years. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> on the other hand, proposes that the duty shall come into operation  two months earlier. If we even considered <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman&#39;s</inline> proposal we would be breaking faith with the people who have invested their money in the industry sought to be protected, and I do not think that the majority of senators are prepared to break faith with capitalists who, at the request of the Government, backed up by the people of the Commonwealth, have invested an enormous amount of money in order to provide Australia with an industry which must eventually be of great benefit to it. Yet, that is the direction of the honorable senator&#39;s proposal, although he stated that the continuance of the bounty would compensate the manufacturers for the loss of the protection proposed to be given after 1st January, 1922. I am not able to see eye to eye with honorable senators who suggest that the whole of the people of Australia should be compelled, except under very special circumstances, to contribute to the maintenance of any industry in which they are not personally interested. A bounty practically means that the whole &#34;of the people have to provide the wherewithal to enable an industry to be carried on satisfactorily, although only a section of the community uses the product of the industry. For that reason I certainly prefer a Protective Tariff to the. bounty system. It is contended that if the date of the deferred duty is not made earlier there must necessarily be a swamping of the market by importation; but I do not think there is much in that idea. We must recognise that the people have been dependent up to now for supplies on importers, who must of necessity cater for the public requirements. I do not blame importers for securing what is necessary a few months ahead, because if they did not do so they would not be worthy of their very, responsible. position. We owe a great deal to importers, who, by the exercise of brain and the use of capital, have been able to supply the public of Australia during the whole of our history, and I &#34; cannot agree with the contention that the date ought to be made earlier because importers axe likely to import what is * necessary in the meantime. In any case, in view of the shortage of supplies, which is likely to continue for some time, I do not think there is -any fear of the market being swamped. At the same time, if the firm can satisfy the Government that they are able to supply the requirements at an earlier date than that proposed, no harm will be done by accepting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> proposal, because the Minister has power to extend the time until the 1st January, or even later. We have, therefore, nothing to fear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> request, and for that reason I feel disposed to support it. I should now like to&#39; say one word on the remarks by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten. Senator Pratten</inline> is well able to take care of himself, but I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> made an attack upon him when he said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> is here in the interests of the manufacturers, and has no consideration for the workers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> knows that to a great extent the welfare of the workers of Australia depends on the success of the industry with which we are dealing. Manufacturers cannot possibly make a success of their businesses without at the same time conferring a lasting benefit on the workers ! </para>

Whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> are aware of the fact or not, that is the position in which they place themselves by always advocating that the only benefit the workers can obtain from the  Tariff must be distilled through the manufacturer and the employer; indeed, that is the whole essence of Protection. </para>

                        <para>- I do not make the remarks personally or offensively, but the principle- of Protection is to put the money of the whole people&#39; into the establishment of industries which can benefit the people only by means of the employment given by their own cash. If private people establish businesses with their own money, I have no complaint to make, because I believe in privately-conducted businesses, while holding the opinion that publicly-controlled and managed businesses can beat private. businesses in the results. Holding that belief, I want none of these duties, whether they are to come into effect on the 1st . November or at once. I desire to see no attempts made at the public cost to render wealthy manufacturers more wealthy. Not only <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> and other honorable senators, desire to benefit the workers by first creating a master class, and to that end they assert that Customs duties must be imposed. The difference of two months between the Government proposals and the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> is neither here nor there; we have to consider the whole principle of this Bill, which is designed to raise millions by taxation, and from whom? It will not be claimed that the wealthy contribute more to revenue by means of taxation than do the- poorer classes The wealthy bachelor . does not pay a tenth of the taxation that is paid by the married working man with six or eight children. I venture to- say that under- this Tariff I practically escape taxation. I do not pay any duties on tobacco-, spirits, or beer, and I do not think there is any duty on tea..I am in receipt, as a senator, of an increased emolument, given, not against my will, but without my assistance, and yet I escape scot-free from taxation to which some of the poor toilers who send me here are subjected. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> is afraid that unless his request is adopted iron for roofing purposes may be imported at a cheaper rate between November and January, and in this attitude the honorable senator has the support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne.</inline> Yet they complain that I describe them as the friends of the wealthy manufacturing: and master class: I do not mind those honorable senators seeking to establish a master class, but the money of the people generally ought not to be used for that purpose. Surely it is not suggested that the workers&#39; ought&#39; to pay for the establishment of a master class? We never see the master class&#39; going out of its way to assist the workers. I do hear that the Government are rendering some assistance at Port Pirie, which is represented in this Parliament by a member of the. Government, who may find the fact of some help to him at the next election. </para>

                        <para>- Broken Hill is getting no assistance now, and I should like to know why. Port Pirie is being- afforded help, with a Minister as its representative, whereas Broken Hill is left neglected. However, I do not wish to argue that matter now. I shall vote with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> to make the item free in the case of Great Britain for two years longer. This is a commodity which Great Britain can freely manufacture, and which wo need in large quantities, and too much of it cannot be sent into Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- The <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates, as they appear in paragraph 1 of sub-item e, are, respectively, 25. per cent., 30 percent., and 35 per cent. These are applicable to imports of wire of No. 16 or finer gauge. In the original schedule there was provision that the rates of duty upon all wire should be 52s., 72s. 6d., and 90s. per ton. In the course of consideration in another place, however, the sub-item covering wire was rearranged, and, upon wire of No. 14 or finer gauge, respective rates of 25 per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per cent, were imposed, while a distinct section was made of &#34; Wire, other,&#34; upon which rates of 52s., 72s. 6d., and 90s. per ton were made to apply. Eventually the sub-item was further amended, and the Senate Committee has now to consider wire of No. 16 or finer gauge, upon which - as I have just indicated - the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates are 25, 30, and 35 per cent. ; while &#34; Wire, other,&#34; is still subject to duties respectively of 52s., 72s. 6d., and 90s. per ton. Wire of finer gauges is extensively used in Australia for manufacturing purposes. Honorable senators should realize what the imposition of the rates proposed must mean to those engaged in weaving wire for various important industrial purposes. Taking the British preferential Tariff of 25 per cent, as a basis, there will be involved collections upon various wires as follow :  - 16 gauge, &#163;9 2s.9d. per ton; 21 gauge, &#163;10 6s. 3d.; 22 gauge, &#163;11 2s. 9d.; 24 gauge, &#163;13 6s. 9d.; 26 gauge, &#163;15 19s.; and 28 gauge, &#163;19 5s. per ton. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Those figures convey precisely what the imposition of the present Tariff will mean per ton upon a commodity of British origin, according to the most recent invoices available in connexion with&#39; wire just landed in Australia. If the Tariff is to be enforced in respect of wire which must of necessity be used by those engaged in manufacturing various classes of wire gauze in this country, the outcome will spell ruin to the industry. I have a number of interesting samples in my hand; they represent manufactures from wires of gauges running from 16 to 28. The sample from No. 16 gauge, for example, is a gauze of galvanized standard mesh used for ventilators, and for heavy screens for sand pits and the like. Prior to the war there were, I believe, no power looms in Australia. When the war broke out, however, those engaged in wire-weaving in this country had to introduce power looms in order to cope with Australia&#39;s needs. I draw special attention to one or two gauzes among these samples which are essential to certain phases of mining operations, and which must be made of the best possible wire. One gauze, of 24-gauge wire, is used for battery screens, also for bath heater burners, and for lamps used in lighthouses. I have specimens before me of wire gauzes manufactured from coarser gauges. From the 20-gauge a gauze is manufactured for use in battery screens. Item 159, sub-item b, deals with wire of iron and steel for use in the manufacture of barbed&#39; wire and wire netting &#34; as prescribed by departmental by-laws.&#34; These wires are dutiable at 52s., 72s. 6d., and 90s. per ton respectively. I ask the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> to consider whether it would not be wise, at the proper time, to request an amendment of item 159 by the insertion of the words &#34;woven wire.&#34; Thus, the wire admitted at rates of 52s., 72s. 6d., and 90s. would embrace not only wire for the manufacture of barbed wire and wire netting, but also that, used in the weaving, processes. Honorable senators may reasonably ask what objection there is to using Australian wire for weaving gauzes. Local manufacturers are using the Australian product for certain classes of wire weaving, wherever it may be suitable; but it has not been found to be suitable for the manufacture of the better grades of wire gauzes, especially in respect of gauzes for batteries. The annealing of the Australian wire is not nearly so perfect as that of the British wire. The wire-drawing industry in Great Britain is very old, and most soundly conducted. </para>

                        <para>- I can only say that I know that it is not doing so. I visited a wire-weaving factory some days ago, and found that the reed apparatus used is very quickly destroyed when Australian drawn wire is employed. The reeds, I was assured, will last three or four times as long when used solely in the weaving of British wire, because of the absence in the Australian product of that even temper which is so noticeable in the British material. In addition, the Australian manufacture is inferior, on account of the presence of a certain amount of scale, which is not to be found on the British wire. I have been informed by a person engaged in the industry that Rylands and Sons can supply wire only up to 20 gauge, and cannot undertake to say when they will be able to supply the finer gauges. If the time arrives when this firm can draw wire which will enable them to produce as good a finished article as the British, I believe the Australian wire will be largely used for the purpose. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> do not desire to pay anything against the Australian product; but I have been assured by practical men engaged in the manufacture of articles in which wire is used that the position is as I have stated. I have with me two samples, and, although I am not an. expert in the matter of wire drawing or weaving, a layman could not help noticing the difference in the qualities of the two wires of the same gauge. The samples before me show an uneven temper and the presence of a large proportion of scale on the wire, which proves that the statement made by the firm mentioned is correct. Before the war we we&#39;re importing large quantities of this materia&#93;, particularly for battery screens used in mining operations ; but during the war firms engaged in Australian wire weaving were able to fulfil the bulk of the orders by using Australian wire, otherwise they could not have been executed. The Fremantle Trading Company - I do not know upon what lines they are working - obtained large quantities of woven wire from Melbourne firms, and are successfully carrying on operations. Prior to 1914, hand looms dominated; but now it is the custom. I understand, to use power looms. I understood, from previous statements made by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> that the Tariff .had been framed with the idea of &#34;giving every possible assistance to those who are manufacturing commodities needed in Australia; but on perusing the schedule we find that in this instance the British Tariff is 25 per cent, on the .raw material , and only 35 per cent, on the manufactured article. Is that giving manufacturers a fair deal? </para>

Rylands and Sons have recently amalgamated with the Austral Nail Company at Newcastle, and are in a position to meet the requirements of Australian consumers. It has been suggested that i&#39;f the wire were made by the same firm in England no objection would be offered to the product; but it must be remembered that the Australian wire is drawn from our own iron, which is equal, if not superior, to any in the world. </para>

                        <para>- I was referring to some of the difficulties of those engaged in the industry of wire weaving in using Australian wire. I have made it quite clear that I am not entering upon &#39;a campaign against any primary industry of Australia. I should like to see them all as successful as possible. At the same time, one must have due regard to the importance of a number of small industries that have materially assisted in the development of this country. This particular industry has been productive of  very, good results indeed, inasmuch as the article turned out here can, so far as quality is concerned, hold its own with the imported article. It has been pointed out to me that the. greatest difficulty has been experienced in the use of Australian wire in connexion with the manufacture of. the better, classes of. wire gauze. Australian, wire is used very largely in the. manufacture of other classes of wire gauze. My remarks in this connexion refer entirely to the manufacture of wire gauzes similar to the . samples I&#39; have here, for which fineness and good finish are essential, so that those who use them, for the recovery of metals from ores for instance, may be&#39; assured! that, they are employing the best possible material for their purpose. </para>

                        <para>- No. I am dealing with the finished article. I want to. protect the manufacture of the finished article. I wish to describe as clearly as I can the difficulties of the industry as pointed out to me when I visited one of the. factories at&#34; work, and because of which it has been found necessary in the manufacture of the better classes of wire gauze to use imported wire. In the first place, the Australian wire is found in many instances to be uneven in gauge. Then the annealing, which is responsible for the temper of the wire, is not satisfactory. It is necessary that a machine working the wire shall work uniformly, and if the annealing is not satisfactory it cannot work evenly, because there is a bigger strain when one thread is being worked titan when another is, being worked. Then there is a distinct, tendency to hardness in thes Australian wire, and the surf  ace  roughness, due to scale, is exceedingly destructive of plant. Because of these defects in Australian&#39; wire, it is impossible to obtain&#39; a. regular mesh, which&#39; is- fatal to successful manufacture. There is always the risk of a breakdown because of the unevenness of the gauge, since a special strain; at a particular time is very likely to cause a breakdown. Then the scale, to which I have referred, destroys the reeds and heddles, and gets into the bearings. Reeds, worn and cut, were- shown, to- me in the framework of a loom, and I was assured - by the operatives working the loom that this wearing and cutting of the reeds, was caused&#39; by the scale which came from the wire- that was used. This scale also injures the heddlers; which carry the wire under and over as the shuttle passes to and fro. These results from the use of Australian wire have been under notice for a considerable time,, when English wire was not available. My informant tells me that it is , chiefly the finer ranges of wire gauze that are affected by the use of Australian wire, such as the samples I have here, which are of 22-inch, 24-inch, and 18-inch gauge, and so on. In the Tariff as first introduced there were no such duties as those imposed by the schedule&#39; as we- have- it before us to-night. I take it that very careful calculations were made as to the duty which would make the impost on wire proportionate to the duty placed on- the raw material of the basie industry of iron! smelting-. As first introduced&#39;, the duties proposed were 52s. per ton on British importations, and 90s. per ton. on foreign importations. These duties- haive been replaced as the result of amendments introduced by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> in another- place by <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties of 25 per cent. British, and 35 per cent, foreign. I have figures here to show- the difference between the rates first proposed on wire and those which we have to consider tonight. I find that as against the duty of 52s. per ton first proposed on wire imported from Britain, the duty of 25 per cent, now proposed on 16-gauge wire amounts to &#163;9 2s. 9d. per ton. Such a duty isi altogether too high in. view of the fact that this wire is imported only for manufacturing purposes. When our wire manufacturing industry produces a wire  suitable for the manufacture of the finer classes of wire gauze, our manufacturers will use it, and a duty upon it might then be considered. In connexion with previous items, the Minister has been contented to propose a duty to become operative within a certain time. </para>

                        <para>- The sub-item with which I wish to deal is sub-item  e  2, which is dutiable at, per ton, British, 52s.; intermediate, 72s. 6d. ; general, 90s. I did intend to move a request for a very much more drastic reduction than I shall now ask for. On reflection and consultation, I have cut the reduction down to a minimum, and I think that honorable senators will be prepared to agree to them. My proposal will be to make the duties on sub-item  e  2, per ton, British, 44s.; intermediate, 72s. 6d. ; general, 90s. In previous Tariffs this item was free. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> in introducing the Tariff, said, &#34;We have a huge continent which is undeveloped.&#34; I quite agree with him. The honorable gentleman may be regarded as the leader of the centralization party, and the hinterland of the big cities will, as a result of his action, be brought to rack and ruin, because the primary producer, and particularly the wheat farmer, are being called upon to pay terribly high prices for all they use and for all their machinery ,and tools, whilst a considerable and enormous fall in the value of their products is taking place. </para>

                <para> The consequence will be that their lot will become such a miserable one that they will be driven into the  cities.  where they may expect to receive much more favoured treatment. I do not wish honorable senators to think that I do not approve of secondary industries. We all know that they are essential and most desirable. It is quite right that they should be encouraged, but it should not be forgotten that they are secondary industries, and in building them up&#39;&#39; we must be careful not to wreck the primary industries of Australia. Ordinary fencing wire is an absolute necessity for every man on the land. I am speaking in this matter for the small man, and I wish honorable senators to know that 60 per cent, of the total flocks of sheep in Australia are owned by men who each have less than 500 sheep. Every farmer in the country must use wire, and when he fences his area he adds to the value of the national assets, because fencing greatly improves the stock-carrying capacity of land. I can say from practical experience that this result is most marked. It is extraordinary how country after it has been fenced and subdivided for a certain number of years improves in its stock-carrying capacity. I may illustrate this by experience gained in the Northern Territory. Thirty or forty years ago it was said that the Barkly Tableland was useless.. My father pioneered that country for sheep, and occupied a large tract of country on which, when he took it up, the tufts <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> grass were in places about 5 yards apart. After that old pioneer had spent a huge sum of money on improvements, fencing the country into many paddocks, and stocking it with sheep, it was found, after thirty years of occupation, that country which formerly grew only a tuft of grass here and there had a thick sole of grass and was carrying, in the smaller paddocks, nearly a sheep to the acre. This, it should be remembered, was land which was said to be absolutely valueless, and this old pioneer was regarded by his friends as being extremely rash in attempting to develop it for either sheep or cattle. His success was only one of many illustrations how country hitherto regarded as worthless may, by subdivisional fencing and occupation, be profitably occupied. In this way, also, obnoxious animals are checked. Fencing wire and wire netting are essential in order to combat the dog trouble, which is very bad indeed in the Darling country and the western district of New South Wales  and Queensland. We all know also what a terrible fight the farmers have to put up against the rabbit plague. Wire netting is an absolute necessity. The. country cannot be developed without it. I think we are extremely moderate in asking only for a reduction in the British preferential Tariff. We have heard much about the necessity of giving adequate protection to our secondary industries, and what a splendid concern the Broken Hill Proprietary Company&#39;s works at Newcastle is for the Commonwealth. I would be very loath indeed to do anything that would damage those great industries, but I am sure honorable senators do not fully realize how important it is that we should safeguard our great primary industries, notably wool, meat, wheat, and butter production. </para>
                <para>On behalf of the whole of the primary producers, of the Commonwealth, I protest against the continual persecution to which they are being subjected by being singled out for . class taxation. This Tariff penalizes two sections of the community, the primary producers and the consumers, while every consideration is given to- the manufacturers, both of the hot-house variety and those who have done so well that some of them give every promise of becoming multi-millionaires. Most of them have been amply protected hitherto, and are already getting comparatively enormous interest returns on their outlay. Increased protection is not needed. Honorable senators seem to forget that the farmer has to pay more than the city man for everything he uses because of the extra freight and the higher cost of distribution, and this Tariff will still further add to his burden. The man on the land is probably paying 25 per cent, more for all his commodities and necessaries of life than the people in the cities who are already growling about the high cost of living. Number 10 black wire, hundreds of thousands of tons of which is used all over Australia, was selling at &#163;10 per ton in 1914. It is now quoted at &#163;32 per ton. </para>

                        <para>- That is a splendid argument for a reduction in the duty, especially in view of the fact that our primary producers get no protection, no bounties, and no encouragement whatever. I know that honorable senators are inclined to think that, because I was connected with land industries, and once held a few farms, I am biased in favour of the primary producers. I can assure them that I got out of the wheat-growing industry because ; I could see only too well what, was coming. For fifteen years the average return from wheat-growing was &#163;2 17s. 6d. per acre as against the cost of production of over &#163;3. What is it going to cost to produce wheat in the future with the price of ploughs, reapers and binders, threshers, mowers, fencing wire, and all other requirements at enhanced values as the result of this Tariff ? I say, in all sincerity, that, after having been connected with the business of wheat-growing for thirty years, and having followed the position very closely from a statistical point of view, if we do not take care we shall kill primary production in Australia. The natural protection which these great secondary industries such as that of Broken Hill enjoy is extraordinary. They have cheap coal, cheap iron, and labour certainly as cheap, considering its excellence, as in England. Therefore, I see no reason for a further increase in the duty. For the whole of the manufacturing industries of the Commonwealth the average outlay in wages is only &#163;129 per head per worker, and for every &#163;100 worth of finished product the proportion paid for labour is 17 per cent. It is of no use blaming labour costs for all the increased cost of production. Labour costs certainly do enter into the problem, but, as I have shown, to the extent of only 17 per cent. We should do all we can to encourage those plucky pioneers who are prepared to go out and develop the empty spaces of this continent. If we do not endeavour to make the lot of the man on the land more profitable and certainly more comfortable by the construction of railways, roads, water channels, telephones, telegraphs, and similar conveniences, and at least provide for only reasonable protection on manufactured articles which he uses as his tools of trade, we shall be failing in our duty. We have heard. a good deal about the great  number- of men - 10,000 - employed in these1 great secondary industries in. New South Wales. I should like to remind honorable- senators that the&#39; much-abused: pastoral industry&#39; employs much more1 labour; and- pays higher wages than any Other industry in the - Common-wealth. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> intends to request a* reduction . in the British preferential Tariff, leaving the intermediate and general1 Tariff as proposed by the Government, and I shall have much pleasure in. supporting his request. The 1908 Tariff&#39; schedule contained no duty* against Britain in regard to this * sub-item, . and again in the 1914 Tariff this item was free, although there was a small- duty of 5&#39; per cent, in the general Tariff.&#39; The proposal now is to jump from 5 per cent, to 90s*, per ton in the general Tariff, and, so far as the British preferential Tariff is concerned, from the free list to 44s*. per ton, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s-</inline> request be agreed to. I realize that conditions have changed since the industry was estab lished and that it may be necessary to impose a duty, but* I think 52s., as pro posed* by the Government, is considerably more than is necessary in the circumstances. The imposition of this duty will inflict a very severe hardship upon a  section of the community that can ill1 afford to bear it. Fencing&#39; wire is* an essential commodity for - every man who goes out to open up the back country: His* available* capital may not be very great for* outlay upon stock, materials; and&#39;implements,&#39; and it is regrettable that the Government in this * sub-item propose to impose a further hardship on him* at the very outset of his career. If we are* in earnest m our desire to assist our primary producers to- the fullest possible extent, here is an* opportunity to prove it.&#39; I have very much pleasure- in indorsing the* views that have been put forward by my* honorable&#39; friend, Senator1 Guthrie.We ought not to impose an additional burden- upon- a- section* of&#39; the community which can least * afford, to pay increased&#39; taxation, and I hope- that the- request* which Senator* Guthrie&#39; in tends*) to- move that the duty under the* British preferential Tariff be reduced&#39;from 52s. to  44si*per  to I understand that- is* now. his* intention - will be agreed&#39;, to; </para>

                    <para>. - I am very pleased to have this opportunity, to continue . my arguments in support of the request that I intend to submit for a moderate reduction in the duty on wire under the- British preferential Tariff. The- carrying&#39; of* such- a request will show at least that we are endeavouring to avoid, the over-penalization of our primary producers. I should have moved* a request to reduce the* duty from 52s. to 30s. per ton but . for the fact that under sub-item- o we have already provided for a duty of -44s. per ton on the bar iron- from which I understand the fencing wire is produced; I want to tell&#39; the Nationalist Ministry what I &#39;think, of their treatment of the primary producers. I regret- to say that I am very disappointed&#39; with them. The primary producers have been* singled out by them for- not merely class taxation but persecution. So far as the Government are concerned, it is a case of * tax, tax, tax the man on the land, who, in addition to having to pay high ocean&#39; and. railway freights, has* bad roads, no electricity, no . doctors, no chemists; no ice, and, in short, none of those luxuries which the city dweller has at band. . He has none of the luxuries or* comforts of those who work* in city factories, or the wealthy manufacturing class* who, by means of this Tariff; are being spoon-fed. The result is that people are flocking from the lands bf the country to our citj.es: Even in Victoria, which is rightly regarded as the Garden* State of the Commonwealth, we have the awful anomaly of 52 per cent, of the total population living in* the city of Melbourne: In. view df&#39; all this- taxation, how can-returned soldiers&#39; and others whom we are settling* in the Mallee, be  expected to grow wheat when in normal times the cost of production exceeds the price obtainable for their produce? If we return to normal times and prices, the majority of them will go to the wall. These returned soldiers and others who are .developing their blocks have to buy fencing wire, the. price of which to-day is &#163;32 per ton as compared with . the normal price of &#163;10 per ton. </para>

                <para>SenatorGUTHRIE.- &#163;10 per ton. This Tariff is designed to spoon-feed &#39; the habitues of picture theatres, race-courses, and others who enjoy all the comforts of city life. The city dweller turns on a tap and the water runs; he can get a cool drink round the corner; he is supplied with electric light and electric fans. Compare his lot with that of the man in the back country. Go into the back blocks as I have done, and you will find men -and women living 40 miles away from a doctor, and having to cart water, and dirty water at that, a distance of 10 miles. They have &#39;no picture shows, no electric light, no electric fans, no doctors, no chemists at hand. This is the way in which the Government are encouraging the settlement of returned soldiers and others on the land. They are taking action by means of this excessive Protection run mad Tariff to attract people to our cities, so that we shall have our cities overflowing and the country undeveloped. The shipping combines, the manufacturers, -the shopkeepers, the theatre owners, and picture show proprietors can pass on any taxation which they have to pay. They pass on to the -consumer all such duties as these, and so increase the cost of living. If the Tariff increases the cost of a piece of cloth, or anything else, to the city- manufacturer or warehouseman, he  passes on the &#39;increased cost to the consumer. The primary producer, however, can not pass on any of the taxation that he has to pay. We are an exporting nation living on the excess of our exports over our imports, and we have to take -the world&#39;s market- prices, less heavy rail and ocean freights for our pri mary produce. The . Broken Hill Proprietary Company,- to which we are giving this enormous measure of protection, has ample supplies of coal and. iron within the country. Its British competitors; however, . have to-get their-iron ore. from Spain,: and have the dearest coal in. the world, to-day. -Wages in. Britain &#39;are just about- as. high as they . are here, and after the British manufacturers have imported their , iron from Spain, and paid the highest price for coal,- they . have to.:send their manufactured article a distance of 12,000 miles- to Australia. . Another result of* this high protective -wall is that . &#34;we will have practically no imports. Ships -have consequently to come out here practically in ballast, in order to take away our wool, wheat, meat, &#39;butter, and other primary products to &#34;the other side of the world, where, by means of such exports, we have to establish our credits. The . consequence is that we have to pay practically double freights. I want honorable senators to realize that the legislation of &#39; this country is going in . a direction that is calculated to make the lot of the man&#34; on . the land not only unprofitable, but unbearable. No one who has travelled in the back country of any of the States &#39;will refute that statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .</inline> Knibbs shows all too clearly in his official statistics &#39;the terrible drift of population to our cities. For that I blame the Governments, past and present. The primary producer cannot pass on these increased charges. He has to compete with the wool, wheat, meat, and butter producers of other parts of lie world in the world&#39;s markets, and has- to pay every farthing of these charges. On the other hand, if, by reason of the Tariff or increased wages the manufacturer of, say, iron has his costs of production increased by &#163;2 per ton, those who buy &#39;his commodity have to pay the increased costs. Whether it is a ton of iron, : a hairpin, or a pin, that is purchased, the increased cost involved in its production by reason of the Tariff . or increased wages has to be borne by the purchaser. And so with the amusement tax. We all know that it is added to the charges for admission to the theatres and picture shows. A high &#34;Tariff means higher prices for everything the people have to buy. It accentuates the difficulties of the very people who, after. all, are producing the greater part of the wealth of the country. As I pointed out this morning, out of the total wealth produced in Australia in 1919-20, &#163;223,500,000 came from the land. I am afraid we shall not have that return, or anything like it, again, because the prices of all our primary products have slumped, on the average, to the extent of nearly 60 per cent. On the other hand, the much-lauded manufacturers of Australia produced only &#163;75,000,000 of the wealth of the country in the year I have, named. I wish them nothing but good luck if they can carry on under a reasonable Tariff, and do not take down the consumers. The collapse in the values of wool, skins, and meat, concurrently with the primary producers&#39; increased cost of living, the additional cost of the machinery they have to use, and the increased rates and taxes they have to bear, make the outlook a very bad one for them. A collapse will not come  about this year; we may have a very big harvest of wheat, and be able to sell at reasonably high prices this year, but within the next two or three years honorable senators will certainly regret this increased taxation and no doubt quite unintentional persecution of the man on the land. </para>

                        <para>- I was merely pointing out that the man on the land has to work far longer hours than the coddled people in our cities, who do not know what labour is involved in the production of wheat or butter. A dairy farmer does not even have a Sunday off. A lot of the industries which the Government are , building up by means of this Tariff are tin-pot hot-house industries. We are told that this industry wants high protection, whereas those engaged in it have cheap coal, cheap iron, and comparatively cheap labour. There is no better -labourer in any industry than is the Australian. In 1918-19, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth</inline><inline font-style="italic">Year-Book,</inline> the average wage per head of the employees of the manufacturing industries of Australia was &#163;129 18s., or 17 per cent, of the cost of the manufactured article. The wages paid by the primary producers are much higher than that. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but that is the average wage paid to those employed in the manufacturing industries of Australia, whereas the wages of those employed by the man on the farm or the station are probably double, if we take into consideration the fact that farm and station employees are both housed and fed. I cannot help rubbing in these facts, because I am dead against this excessive protection,  which must increase the cost of living, penalize the&#39; primary producer, and, at the same time, over-fatten those who are already too fat: - some of the pampered manufacturing class. I know that the Minister is not pleased with what I have said, but I believe he is fair, and I hope he will agree to the request that I intend to move at the proper time, that the duty under the British preferential Tariff be reduced from 52s. to 44s. per ton. . </para>

                    <para>. - I stated on the general Tariff debate that an important factor the Senate would have to take into consideration would be the different hours and conditions of workers in various industries. I understand that a forty-four hours&#39; week is worked in the wire-drawing industry in Australia. We have to face a possible economic waste brought about by a reduction of the working period from a reasonable forty-eight hours to forty-four hours per week. An illustration of this economic waste was given to us recently in connexion with a small Commonwealth undertaking which suffered a loss of over &#163;70,000 through the reduction of the. hours of labour from forty-eight to forty-four per week. How long will a man on the land continue to be contented to work sixty hours a week in order to enable forty-four hours per week to be worked in another industry? We had more development of the out-back country during the last three or four years than we have had for many years past, and it has been brought about by our efforts to place returned soldiers on farms, but in nine cases out of ten these men have not been able to fence their properties because of the price of wire. If we adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> suggestion to reduce the . duty on British-made wire, we shall only be living up to the pledges we gave to Great Britain during the war. Our importations of wire in 1913 were as follow : - United Kingdom, 124,000 cwt..; Germany, 707,000 cwt. ; United States of America, 475,000 cwt.; and other countries, 7,000 cwt. In 1920 the figures were: - United Kingdom, 48,000 cwt.; Canada, 17,000 cwt.; United States of America, 313,000 cwt.; and Belgium, 15,000 cwt. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is merely asking for a reduction of the duty on the goods we import from Great Britain, to which country Australia owes something, and we can repay our debt to some extent by giving British goods a preference over those of other countries. It is a great mistake for honorable senators to be everlastingly painting a terrible picture of what the man on the land has to do. One would think that he has no time to sleep, no pleasure, and an unpayable occupation; whereas, as a matter of fact, a young man in &#39;Australia could have no better occupation than the working of a decent farm. Of course, there are certain things to be done in the initial stages of development, but the people in these outback districts make their own fun, and get just as much pleasure out of life as city dwellers do. I heard one senator to-day make the most astounding statement that children in country districts were not as healthy as children who live in towns. </para>

                        <para>- It is not. One can live 25 miles from a doctor and not require his services more than once a year. In the next five or six years there will be a greater demand for wire in Australia than we have known in the past, because on account of the high price of this article, and also owing- to the cost of labour, fencing improvements have been hung up. But while those who are engaged in making the wire work forty-four hours in the week, the man who puts it in his fence is obliged to work sixty hours a week. I have heard honorable senators talking about the influx of population to the city. Why should a man continue to work sixty hours % week in the country if he can get all the luxuries we hear spoken of by working forty-four hours a week&#39; in the cities? Still the &#39; man who works under reasonable conditions in the country is really better off than the one who works forty-four hours a week in a city. During the election campaign of 1919 all the Government supporters, and even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> cried out, &#34;Produoe! Produce! Produce!&#34; The Government said that every inducement possible would be given to the people to continue and extend production, but the duty on wire will not assist in achieving that result. Every farmer realizes that he must be prepared to pay for the development of secondary industries. No country can be built up unless every section is prepared to make a sacrifice, and every man who believes in Australia is prepared to give reasonable protection to assist in the development of its industries, provided he is at the same time able to get the machinery and other things he requires at a fair and reasonable price. I shall support the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> to reduce the British rate upon wire. </para>

                <para class="block">The . duty . proposed . in . the . schedule is 25 per cent. The rate I propose will also impose on the . users of the manufactured article a very heavy burden, but at . the same time it will afford ample protection to the manufacturer. The sub-item refers only to wire of No. 16 gauge or finer gauge, and under a 15 per cent.  British Tariff -a duty of &#163;5 8s. per ton would, be paid on No. 16 gauge, &#163;6 13s. on  No.. . 22 . gauge,. . &#163;910s. on No. 26 gauge, and &#163;1111s. on No. 28 gauge. The original proposal in the Tariff as &#39;suomitted in &#39; another place was for a protective duty of &#163;2 12s. per ton against  Great Britain ; &#39;so that l am not asking  for very much, particularly when the industry will&#39; be afforded, on the average, at least two and a half times more protection than the Government originally -intended it to have. The industry of wire weaving is bound up to a very great extent with our primary industries, inasmuch as the article produced is used extensively for battery screens in mines  and stripper cloth in connexion with harvesting operations. The primary producer is specially interested in the duty  on this commodity. Supposing. we insist on this very heavy duty on wire, and we -find what is predicted occurs, namely, that the manufacturers of woven wire go out of business, what will it mean? The  mining, agricultural, and many other sections of industry will have to depend for woven wire on importations of the British finished product. What then becomes of the industry at Newcastle, which is established to produce the wire for Aus-   tralian consumption? Where will be the demand for the Australian article if the finished article is imported? I am told definitely that with a Tariff like that before us, the industry here cannot be carried on effectively. In the first place,, it  puts the article up to a very high price. -I am now dealing with wire of No. 16 or finer gauge; and I think that the figures  1 have submitted show that what I propose will give the drawn wire industry heavy protection : as against Great Britain,  and twice as much protection against other countries. If I were to propose to give small protection- to the drawn-wire industry, I could not expect support, but when I propose protection to the extent of &#163;6 4s. per ton, as. against the &#34;52s. originally proposed, . honorable senators will agree that I am not doing anything to prevent the success of . this industry. in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- In Melbourne andSydney.. The allegation that the Australian wire. is. not of good quality is not borne out by the facts. Any one who has used it knows that it is made of the best material, and is equal, if not- superior, to. wire- made anywhere in the world. Is it . fair, to those men who have established an industry for the benefit of Australia,, in its. hour of need, that they should be treated as proposed. I know that Belgian iron is coming into Australia, and is being used here- to-day. I desire to move that the duties on sub-item e 2 be raised in both the- preference and genera&#93; columns by 10s. . </para>

On the 9th June, this sub-item was divided into. e1 and e2, and on 9th July, it was further altered to the form in. which it now. appears.. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has moved that the British preferential duty of 25 per cent; be reduced to 15 per cent., and-, according to the figures submitted&#34; by him, that 15&#39; per cent. . will&#39; work out . at a rate varying, -according- to the fineness&#39; of the gauge; from &#163;5 8s. to &#163;11 lis. per ton. If that is the result of&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne&#39;s</inline> proposal being accepted, it will mean that&#39; the actual duty charged&#39; on this class of wire will&#39; be very considerably higher than what was originally proposed , by the Government.

                    <para>. - Replying to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Payne</inline> has said, I admit that there are a number of small manufacturers who may feel the proposed duties, and I am. willing, therefore, to: meet the honorable senator and. the Committee half way, if they will accept the rate of 20 in place of 25 . per - cent, in the British preferential column. The object of the Tariff is to supply raw material cheaply, so that those, who are making it up into finish articles may have a. fair margin of profit. As to. the other complaint that has been voiced, we are not in a position to do anything to remedy it &#39; I should like the farmer to get cheap- fencing, but I have myself paid . <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2.</inline> a coil for wire, a price which worked out at over &#163;40 per. ton. Still, as a Protectionist, I am bound to carry out my pledges to my constituents, although the policy which, they indorsed may pinch here and there. . During the elections I heard none of the objections to the Tariff that Senators Lynch and . Guthrie have voiced in this chamber. There may be differences of opinion as. to rates, but all. the. Victorian candidates were on. the Protectionist-, ticket. Yet these senators ask for reductions, on every third. or fourth item. </para>

                        <para>- Circumstances have changed since the matter was first dealt with. We now have in Australia concerns capable of manufacturing all the wire we require, whereas formerly there were only a few manufacturers of barbed wire and the like, who were in a small way.  This country needs millions of miles of wire fencing, the making of which will become a national industry. The duty on rods, which is the raw material of the wire manufacturer, is 44s. per ton, and the margin of duty in favour of those engaged in drawing,, the wire is, therefore, 8s. Will any one say that that is too much ? . </para>

That pig iron has to be made into blooms or billets, and then drawn into rods, which are the raw material of the  wire maker.  I am not an expert, but I should say that the drawing of a ton of iron must involve considerable labour; and to recompense the manufacturers they are afforded protection to the extent of 8s. Before concluding my remarks I wish to refer briefly to an unfortunate incident in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> and myself were involved. The honorable senator made me very angry, although I am sure that he bore me no malice in speaking as he did. In the course of sixteen years&#39; experience in the Senate I can recall only one occasion on which I have been called to order; but when I am accused of leading a sporting life and of persecuting the primary producers of the country, I am bound to protest. I have not been to a picture show for two years, and I have been to the theatre only ,once in many months. Four Saturday afternoons out of five , are spent in my garden. I have met <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> upon a race-course, but I have been to only one race meeting since New Year&#39;s Day. </para>

The wire industry in this country was of a very slight character. However, Rylands are bringing out plenty of capital, and are prepared to meet demands for nearly all- classes of wire work. Australia should extend a welcome to the English manufacturers. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened with mixed feelings to this debate. The position appears scarcely to have been grasped by some honorable senators. The original proposal of the Government, made about March of last year, was for .the imposition of a British preferential duty amounting to 52s. per ton. At that time no one had an idea that the manufacture of wire in its finer processes would be shortly consummated in this country. The rate of duty was imposed in order to encourage the manufacture of fencing wire, and of  that commodity solely. After the imposition of that rate, negotiations were opened up between the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> and the well-known British firm of Rylands, which purposed the establishment of a fine wire-drawing industry in Australia. That being the state of affairs, an addition was made, in another place, to the original Tariff as proposed by the Government in order to protect the manufacture of finer drawn wires. The rate, of 52s. per ton, stands to afford reasonable protection to the manufacturers of coarse or fencing wires, while the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate of 25 per cent, was imposed to protect the finer processes of wire-drawing. Because of the establishment of that latter industry, Australia now has the satisfaction for the first time in its history of knowing that even such articles as needles, hatpins, and hairpins are being made out of Australian iron. We have a new industry established, at Newcastle which is a credit to Australia. It employs 900 men. But attempts are now being made - shall I say, vicious attempts ? - upon reputable manufacturers and on an altogether worthy industry, to reduce the duty so that there shall be a reversion to importations. I am sorry that the Minister has even agreed to a compromise. But since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> has expressed his willingness to accept 20 per cent., I presume that there is nothing further to be said. </para>

                        <para>- I am not so sure that the Committee is behind the Government with respect to the compromise. I would have preferred to force a division regarding which - in accordance with the principle that Australian development must ; come first - there would have been no doubt concerning the casting of my vote. With respect to the rate of 52s., do honorable senators realize that the raw material for fencing wire is from iron made at the Broken Hill Proprietary Company&#39;s works at Newcastle - iron turned into bars, upon which commodity there is a duty of 44s. per ton? The modest proposal of the Government is to add .only 8s. in the case of fencing wire, making the duty 52s., while the &#34; manufacturers of that wire must submit to a duty of 44s. in favour of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company&#39;s iron. Any firm actually paying nearly &#163;16 per ton for raw material from the Broken hill Proprietary Company&#39;s works, and selling fencing wire drawn from that material manufactured in Newcastle at &#163;22 per ton f.o.b. Newcastle, is not profiteering, but performing a great national service in the interests of the Commonwealth. Purchasers are paying nearly &#163;16 a ton, which may be a fair and reasonable price to be charged by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. The difference between that and the wire selling price is only &#163;6 per ton, for which they have to undertake the drawing and incur other miscellaneous and necessary charges. </para>

                        <para>- No. 16 gauge. . I am informed that that is the price today. In supporting this Tariff, I am proud to have been able to give some slight assistance to the many great key industries being established in Australia with the assistance of this Parliament. Not only Rylands, Coopers, Cadbury s, and Lysaghts have been assisted, but the development of our own industries have been greatly benefited. Notwithstanding this assistance, there are honorable senators who endeavour to pick them to pieces, and whine because of the handicaps which they allege certain duties are imposing upon the man on the land. A little later they will be the first to express their appreciation of the assistance the Government have given these industries, and the efforts they have made by means of a Protective Tariff to enable these industries to successfully prosecute their under takings. I believe in consistency, and I,  for one, desire to inform the Government that I shall tell my constituents the part the Government have played in creating  these big undertakings. One would judge,  from the remarks of some honorable senators, that Great Britain wanted us to-give  her goods a free entry into Australia; We have complete fiscal independence; but we have accepted the principle that, because we are children in our mother&#39;s house, we should give Britain preference over other nations; and rightly so, too. We are free to create whatever Tariff we may desire. Britain,. so far, has stood for Free Trade because it suits her best,  and because she has . adopted that policy  she makes no difference between the imports from any part of the world, Australia included. Britain is not asking us to&#39; give her Free Trade, and she docs not desire us to do more than we wish. In most instances we have shown her preference to the extent of 10 per cent., 15 per cent., and 20 per cent., and it is misleading - although I could apply a stronger term - to bc always speaking of giving the goods from the grand old Mother Country a free entry into Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think he does. In another place, his party colleagues spent days in endeavouring to increase the duty on the items we are now discussing by 50 per cent., but the Leader of the Opposition in this Chamber (Senator Gardiner) is endeavouring to reverse the whole position. On fencing wire, when we deduct the protection given on the raw material, there is protection equivalent to only 1 per cent. I would like to see the industry so well established that needles, pins, and hatpins and other fine wire products can be made from Australian iron. </para>

                    <para>. - I am glad to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> statement on his attitude towards the Tariff. The honorable senator uttered one remark which astonished me. He said that he could not understand my attitude, and. if such is the case, he is the only member in this Chamber who cannot. When the discussion of the Tariff was first commenced, I made it quite clear that, in my opinion, in endeavouring to protect some industries, we would be placing burdens upon others, and the discussion on this item proves that my contention is correct. The farmers in this community, the landowners and the users of wire will now find themselves interfered with by the duty which has already been placed upon the raw material. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has referred to the question of fencing wire, and I realize that the primary producer is at present responsible for much of our wealth. I know, however, that the country is developing, and when our population is six or seven times greater than it is to-day, the secondary industries will play a more important part. But if we deliberately lay ourselves out to say that the material which the primary producers must have is going to be placed beyond their reach, the position will be acute. A few years ago fencing wire was &#163;8 or &#163;10 per ton. </para>

                        <para>- I know their patriotism is very sincere-; hut I would like to put them to the test. If I was offering German wire at &#163;10 per ton, and British wire at &#163;15 per ton, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> was in the market, I know which he would purchase. Before the war wire was selling at &#163;8 and &#163;12 per ton, and &#163;10 per ton could be regarded as an average price for No.8 or No. 10 gauge. The price is now more than double that figure, and yet we are informed that this is only 8s. per ton protection. The protection that the wire manufacturers have at present is more than &#163;8 per ton. Freight is estimated at 25 per cent., and if wire is being sold at &#163;32 per ton, there is considerably over &#163;5 protection in freight alone. </para>

                        <para>- Unless the 16 gauge was used, in making barbed wire, I do not know where it could be used. No. 8 and 10 gauge is used for fencing purposes, but No. 12 may be used in some cases. I will accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> statement that No. 8 wire is being sold for &#163;22 per ton. That is more than double the pre-war -price, and it cannot be said that the cost of production has doubled. The argument has been used that the industries producing the raw material will charge higher prices, and this argument merely convinces me of the soundness of my position when I assert that, if it is to be applied all round, protection is impossible. What is the use of speaking of 8s. per ton on wire as protection if the persons who are protected to that extent must&#39; pay the increased charges, on all the articles which they use, and which are the product of other protected industries? The whole business- from beginning to end is so stupidly impossible that none but Protectionists could be found to support it. When industries have developed&#39; under Free Trade, as the iron industry did, it is claimed that their development, has been due to the imposition of Customs duties. The wire industry grew up without a duty, but as soon as it becomes established, some one with a personal interest in the business brings his interest under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs, of the Government, or the party, and duties are imposed for his benefit. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> has reminded me that the members of my own party follow the same course, and I have candidly acknowledged that on this matter I am right out of - step with the members of the party to which I belong. But, because I do not agree with every detail favoured by the majority of the members of the party, is it to be assumed- that I am not at liberty to express the opinion I have formed from the experience of a lifetime that what they are attempting is impossible? I was very pleased to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s interjection when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> was speaking, suggesting that the honorable senator&#39;s determination to cut out imports of wire from Great Britain savoured of fiscal Sinn Feinism. Judging by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> attitude to the centre of the Empire, I must regard him as-- a fiscal Sinn Feiner. He is out to destroy the Empire so. far as interference with the&#39;free interchange of commodities with Great Britain may tend to do so. The honorable senator will not permit the indulgence of a sentiment in favour of trading with Great Britain. We &#34;have in the schedule now under consideration provision for the imposition of duties in the intermediate column to enable us to trade with New Zealand and Canada when those Dominions are ready to come into line and make similar concessions in respect of Australian goods sent to them. Here we have Great Britain admitting our- goods without charge or demand, and yet we set up a Tariff against imports from Great Britain, though they may be the very things which our primary producers most require. Wire-netting is a continual need of every man on the land. There is no progressive farmer in Australia who is not continually adding to his &#34;fencing. These duties will represent a continual drain upon the progressive farmer, because they will add to the cost of his fencing. When Australian manufacturers can- obtain No.8 wire for &#163;22 per ton, and, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> &#163;32 per ton for the finer wire, I fail to understand why it should be necessary to impose any duties on the British product. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> stated that Great Britain did not ask us for Free Trade. That is so. She looks after her own business, and trusts that we will look after ours. But I do not see that there is any occasion when we are considering a Tariff to&#39; declare fiscal war against Great Britain, especially when by doing so we are punishing our own people. A duty of 52s. per ton on wire may not be regarded as a serious impost, but it means that if a British manufacturer is prepared to supply an Australian farmer with wire, and the farmer wants the British product, he must pay a fine of &#163;2 12s. per ton for the right to use it.  I think the whole Empire should be bound together, and what stronger binding material could we have than fencing wire? Fencing wire might be an excellent means for linking the various parts of the Empire together. There is no Empire sentiment  displayed by traders in the community. I commend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> for agreeing to the. compromise proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> and accepting a reduction of 5 per cent, on- the smaller wires. Why should not the hon7orable senator agree to the proposed reduction of Ss. per ton on the British product? In view of the spirit of compromise and the sweet reasonableness which the Minister has exhibited in agreeing to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne&#39;s</inline> proposal, he might very well agree to a duty of 44s. per ton on the British product, instead of the 52s. per ton proposed. He should bear in mind that the reduction would mean an advantage of 8s. per ton to pastoralists and land-holders generally throughout Australia on an article which they continually need. They have petitioned the Senate in con&#39;nexion with this matter, and I believe that many members of the Committee are sufficiently interested in the owners of land and the workers on land to listen to that petition. The Minister might meet the request of the primary producers, to whom we can give no protection under the Tariff, because their products must be sold in the markets of the world. I appeal to the honorable senator to accept a duty of 44s. per ton on British imports of this article in lieu of the proposed duty of 52s. per ton. He should realize that the primary producer needs protection as well as the secondary producer. </para>

                    <para>. - I really do not know where I stand in this matter, and that is easily explained by the course which our Tariff legislation has taken up to date. On. looking at the price-list of various commodities I find that bar iron, the raw material from, which wire is made, costs &#163;32 per ton. That is according to the <inline font-style="italic">Industrial Australian &#39;and Mining Standard</inline> of this month. I find in the same list that No. 10 gauge wire is quoted at the same price. There must be something wrong with these figures! <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .</inline> Pratten said that No. 8 gauge wire costs &#163;16 per ton, but according to the pricelist before me it costs &#163;26 10s. per ton. </para>

                        <para>- According to the list before me, the price is &#163;26 per ton. If the raw material of the wire industry is at such a high price as that I have quoted, even the&#39; proposal of the Government is hopelessly inadequate for the protection of the industry. I know that wire netting costs the price quoted for it, because I paid that price for it myself months ago. The duty imposed on the raw material of these manufactures will&#34; have to be added to- the burden of those on the countryside who must use the manufactured article, those for whom we have heard so many pleas put forward to-night. At the outset of this Tariff debate I took up the position that I would be prepared to give every industry a fair chance to succeed, provided, of course, that those engaged in it put forward their very best efforts. My policy is to give every one a fair start,, and to encourage them to get a move on,, and if they do not, to withdraw the help given. In this case, it is conceivable that the duty will particularly benefit those associated with the big Newcastle Works.. The small man, in whose behalf the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> spoke to-night, will have very little chance of starting operations, because he will be obliged to go to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company  for this raw material, and then market it in competition with the company itself. In the management of businesses of this description, the multiplication of a given set of processes under one control must result in a reduction of overhead charges. Therefore, the only effect of this duty will be to give still greater protection to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, with no corresponding benefit, so far as the creation of new industries is concerned, to the people of the Commonwealth. If, for instance, a man with a capital of &#163;5,000 wished to commence business in the manufacture of wire netting, he would have to buy his blooms, his rod iron, and all the other material from the Newcastle works. How, then, could he sell his product in competition with that great industrial concern, which is specially designed to keep down the cost of production? He would have no hope in the world. If this much is conceded - and I do not see how honorable senators can think otherwise - the prospect of establishing new industries is exceedingly remote unless, of course, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> can tell us that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company are going out of this particular branch of their business, and that is not at all probable. Would any honorable senator put &#163;10,000 into a venture of this description in these circumstances? It is plain, I think, that the only effect of the duty will be to enable &#39; the Broken Hill Proprietary Company to make still greater profits and crush out the small man. &#39; </para>

                        <para>- If any manufacturer can engage in the fine wire-weaving, industry, he can also handle the medium sized wire. There is no essential difference between No. 16 and No. 10 wire. I have no desire to discount the value of the industry at Newcastle, or to qualify in any way the commendation I have already placed on record concerning that great industrial enterprise. But with regard to this sub-item, we have to think of the probable effect of the duty. We must recognise that if the Broken Hill Proprietary Company remain in the field the small manufacturer will not have the ghost of a chance of succeeding. Everything will depend upon how they are going to behave. Are they going to tread the path of the monopolists? I am afraid they . are, because I have perused a copy of a certain document which sets out that if manufacturers desire to be supplied with raw material at a certain price they must buy exclusively from that&#34; concern. This statement was made in the House of Representatives, and it was denied; but I saw the document, or, at all events, a copy of it, and it now remains for the Broken Hill Proprietary Company to contradict my statement. Is not this the beginning of the nefarious practices of those Trusts which are the curse of the United States of America under a high Protectionist policy? This brings me to another point. If there is one thing in the world that would make me take this stand, it is the facility with which men change their opinions when they find themselves in different circumstances. How did the Broken Hill Proprietary Company make its money? In the first instance, it was a struggling mining proposition. It is quite true that Dame Fortune smiled beneficently on its operations. It progressed and made huge profits. Since then it has changed its occupation, and instead of being engaged in the mining of silver, it is largely concerned in the mining of iron ore from Iron Knob, in South Australia, and in the manufacture of material required for all the great iron and steel industries of the Commonwealth. If we could get the collective opinion of those associated with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, when it was a struggling concern, I think they would look more favorably and sympathetically on their sister industries in the industrial field than they do to-day. They have changed their nature, and from being operators in metalliferous mining they have, as disclosed by the last balance-sheet, made a clear profit of &#163;500,000 in their; new &#34;venture. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company, as I have -said, have changed their occupation, and evidently their, sympathies have changed accordingly. Hence the necessity for us to. tell them, plainly that they are not going to tread, the well-beaten, and recognised track of huge combinations in- America. We must tell: . them plainly that they will not be allowed to do that in Australia if the Government of the day is worth it3 salt, and is able to prevent them from doing, so. We have a chance in. this case , to prevent such being done. We already have done very well for them. We have piled on duty after, duty; for. which they did not ask. until lately. We have given them a big duty on pig iron, and. here we have a further proposal to give them, a duty on wire, which is made under the same roof as is the- pig iron produced from our iron ore. I invite, honorable- senators to consider for a moment the invidious position that is to be created. The Minister proposes to grant a concession to the manufacturers of. small-gauge wire; that will help the mattress makers and the wire weavers in. many of our cities. But he refuses to grant any such concession in respect of the larger grades of wire, the purchasers of. which are just as- much entitled to consideration as are the small manufacturers of the metropolis. Such wire. is purchased by the man outback, concerning whose lot every word spoken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is the absolute truth.. The. importance of the wheat industry of Aust tralia cannot be too often emphasized, Some time.. ago I. asked the Governmentfor information regarding the wheat industry, and they commissioned- the Government (Statistician to supply me with it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> will remember that I was supplied with&#39; nearly 100 pages of information concerning, various tin-pot industries in this country ; but. with only three pages relating, to the- great wheatsrowing industry. That was all the information they could give me under the various headings in respect of which I had asked- for particulars about the wheat industry, as compared with nearly 100- pages of matter relating to other industries. This is but another illustration of the interest shown in the small secondary industries compared with the huge wheat-growing industry of Australia and the people engaged in it, who observe the most commendable silence in regard to their burdens and afflictions. We are rapidly: approaching a time when people will pause before they decide to go into; the wheat-growing areas. That fact is shown in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Y ear-Book.</inline></para>

                        <para>- No, it is rather late ; and if. I were to set out once more to&#39; speak for the man on the land, I should certainly be able, with- the assistance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Guthrie,</inline> who are equally well posted; on: the subject,, to keep the Committee going until the early hours of the morning. I am not going, to accept the challenge : of the Leader , of. the- Senate to-&#39; tell- all I: know regarding, the lot of the- unfortunate man on. the land, and. the- effect which this wretched Tariff will have on him.. I confess* that I am rather interested in this question of fencing wire. I am, to a certain extent, a property owner, and my personal experience with regard to the purchase of wire since the war has not been a very happy one. Let me tell of one incident which occurred during my absence on active service, and. which serves to illustrate the gratitude of some people, at all events, to those who . do their duty to their country. I have a . small property in Western Australia, and. shortly before the war had. spent something like &#163;2,000 on fencing, wire for it. I decided when I went on active service that, if I left the fences, where they stood, they would still be there when I came back. I made amis- take. While I was . away, fencing wire became scarce and expensive, and when I returned I found hardly a yard of the &#163;2,000 worth of fencing wire that I had put on my property. I still owned the property, and, as I wanted to do something with it, I began to inquire the price of wire to replace . that which I had lost. And whereas before the war it had cost me about &#163;16 per ton . to purchase the wire and have it &#39;delivered on . my property, which was some way . out, . I found that . it would cost me . &#163;65 per ton in Perth beforeIstarted to shift it. . That was my experience . on my &#39;return from active service. With respect to portion of this land, I have done what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has done with some of his property - I have got rid of it, and have left it to some other &#34; mug &#34; to pay the enormous prices involved in fencing the property in order to bring it into use. &#39;The wire which I bought in Perth before the &#34;war cost me about &#163;12 per ton there, whereas in 1920the price was &#163;65 per ton, I believe that in Perth to-day it is about &#163;40 per ton. Western Australia, from an agricultural point of view, is less developed than any other State, and it is in the interests of Australia that it should bo developed. It is impossible, however, to develop it, having regard to the absurd prices that we have to pay for all commodities - tools of trade, fencing wire, machinery, and everything else required by the man on the land to-day. The State which I have the honour to assist in representing is a very considerable producer of wheat, and it is a conservative estimate that it will produce at least 100,000,000 bushels of wheat per annum. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and that, I am assured, is a very conservative estimate. Western Australia is not yet producing, anything like that quantity, and unless the encouragement given to the man on the land is greater than that which has been given up to date - unless we alter this Tariff very considerably - that estimate will never be realized. I am sure that the prophecies of Senator Guthrie with regard to what is going to happen to those on the land within the next two or three years are well founded. Instead of encouraging the use of our vacant land, we are making it more difficult. We pay attention to our secondary industries, . and sacrifice our primary industries. -There is a great deal . of tails . about key industries, which are said . to be . absolutely essential if we are to make this country great. Is it not much more-necessary -to get people into the Common-wealth if we are to retain it? . </para>

                        <para>- Not principally, only partly. It was the last straw that broke the camel&#39;s back. Why should we apply the last straw by loading our primary industries with that little extra burden which makes it impossible for them to carry on? It is said that we cannot possibly reduce the duty on this item, because we have already fixed the duty on the raw material at 44s. It is to be regretted that we were so foolish as to agree to that rate of duty, but because we have made a mistake already, are &#34;we to make another mistake now? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> request is exceedingly moderate. I would &#39;have supported a reduction to30s., or even a proposal to wipe out the duty altogether. </para>

                        <para>- If the Government&#39;s policy were sustained by the people who ought to be behind it to-day, there would have been no Country party in existence in Australia. That party has come into this Parliament to oppose the Protective policy of the Government as being against the interests of the country people. Although the area under wheat in the Commonwealth was 12,484,512 acres in 1915-16, it dwindled to half that acreage last year. In 1910-11 the acreage was 7,372,456 acres. The outstanding feature of these figures is the fact that our wheat production is behind what it was eleven years ago. I am told that wheat-growers are turning their attention to other pursuits, because they find wheat-growing unpayable. This is certainly the case with those who paid high prices for land in the drier areas of New South Wales and Western Australia. In the latter State, some men have had such a discouraging time at wheat-growing that there are hundreds of farms now in the hands of the State Agricultural Bank, because their owners have walked&#39; off them, not having sufficient resources to work them under the conditions obtaining during the last few years. That is the condition of the industry that is one of the principal buyers of wire. </para>

                        <para>- There are different opinions as to that. Under the same weather conditions, wheat is grown in the Mallee land of Victoria, and in Western Australia. There is a 12-inch rainfall in both places. But the farmers in the Mallee country do not work forty-four hours a week. The result of this Tariff must be that the wheat-growers will be crushed by the excessive cost of their equipment and other requirements, and at the same time wheat, on which we mainly rely, will fall in value. It may be said that the wheat-growers could go in for dairying, but as a fact, there are fewer dairy cows in Australia now than there* were in 1914, the figures for that year being 1,900,000, as against 1,902,000 for 1920. Then there is sheep raising, which requires so&#39; much wire netting and wire; but in that industry the highest number of sheep was reached in 1890, when there were 97,000,000. Droughts followed, with alternating seasons, and in 1910 the number was 92,000,000, whereas last year it was only 87,000,000.&#34; It will be seen that dairying and sheep raising have been keeping pace in their decline with -wheat growing. These great indus-  tries are .certainly not in a good way, and now action is being taken by means of this Tariff which will make their conditions still worse. It is &#39;becoming more difficult than ever for men on the land to make ends meet, and this at a time when we are so desirous for men to go out into the country, and make prosperous homes for themselves. I support the proposed reduction on the ground that, otherwise, we are simply giving an extra duty to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company for turning out wire, and that there will not be the least chance of founding the small subsidiary industries spoken of by the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- The statement te which I ret er is not correct; the wire is made by an entirely different company, the rods being turned out by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. The only protection given to the  wire maker  is 8s. per ton. If the maker of bar iron is deserving of protection, to the extent of 44s*. , we ought, in justice, to increase rather than diminish the protection given to the  wire maker.  It is all very well to say that a mistake&#39; was made in the beginning ;  that only shows that honorable senators are not seized with the position as it is to-day. When speaking previously, I said that &#163;4,000 had practically been lost to Australia in connexion with the wire industry,. I then referred to wire that is coming from England, and I wish to correct my statement; I ought to have spoken of 4,000 tons.. It will be seen that, even with our present Tariff, this trade is going away from Australia. This is an infant industry, and before the infant is out of the cradle it is proposed to knock it on the head. At the instigation of Australia, this company undertook the work of producing this commodity; but while we protect others we protect the wire maker only to the extent of 8s. per ton, as against 44s. in the case of the producer of bar iron. This means, of course, that we shall have to depend on other countries for our supplies. </para>

One of these works is situated at Guildford, Western Australia; the other is in New South Wales. When they begin to produce, articles of the calibre mentioned by the honorable senator, duty will be imposed by the prescription of departmental by-laws. Meanwhile, these special lines will continue to be duty free. That is fair, and in .the best interests of Australia. If the manufacturers can turn out these high-grade products with commercial satisfaction and success, protection will be afforded. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> said just now that he was not prepared to accept a Ministerial assurance, and I take it that he means he would like an assurance approved by-Parliament. I may point out that there is a difficulty in setting out his intention in the form he desires. I have already assured him that these articles will be admitted free until they are produced in Australia. It is not possible for Parliament legislating to-day to say when that day will be, and it is therefore left to departmental by-laws to determine when the duties shall become operative. I can only give the definite assurance in the clearest language of whichIam the master that it&#39; is the intention of the Minister and the Department to see that the articles made here are of the requisite quality, and in the necessary quantity to meet our requirements, and that not until then will the duties be imposed.  I  give that assurance to. the Committee without the slightest reservation, and it is for the Committee to decide whether it shall he accepted or not. I think the Committee, and even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> will see that I have gone as far as is humanly possible, and I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will not press the matter further. </para>

The only reason&#39; I had fox asserting that I purchased from the Broken Hill Proprietary Company was that my agent in Sydney said that he had purchased the material from the Newcastle Company, In the circumstances I regret having made the statement, but at the same time I would like to see the share register of the Rylands Wire Company in Newcastle to ascertain the names of the shareholders.
