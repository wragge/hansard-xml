                    <para class="block">I desire to address myself to the question of the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. M.</inline> L. Shepherd as Australia&#39;s representative at the forthcoming League of Nations Conference. The cabled intimation of that appointment, I venture to assert, has caused more surprise, not to say consternation, throughout Australia than has anything else that has been done by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> during his absence; abroad. I could say personal things concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd,</inline> but I do not propose to do so. The question is not as to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd</inline> or his capacity, but whether in making this appointment consideration has been given to the standing and position of the people of Australia and the importance of the League of Nations. Measured by those two tests the appointment falls far short of what Australia might reasonably demand. It may be that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> busy man that he is, had not taken into consideration the fact that the time was approaching when it would be necessary to make a selection, and that&#39; it was only at the last moment that he appointed as our representative the secretary to the High Commissioner in London. That appointment, I think, is a slap in the face for all those men in Australia who, by reason of their experience and proved public capacity, their ability and willingness to represent the Commonwealth at such a gathering, ought not to have been overlooked. It may be said that it was made by the Prime Minister himself, and that the Government cannot be held responsible for. what he does. </para>

                            <para>- The records of Hansard will show what the honorable senator did say. If he did not make that statement he, at all events, conveyed to my mind the impression that the first intimation received by the Government as to this appointment was by way of a cable message from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd</inline> had been selected. I am of the opinion that the Prime Minister is not favorably disposed towards the League of Nations. Statements contained in public utterances made by him from time to time suggest that he does not appreciate how immensely important it would be, not only to Australia, but to civilization generally, to have a League of Nations which could effectively look after the world&#39;s affairs and possibly preserve the peace of the world. The right honorable gentleman, supported as he has been during his term of office, by a weak Cabinet, and a weaker following in Parliament, has placed himself on a pedestal, and imagines that he is the sole governing authority of Australia. I remember reading some time ago a severe criticism of the action of the then  President  of the </para>

                    <para class="block">United States of America, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Woodrow</inline> Wilson, in electing to attend the Peace Conference, the view being expressed that he should have deputed his secretary to do so, and that as the supreme authority of the United States he should have taken up a position equal to that occupied by  His  Majesty the King. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> seems to consider that he is the sole constitutional governing authority in Australia. Secure in his position as lawmaker and law-giver of the Commonwealth , he has not even deigned to appoint his own secretary, but has selected the secretary of another Department to represent Australia at the Conference. I am not going to mention the names of any of those who might fitly have been chosen for this position. If the office of High Commissioner had been filled the gentleman holding that office might well have represented us. He would have been selected by the Government, and approved by the Parliament, to represent Australia as its ambassador in London, and would have been a fitting representative at such a gathering as this. When I asked the Leader of the Senate, on Tuesday, whether there was not some messenger or office boy who could have been chosen instead of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd,</inline> I anticipated the reason which the Prime Minister would give for the selection he had made. My anticipations have proved correct. In this morning&#39;s newspapers there appears a cabled report of a statement by the Prime Minister that the financial position of! Australia is such that we could not bear the cost of sending to the Conference a man who would fittingly represent us. What an advertisement for Australia it is to say that the cost of sending some one possessing the capacity and attainments necessary for such an appointment would have been a matter of grave financial concern to us. That fairly represents the attitude taken up by the Prime Minister throughout his visit to the Old Country. While he has risen occasionally to high flights of oratory in dealing&#39; with the importance and power of the Commonwealth, we find him sinking again to the level of the man who has no confidence in Australia, and no belief in what he says about it. This latest action on his part is the lowest depth to which he has sunk as a public man. </para>

I said when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen left Australia - they were not mere words - that his public record and political associations and his knowledge of the affairs of the Commonwealth for many years, made him eminently fitted for the duties involved in connexion with -such an important task. Some honorable senators, have had association with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd</inline> in his public capacity. I am not going to debate or discuss the opinions which have been formed concerning him. They  remain altogether apart from the grave importance of Australia&#39;s representation at a Conference of this character by a. gentleman holding the position such, as that at present occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd.</inline> If he was a man of outstanding ability, or one possessing qualifications: that were generally known, I venture I to say that strenuous opposition would not have been shown. Public opinion  is highly incensed over the appointment, and, as Walter Bagehot said, &#34; Public opinion is the opinion of a bald headed man <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the back of an omnibus.&#34; If we measure this appointment by public opinion, it can safely be said that it has already been condemned from one end of Australia to the other. It is the main topic of conversation in clubs, trains, trams, and in the street. I very seriously appeal to the Government, even at this late hour} to undo the wrong that has been  done!  to Australia by calling a Cabinet meeting, and, after discussing the matter, informing the Prime Minister that the &#39;appointment does not meet with the | approval of the Government or the people of Australia. It would be better for Australia not to have a delegate than to be represented in this manner. The Prime Minister made reference to the cost of the appointment; but he must have been aware of the expenditure to be involved before he left for Australia. What was to prevent the Prime Minister himself representing the Commonwealth at the forthcoming Conference? </para>

                            <para>- On the last occasion Australia selected a worthy delegate who went with the unanimous support of the Australian people. But here we have a delegate who is totally inexperienced, altogether unqualified for so important a task, and the unanimity of opinion is as much against the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd</inline> as it was in favour of the selection of the Minister for Repatriation. I have submitted this motion to give honorable senators an opportunity of voicing their opinions, because the occasion calls for the expression of our indignation at Australia being so belittled in the eyes of the world. Other nations are anxious that Australia should have a fitting representative so that our relations with foreign countries can be discussed in such a way that the dignity of the Commonwealth may be maintained. The people of Australia demand the selection of some one capable of adequately representing Australia at the Conference of the League of Nations. </para>

No one could listen to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> without realizing that he was not seeking to defend the reputation or standing of Australia as a member of the League of Nations, but was endeavouring to make a bitter and vitriolic attack upon the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> When a question was asked regarding this appointment I gave a reply which possibly did create the impression that the Prime Minister himself had made this appointment. Nothing could be further from the facts. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet exchanged cablegrams regarding this appointment, . in the fullest sense of the word, and, whether the selection is a wise one or not, the appointment must be accepted as having been made by Cabinet after consultations between the Prime Minister and his Government here. </para>

That clears the Prime Minister from any responsibility of not consulting with his colleagues. </para>

I wish it, from the bottom of my heart, the success which I doubt if it can attain. It will be in the minds of honorable1 senators that between the last meeting of the Assembly and the meeting which is now under consideration, there has been a shortening of the period of notice. The present meeting is not being held twelve months after the last, but only about nine months, owing to the fact that, although at the last meeting, it was determined to hold the succeeding one in November, it is being held in September. </para>

If it were merely a matter of sending a delegate from here to Sydney, the position would be quite different. In view of the considerable lapse of time involved Sn despatching some one from Australia to the Conference, there was an obligation upon the Government to see whether the business to be transacted was of such a character as to justify the adoption of that course. Do honorable senators know what is contained in the agenda paper of this Conference ? </para>

Committee to report upon the credentials of representatives, a purely formal procedure; the election of a  President  to preside over the meeting of the Assembly; the examination and adoption of agenda; and the nomination of the Committees. The Conference divides its work amongst Committees, in accordance with a system well known in other countries, though not adopted here. Of the remaining twenty-one items of the agenda paper, I think there are only two which refer to matters other than the reception of reports from Committees appointed by the last Assembly to deal with the various questions to which the reports refer. </para>

Allowing time for the transport of communications, and for meetings of the Council, and the preparation in report form of any comments which the Council chose to .make, it  would  have been at least the 20th June before these matters were available for distribution to the various nations of the world that are members of the League.  Such  reports could not have reached here at i the earliest before the end of July, and, as a matter of fact, they have not yet been received. In the circumstances it &#39;will be seen that it would have been impossible for Australia to send back any comment which the Government of this country, in their turn, desired to make. </para>

                <para class="block">It may be said that this last is a very important matter. It is, in a sense ; but it is purely formal, because the ratifications were sent out to the several members of the League, and, without exception, have been returned. Therefore, the report will be merely a bald statement that such-and-such members of the League have done this. It will be merely a formal record. And so it is with so many other matters on the agenda. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has asked me to indicate what other business, apart from reports from the various Committees, will come up for consideration. The agenda -paper contains this business: - </para>
                <para>The request of Bolivia, dated 1st November, and 15th December, 1920, for the inclusion in the agenda of the 1921 session of the Assembly of the Bolivian demand for the application of article 19 of the covenant to the Treaty of Peace signed between Bolivia and Chile on 20th October, 1904. Chile, in letters dated 17th, 19th, and 28th December, 1920, has requested that notification should be made of her opposition, by moving the &#34; previous question,&#34; to the proposal of Bolivia to include this item in the agenda of the Assembly. </para>
                <para class="block">Another matter is the appointment of the non-permanent members of the Council. At the last meeting of the Assembly, nonpermanent members were appointed for twelve months, and four others will have to be appointed now. The only point which remained unsettled at the last meeting of the Assembly was as to whether there should be a geographical selection or not. This matter was left open, and whilst the Assembly declined to accept a definite proposition to that effect, acting in the spirit of that gathering, it has elected China, a non European country, as a member of the Council. Another item on the agenda paper is consideration of the Budget for 1922, together with the audited accounts for the second fiscal period, and the adoption of the report. </para>

                            <para>- I do not ; but I want honorable senators to take a larger view of the position. At the last Assembly the distribution of costs was considered, and, to the best of my ability, I made  a  strong protest against Australia being called upon to pay the same proportion as the great Powers of the world, as much, for instance, as Great Britain and France, and,&#39; as much as  the  United States of America would have paid if she had remained a member of the League. This arrangement was due to the fact that, owing to the short time at the disposal  of delegates  when drafting the covenant  at  Paris or Versailles, it was decided that the  I  expenditure should be distributed among the Nation members on the same basis as the costs of the Postal Union. But the total expenditure of the Postal Union is about &#163;5,000 per year, and, therefore, the distribution of the cost  is  not so important to the countries  that  are in the Union. The Australian representatives at the gathering which determined the question of, distributing the costs of the Postal Union, no doubt with some pride, took the view that as this was a country of great distances we were entitled to be regarded as a first class Power. Therefore, we were placed in the first category, and pay first class costs. As I have already shown, that did  not  matter very much when dealing with  an  expenditure of &#163;5,000, spread over  all  the members of the Postal Union,  but  when we apply that system to the League of Nations, the Budget of which now  exceeds  &#163;1,000,000, and, in my opinion, it will not be long before it reaches &#163;2,000,000, it becomes a matter  of  supreme importance to Australia. Speaking from memory, I think Australia&#39;s share of the liability is now in  the  neighbourhood of &#163;60,000 per year. </para>

                            <para>- At the last meeting of the Assembly I put the Australian position, and pointed out how manifestly unfair it was that a country like Holland, with 8,000,000 of people, and Brazil, with a population of 30,000,000, should be paying infinitely less than Australia. With the active assistance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balfour,</inline> the British representative at the last meeting of the Assembly, I did my best, and, I venture to say, not unsuccessfully, in getting the Assembly to recognise the unfairness of the present system. But it was not possible to secure a definite decision-, because, with a number of large Powers benefiting by the existing arrangement, it is not difficult to imagine the facility with which objections could be raised to any alternative suggestion. The Assembly, recognising the unfairness of the present system, appointed a Committee with instructions to prepare a new scheme, certain indications being given as to the lines it should follow,  for presentation at the forthcoming meeting. </para>

                            <para>- It is important. The Assembly, as I have said, not only admitted the injustice of the present scheme, but it went further, and I. think I may say that my action was a factor in bringing about that result. It agreed that if it were found that any member of the League was paying, under the present system, more than it should pay, it would pay so much less in future years under the new scheme in order to re-adjust the position that had been created. It is important, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has indicated, that the Assembly has adopted this principle. The only matters for consideration now are the de tails of the organization necessary to give effect to it. . </para>

                            <para>- But seeing that the Assembly has adopted the principle and agreed to the lines which the new scheme should follow, they are not as important as the honorable senator believes. Matters of procedure, and possibly an examination of the figures presented, will certainly not be big subjects for consideration. Therefore, no one can say that those who attend this Assembly will be engaged upon a high mission, or that the details of the new scheme will be a very vital matter. At the most Australia may be called upon to pay a few thousand pounds more under one scheme than under another. The main factor is that the principle has already been admitted that in future the cost should be distributed, not in an arbitrary way, but with some regard to the trade and importance of the various members of the League. In fact, this matter could have been dealt with outside the League altogether. </para>

                            <para>-At any rate he is not now a member of the diplomatic service. It may please honorable senators to make out that he is an outstanding figure in the Empire, but with all due respect to him, and with every desire to handle his name lightly, it is not one that would occur to the minds of honorable senators as being that of a man whom Great Britain would choose to represent it at the Assembly of the League of Nations if it desired to be represented by one of its leading men. It is clear that the British Government are sending this ex-official rather than a member of the Cabinet because they take the view which we take, namely, that the matters to be discussed will not be of sufficient importance to justify the action they took on previous occasions in being represented by leading members of the Cabinet. South, Africa is sending its High Commissioner. It is also true that the Union Government has appointed Lord Robert Cecil, but I would hesitate to say that his appointment is due to his knowledge of South African affairs or sentiment. He has been appointed because, like General Smuts&#39;, he has been a great advocate of the League of Nations. General Smuts, because&#39; of his great interest in this body, and his desire to see that some one should be in attendance who, in a sense, has been a sponsor for the League, has appointed Lord Robert Cecil as one of South Africa&#39;s representatives, although the interests and sentiment of the Union will actually be represented by its High Commissioner. Lord Robert Cecil owes his position entirely to the attitude he has taken up towards the League. So far as I know, Canada has not yet announced the name of its representative, but it is only a week away from Geneva. </para>

                        <para>. - I was hoping that some other honorable senator would continue the debate. Although I cannot agree with all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said, I think we are indebted to him for submitting this motion, if only for the reason that it has enabled us to hear the speech just delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen. Personally, I am strongly in favour of the maintenance of the League of Nations. There is, however, an impression amongst a number of people in Australia that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is not too keen on the idea. And even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen, whose good work at Geneva we&#39; all recognise, appears to me to have come back, perhaps, a little disappointed as to what the League may find it possible to do in the future. In my opinion, we in Australia ought to do everything we can to assist the League in the work for which it has been created; indeed, I regard it as our great hope for the future. It may be that it will not dp all that is expected or desired; but another war is a prospect so awful that, as I have said, we ought to render the League every possible assistance in order to avert such a calamity. We might imagine, from what we hear, that very little will be done at the forthcoming Conference, but after the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen to-day, it seems to me that business of great importance will come up for discussion. I quite realize that unless the Australian Government have definite knowledge of the reports to which reference has been made this morning, it will not be possible to give definite instructions to the Australian representative as to how he ought to vote. I feel very strongly that our representative must be an Australian, acting on instructions received from here, and the non-receipt of the reports render the position very difficult. I do not say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd</inline> may not be able to do what there is to be done. He is probably a very able and distinguished civil servant, who has done good work along certain lines; at least, I suppose that is so, or he would not be in ids present position. At the same time, I think we ought to have some one at the Conference to present the case for Australia in the best way possible. What might be regarded as one of the minor matters -to be considered is the cost of carrying on the League. And <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> E. D. Millen admits that this may mean for Australia some thousands a year. In my opinion, this is a matter of some importance, and it is worth while spending, perhaps, a thousand or two more in order to insure our proper representation. Under the circumstances, I do not urge that a Minister of the Crown should go, though if there bad been any suggestion to that effect I should probably have raised no opposition. All things considered, it may be just as well that a Minister was not selected; but without mentioning names, there are other Australians, whose appointment might have given more general satisfaction. For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs is, I believe, at the present time in London. I do not know whether that gentleman would have been prepared to undertake such a mission. </para>

                        <para>. -  I look on the League of Nations not only as the hope of Australia, but as the hope of mankind. If we desire to do away with war, the League represents our only possible chance. We all deplore that the United States of America has not come into the fold, though we can understand her reasons for holding aloof. As has been said, we ought to help the League of Nations by all the means in our power; and the question is whether an appointment like that  of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd</inline> will assist us to that end. In my opinion, it will not. I do not wish, to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd</inline> is not an admirable man in the position he now occupies, but he is very young, and was appointed to the position of secretary to the High &#39;Commissioner only very recently. Altogether, he does not appear to me to be a person sufficiently well known to represent Australia on such an occasion; he cannot possibly command the respect and attention which would have been accorded to others who might have been selected. Two or three names occur <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> me, including that of the ex-Go&#39;Vernor-General, Lord Novar. His would have been a most excellent appointment, and other names have been mentioned, though I do not care to further refer to them. The South African Government apparently had no South African available, and they appointed various British statesmen. </para>

                            <para>- This shows that the South African Government wish to assist and encourage the League in every possible way. I am afraid that the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd</inline> will be regarded as a slur on the League. It will be taken that the Australian Government considered it hardly worth while sending anybody, and so selected a civil servant, with no parliamentary experience, a young man who is just winning his spurs. It is a deplorable state of affairs. Australia is, perhaps, more exposed to future war than any other part of the world ; we are an isolated handful of people, far distant from any nation which might protect us, and, as I said at the beginning, the only hope, not only for Australia, but for mankind, is to make the League of Nations a success. </para>

                        <para>. -  I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> on affording us this opportunity to discuss the representation of Australia at the forthcoming Conference. During the last two or three weeks, on more than one occasion I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen questions regarding our representation; but on two of these occasions I was unable to get any definite information further than that the matter was being considered. When I was in Tasmania a few days ago, however, I saw an intimation in the press, at the end of last week, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd</inline> had been appointed. To say that nobody was more astonished than myself would be incorrect, because each one who has since discussed the matter with me I have found to be more astonished than the last. This week <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen, in reply to a further question by me confirmed what had appeared in the press, and, whether the honorable gentleman intended it or not, I think he distinctly conveyed the impression to the Senate that the responsibility for the appointment rested on the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> That that was the impression conveyed to the public by the press report of the Minister&#39;s reply, I am abundantly certain. I know that is the attitude of a number of people &#34; outside,&#34; rightly or wrongly, in regard to the whole matter. More than one has said to me,&#39; &#34; This appointment will cause trouble. I would not be surprised to see some resignations from Ministers who will dissociate themselves from it.&#34; The impression has been conveyed that the appointment was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and afterwards notified to his colleagues.  Honorable senators have been informed to-day, however, that before the Prime Minister finally appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd</inline> he indicated his selection to his colleagues in Australia, and that they fully share responsibility for it. </para>

                    <para>I shall not enter into the qualifications  or otherwise of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd</inline> for appointment to this representative position; but I agree with other honorable senators who have already spoken that if we have any hope and confidence in the League of Nations, and in the outcome of its existence, it becomes our bounden duty to do all that may be possible to uphold and maintain  its  dignity and prestige. In taking the course of appointing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd</inline> to represent Australia on this occasion - meagre though the agenda paper may be - I do not) think that the Government fere insuring the maintenance of such dignity and prestige. There have been opportunities to provide for the representation of Australia at the meeting of the League in a manner which would have secured much more dignity, skill, and prestige. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E.D. Millen),</inline> referring to the scantiness of the agenda paper, mentioned one or two specific items. The honorable senator alluded, for example, to the consideration of a report concerning those particular members of the League which had subscribed to the protocol in connexion with the International Court of Justice. I think the Minister referred also to a report in regard to the international Tribunal itself. I take it that such report will have specific reference to the functions of the Tribunal. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Honorable senators may recall that I asked questions earlier this year as to whether Australia had assented to the establishment of the Tribunal. I am now given to understand that the two items to which I have just alluded were separate - the one having to do with a report regarding the different members of the League who had signed the protocol, and the other concerning the Tribunal itself. I may be in error, but it appears to me that many of the matters which will arise, although they may be based merely upon reports, will be subject to discussion. That will almost inevitably be the case, despite the fact that, as the Minister has correctly pointed out, they will not be debated with any sense of finality, seeing that they must afterwards go before the respective Governments. There is bound to be something, therefore, in the nature of preliminary discussion. And the representatives of each member of the League will subsequently report the views put forward or indicated by his co-delegates. Such reports, to a varying extent, will naturally influence the opinions formed by the Governments themselves. For example, a subject may arise upon which Lord Robert Cecil and his fellow delegate representing the South African Union may comment informally and without committing South Africa. Canada&#39;s representative, upon returning and reporting to his Government at Ottawa, might say that, so far as he could ascertain, South Africa&#39;s attitude was likely to be so-and-6o. To that extent, Canada might be influenced. Or the Canadian delegate might report that the South African representatives expressed certain views upon a specific subject, but were very cautious and careful to disavow official responsibility for their sentiments. Whereupon the Canadian Government might be impressed in another direction. It is, I urge, in these informal preliminary discussions that a great deal of groundwork is likely to be done, and indications given which may effectuate common sentiments and common conclusions among the members of the League hereafter. In all the circumstances, someone should have:been appointed to represent Australia who has been trained in responsible utterance and action, is intimately sympathetic with Australia&#39;s ablutions and responsibilities, and has some knowledge at least of the political questions with which the League of Nations is and will be confronted. With all his qualifications in other directions, however great they may be or whatever they may be, I do not think that the gentleman selected possesses the requisite equipment, and I think that Australia will not be fitly represented at the gathering of the League. I say that without disparagement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd,</inline> either personally or in relation to the manner in which, he has discharged his duties here and in London. I agree with Senators Thomas, Fairbairn, and Gardiner that Australia is not holding up her end in the deliberations of the League of Nations, and that, to that extent, she is not doing justice to that international body. I am glad of the opportunity which, perhaps, would not otherwise have been afforded, to gain a more or less intimate sense of the particular work to be done at the forthcoming Conference. The result of the Prime Minister&#39;s selection may be that Australians will take a greater interest in the proceedings and become more deeply concerned regarding future developments. I do not know that anything final or practicable can be done in  the matter by the Senate at this stage - certainly not upon this motion. But I hope that members of the Ministry realize that, in such an important situation, it is not desirable, however expedient it may be, that the announcement of an appointment of this kind should be sprung upon Parliament and the public. For some time. I have been asking what steps were being taken in respect of the representation of Australia at the gathering of the League, but I have not been able to get a definite reply. Obviously, Ministers here did not know. All I could learn was that some steps were being taken. It was only during the short interval covered by the last week-end that the public and members of Parliament were informed, through the newspapers, that an appointment had been made. And, almost simultaneously, the Prime Minister was announced to be leaving England. Even had the Commonwealth Parliament been actually sitting upon the day of the announcement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd&#39;s</inline> selection, it may be taken for granted that Ministers would have replied to inevitable criticism, immediately raised, that nothing .could be done in the matter, seeing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had departed. At all events, it cannot be said that the date of the meeting of the League of Nations was sprung upon the Government. lt has been known for a considerable time, and all arrangements should have been made for the adequate and efficient representation of the Commonwealth. The statement that these reports were promised for June last, and that some are not yet available, is no answer to the fact that the date for the meeting of the Assembly has been known for some time. I again thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> for submitting this motion, and so giving us an opportunity to discuss the whole situation. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not know whether to think ill or well of the action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> since, on the one hand, it will give additional publicity to the appointment that has been made by the Government; while, on the other, the discussion that has taken place on this motion will show the world that if the matter had rested with the Senate, a co-ordinate branch of the Legislature of the Commonwealth, a vastly different appointment would have been made. While this motion will give wide publicity to the appointment which has been made by the Government, the balancing advantage will lie in the publicity given to our criticism., and the fact made plain during this debate that this Chamber would have made a very different selection. The Government, in defence of the action taken by them, have cited the relative unimportance of the business set down for consideration by the Assembly of the League. I agree that a superficial reading of the agenda paper does not suggest that the business set down for consideration is very important. There is, however, one item of very great interest to us. I refer to the plea of the people of certain South American nations that an attempt shall be made to adjust their contending interests. In the settlement of that international dispute the Assembly may lay down principles of a far-reaching character that may finally affect even Australia. I attach the utmost importance to that question. In its determination principles will be laid down for the future guidance of the League of Nations, and we need to have a man of no ordinary capacity to adequately represent Australia in the consideration of such matters. As to the ether questions to be considered, it is quite clear that, while the reports to which reference has been made will not be finalized, some action may be contemplated  that will call upon Australia&#39;s representative to clearly and thoroughly set | out the views of the people, of this country, and the question arises as to whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd</inline> is the man for the | job. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Revert ing ito the question of the relative unimportance of the business to be dealt with, I think that the contention put forward on behalf of the Government is answered by &#38;. statement that appeared in the daily pre&#38;s some time ago in regard to the indignation felt by Lord Robert Cecil when the | British Government, in selecting a representative to attend the Conference, passed him over. That is an ample reply to the plea of the Government that this second Assembly of the League is unimportant. Lord Robert Cecil desired to be present at the Conference, and, according to the newspaper reports, felt very keenly the | way in which he had been ignored. He would not have wished to attend a mere formal gathering. He must have considered that matters of importance would arise, and that his presence, as one of  the  creators of the League of Nations,  was  desirable. $ re-echo the view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn,</inline> that if any nation has} reason to look with hope and confidence towards this newly-created boc|y, it is Australia. We have good reason to rely upon our former means of security, but we are entitled to regard the League of Nations as an additional safeguard, and as being Australia&#39;s third if  not second, line of defence. The smaller countries of the American Continent, from Labrador to Cape Horn, have the1 dead hand of  President  Monroe to protect them, even if they do nothing for themselves. Australia is the one part of the British Empire which is l more exposed to attack, and has more reason to fear the future than any other nation. In view of that fact, we&#39; must see to it that this new form of safety and defence, the League of Nations, is not lowered in prestige or importance. A sure means of lowering its prestige and destroying its power for good would be the selection of men of inferior calibre to take part in its deliberations. We do not select feeble or incapable men for appointment to Ministerial office, and the principle that guides us in creating Governments should be followed in the selection of men to take part in the councils of the League of Nations. I regret that the Government have taken this action. We have to consider what may be the views of those gathered round the council table, who naturally sum each other up and inquire as to the standing of their fellow members. It is necessary that our representative should have the confidence of the Assembly. I hope that good will issue from this discussion, and that as a result of the criticism in which the Senate has indulged, the Government will plainly recognise that we do not indorse the action they have taken, and they should try to amend it. </para>

Take, for instance, what happened in connexion with the report of the Finance Committee at the last gathering of the League. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen represented us on that occation, and it is quite possible that but for his action the cost of management might have gone on increasing.  His  protest against these increasing costs, even if it did not bring about a reduction, will prevent their further growth. </para>

It is ability of that kind that makes all the difference between good and poor representation. No matter what the business paper may be, Australia demands that at a gathering of such importance it shall be adequately represented. I shall conclude by earnestly appealing to the Government to consider whether, having regard to the views expressed during this debate and public opinion generally, it is, even now, too late to provide for the more adequate representation of Australia than the present appointment will give us.

The only question which will arise in which Australia is directly or particularly interested is the apportionment of the costs of the League amongst its several members. The&#93; unfairness of the present method, as it affected Australia, was put before the Assembly at its previous meeting by me, and the Assembly admitted the principle contended for by authorizing a Committee to present and prepare a more equitable system. The matter is now one of detail and internal organization, rather than of principle. In the circumstances the Government is satisfied that the Acting High Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd,</inline> will adequately safeguard Australian interests. </para>

If that were done, there would be a ring of indignation from one end of the country to the other. Although we are not actually imposing a fine, we are penalizing the exporters by means of the Tariff.

                    <para>. - I desire to show that increased duties have not always had the effect of raising prices to the users of any particular commodity. I have been informed that the price of horseshoe nails before duties were imposed was ll1/2d. per lb., and it has since been reduced to 41/2d. per lb., which shows that if we have a perfectly free and open market, and there is no combination of importers, prices are reduced. &#34;We are, therefore, justified in supporting the rates appearing in the schedule. I am sure we are all anxious that nails should be manufactured in Australia, but we do not want the price to be increased as  a  result of protection, because it means penalizing the users, many  of  whom are living in the back country  doing  important pioneering work, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has so ably referred. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to have that information, because I have personal knowledge concerning the in  crease  in prices during the war period, and if Australian firms are manufacturing this commodity they fleeced the users to their utmost capacity during the period I have mentioned. I understand that a factory was established in Victoria under a high Protective Tariff, and, therefore, the money contributed by the people in Victoria and other States has enabled manufacturers to charge unreasonable prices because there has been no competition from outside. It is true that there have been importations from Sweden ; but it was the absence of freights and the interruption of industries owing to the war that was responsible for importations ceasing, and not the Tariff. If I had a pre-war price list from which to quote, I would show how excessive were the charges for horseshoe nails during the war period. There was no great increase in the cost of production. All that happened was that the overseas competitors were cut out of the market, and then the local manufacturer took the last penny out of those who used his nails. I invite honorable senators to produce price lists covering the period 1915 to 1920, and to compare them with pre-war prices. </para>

                        <para>- Nails used in fastening plates on powerful horses that are galloped over hard turf at a high rate of speed are subjected to considerable strain, and their use in this way is a high test of their quality. I gladly accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn&#39;s</inline> statement that this firm turns out what must be an excellent article. The firm, I find, manufactures horse rasps. Trusting to my memory I say that the pre-war price for an ordinary small 14-in. horse rasp was about 71/2d., and the war price was about 3s. 6d. I mention that to enable honorable senators to realize what Australian firms, whose industries have been brought into existence and maintained by Australian taxpayers, did during war time. </para>

There must be fair dealing between the manufacturers and the public. If any honorable senator has any doubt as to what has taken place, I invite him to go into any of the warehouses and obtain their war-time price-lists. During the war the cost of shoeing a horse increased, because of the advance in the cost of material to the blacksmith, from 6s. to about 10s. These industry promoters, who want the public to keep them going by means of Customs duties, must not run away with the impression that their action during war time passed unnoticed. </para>

                        <para>- No. Shoeing smiths, in pre-war days, were getting 10s. or 12s. per day. If wages rose during the war to 15s. per day, that was, perhaps, the maximum. It is of no use considering individual cases. I am as anxious as any one to see local industries well established in this country; but I notice how busy the experts in the business are in supplying information to honorable senators to facilitate the passing of these high duties. I desire to conserve the interests of the Australian workmen; and my objection to this Tariff is that it will not do what it is supposed to do. Why not give the nail manufacturers a bounty on production? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator evidently is asking for advice, and I shall give it to him. He has had a great deal to say in general about these items. It would be as well if, in future, he disregarded general statements, and produced proof of his assertions.  His  allegation that these firms had a free hand during the war because importations had ceased is absolutely absurd. If there has been an increase in price, it certainly has not been due to any substantial falling off in importations. Official figures show that, in 1913-14, our total importations were 10,536 cwt. ; and in 1914-15, 10,117 cwt. There was a slight falling off in 1915-16, the figures being 9,800 cwt. In 1916-17, our importations were 9,600 cwt. ; and in 1917-1S, 8,600 cwt. It is evident, therefore, that the importers must have put up their prices. I doubt if any increase was due to the action of local manufacturers. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> shut his eyes entirely to the fact that* wages in all factories have been steadily climbing up as a result of Arbitration Court awards? Then there has also been an increase in the cost of raw material. </para>

                        <para>- In reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> .allegation that the price of horseshoe nails was unduly inflated during the war, I have been informed by the Customs Department that the list price of these nails has been uniform from 1913 to 1921 at 18s. 9d. per box of 25 lbs., and that the only variation which has taken place has been in regard to the discount rate. In 1913 this was 75 per cent, and 5 per cent off. In&#39; 1914 it was 72-&#163; per cent, and <inline font-style="italic">1\</inline> per cent. off. In 1921 the discount was plus 5 per cent, on the list price. Therefore, from 1913 to 1921 there was an actual increase of 85 per cent. But, as in the meantime, according to the statistician&#39;s figures, the cost of all commodities increased in greater ratio, it cannot be said that the manufacturer&#39; of these nails unduly increased his prices. Before lunch I ! mentioned the quantity of nails imported over a number of years. I emitted to refer to the importations in 1918-1919, and 1919-1920. In the former period, the first year after the war had concluded, and when the old Tariff was still in opera,tion, the quantity was 24,280 cwt., as against an average importation of about 10,000 cwt. in the preceding years, showing clearly that the market was being knocked out. Of these nails, 10,900 cwt. came from Sweden, and 12,560 cwt. from the United States of America. In 1919-20, when the new Tariff was partly in operation, the importations of these nails fell to 5,420 cwt. These nails have been made in Australia since 1883, when John Pen der and Son commenced operations under the Victorian Tariff of 14s. per cwt., a very much higher rate than is now proposed. But, in dealing with this question, we must also bear in mind that the duties upon bar and rod steel, the raw material from which these nails are made, are equal to 2s. 2d., 3s. 3d., and 4s. per dwt. Under the- State Tariff, the manufacturer imported his raw material free. Therefore, we are giving him a much smaller protection than he enjoyed in the earlier years of his industry. Another factor to b&#39;e taken into account is the increase in importations from Sweden and the United States of America, as compared With those from Great Britain. I think that the facts I have mentioned are sufficient to show that a reasonable case has Been made out for the duties which appear  in the schedule, although I know that they will not reconcile&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to them, because he does not believe in the imposition of duties of any kind. </para>

No one. in the Senate is more prepared to approach a  question  in a reasonable spirit, but the Minister cannot expect me to believe that the prices at which these nails come through the Customs House are in any way proportionate to their cost over the counter, I have actual knowledge of the fact that, during the war, the counter cost of these nails was five or six times their price in  pre-war  days. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has nob disproved my charge that during the war, when the users of these nails were at their mercy, the local manufacturers levied exorbitant charges. I was particularly pleased to hear the figures in regard to the enormous importations during that period, because many reputable importing firms told old customers of theirs that they were not in a position to obtain supplies of these nails. The Minister&#39;s statement is, perhaps, a severer condemnation of these firms than is my condemnation of the manufacturers. </para>

                        in charging the maker of horseshoe nails with having taken undue advantage of war-time conditions to fleece the public, chose to ignore the additional cost of nail-making brought about by the war conditions. I am informed, on the very best of authority, that the steel rods imported from Sweden - which are absolutely necessary for this particular industry, because only of this class of steel can the nails be effectively made - advanced to six times their pre-war price. In addition to ignoring this basic fact,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>
                        neglected to mention that every cost of carrying on the industry was considerably increased during the same period; so much so, that I am assured the manufacturer made practically no profit at the prices he charged for his nails, or, at any rate, no greater profit than he was making prior to the war. I know that the establishment of this industry has proved a great boon to Australia. Those who handle the nails it produces declare that it is a most valuable industry to this country. If I thought it worth while to go into a complete analysis, it would easily disprove every statement made by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner;</inline>
                        but I feel that I would not be justified in taking up the time of other honorable senators in doing so. It is sufficient to say that the increased price of nails dur ing the Avar period was not due to the fact that the manufacturer was taking an enormous profit.

                    <para>. - If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> charges were correct, the manufacturer of these nails would have had to turn out the same output as he had before the war, because, naturally, if it was smaller, his profit must also have been smaller. In 1905, the output of his factory was 14,000 cases; whereas in 1917, during the war, it was only a little over 5,000 cases. But the overhead charges were still the same, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has pointed out, the cost of the raw material had increased sixfold, and higher wages had to be paid. In view of these facts, with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> should have made himself acquainted before speaking to this item, the honorable senator ought to withdraw his charges unreservedly. </para>

                    <para>. - I have here a communication from the Master Farriers Society of Victoria, protesting against what the members thought to be the policy of the Government in imposing <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties on horseshoe nails. I find that no such policy is proposed. This schedule raises the specific duties, per cwt., British, from 8s. 6d. to 12s. ; intermediate, from 10s. 6d. to 14s.; and general, from 12s. to 15s. Therefore, the protest of the Master Farriers Society falls to the. ground inasmuch as no <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties are proposed. But in this protest it is asserted that the quality, of the horseshoe nails made in Australia is inferior to the quality of the nails imported. I do not desire to read the whole of the communication sent to me, but merely say that there is some evidence, which may be true, afforded by the regular and large importations that have  taken place, and took place even during the war. These importations are an evidence that horseshoe nails were obtained practically at any price from abroad, or from the usual sources of supply, and that they were necessary, because, according to the Master Farriers Society, of the inferiority of the locally-made article. I think that on the whole the proposals of the Government should be accepted by the Committee for the reason that, according to my information, the average f.o.b. price of horseshoe nails made abroad is &#163;85 per ton, as at the 7th July of this year. Consequently, the duties which* the Government propose, although showing considerable increases, do not amount, so far as I can see, to more than 15 per cent., British, and 18 per cent., general, which I think honorable senators will agree are fairly modest rates. </para>

The Minister for Trade and Customs, with  his departmental officers,  went fully into  the matter, and I think it would be reasonable for the Committee to accept the  item  as presented. </para>

The honorable senator even  went  so far as to  reduce  a British preferential Tariff by 21/2 per cent., and in doing so&#34; to occupy much of our sleeping time. He now practically says that we have no right to interfere with the settled policy of the Government and the Department. </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable senator deny that my request merely makes the Tariff what it  was  when originally introduced in another place? If the honorable senator regards that  as  a false premise we can readily realize that he  is  new to the Senate, and to the  discussion  of Tariff Bills. With more mature experience, however, he will realize the position. It is not my habit to do anything that can be described  as false;  and I can only attribute <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne&#39;s</inline> attitude to his inability to understand how this Tariff business is conducted. <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator PAYNE</inline> (Tasmania) &#91;2.54&#93;.  -I  cannot allow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to attribute my remarks in regard to himself to my inexperience. I have been quite long enough in political life to understand politicians of the calibre of the honorable senator, especially when an attempt is made to asperse the character of? a reputable business man by withholding the most important fact that the additional cost of raw material must have a great effect on the price of the manufactured commodity. That is the false premise to which I referred. </para>

                        <para>. - I resumed my seat in order to give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> an opportunity to explain and withdraw his remarks in reference to myself, but he has now added another charge: That I have imputed dishonesty to a reputable business man. I have stated nothing but facts relating to the exorbitant prices charged for horseshoe nails. These duties were increased in another place, possibly on  a  suggestion made by a member and accepted by the Government. The whole question is -whether the taxpayers generally, many of whom never use horseshoe nails, are to be taxed in order to establish this industry. It is an old Protectionist argument that the taxpayers generally may be taxed for such a purpose; but we are told that this industry has been in existence for forty years, and surely it cannot be regarded as an &#34; infant &#34; ! <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> talks of the enormous cost of the raw material; but, according to the Minister&#39;s statement, 25-lb. boxes of nails were coming in at 18s. What did a 25-lb. box fetch during war time? I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> to produce the figures. There has been, no exorbitant increase in the cost of the raw material, which came in at the price the Minister quoted, somewhere under 9d. a lb., while, if my memory is right, nails during the war period were sold at 2s. 9d. per lb. It is now proposed to give these manufacturers even more profit by making the users of horseshoe nails pay higher prices for the rest of their lives. </para>

He has indicated the price for the first two years of the war, and then he leaves a significant gap by quoting the figure for 1919. The increase of rates of wages during the war period was a mere nothing. Wages are not high even to-day, taking into consideration the high cost of living. </para>

Those honorable senators who feared to assist me to reduce the general Tariff because they were afraid of the importation of nails from Germany, should not hesitate to support me in regard to the intermediate rate. As a matter of fact, there is no such thing as an intermediate Tariff.

                        <para>- I am glad to learn that the concession covers also our late Allies. Practically, however, there are only two rates of duty. What is everybody&#39;s business is nobody&#39;s business. The benefit of the intermediate Tariff is open to sister Dominions and to certain friendly nations. It affords scope for- reciprocity, but there is no driving force in the direction of its adoption. The invitation to take advantage of the concession stands; the opportunity to make mutual arrangements holds good; and that is the end of it. </para>

I shall first move that British horseshoe nails be free, and if that effort fails I shall move that the former rate of Ss. 6d. be reimposed. It is absurd to describe a Tariff of 12s. per cwt. upon nails, compared with 15s. under the general column, as a measure of preference to the Mother Country. It is actually a very heavy impost. I recognise the superiority of Australian workmen. In a fair run they could beat the English competitors without any handicap.

                        <para>. - The duties for which this item provides should not be imposed. I do not know that we have in Australia any manufacturers of rifle barrels, so that it cannot be said that -these duties are designed to build up a local industry. The Commonwealth Small Arms Factory does not compete in the open market. The Defence Department is getting ready for the next war by dismissing operatives from that factory and allowing much of its valuable machinery to remain idle. No reduction is being made in the Headquarters Staff, but men engaged in the manufacture of rifles in the Commonwealth Factory are turned off at practically a moment&#39;s notice. If the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> were to ask us to-morrow to agree to a vote of &#163;100,000 to be expended on importations of swords, bayonets, and other things covered by this item, we should do so without comment, but here we have a proposal that private firms shall not be permitted to bring in such goods without paying heavy duties upon them. Surely in time of emergency stocks of guns, rifles, swords, and bayonets in private warehouses would be as useful as if they were in the store-rooms of the Defence Department. The Minister, perhaps, does not view with equanimity the prospect of the people being able to supply themselves with these arms. He fear&#39;s, perhaps, that they might turn them against their real enemies within and not outside Australia. I refer to those who make it hard for them to live - to the enemy that controls Governments and makes the many pay for the comfort and luxury of the few. I move - </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to have that information. It seems unreasonable to impose such an unnecessarily high duty on firearms of this kind, which are used extensively by the primary producers in waging war against the fox and other vermin. The small-bore Remington rifle is quite a necessity in many districts, as large numbers of them are used for the purpose I have mentioned. Cheap guns should be available at a reasonable price, because they enable youths to master the art of handling firearms, and can also be utilized in many other ways. By using the term &#39;&#34;cheap,&#34; I do not mean an inferior gun, but one which can be purchased for a reasonable price. Firearms of this type are not manufactured by the Small Arms Factory, and by imposing this unnecessarily high duty we are preventing their importation or making them very expensive. But as it is the policy of this Protectionist Government to impose heavy duties on practically everything the primary producer requires, I suppose the sub-item will be passed. </para>

                <para class="block">During the war the manufacture of chains from&#189;inch to 3 inches was taken up by H. Williams and Company, engineers, Brunswick, who employed thirty men in the business. The plant was capable of turning out 5 or 6 tons per week. The chains concerned are ships&#39; steering, mooring, crane, and hauling chains. The business has been purchased by Inglis, Smith and Company, ships&#39; providers, Melbourne, who have taken over Williams and Company&#39;splant, and are carrying on the manufacture. One of the orders fulfilled by Williams and Company consisted of 135 tons of 2 -in. anchor cables and shackles complete for the Commonwealth Ship Construction Branch. Cable chains of&#189;-inch to 1&#189; inches were also made by the Federal Spring Works, North Melbourne, but, owing to the lack of orders, this firm has not made any chains since January last. Their raw material was Broken Hill steel; but this is not quite satisfactory, inasmuch as when the chain is submitted to Lloyd&#39;s test, the links show excessive elongation. The other manufacturer has been using material obtained from the Lion Rolling Mills and the Victorian Rolling Mills, Melbourne, but they make the same complaint - that chains made from this material are apt to fail to stand the Lloyd&#39;s test&#93; and the disadvantage is that a ship supplied with chains not certificated as standing such test suffers in Lloyd&#39;s classification. Inglis, Smith, and Company propose to import Netherton Crown iron for use in making their chains. This class of iron is not made in Australia. The malleable iron sprocket and link belting chains mentioned in sub-item  b  are being made by Malleable Castings Limited, Marrickville. This type of chain consists of malleable cast detachable links, and is used largely as driving chains in agricultural machines. The Meadowbank Manufacturing Company, Sydney, also make this type of chain. Those classified under sub-item c are driving chains of the roller type used in motor vehicles. No instance of the manufacture of this type of chain has been brought under the notice of the Department. </para>

                    <para>. -  I trust the honorable senator will not press a request of such a sweeping character. I may remind the Committee that machinery is not largely used in the manufacture of chains, and that most of the work is done by hand labour. It is very necessary that our requirements should be met by manufactures in the Commonwealth. I do not know what the conditions are at present in the Old Country, but the chain-making industry at Cradley Heath is one of the black pages in the history of the economic life of Great Britain. Although the work is of a heavy character, it is done largely in Britain by women and children, and any one who has read the terrible record of the chain making industry in that country will not favour the chains manufactured under such conditions entering into competition with those made by highly trained &#39;adult labour in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Then malleable chains are not under consideration at the moment. My feeling in the matter is that if the locally-made chains are not up to standard, the Government would be well advised to hold their hand and defer the imposition of a duty on this sub-item until the local industry has advanced to such a stage as to be in a position to offer a, fair supply of a good article. We are being asked to impose a duty of 30 per cent. on British imports of these goods almost with our eyes shut. It is certain that local manufacturers cannot cope with Australian requirements, as we know that almost all of these chains are imported. To levy a duty of 30 per cent. on these goods without the compensating advantage of having an industry established here is simply penalizing unnecessarily those who have to use these articles. The price of chains has gone up enormously. I can say, tram personal experience, that the price of the ordinary type of chain used has gone up about 400 per cent. Why should we penalize the users of these chains when there is no local industry for their manufacture? </para>

                        <para>-  It is the smaller type of chains that is turned out successfully. It is with the manufacture of the bigger chains that we are having difficulties, and the local manufacturers of those chains propose to import their raw material to overcome those difficulties. Malleable chains are being made in quantities in Australia by the two firms to which I have referred. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is mistaken when he says that this is not a protective duty. The manufacture of articles referred to in this sub-item is carried on by quite a large number of firms in the Commonwealth. During the war, the Colonial Ammunition Company started rolling nickel silver sheets, which are being used notably by the Phoenix Manufacturing Company in the production of plated ware, which for quality will bear comparison with any imported plated ware. Each article is stamped with the inscription, &#34; made in Australia.&#34; We produce the raw material, and it is only right that we should protect the industry. To some extent, the articles may be regarded as a luxury, and, from the revenue point of view, should bear a duty. </para>

                    <para>. - My request refers only to articles made wholly of gold or silver. These metals are so valuable to me that I want to encourage people to import them freely. It is extraordinary that a man should be taxed to the extent of &#163;35 for every &#163;100 worth of gold or silver he introduces into this country. Gold and silver always have a fixed value. In fact, these metals are the basis of value. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> says the articles referred to are luxuries. Well, I want all the luxuries I can get, and it occurs to me that we should admit free any articles made wholly of gold or silver, because some day we might want to melt them down to pay our debts with, or to redeem part of the note issue. </para>

The Hydro Press Company Pty. Ltd. are making pie dishes and frying pans in three sizes, and will shortly be making saucepans and kettles. The Modern Art Metal Company and the Aluminium Pty. Ltd. are putting up their premises, and getting ready for making these utensils. When all these firms are in operation, they ought to be able to supply the local market. At any rate, we ought to encourage them to do so. The duty is  not  very high. </para>

                    <para>. - The evidence given before the Inter-State Commission, shows that the Welsbach Light Company of Sydney were making these mantles prior to 1914, but abandoned the manufacture, giving as a reason for doing so the higher cost of labour and raw&#93; materials, the absence of effective protection, and the restrictions imposed by factory legislation. Somewhat later, a firm called the Incandescent Lighting Plaissety System Company Limited started the manufacture of these articles, but were unable to make a success of lit, and their business was taken over by the Phoenix Gas Mantles Limited, which company is now making about 100 gross a, week, or 700,000 mantles per year . The average number of mantles imported yearly during the last six years was about 3,700,000. The local manufacturers, becoming uneasy in regard to competition from Japan and the United States of America, petitioned fora higher Tariff. TheFlexiboe Mantle Company applied for a duty of 50 per cent without any preference. The Phoenix Mantle Company asked for a 45 percent. duty, with a preference of 10 per cent. to the United Kingdom. A third firm, the Lighting Supplies Company, imports the fabric cut to size, and assembles the mantles. Their output in 1920 was 1,736 gross. The Phoenix Mantle Company, since the introduction of this Tariff, have placed an order locally for ten additional weaving machines; and when these are installed they estimate that their output will be 400 gross per week, equal to 20,700 gross per year. The number of employees in the. industry is 165. It will be seen that there is every hope that Australia will be able to supply its own requirements in this respect. ltem agreed to. </para>

                <para class="block">If this request be adopted, I intend to move the addition of a further paragraph, &#34; (b) n.e.i,&#34;, and leave the Committee to fix what duties they desire. In my own State, to which my knowledge of this matter is confined, there are several industries which supply to orchardists, small farmers, florists, and so forth, spraying, sprinkling, and irrigation systems. Under the Tariff as passed by this Committee, unless the alteration I propose is made, those industries must be placed in a most unfair position. They will be called upon to pay on the parts imported from abroad for the purposes I have stated considerably higher duties under this item than are paid on the completed machines; in other words, parts are at present charged under item 208, 35 per cent., 40 per cent., and 45 per cent., whereas the complete machine under item 161, which the Committee has passed, will come in at 15 per cent., 25 per cent., and 30 per cent. This is a handicap in the case of those parts which enable the farmer or the fruit-grower to erect his own irrigation system. Unless this amendment is made, such a man will have to pay 35 per cent., British preference, on parts, whereas the completed machine from abroad will pay only 15 per cent., and as a general duty he will have to pay 45 per cent., as against 30 per cent. under item 161. For the information of the Committee I desire to read the following letter which I have received from Herbert James Rumsey of Dundas, New South Wales, who is one of the persons who supplies these home-made irrigation systems. He says: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>My system is one under which any settler can fix his own irrigation plant. It includes drilling machine, nozzles, and a patent device for turning the pipe back and forth. . . . My type, which are used in thousands, they have never attempted to make here. . . . We have supplied the material for over 1,200 installations of my system; but recently, with the awful handicap of high-priced pipes, and 45 per cent. duty on the fittings (even the drilling machine, which cannot be made locally, is taxed), the cost is getting prohibitive, and though we get plenty of applications for estimates, very few of them are now being carried out. . . . My irrigation parts, which are really the raw material from which the settler is manufacturing his own irrigation plant, are charged at 45 per cent. duty. There are good reasons why they cannot be manufactured locally at present, and I have to pay a higher duty on them than is charged on completed sprinklers, though we make up sprinklers from them, and have to sell in competition with the imported article, paying a lower duty. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I have taken some trouble to verify the position I am setting out, and I submit that unless the item is altered in the direction I have indicated, local industry will not get fair play. A most unfair tax will be placed on the people who manufacture these things, in view of the lower duties on the completed article imported from abroad. I am quite aware that included in the materials that I am asking shall be admitted under the same duty that the Committee has passed in the case of item 161, are wrought-iron pipes; that 2-in. and 3-in. pipes are now free., 5 per cent., and 10 per cent., and that on 1st January next, provided the industry is established- which I do not think is at all likely - they will be dutiable at 271/2 per cent., 35 per cent., and 40 per cent. The 4-in. pipes are now dutiable at those rates, and are not made in Australia. I submit this request for the purpose of making it reasonably easy for the fruit-grower, the florist, or the small farmer to have his own irrigation plant at a reasonable price. I do not think there is either justice or equity, or any regard shown for the interests of men such as these, in charging a higher duty on parts than is paid on the completed article. </para>

                        <para>- I was not aware of that. We have not had much time; but as far as I have been able, I have had the matter looked into by the officials of the Department. Their first criticism, which is a departmental one, is that where items are split up as now proposed,  great care has to be taken in the wording, because it is under just such items that disputes arise as to interpretation. They say that the verbiage is vague, and this, I am informed, is likely to cause difficulty in administration. Further, the request cannot be accepted, because it is inconsistent with the Tariff. It will mean that the Australian manufacturer who can manufacture, as he does, certain of these parts will have his material imported at the low rate of duties proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline></para>

                        <para>- The course proposed is not taken in the case of any other industry. We impose a duty on the completed article in order to encourage manufacture, and we impose the same duty on parts, unless it is otherwise specified. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> for instance, refers to item 192, he will see that &#34;brass work, bronze work, and gun-metal work for general engineering and plumbing and other trades &#34; pays, exactly the same duties as are provided in item 208. Under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> proposal it would be possible for certain material, which the Committee has agreed shall be dutiable at certain rates, to come in, if used for another purpose, dutiable at lower rates. How could the Department follow the material up to see that it was used for the purpose specified ? </para>

                        <para>- That is quite likely; but I think that the position has only to be stated to show the confusion that would arise under the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> I submit that sprinklers and the materials for sprinklers are already largely manufactured in the Commonwealth. A&#39; boot manufacturer advocates protection for his boots, but would like leather to be admitted free. THat is a view which the Committee cannot adopt; one manufacturer is as much entitled to protection as another. We must be careful that, in looking after the interests of the man who simply assembles parts we do not kill the industry of manufacturing parts. &#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has told us that certain of these parts cannot be made locally, but, if that is so, there is clearly redress under item 404, which admits free under the British preferential and intermediate Tariffs, and at 10 1 per cent, under the general Tariff, &#34; materials and minor articles, as prescribed by departmental by-laws, for use in &#39;the manufacture of goods within the Commonwealth.&#34; All that the manufacturers to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has referred have to demonstrate is that the parts they require cannot be made in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Then those parts will dome under item 404. I suggest  the  possibility that those who have communicated with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> are not aware of that fact; indeed, a case of the kind came under our notice only this morning. Halving in view the difficulty of interpretation, and the confusion which would arise if this request were adopted, and also bearing in mind the desirability of protecting, not only those who manufacture the completed machines, but those who manufacture parts, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> ought to withdraw the request. </para>

                        has courteously furnished me with a copy of his proposed request. I have no desire other than  to  facilitate debate, and the introduction and acceptance of requests, provided that the latter do not confuse or stultify decisions already reached by the Committee. Senator Pratten made specific reference fo wrought-iron pipes as coming under item 208, namely, &#34; manufactures of metal n.e.i.&#34; Pipes, however, have been already dea&#39;lt with. Nozzles, brass work and similar manufactures have also been considered and dealt with by the Committee. These parts, and wrought-iron pipes also, are complementary to such contrivances as | sprinkling and irrigation systems.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline>
                        proposed request is so comprehensive that it could scarcely fail to involve articles  covered by items previously considered. That being the case, I cannot accept the honorable senator&#39;s request.

I wish to provide that sprayer and sprinkler parts shall not be charged higher duties than those on the complete machines, as covered by item 161. If I add &#34; n.e.i.&#34;, the rates set out under item 192 must govern the manufactures coming under item 208. The duties upon everything included in item 192 are, respectively, 35 per cent., 40 per cent., and 45 per cent. But the Committee has decided that the completed appliances shall be subject to duties of 15 per cent., 25 per cent., and 30 per cent.; that is, under item 161. </para>

Its object is, we understand, to encourage Australian industries, but here we have an inducement deliberately held out to the public to obtain the finished article from overseas. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior,</inline> who is a handy man in a garden, says that parts for sprinklers are often attached to a kerosene tin with very good results. Many irrigationists have to make their own sprinklers, but we find that, under a previous item, we have already provided for duties of 15 per cent., 20 per cent., and 30 per cent. on the completed article, whereas under this item the duties on the parts that go to make up that article are nearly twice as much. That is ridiculous. </para>

                    <para>. - I propose to ask the Committee to agree to the request of the House of Representatives to reduce the duties on printers&#39; type. Honorable senators may naturally think that I have a strong personal interest in this question, but I assure them that if I thought there was a chance of developing to any extent the type-founding industry in Australia, I should have no hesitation in voting for the retention of the present duties. There are, however, peculiar conditions associated with the industry here, which precludes the possibility of its extensive development. In the printing offices of Australia, no less than 1,000 faces, or different kinds, of type are used ; but the Australian Type Foundry, Sydney - the only type foundry that we have in Australia. - makes only 100 faces. In order that our printers may be thoroughly up to date, it is essential that they should have the choice of a wide range of type. There are no less than sixteen different kinds of script or imitation- writing type, but the Australian Type Foundry makes only two faces. Then, again, there are twenty-two different faces of typewriter type, but of these, again, the Australian Type Foundry makes only two. Printers use what are known as shaded letters, but the Australian Type Foundry makes none of these. I could, if necessary, enumerate many different kinds of type used by printers but not made here, so that if our printing-houses were restricted to the use of type made by the local foundry they would suffer in competition with printers abroad. Catalogues and other advertising matter are circulated abroad by Australian firms, who desire that their work shall be done in the best possible style, and the trade here should not be hampered. In New Zealand imports of printing type from. Britain are free, while type from other countries is dutiable at 10 per cent. The Australian Type Foundry is able to compete in open market with American and other type foundries. The value of the exports of Australian-made metal type, principally to New Zealand, in 1909 was &#163;2,800, 1910 &#163;2,300, 1911 &#163;2,700, 1912 &#163;2,800, and 1913 &#163;2,100. The Australian foundry can sell for less &#34;than the American type foundries are able to sell, for the reason that it has not to incur the great initial expense of designing faces and producing the steel dies from which the matrices are made. Important evidence in regard to this matter was given before the Inter-State Commission in 1916. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> Haddon, of the John Haddon Company, London, type founders, mentioned, in the course of his evidence before the Commission, that it cost his firm &#163;7,000 to design one series of type and to make the necessary steel -dies. The Australian Type Foundry does not design any type, and, therefore, avoids that initial expense. It secures a. series of American or British types that have become popular, and from them makes the copper matrices from which it casts its type. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wimble,</inline> proprietor of the Australian Type Foundry, admitted before the Inter-State Commission that he had not to meet these great initial expenses.

                    <para>Whilst it appears to be a matter of good taste and discretion on the part of a manufacturer whether or not he should express some acknowledgment for his indebtedness to those whose original work he is copying to his personal advantage, the designs, which are not registered here, are public property, and under the circumstances it is probable the local type founder is following a practice &#39; usual elsewhere under similar conditions. The fact that by doing so he is avoiding a very important proportion of the manufacturing cost which is necessary to his competitors is, however, an important feature in the consideration of the relative costs of manufacture in Australia and the countries from whence the printers&#39; metal type is imported. </para>

                <para class="block">It has been said that the Australian Type Foundry uses Australian metal ; but there is not very much in that contention, as practically all the material used by that foundry consists of type which has been recast. Quite recently the Australian Type Foundry was selling one particular class of type at11s. per lb., although the value of the metal was about 6d. to 8d. per lb., and when one remembers that a typecasting machine can cast 7,000 or 8,000 types per hour, about 10 lbs. of metal, the actual casting costs 6d. to 8d., so that the total cost is1s. to1s. 6d., for which a charge of11s. per lb. is made. That was in connexion with one of the dearer types; but it will be seen that there is a very wide margin between the cost of production and the price charged. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - It is very interesting, and, in a sense, a sad memory to recall that one of the most distinct recollections I have of the honorable senator&#39;s father is in connexion with Tariff matters when he made a very strong and eloquent appeal in this chamber on behalf of the printing industry. I well remember ex-Senator Vardon displaying printed catalogues that were being imported into Australia to the detriment of the printing industry, and I have no hesitation in saying that his efforts on that occasion assisted considerably in the fairly heavy rates imposed on printed matter being retained. Whilst we are willing to protect the printing industry in this way, I do not think printers have the right to claim that they should have protection, and that those who supply the type should be exposed to the full blast of the open market. Type is being manufactured by Wimble and Company, in Sydney, where about 100 men are employed. </para>

                        <para>- That is impracticable. The industry is established in the Commonwealth, and I have no doubt that it will grow, as at present 50 per cent. of the Australian requirements are being manufactured locally. I am informed that the industry has been in operation for about twenty years. It cannot be said that these duties are a great drain on the industry, because the official figures disclose that the total importations last year were valued at &#163;4,499, and the total amount of duty paid was only &#163;1,080. When one realizes the quantity of job printing done throughout Australia, it will be seen that the proposed duties are not a very severe handicap to the industry, whilst at the same time they give some little protection to local manufacturers. </para>

                        <para>- I said at the outset that I might be accused of that, because I am engaged in the printing aud publishing business. I am willing to sup.POrt a high duty on  strawboards  because we manufacture all we require, and if we could make all the type we desire to use I would support the imposition of high duties. Printers are taxed very heavily in the matter of duties, as on a machine I shall be landing shortly I shall have to pay duty amounting to &#163;150. I am. not complaining of that. If the industry could be. established in Australia in such a. way that we would not have to import, I would support the proposed duties; but, having regard- to the peculiar conditions attaching to the industry, that will never be so, because of the great initial expense in designing letters. It is not fair to copy designs from the other side df the world, because by doing so we would be avoiding expense to which others have been put. I trust the Committee will agree to my request. </para>

                    <para>.- - This is an instance in which the Department should be given some discretion. If we were to remove the duty on type simply because certain kinds are not manufactured in Australia owing to the existence of patent rights and other reasons, we would be doing a serious injury to an established industry. Pro vision has been made for the exercise of departmental discretion in other instances, particularly in connexion with electrical appliances, and the Department should be allowed to discriminate between the type which is manufactured in Australia and that which is not. We  must  give protection to those who have established the industry and are manufacturing 100 different kinds of type. If we ,did not, the business would be ruined, and there would not be any possibility of &#39;expansion, which may result if the  duty  is continued. It is difficult to specifically mention the different kinds of  type  in the schedule, but if the Department had discretion the difficulty might be met. </para>

                        suggestion is quite impracticable, because if a duty were imposed on type made in Australia, and there was no duty, or a low one, on that not made here, it is quite evident that the printers would purchase that on which a low duty had been imposed, because they would be able to get it cheaper than the Australian article. If that were done, it would mean wiping out the&#39; Australian industry, and I do not wish to assist in doing that. On the other  hand, I do not see why printers should be penalized &#39;because the Australian Type Foundry makes only 100 different kinds of letters.

                    <para>It is the printer who seeks to educate the public taste who is penalized. We have foi several years adopted the .principle that we must buy the type that we use, regardless of its cost. It is grossly unfair that we should have to pay so dearly for it to support a house whose only enterprise takes the form of piracy, and whose limited range of faces is tending to make Australian printing look poverty-stricken. </para>

                    <para>Personally I think that, taking into consideration the small amount of foundry type that is made in Australia, and the lack of originality in same, it is a pity to hamper in any way the introduction of new and original faces, as we owe the present high standard of typography to the imported types, the educational value of which is very great. </para>

                    <para>Wc realize what a hindrance it is to the advancement of the printing trade in general, as we ourselves have found that the introduction of new typos into Australia for the benefit of printers has been a very expensive item, owing to the high duty which is placed on it. The high cost of printing plant is the printers&#39; most serious difficulty with which he has to contend, and until such time as printing machinery and type is manufactured in the Commonwealth, or a moderate duty only is imposed on imported plant, the trade in general will make- little headway. When the excessive cost of up-to-date machinery has been reduced to come within the reach of the average printer the trade will be enabled to compete on an equal footing with overseas houses for the manufacture of stationery and other goods, which at present can be imported at a cheaper rate than that at which they can be produced here. </para>

                <para class="block">These are the views of business firms, and if is quite evident that they cannot secure all the varieties of type they require. At first, I was disposed to agree to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle&#39;s</inline> suggestion that we might arrange to admit free of duty varieties of type which are not made in Australia, and I am sorry that it seems impossible to do that. I think the duty might be- reduced until the Australian type founders are in a position to produce the varieties of type that are necessary to turn out good work. When they can do so, the duty might be imposed, but in the meantime, I strongly support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon&#39;s</inline> request. </para>

                        <para>- It has been pointed out that the type-founding industry has been carried on for some twenty years in Australia., but is still in a position to supply only certain varieties of type, whilst many other varieties that are not manufactured here are required by printers in their industry. In my opinion the only justification for an increased duty is that an industry that is worth maintaining has been shown to be unable to make headway or to hold its own because of insufficient protection. This industry has been carried on for a long time to the stage at which it has progressed under the previously existing duty. In the Tariff of 1908 the only duty imposed was 20 per cent. In the 1914 Tariff there were duties of 25 per cent, in the general Tariff and 20 per cent, in the British preferential column. </para>

                    <para>. - The longer we live the more we learn. When I listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> seriously asking the Committee to agree to the severest cut yet proposed in the duties set out in this schedule, representing a reduction which would not have occurred, even in their wildest dreams, to honorable senators who have been seeking concessions for the primary producers, I thought the world must be turning upside down. The time of the Committee has been wasted for more than a quarter of an hour in an effort to save &#163;1,,000 a year to the printers of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> and myself have vainly begged, almost in sackcloth and ashes, for a miserable concession of 5 per cent., and yet we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> on this item asking for the biggest reduction so far requested. Hitherto, when high duties have been proposed, as soon as the Ministerial voice has been raised the honorable senator has been attracted as by a magnet to the support of the Government. </para>

                    <para>.- The effective duty is really 25 per cent., because practically all saws of this class come from the United States of America. I am informed that W. H. Blakeley, of Melbourne, is a manufacturer of the saws included in this item, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has also stated that a Sydney firm is engaged in the business. As the local manufacturers have to import the material, steel circular plate, which is dutiable, there is not a great margin of protection. </para>

                    <para>. -  This is one of the items in which a real and valuable preference is given to the manufacturers of the United Kingdom. It is a mistake to believe that the United States of America is the chief supplier of tools of trade in the Australian market. Prior to the war we imported annually from Great Britain &#163;306,000 worth, and from the United States of America &#163;293,000 worth. In 1919-20, importations from the United Kingdom totalled &#163;431,000, and from the United States of America, &#163;403,000.From Germany, . prior to the war, we imported tools to the value of &#163;38,000 yearly. As the duty is a substantial preference to the United Kingdom, I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to withdraw his request. </para>

                        <para>- On this subject, I suppose the Minister and I must agree to differ. I claim to know something about carpenters&#39; tools. Prior to the war, planes, like the Stanley plane, could be bought at from 9s. to 15s. 6d., according to size. Now they cost from 25s. to 37s. 6d. For rough work, the German jack plane, a plane without a back iron, has reduced labour by about 50 per cent. The American Disston saw has also displaced those splendid English saws made by Sorby, Howell, and other British manufacturers, simply because it is more suitable for existing conditions. Artisans instinctively choose the very best tools for their work, and it is only right that they should have a wide range of choice. The American axe has practically displaced the well-known English broad-axe in our market, because it is specially suited for our requirements. No matter what the duty may be, the skilled mechanic will buy the implement that is most satisfactory for his particular class of work. This is because in these days expedition is expected on all jobs. Workmen of today are expected to do more than formerly because they have better tools. This time last year I supervised the erection of a house, and I found that the men in <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> own trade, as well as the bricklayers, plumbers, tilers, and all other artisans were working just as fast as ever. There was no suggestion of the &#34; go-slow &#34; policy about them. This duty isa tax on the tradesman, because it will prevent him from having the best tools unless he pays exceedingly high prices for them. The increase in the cost of carpenters&#39; tools is easily 300 per cent. </para>

                    <para>.I think the majority of honorable senators will agree to the request which I intend to put forward in regard to the duty upon rabbit traps. We have just passed sub-item a, which admits dog traps free from Great Britain, and at a 10 per cent. duty from foreign countries, whereas under sub-item b the rates of duty upon rabbit trap&#39;s are 20 per cent., 25 per cent., and 30 per cent. In the southern parts of Australia the greatest curse to the man on the land is the rabbit pest. Nothing is more vital to the prosperity of Australia than is the development of our lands to the highest extent of productivity ; but any one with experience of outlying settlements, when land which has been taken up in a virgin state is being cleared and cultivated, must recognise the awful struggle of the occupiers to keep out the rabbits from the virgin bush around them. I have seen extensive areas of devastated land which, before the rabbit pest became so evident, furnished sustenance for cattle and sheep, or produced crops. The farmer cannot protect himself against rabbits by wiring his holding unless he has a fair amount of capital at his disposal, and it has been found in Tasmania that the best means of dealing with the pest is to keep the rabbits in check by systematic trapping. The price of rabbit traps in Selbourne to-day is from 33s. to 36s. per dozen. It is so high that many people who formerly earned a livelihood by trapping are now precluded from following that occupation. Are we imposing a duty of 20 per cent. British, and 30 per cent, general, to prohibit the importation of these traps, or to keep the price at the 2&#62;resent high figure ? It may be contended that this protection is necessary in order to support an industry in Australia ; &#34;but it cannot be more than a small industry. What benefit is derived by the maintenance of a small industry engaged in the manufacture of rabbit traps in comparison with the good that would result from enabling trapping operations to be carried on more extensively than they are to-day by permitting these essential articles to come in free, or, at any rate, at a very low rate of duty ? We admit, free of duty, the traps that are necessary for the capture of wild dogs, which are a curse to the big squatting areas, but we penalize the holder of a small agricultural block by obliging him to pay a heavy duty upon the rabbit traps he needs.

                    <para>. - The honorable senator&#39;s speech was most refreshing, coming from a Protectionist. We all agree that everything possible should be done to keep down the rabbit nest. Therefore, rhapsodies upon the subject are quite beside the question. I could understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> taking up the attitude that the duty will render it difficult to deal with the pest. I always thought that Protectionists believed it better to have articles, if possible, made in their own country, because that affords a better chance of having them supplied cheaper. Such arguments as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has used would be all right from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> point of view, but I cannot understand them as coming from a Protectionist. If what he says is true of rabbit traps, which do not call for any involved manufacturing processes, what about reapers and binders and stripper harvesters&#93; </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> S. Garling, of Castlereagh-street, Sydney, stated, on the 5th March, 1920, that he had completed his arrangements for .the manufacture of a plant for turning out a patent rabbit trap, and that his factory, which would have a capacity of 2,500 traps per week, would be in full working order in five weeks from that date. The Meadowbank Manufacturing Company, New South. Wales, is also in a position to manufacture those traps. In addition, the English firm of Henry Lane, Eagle Works, Wednesfield, England, are contemplating the establishment of a factory in Australia for a similar purpose. This depends on the amount of Protection that is given on this item. </para>

                        <para>- No dog traps are being made in Australia, but rabbit traps are in abundance. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garling,</inline> of the Australian Patents Manufacturing Company, reports that his company is only in its infancy, but he expects it to go ahead. Messrs. Lowe Brothers report a. great falling-off in the demand for rabbit traps, consequent upon the drop in the price of skins. In 1920 that firm made only 236 dozen traps, valued at &#163;329. Eight men were partially employed at wages amounting to &#163;135. The output for 1921, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garling</inline> informed us, depended on the demand, and all demands will be met. This company makes chains as well as traps. Henry Lane (Australia) Limited has established a rabbit trap factory at Newcastle, with a capital of &#163;12,000 and an output capacity of 300 dozen traps per week, which can be easily increased up to 500 dozen. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanington</inline> commenced to manufacture in June, 1920, with ten hands and two partners employed. In three months last year he turned out &#163;3,600 worth of traps, and can supply a much greater quantity if demanded. These facts show that all the needs of the Commonwealth can be met without difficulty by local manufacture, and I cannot understand how any Protectionist can advocate the removal of the duty. </para>

                    <para>.- I must reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who has criticised what he regards as my conversion from, a Protectionist to a Free Trader. The honorable senator has made the very statement that I required in order to support me in my attitude on this item. He has truly said that rabbit traps are being manufactured in Australia, and very good traps they are; but their price is out o&#34;f all proportion to their value. He has also said that the demand has been supplied, but his latest information is that the demand is falling off on account of the decreased market price for skins. That is perfectly correct, but no matter how much skins may fall in price, it remains essential that rabbits shall, as far as possible, be trapped and exterminated. How can we expect trappers to pay the present high prices for traps if skins have depreciated in value by half in the last year or two? The very fact that skins have fallen in price necessitates something being done to provide the trappers with traps at a reasonable price. In the north-western portion of Tasmania valuable areas of land are being taken possession of by rabbits simply because skins have fallen in value, and the trappers cannot afford to pay the present price for traps. I urge the Minister to look at this matter from a practical point of view, so that we may prevent the ruin, which has already begun, in many districts of southern Australia. </para>

That is the sort of reasoning I have applied to every item in the Tariff, and I am glad <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> joins me on the item of rabbit traps. It is very i strange; that dog traps should be free,l while rabbit traps1 bear a heavy duty. Since that duty was imposed, the price of rabbit traps has increased by about 400 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- 1 dare say there are any number of other factors. I do not think it could be said that a 30 per cent, duty would cause a 400 per cent, increase in price. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has told ,us that there has been a great falling off <inline font-style="italic">ih.</inline> the number of rabbit traps turned out, and I am. not surprised to hear that. School boys who have been accustomed to pay i6d. for  trap3  refuse to pay 2s. 6d.. and &#39;the trapper who previously would not trouble to hunt for a lost trap will now &#39;scour the bush for one. These traps are the peculiar tool of the trapper, and I cannot see why there should be an exorbitant duty imposed. With all the factories at work, and with the high duties, the fact remains that these traps are four tunes the price they were before duties were imposed. These trappers are continually losing their traps from one cause or another, and are now faced with an outlay they cannot well afford. Despite the fact that the. rabbits are now regarded as a pest, I am inclined to think that their intelligent cultivation will yet be taken up by the Australian community. </para>

                    <para>. - In regard to the duty on whale oil, I may say that for some years a company operated on the Western Australian coast. It erected works at Point Cloates at a cost of &#163;60,000 or &#163;70,000, and at Albany at a cost of &#163;19,000 or &#163;20,000. It is proposed to renew the industry, which has been in abeyance during the last season or two. The chief competitor is Japan, and the value of imports from that country of recent years has been as follows: - 1913, &#163;19,882; 1914-15, &#163;22,814; 1915- 16, &#163;45,618; 1916-17, &#163;27,159; 1917-18, &#163;51,092. The value of our exports of whale and fish oil are set out in the official statistics as follows: - 1913, &#163;75,035; 1914-15, &#163;197,380; 1915-16, &#163;111,165;  1916-17, &#163;32,668; while in 1917-18 the value of these exports dropped to &#163;2,473. The industry is well worth encouraging, and I hope therefore that the Committee will agree to this item. </para>

                <para class="block">Tung oil, which enters into the making of varnishes, is extracted from a nut, and is produced only in China. The best varnishes are made with linseed oil, but there are certain varnishes in the manufacture of which tung oil is necessary. </para>
                <para class="block">The disadvantage of imposing a duty on that oil is that that increases the cost of the varnish in which it is used, and tends to destroy the export trade in such varnishes. It has been suggested that a rebate of the duty paid on tung oil used in the manufacture of varnishes for export should be made. That, however, would mean that the users of such varnishes abroad would obtain them for less than local users have to pay. We ought to endeavour to avoid such an anomaly. In some cases the practice has to be followed. For instance, a rebate is allowed in respect of the duty on sugar used in jam and condensed milk for export, but I fail to see why the people outside should be supplied by Australian manufacturers at prices below those charged to the local consumers. Tung oil is necessary in the manufacture of insulating and electrical varnish, which cannot be made with linseed oil. It is also used in damp-resisting compositions, lacquers for meat and jam tins, and as a dressing for hardwood. The only argument that can be used against its free importation is that it may enter into competition with linseed oil manufactured in Australia, but as the varnishes to which I have referred can be made only with tung oil, such would not be the case. I recently visited a Sydney varnish manufacturer who uses this oil, and he informed me that since the duty has been in force the export trade with China and Singapore has been lost, possibly because supplies are being obtained from America, where tung oil is admitted free. </para>

                    <para>. - I ask the Committee not to accept this request, for several reasons. The Australian varnish trade depends very largely upon linseed oil which is made here, and the manufacture of varnish in Australia is increasing. Although we are not able to supply all our requirements of linseed oil, we have to remember that the residue remaining after the linseed has been pressed, forms a valuable cattle fodder, which is greatly in demand in time of drought. The varnishes made from tung oil enter into competition with the varnishes made from linseed oil, and if the former are admitted free it is obvious that those made from tung oil would be sold at a cheaper rate. The  output of oil-cake would also be considerably reduced. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> that whoever supplied him with his information has exaggerated the position in several instances. The honorable senator said that tung oil was preferable for dressing hardwood, and, as a Western Australian, I cannot refrain from smiling at such a suggestion, because there is no better substance for dressing hardwood than linseed oil or a mixture of the boiled and raw oil. It is universally used in Western Australia, where many of the houses are constructed of hardwood. I have not heard of tung oil being used for that purpose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> has also been advised that the imposition of this duty has destroyed the export trade to the East, but that is ridiculous. It has been assumed that this duty was imposed only when this Tariff was introduced; but it has been in force for twelve years, and during that time Australian manufacturers using tung oil in varnishes have been exporting. Linseed oil has dropped, in price in the United Kingdom very substantially. As there was no export from Great Britain during the war, cur varnishes were then in demand, because the market was bare. Consequently, we were able to build up an export trade ; but now Australian varnishes have to enter into competition with those manufactured elsewhere. </para>

                        <para>- It needs something to give it a face, so that it may resist the weather, and it is the same with varnishes. Those engaged in the business say that tung oil is necessary in the preparation of some kinds of varnishes, particularly the cheaper variety. Varnishes manufactured in countries where tung oil is admitted free enter into competition with those made from linseed oil.* If we are to compete with them it must be on a common ground. It is unreasonable to suggest that the manufacture of linseed oil should be encouraged because linseed cake is a by-product, and is useful in time of drought. The quantity of linseed cake used is comparatively small when compared with copra cake. The quantity of linseed cake made in Australia is infinitesimal. </para>

I  believe  that the Government are prepared to make arrangements for a rebate on *ports, but that means only that our own people will have to pay more for  these  oils than will people outside. It may; be assumed that I have viewed the question as a Free Trader, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior,</inline> who admits the fairness of my request, is nob a  Free Trader, and has given many  votes on Protective lines. I hope1 that the Committee will support my request. </para>

                    <para>. -  A considerable change has been made in the duties imposed on this item. The item includes a number of substances which were formerly dutiable in the general Tariff at 5 per cent., and in this schedule the duty in the general Tariff is 10 per cent., or an increase of 100 per cent. When we find the word &#34;free&#34; in the British preferential column it is an indication that the articles covered by the item are not made here. Apparently these things are not made in Australia, and yet there has been a jump-up in the general Tariff duty from 5 per cent.  to  10 per cent., the purpose apparently being to give the Old Country a still greater preference than was given under previous Tariffs. I should like to know whether the Old Country is in need of this extra preference. If she is not, I see no reason for increasing the duty in the general Tariff, as it will merely have the effect  of  an extra impost upon those who use these substances. There should be some explanation of the increased preference  to  Great Britain. </para>

                    (Western Australia -  case of a commodity which both the United Kingdom and America can supply, and upon which we do not desire to impose a duty, the only way in which we can give a preference to the United Kingdom is by imposing a duty on imports from America. The articles covered by sub-item a are free from the United Kingdom, and dutiable at 10 per. cent. if imported from America. Provision has been made for a duty of 5 per cent. in the intermediate column, but that will not be operative unless it is made the subject of an agreement, so that it may give us something with which to bargain with a country to which we desire to send the products of Australia.

                <para class="block">The existing duties are 5s. 6d. British, 6s. intermediate, and 7s. general. Kalsomine is a product from kaolin or china clay; and caseine, which is necessary for the manufacture of kalsomine, is dutiable at 25 per cent. under another item in the Tariff. The effect of this duty is to reduce the protection to this industry to 121/2 per cent. It must be patent that if outside competitors can get caseine at a cheaper rate, the Australian manufacturer of kalsomine should have more adequate protection. I had an opportunity of inspecting a South Australian kalsomine industry recently, and saw a very large deposit of the china clay, as pure as could be found, I understand, anywhere in the world. This company is starting operations for the preparation of a number of kalsomine paint colours. From alumina, another product of kaolin, is manufactured a toilet powder, which is sold usually in small 1-oz. boxes for about 4s. 6d. a box. Alumina is also used for the &#34;facing&#34; of newsprint required for illustrations, and also enters largely into paint-making processes. Then from the silica is obtained that useful article of household use known as &#34; Clever Mary,&#34; besides a number of other valuable products. . </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps not the industry mentioned by the honorable senator; but others were, including the Australian Kalsomine Company, in Melbourne. The Inter-State Commission recommended that the duties be as set out in this schedule, and as 5s. 6d. in the&#39; British Tariff represents about 271/2 per cent., the general Tariff would be somewhere in the neighbourhood of 30 per cent. or 40 per cent. Since the Tariff was dealt with in another place the Department has not received a single complaint or request for consideration in regard to this particular item. Therefore, we may presume that the duty is adequate. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> not to press his request. </para>

                    <para>. - After seeing what is being done by the company to which I refer, working under comparatively crude methods, I realize that this is an opportunity to encourage the development of an important industry. Therefore, I feel inclined to press my request. I omitted to mention that the clay produces an exceedingly fine white tile. Other deposits produce a tile which, when burnt, is creamy in colour; but the tile produced from this particular deposit is pure white, and the kalsomine paint will stand every test. I saw a sheet of galvanized iron which had been painted with it and exposed to the sun&#39;s rays and other weather conditions for nine months, and then the colour was as! bright as when first put on. This Tariff is framed for the purpose of encouraging Australian industries, and I ask honorable senators to support my request. </para>

                    <para>. - As no doubt most honorable senators are aware, for many years there has been an agitation to regulate, and in many cases prohibit, the use of lead paint, because of the danger of lead poisoning. It is a serious danger in Australia, where the heat quickly extracts the oil, and the residual chalks or powders have been carried to the mouth from the hands of persons handling articles that had been painted, with very serious consequences, in many instances. The use of lead paints is absolutely prohibited in France and Holland and in some of the South American countries. In many other countries the regulations governing their use are very severe. A Royal Commission which sat in England before the war also recommended the practical prohibition of the -&#39;use of lead paints, but the war intervening upset everything in this respect for the time being. In Queensland, the British Medical Association has been assisting the Operative Painters&#39; Union in an endeavour to get the State Government to prohibit the use of lead paints in certain circumstances. The present Tariff is so framed that it unduly taxes the non-poisonous and high-grade material, and practically encourages the use of the cheaper, low-grade article which ia most dangerous, inasmuch as it has less body and is more soluble. Under the old Tariff, lead or zinc in oil was dutiable at 5s. per cwt. against Great Britain and 6s. per cwt. general. The new specific rates are 8s. and 10s. per cwt., an increase of 3s. per cwt., or 60 per cent., and 4s. per cwt., or 66&#167; per cent., surely a sufficient increase for even the most ardent Protectionist. However, a further <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate has been added, viz., 25 per cent, against Great Britain and 35 per cent, general. As the present f.o.b. price of pure white lead in Great Britain and the United States of America is about &#163;70 per ton, this <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty works out at 19s. 3d. per cwt. against Great Britain and 27s. per cwt. general, or an increase of 285 per  cent.  and 350 per cent, respectively. Again, as the present f.o.b. price of zinc, the non poisonous material, ground in oil, is about &#163;90 per ton, the new <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates work out at 24s. 9d. per cwt. against Great Britain and 34s. 8d. per cwt. general, or an increase on the 1914 Tariff rates of 395 per cent, and 587^ per cent, respectively. This prohibitive Tariff on the zinc or non-poisonous paints encourages the use of the cheaper lead paint, which is a dangerous article, and is a serious handicap to the painting trade, and harmful to the operatives engaged in that trade. In order to bring the non poisonous lines into more general use, I suggest that the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty upon them should be at least half the duty fixed for the poisonous article. The local white lead manufacturers have taken every advantage of the present prohibitive duty. I paid a visit recently to the largest white lead manufacturing establishment in Australia, controlled by Messrs. Lewis Berger and Sons, of Sydney, where a great number of men are employed, and in which a considerable capital has been invested. Their selling rates are just keeping under the fluctuating prices prevailing in the .Old World. In 1914 pig lead was selling at about &#163;18 per ton, and white lead in oil, after the payment of &#163;5 per ton in duty, at &#163;25 per ton. To-day white lead cannot be bought at under &#163;80 per ton, or pure zinc in oil at under &#163;100 per ton. While I realize the necessity of encouraging local industries, in order to utilize to the full the labour available, I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that for every man employed in making white lead, at least ten are required for its application, and if it can be shown that the health and even the lives of these operatives, are endangered by the maintenance of this industry against the zinc white industry, that is a matter we ought to take into consideration. </para>

                <para>We desire to bring before your notice the grave danger in which our trade stands by reason of an iniquitous Tariff on the importation of white lead and non-poisonous paints. Owing to this <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty imposed by the Federal Government, the cost&#39; of non-poisonous paints will be increased to such an extent that it will become impossible to use &#39;them. The result of this will bc to increase the use of white lead paints, which are detrimental to the health of the operatives, and the use of which it is our earnest desire should be discontinued. By the imposition of, the above Tariff it makes it practically impossible to either use or advocate the non-poisonous product. The dangers attendant upon the use of white lead paints are fully realized in the older countries, and France, Holland, Belgium, and South America have prohibited their use and manufacture. The dangers accruing are so real that it is our desire that every member of the Federal Government should be approached and asked to pledge himself to have this <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> Tariff removed, allowing said products to come in under the old rates, namely, the duty to be left at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;8</inline> per ton Great Britain, and &#163;10 per ton general. This would give the local makers an extra protection of &#163;3 and &#163;4 per ton, in addition to the extra freight protection on pre-war rates of &#163;3 10s. per ton.

Not a single extra ounce of zinc white, or a single ounce less of white lead would be used. </para>

                        <para>- Zinc white is being made by the Electrolytic Zinc Works at Hobart. The local manufacture of zinc white would be injured by accepting the honorable senator&#39;s suggestion. We can best promote the use of zinc white instead of white lead, by encouraging its manufacture in Australia. If we destroyed the local manufacture of the article, there would be no one in the Commonwealth interested in its use, except importers. I have some evidence as to the effects of white lead. I have that of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Nash</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Graham,</inline> who do not agree with a great deal that has been said about it, and that of the Association of Architects, in New South Wales, who combat the argument that zinc white should be used in preference to white lead. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The question of prohibiting the use of white lead is to come up before the League of Nations, and the Commonwealth Government are at the present time engaged in selecting their representative. The trade unions, the employers, and the Commonwealth Government will be separately represented, and the League will consider what action the nations as a whole shall take. It is by , no means admitted that white lead paint is harmful under proper conditions. The Architects Association has pointed out that many commodities of this kind, that used to be harmful in the old days, are&#39; under modern conditions quite harmless. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> will certainly not gain his ends by the means he proposes, and, therefore, I suggest that he do not press this request. </para>

                    <para>. -  I have considerable sympathy with the ethical object that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> wishes to accomplish. There is, I think, evidence that lead paint has caused some sickness and death. For what it is worth, I give a statement made in a circular issued by the New South Wales branch of the Operative Painters and Decorators Union of Australia, to the effect that the dangers attendant on the use of white lead paint are fully realized in the older countries; and that France, Holland, Belgium, and South America have prohibited its use and manufacture. I, however, agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that the method proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> will not much help that honorable senator in the direction he desires. I take it that he wishes to have duties differentiating between white lead paint and zinc paint, the duties to be the lower on the latter commodity. The controversy over this question has been going on in New South Wales for over twelve months, and during that time very strong letters have been received by some of us from manufacturers of zinc white in Sydney. Amongst others, there is a firm which carries on what are known as the Mascot Smelting Works, and which on the 27th September, a year ago, wrote stating that it had invested a capital of &#163;20,000 or &#163;30,000 in a factory for the manufacture of zinc white, and that any attempted alteration of the duties in the direction of differentiating in favour of imported zinc white would very substantially and seriously interfere with the industry that had just been established in order to provide this non poisonous paint. Inasmuch as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> will not accomplish his object by, the request he has submitted, and inasmuch as there are several firms here which have entered upon the manufacture of zinc white for the purpose of competing with the white lead paint, this problem may, to some extent, solve itself with the further development of zinc paint production. I understand that the prices of the two compounds are much the same. I hope that, as a result of that development, the operative painters in New South Wales will be able to obtain an efficient substitute if they want it, seeing that the result of scientific investigation suggests that it may be better from every stand-point to use zinc white than white lead paint. </para>

                    <para>.- I really think the Senate ought to give some consideration to the humane proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.</inline> At this time of day no one will question that the continuous use of white lead paint is unhealthy, and that zinc white is an efficient substitute. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> is endeavouring to give preference to zinc white by making it really the cheaper paint; and if he succeeds that will bring zinc white into more general use. The trade unions interested have been giving considerable attention to the question of the use of this poisonous substance, which for many years has made sad inroads on their membership. With increasing intelligence, they are determined to prevent, as far as possible, the use of such substances ; and on that ground alone I shall be found supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.</inline> I think this Chamber should give its first attention to the health of the people it represents. </para>

                        request would, I think, have met with more favour if it had not been shown that a very determined effort is being made in Australia to meet a difficulty that has&#39; prevailed in the painting trade for many years. I desire to refer to one effort in this direction, and not only in connexion with zinc oxide. For the first time in the history of Australia, a company which carries on operations at Risdon, on the banks of the Derwent, near Hobart, have solved the problem of producing a snow-white paint which retains its whiteness longer than does white lead paint, and is absolutely harmless. The plant for the production of this paint has been considerably extended, and I am given to understand that in a short time the company will be able to supply it in such quantities as may lead to the practical disappearance of white lead paint.

                    <para>. - Ship&#39;s anti-fouling composition is really a paint. The preferential duty is 4s. per cwt.; it has remained the same since 1908. Is that rate reasonable or fair? I do not think it is high enough. The composition, I understand, is worth &#163;9 per cwt., so that the British Tariff is equivalent to only a little more than 2 per cent. The composition is made in Australia. Seeing that reasonable protection has been afforded in respect of other varieties of paint, I fail to see the fairness of these rates. I understand that the Australian manufacturers have made strong representations to the Minister for Trade and Customs, but that their case has not succeeded with the Government. </para>

                    <para>. - The question of protecting the industry with higher rates of duty has been fully considered. The painting of ships with anti-fouling composition is a rather considerable local industry; and the Government do not wish to drive it away from Australia. An application was made  to  the Inter-State Commission by a Sydney manufacturer for an increase in duty of 2s. 6d.per gallon, which is equal to 25s. per cwt. But the Commission recommended that the rates should remain at 4s. and 4s. 6d., on the ground that the amount of employment in the manufacture of the composition, if all requirements were locally met, would be inappreciable compared with that involved in the docking and painting of vessels. Messrs. Chas. Atkins and Company, of Melbourne, applied in February last for a higher duty on ship&#39;s anti-fouling composition on the ground that the firm was able to cater for the requirements of the Commonwealth. A similar application was made some time ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLeod,</inline> of Sydney. Inquiries from the Melbourne Harbor Board and the Commonwealth Line of Steamers revealed that one of the local products was of poor quality, and that another had not been long enough in use to prove its value. In another instance, however, a small trial had been made by the Union Steam-ship Company. . The composition had stood the test under water for several months, and had shown every sign of being satisfactory. Upon the whole of the evidence, however - which, though incomplete, was not encouraging - the Department felt that it was not justified at the time in increasing the rates of duty. The Minister for Trade and Customs personally went into the whole subject. </para>

                    <para>The duty passed on 16th June was not the original proposal of the Government, but was the result of an amendment asked for by the Minister for Trade and Customs without any previous notice to the Committee, and without any facts or information for an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> alternative being disclosed. There was only the bare statement that it was to protect the higher qualities of varnish manufactured in the Commonwealth, and the amendment was agreed to on the voices. The effect of the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> alternative is to alter the incidence of the Tariff by 75 per cent. to 350 per cent. above the fixed duty on the different grades of varnishes imported. It imposes  a  crushing burden on the coachbuilding, motor, and painting trades, which require to use high class varnish, the quality of which is not obtainable in the Commonwealth; and it is a heavy blow to British trade. The present Tariff is not Protection, but prohibition, and as the highest prices quoted by Australian manufacturers were, under the old Tariff, 25 per cent. to 50 per cent. lower than the imported goods, there could be no question of unfair competition. The following will disclose the position clearly, being  a  shipment just landed, 29th July, 1921, <inline font-style="italic">ex</inline> s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Omar: -</inline> 938 galls. varnish (net value &#163;1,023 13s. 6d.), old duty, 2s. 6d. per gall.; equal to &#163;1175s. </para>

                        <para>- I ask whether the increases which have been made are not disproportionately heavy. There is no reason why the duty should be raised 350 per cent, simply because the varnish to which it applies happens to be a good one. There are many honest tradesmen in this country. If they are working on a good job, and are getting a reasonable price, they will use the good and expensive varnish as a matter of pride and principle. It would be interesting to go through the various debates conducted in the Commonwealth Legislature upon Tariff matters, and .to study the views there expressed with respect to the duties on varnish. The trade itself originally asked for duties of ls. and ls. 6d. per gallon only. Yet enormous increases, reaching a? high as lis. per gallon, have been imposed at the behest of the Minister for Trade and Customs. There is only one test of varnish, and that is. the test of wear. Until that has  been  applied, a cheap varnish will look practically as good as a costly one. I would not object to the imposition of a .fixed rate, so long, of course, as it was reasonable. The trade would know then where it stood. I would not object to a moderate concession by way of a reduction of the British preferential Tariff. The rate of 25 per cent, is altogether out of reason. I would consider 15 per cent, a fair thing. There is no extraordinarily valuable machinery required, for the manufacture of varnish; nor are there great numbers of employees engaged in its production. Little skill is required in its manufacture, which is merely concerned with ingredients quickly and easily mixed. Here is an attempt to shut out of Australia a varnish that we cannot replace. I am not one of those who say that an English article is better than an Australian one. I should be very glad if we produced varnishes that could compete with those made in Great Britain; but men in the trade who know what they are talking about tell me that those who want, to give a good return for the money they receive will use a high-class varnish, even if it is loaded to the extent of this huge <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, which works out at lis. per gallon. Such an impost is unreasonable, and I hope that the Minister will agree to move a request either that the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate under the British preferential Tariff be reduced to 15 per cent., or that we have only a reasonably heavy fixed duty. I fail to understand why we should impose on the superior article a higher duty than is levied on one of inferior quality. What would happen if a duty of, say, 14s. a gallon on first-grade whisky and a duty of only 13s. per gallon on inferior whisky were proposed? Messrs. Harland and Son, whose high class varnishes are very largely imported, are very badly treated under this item.We should have the same duty on the high-class varnishes that we impose on those of inferior quality. If the Minister is not prepared to agree to that, I shall move a request that the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty under the British preferential Tariff he reduced to 15 per cent. </para>

                    <para>.- The varnish-making industry is well established in Australia. There are six factories in New South Wales, sixteen in Victoria, one in Queensland, two in South Australia, one in Western Australia, and one in Tasmania. Under the 1914 Tariff the duty on imports from the United Kingdom was 2s. 6d. per gallon. That rate has not been altered. At one time the compositions from which varnishes were made were imported only in liquid form, so that a fixed rate of duty at so much per gallon was practicable, but the introduction of compositions in powder form made it desirable to change to an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> basis. New South Wales has a larger output of varnish than any other State, and one company carrying on business there has a contract with the Government railways for the supply of 18,000 gallons per annum. That fact alone should convince the Committee that the industry is worth protecting. As to the reason for the imposition of these <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties which has led to a protest on behalf of the importers, I may say that complaints have been made to the Department regarding the practice of certain varnish manufacturers in the United States of America who send varnish to Australia in a &#34;heavy&#34; or &#34;paste&#34; form, which is broken down here by the addition of &#34;thinners&#34; to the extent of 3 to 1. The &#34; thinners &#34; are said to come in free, so that the duty paid on one gallon of heavy varnish would actually represent the payment on 4 gallons. That was an ingenious means of overcoming the specific duty. In consequence of that practice it was decided to impose alternative <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties of 25 per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per cent., in order to give the local industry, not more protection, but the same that it had hitherto enjoyed. In the circumstances, I think the passing of the duties as they stand is justifiable. </para>

Coming to the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> a communication has been sent to me by the Master Painters and Decorators Association of Victoria stating that the local manufacturers of varnish sell their productions at prices ranging from 25 per cent. to nearly 100 per cent. lower than the British-made article, but that- </para>

                <para class="block">The association protests strongly against the imposition of these <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties on the ground that they unnecessarily increase the cost of varnishes that they must in any circumstances import.

                    <para>. - I intend to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> request, because, after having given this matter some consideration, I have for the first time been brought face to face with what an alternative duty means. The increases quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> are astounding, and when one recognises that under a duty of 2s. 6d. per gallon local manufacturers of varnishes have been able to sell to the Australian users their products at 25 per cent. less than the imported article, it is extraordinary that the Government have attempted to impose a duty that would, on the higher-grade varnishes, reach11s. per gallon. This is not Protection, but prohibition, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> is correct in saying that the master painters of Australia find it essential to use the best varnishes available for their higher -grade work. I am anxious to. assist the local manufacturers to retain the ground they have gained, and to extend their operations under reasonable protection; but surely it is not necessary to impose duties ranging from 5s. 101/2d. to l1s. per gallon instead of 2s. 6d. per gallon, as was proposed when the schedule was introduced. There is no justification for penalizing reputable British firms by imposing such heavy duties merely because the Customs authorities have ascertained that certain American manufacturers have endeavoured to evade the duties by exporting varnishes in a thick state and thinning them down here. I hold no brief for William Harland and Sons, but I know their varnishes can always be relied upon, and are exclusively used in all high-grade work. The request is a moderate one, and means that instead of imposing 25 per cent., a duty of 15 per cent. will be charged, and that on the better classes of varnish will return about double what was proposed when the schedule was introduced. On the best varnishes it will be about 6s. instead of 2s. 6d. per gallon, and that is going a long way towards meeting the financial necessities of the Commonwealth, and at the same time doubling the protection to the local manufacturers. </para>
