                        <para>- I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether, in view of the fact that New Zealand is a sister Dominion, inhabited by our own kith and kin, the Government will, at an early date, make reciprocal trade arrangements such as would tend towards the most friendly feeling between these two far-flung outposts of the British Empire, instead of treating New Zealand as a foreign Power, as has apparently been done in the Customs Tariff Bill? </para>

                        <para>- The answer is: -  1 and 2. Under the joint Commonwealth and State immigration scheme, the States declare  to the Commonwealth the number of immigrants they require. The figures mentioned cover approximately the number of immigrants requisitioned for, by the States for this year. Every effort has been made by the Commonwealth to induce the States to increase their immigration activities; but as they have not done so, I must assume that they cannot, under existing circumstances, absorb larger numbers. It was these facts, amongst others, that the Prime Minister had in his mind at the time he spoke. The recent Premiers' Conference favorably considered proposals, which, it is hoped, will, before long, achieve satisfactory results. But he has stated that what he desired, and what the Commonwealth could absorb, was not less than 100,000 per annum. </para>

                    <para>. - When this item was last under consideration in this Chamber the Committee decided to request a reduction of the duty in the British preferential column from 25 per cent, to 15per cent., leaving the duties of 30 and 35 per cent, in the intermediate and general columns untouched. The item was very fully discussed here, and it is unnecessary that I should detain the Committee by reiterating the arguments used in support of the Government proposal. There is, however, one point to which I think it well to refer. It does seem to me that if by means of a Protective Tariff, we desire to stimulate Australian industries, we should put forth every effort to induce local manufacturers to make the best articles, and should not give such protection as will enable them only to produce inferior articles. The manufacturers of varnish contend that a protection of 15 per cent., as proposed by the Senate would make it impossible for them to compete in the manufacture of the higher grades of varnish. For this reason I ask the Committee to bring this item more into conformity with the general level of the Tariff. An <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 15 per cent, is merely an anomaly in a Tariff the average of which is much higher. I move - </para>

                <para class="block">I submit the amendment with a view to effecting a compromise. The matter has reached a stage at which I consider a compromise might very fairly be made. The Committee's view of ample protection for the varnish industry was 15 per cent. on imports from Great Britain. In the opinion of another place, the British preferential duty should be 25 per cent. I intend to submit a modification making the duty in the British preferential column 20 per cent. A huge factory is not required for the manufacture of varnish. I could produce gallons of varnish at a very cheap rate. The duties proposed would not amount to much on low grade varnishes. A good varnish is worth about £2 per gallon, and a duty of 25 per cent, on that would amount to 10s. per gallon. I venture to say that the whole cost of producing a gallon of varnish would not be much in excess of that amount. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> has very properly reminded the Committee that this item was discussed fully on the previous occasion, and I am anxious to learn whether honorable senators will be willing to deal with it in the way in which, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> they dealt with some other items last evening, when that honorable senator submitted amendments in the way of compromise. I personally believe that a duty of 15 per cent, on varnish imported from Great Britain is too high, but I am willing to try to meet the view expressed in another place by proposing a compromise which should be acceptable to both Houses. It is not in this case asking honorable senators to go back upon what they have already done, but asking them to maintain what the Senate has already done. And I think  it is not unreasonable to look to a majority in the Committee to assist the minority to maintain what the Senate thought right. I remember that on one occasion in the New South Wales Parliament the members of the Government permitted a Bill for the payment of members, introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Daniel</inline> O'Connor, to pass as a private. Bill. . The Upper House rejected the measure, and then <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes made it possible for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor</inline> to introduce his Bill as a Government measure, because, although <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes was opposed to payment of members, he did not consider that the Upper House should he allowed to treat the opinion of the Legislative Assembly in the way it had done. The Senate lias met another place in a most generous way. "We have agreed to 400 items as' proposed by another place, and have asked for modifications in only about ninety items. Very few of our suggestions have been adopted, and when another place insists upon standing hard and fast to its original decisions on items upon which we have disagreed, the Senate should take some action. I am well aware that the powers of the two Houses are clearly defined in these matters. I know something about varnish, and I am satisfied that, if we made the duty very much higher than is proposed, it would not induce local manufacturers to make the higher qualities of varnish. ' What those in the business want is to keep out good varnish, so that inferior varnishes manufactured here may be used. </para>

                    <para>. Varnish  quite  good enough for all practical purposes can be, and is being, made in Australia. A duty of 15 per cent, against varnish imported from Great Britain is not sufficient protection to enable the Australian manufacturers to carry ou their business. Varnish is made entirely from imported materials. </para>

If Australian varnishes are good enough for such requirements, they should meet all our ordinary needs. I cannot agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that because the other Chamber has not accepted some of our suggestions we should refuse to further negotiate.

                        <para>- Yes. A really good varnish must be used for that purpose if a fine finish is to be preserved for any length of time. I realize that good varnish is expensive, but ordinary varnish is quite sufficient for ordinary work, such as the. finishing of railway, carriages.

                        <para>- I realize that the Old Country has an . advantage over Australia through trading in a sensible way. To enable £40,000 to be distributed in wages by Australian manufacturers, about £60,000 has to be paid in duties, so that ordinary linseed oil may be manufactured here. It is useless to attempt what is impossible, and therefore I am not asking for no duty on varnish, but I am suggesting that as a fair compromise the Committee, should fix the rate at 20 per cent., which is midway between the duties asked for by the two Chambers. </para>

                    <para>. - I recognise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> very reasonable desire to arrive at a compromise, but having made such an excellent start, he should go a little further. It may come as a revelation to the honorable senator when I tell him that I have seen correspondence from officials of the South Australian Railway Department, and one of the responsible officers of the Tramways Trust in Adelaide, showing that they had obtained samples of Australian-made varnish, and, without intimating to the manufacturers what they were doing, had tested the article in their workshops, first, with regard to its appearance, and then as to its utility in service. The opinion they formed was that the Australian varnish was equal to the best imported article. </para>

                        <para>- I imagine that, for railway and tramway work, a very good varnish that would provide a fine finish and harden well would be required. Seeing that the duty on linseed oil has been raised 50 cent., from 6d. to 9d., and the duty on other ingredients in varnish manufacture has been raised, 15 per cent, cannot be regarded as an effective measure of protection for this industry. For that reason I ask the Committee to support my motion. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to correct an impression' that may be gathered from the remarks of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen).</inline> I certainly did speak of inferior varnish, but I corrected myself by adding that locally-made varnish was good enough for ordinary work. I have no doubt that for such purposes Australian varnishes are as good as any others, just as Australian wines are equal to rival brands. Nevertheless, I do not think anybody would claim that Australia has yet reached that pitch of perfection in wine-making which France has attained. As far as good varnishes are concerned, a percentage duty means a much higher rate than a fixed duty, and the fixed duty applies to the inferior varnishes, because of the price at which they can be purchased abroad. There is no exorbitant duty on the varnishes that are mostly made, but there is three or four times as much duty on the higher grade varnishes. </para>

                <para>It has been stated that in South Australia there are two distinct deposits of white marble, and it is affirmed that it is suitable for statuary purposes. Apart from the desire to encourage the use of our own materials, it is extremely difficult to determine if marble is imported for statuary or other purposes, and, as the duties are fixed on a low scale, I suggest that it is not worth while dividing the item, and multiplying the administrative work of the Customs Department without any corresponding advantage in the way of revenue. </para>

Notwithstanding all that has been said in this Chamber as to the quality of Australian marble, we must fall hack upon our own personal experiences. Can any honorable senator say that we have in Australia any marble equal in quality to the Carrara marble for statuary purposes? The answer is No. If we consult any person in the trade we shall be told over and over again that up to date at all events, no Australian marble to compare with the Italian product has been found. </para>

                        <para>- We have the inexpert evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior,</inline> but no other evidence, that South Australia can produce a marble suitable for statuary purposes. This sample is full of black, pencil-like seams. Marble has been free hitherto, and we should not now impose any duties upon it. We have only to recall the evidence given before Commission after Commission on this question to realize that so far we have nothing to compare with the Italian product. It is admitted that for general purposes the Australian marble is very good indeed, but for statuary and works of art designed to elevate the tastes of the people there is nothing to compare with Carrara marble. Take Australia House. Is there any marble in that building equal in quality to Carrara ? There is every variety, it is true - red, black, and speckled, and all the rest of it, but nothing to compare in beauty with Carrara. There is only one place in the world where this beautiful, pure white marble is found, and that is Italy. Let us face the facts. We must admit that Australia has not to date produced a marble suitable for statuary purposes. </para>

                        <para>- I have consulted men in the business, who certainly know more about the quality of marble than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> does, and they all say we have not the finer white marble in Australia. Nevertheless, the Government want to compel our people to make statuary out of such materials as we have. It is quite true that we can make statuary out of mud or granite, or any substance that -will hold together, but for the statuary that will appeal to the finer tastes of the people, to the aesthetic side of their natures, we must have Carrara marble. Is there one piece of statuary made from Australian marble in this building ? We want to tear the cobwebs from our eyes in this matter, and get away from this insane doctrine of shutting out the best that the world can produce in the belief that by encouraging the use of some Australian product we are doing something to develop the artistic tastes of the people. </para>

                        <para>- I refer the honorable senator to any sculptor, and I challenge him to prove that there is. I have not done any globe-trotting since I have been in this country, because I have been too busy trying to earn an honest living, but I ask any globe-trotting honorable senators to say if there is any marble in Australia House, London, to compare with Carrara. The answer is No. Why, then, do we circumscribe our position and hinder the work of our sculptors by encouraging the use of the inferior product when there is available to us this pure and rare product from Italy.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator SENIOR</inline> (South Australia) [11.45]. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> refused to examine the specimens of marble I have placed before the Committee. He could not distinguish between a stain and a lead pencil mark, so superficial was his gaze. He condemned the stone as being not equal in whiteness to Carrara marble, because of a lead pencil stain. He asked whether there was a statue in Australia made of Australian marble. I replied, " Yes." What I am saying is supported by the marble workers in Adelaide, who inform me that marble from Italy is shipped as ballast and enters into competition with Australian marble. A large quantity of marble has been sent to Australia House from Angaston, South Australia, and it is there to-day. At Macclesfield, in South Australia, there is a marble equal in whiteness to Carrara marble, and very nearly as fine in texture. I venture to say that it is equal, for general statuary purposes, to Carrara marble. To allow the Carrara marble to come in for statuary purposes will also mean admitting it for commercial purposes. It is not possible to keep track of a piece of marble after it has entered this * country. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the Committee will persist in its  request.  The quantity of marble involved is very small. Very little white marble is required for statuary purposes in Australia, so why should not Australia have the best the world can produce for this purpose? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> claims that South Australia produces a marble equal to the very best in the world, and he has submitted, in support of his allegation, several specimens. I have had a look at them, and, without professing to be an expert, I can say that they appear to be nice and white; but I would describe them as " coarse white quartz." I have seen granite polished beautifully, but no one would dream of calling it marble, although I have known it to be sold as marble. I do not doubt that the producers of the article in South Australia have induced <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> to invest in it as marble. Many other men  with as much technical knowledge and experience as he possesses have probably been taken down in the same way. 1 have- a small knowledge of quartz, having had some technical training in the Adelaide University, and on appearance, without test, these specimens look very like quartz. Even if they be marble, it is not of the same quality as Carrara marble. It is not the class of marble that would be used for art purposes. Why should the Committee not encourage the use of the very best materials for educational purposes? We hope that what our workers in marble produce will be equal to the very best in the world. Then why not encourage them to use the best material the world can offer by giving it to them free of duty ? </para>

A most rudimentary knowledge of quartz and marble would have told him that marble <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> carbonate of lime, and that quartz is silica. Marble can be tested in a moment by hydrochloric acid. . The acid, when brought into contact with the marble, will act upon it, and give off a gas. Any member of the Committee is welcome to test the specimens I have produced with hydrochloric acid. The test will prove whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman's</inline> knowledge is knowledge, or whether what he has said was only a guess.

                        <para>- I tested them by several means. ! would not assure the Committee that they are marble if I did not know them to be marble. There are marble deposits all over Australia that have been tested again and again. The stone would not have been sent to AustraliaHouse without being tested. It seems to me that nothing short of a blow on the head with it will convince the honorable senator that it is hard. Vessels that bring Carrara marble to Australia bring it as ballast, and to make up for the light weight of certain cargo. Is the Committee going to be unpatriotic enough to allow the product of the cheap labour of Italy to compete with the Australian product, especially when it is shipped in such conditions? </para>

If the duty is unreasonably low, the way will be open for foreign producers to export large quantities to Australia, and it will then come into competition with the Australian marble used for general purposes.

                    <para>. - I was very much interested in the exhibits of South Australian marble produced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior,</inline> and I think they should be laid on the table of the Senate. The material appears to me to be too quartz like and too brittle for work of a fine character. What would honorable senators think if I produced a. miniature piece of ice and called it an Australian diamond? I believe some would say that it was an excellent sample, and I believe it would be just as good a specimen of a diamond as that submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> is of first class marble. Every reputable firm in Australia using Carrara marble has notified honorable senators that they desire to have the duty removed, because they cannot obtain in Australia the material they require. I have in my office statements from every firm in Australia - including those  in New South. Wales which I know something about- that the Australian marble is unsuitable for statuary purposes. Who is to be the judge? Is it those who have to work the material, or men such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> who own a quarry? </para>

I believe that the output of New South Wales is greater than that of all the other States combined, and its quality is magnificent; but I am not going to say that it is suitable for purposes other than those I have mentioned. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> in his desire to get the best at the cheapest price, and I do not wish to assist in placing the best beyond the reach of those who have to use it. Why should not students be able to practice on, and become acquainted with the various textures of, all marbles used in monumental work so that they will be able to produce work equal to that of the fine old artists ? </para>

It is only a matter of a few months, and the alteration has been made.  because it was thought that the industry was not in a position to supply a reasonable quantity of this material within that time.

                <para>The duties originally fixed by another place were 25 per cent., 25 per cent., and 35 per cent, respectively. The Senate requested another place to reduce the rates on arsenate of lead to 10 per cent., 15 per cent., and 20 per cent. Arsenic, which is the material principally used in arsenate of lead, has been made dutiable by both Houses at 25 per cent., 25 per cent., and 35 per cent., and it appears to be an anomaly to place a. higher duty on the raw material than that proposed on the manufactured article. For that reason I ask the Committee to support the motion I have submitted. The production of arsenate of lead has made considerable strides during and since the war period. It is said by Customs officers that the local manufacturers are now in a position to supply the Australian requirements, and are doing so at a price lower than that charged for the imported article. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I point out that, under the request made by the Senate, if the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties originally proposed by another place were higher than the specific duties suggested by the Senate, the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties would be imposed. In these times, when prices are constantly changing, it is very difficult to say when a specific duty will be higher or lower than an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. In this matter the Senate has not received fair treatment from another place. We are new asked to go beyond the duties originally imposed by another place merely because the request made by the Senate has provided the opportunity to propose an increase in the duties. I enter my protest against the motion. </para>

                        <para>- If another place declines to accept suggestions we made, honorable senators complain of a lack of consideration for the Senate. When another place has fallen in with our views, or has submitted a modification of a Senate request, we are told that our request has been used as a means to raise a duty. In order to relieve another place of this very serious imputation, honorable senators may reject what is now proposed, and go back to their request; but I point out that honorable members in another place have made an effort to meet the views of the Senate. They evidently thought that duties of 20, 25, and 30 per cent, would be sufficiently high on this item, but the Senate asked for duties representing 100 per cent. Another place has proposed  a <inline font-style="italic">via media,</inline> and is now accused of using our request in order to raise these duties. </para>

                        <para>- No. The modification proposed by another place makes no provision for the alternative. If it is agreed to, there will be no question of a higher or lower duty, but the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties proposed by another place will replace the specific duties suggested by the Senate. The view of the matter apparently taken by another place was that the Senate desires higher duties on lactose than they originally considered necessary, but they are prepared to meet us by going more than half way along the road, and, therefore, propose to lift the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties they originally suggested to 30, 35, and 40 per cent. They are not inclined evidently to agree to the 100 per cent, duty which honorable senators desired to impose on this particular article. The modification of the Senate's request made by another place is a reasonable effort to adjust the difference of opinion on the subject between the two Houses. </para>

                    <para>. - Those competent to express an opinion on this subject are the persons who are directly and financially concerned in the manufacture of lactose. What do they say about these <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties? They tell us that, during the war, importers of this article were getting 4s. 6d. per lb. for it, and they are now prepared to dump it into Australia for a. few pence per lb. When we considered the matter previously, I told honorable senators that the manufacture of lactose is a side line ' of the dairying industry, and I reminded them that the Commonwealth and State Governments have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds in settling returned soldiers on irrigation blocks to carry on the dairying industry. If Australia is to be made a dumping ground by importers of this article, the local industry cannot he carried on. The Senate requested the imposition of specific duties of 6d., 9d., and ls. per lb. on lactose, and I personally tried to induce honorable senators to agree to duties of 9d.. ls., and ls. 3d. per lb. The Department presented such a case to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and (that Minister made such a plea for me to accept the modification, that I very reluctantly did so. If the other Chamber had been conversant with the effect of this alteration of duty, it would not have agreed to it. Within the last hour I have received a note from the manager of a cooperative company which contemplates establishing a factory at Murray Bridge for the manufacture of lactose. Such a factory would enable1 the returned soldiers settled in that locality to get the full benefit of their efforts in. connexion' with dairying. </para>

Has any proof been given that the Committee was wrong? If it  is necessary to protect this industry in the interests of soldiers, we should do so. Owing to the collapse in the market for the output of the primary producers, their prospects are anything but good, and we should be anxious to do anything we can to prevent returned soldiers who have been settled on the land sustaining failure.

                    <para>. - I have nothing to say against the arguments advanced in opposition to my motion, but they surprise me, coming from the honorable senators who venture to put them forward. Throughout this debate there has been a certain line of demarcation between groups of senators. A number of senators, with considerable consistency, have contended for a lower range of duties, and they have claimed to be reasonable and sane Protectionists. Sanity, as they understand it, means putting a very low duty on some items, which may concern certain interests, while they impose high duties on others. But that is not sanity. </para>

                        <para>- I favour a fiscal policy which is fairly reasonable and uniform, not a policy which picks out certain industries for favours which are denied to others. That is making the Tariff a means for the distribution of public benefits. Much has been said of the imports coming here, and it is contended that the proposed duties will save soldier settlement. I would point out that the value of the imports of lactose in 1919-20 was only £20. The question is whether a duty of 30 per cent., 35 per  cent.,  and 40 per cent, is a reasonable measure of protection. The low  Tariffists  say "No," and they want over 100 per cent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> who has been a consistent low Tariffist,  but has been in communication with representatives of this particular industry in his own State, wants, not 100 per cent., but in the neighbourhood of 150 per cent. If there is such a thing as reasonable protection, it is not represented by 150 per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - The duties fixed in this item were the result of a compromise when last it was debated in this Chamber. There was a proposal by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> for a higher range of duties, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who was in charge, suggested the compromise which is represented by the Senate's request. I have not heard anything to justify any change in the attitude adopted on that occasion. It is true that during the war we had to pay 4s. 6d. per lb. for this article. At that price a duty of 6d. would not have been too high; but to-day the price is somewhere in the vicinity of ls., and it is suggested that, in consequence, the duty of 6d. is too high. It all depends on what the price of ls. means. If it means what I am informed it does mean, namely, that an effort is being made to keep down the price in order to introduce the commodity from abroad, there is every justification for the retention of the higher duty. I am not prepared to give an authoritative opinion on the subject, because I have not received much information, but, on the information supplied by the Government and other honorable senators, I know of no reason why I should alter my view. The request made by this Chamber was a reasonable one. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> is inclined to accuse honorable senators - I know he has me in his mind  - of blowing hot and cold on this question of high or low duties. I have endeavoured to explain before that, in the fixing of duties, my object all the time has been to fix what, in the circumstances" of the case, may be regarded as a reasonable duty, neither a higher range nor a lower range, but a range sufficient to give an adequate measure of protection to the industry without injuriously affecting the primary industries of this country. That is the attitude I have adopted all through the Tariff debate, and that is the attitude I shall assume to the end. If the circumstances call for high duties, I shall vote for them. If, on the other hand, the circumstances demand low duties, I shall vote for low duties. In this case I have not yet been convinced that the request made by the Senate is unreasonable, and until further information has been furnished why we should change our opinions I propose to adhere to my previously expressed view. </para>

                    <para>. - I have very grave doubts as to how I should vote on this item, as I do not know how I voted on the last occasion. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> has said is literally true. When this proposal was before the Chamber previously, the compromise agreed to was suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> While I am not prepared to vote for wild duties of 150 per cent., we should consider what may happen to this industry if _ America dumps 90 tons of this product into New Zealand and Australia. That will be a serious matter. It will result in the closing of the factory at Murray Bridge, South Australia. I feel, therefore, that I am on the horns of a dilemma. I do not want to vote for high duties, and yet I do not wish to see this Australian industry closed up. I do not know whether the manager of the South Australian Co-operative Union Limited is so much an interested party as to discount the value of his opinion, but the fact that he represents a co-operative enterprise should entitle him to consideration. I am impressed by his statement that the American papers report that the glaxo people have bought, in one lot, over 90 tons of sugar of milk lactose for shipment either to New Zealand or Australia. The American people, so he says, are pleased at the deal, because it means that they are getting rid of the surplus manufactured product. It seems that the Australian industry is in peril. An anti-dumping measure is promised, but we do not know whether or when it will be passed. In the meantime, we are asked to vote for these extraordinary duties. I am inclined to demonstrate my loyalty for once in respect of this Tariff and support the Government's attitude, not of to-day, but as outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in August last. </para>

                    <para>.- Originally, the Tariff upon  timber,  undressed, n.e.i., for the manufacture of boxes, as prescribed by departmental by-laws, was 3s. 6d. per 100 super feet all round, while the duty on timber, undressed, but cut to sizes, was 5s. Thus, a protection to the  extent  of1s. 6d. per 100 feet was afforded local dressers and manufacturers. The Senate requested that the intermediate and general rates should be raised, to provide a wider margin between the duty on undressed timber and on timber cut to sizes. The House of Representatives, taking the view that the outcome would' he to impose additional charges upon those who use these boxes for the transport of their produce, deemed it advisable to retain the 5s. rate on timber cut to sizes but to lower the duty on the raw material to1s. per 100 feet, in order to afford a wider margin of protection.

                    <para>. - Upon certain items of the Tariff it cannot be said that Australia is offering very much encouragement to trade with New Zealand. It has been pointed out more than once that the intermediate rates afford opportunities for entering upon reciprocal arrangements with our sister Dominion, as well as with other countries. Here, however, the proposed rates are all the same. We import large quantities of New Zealand timber. Why has no provision been made for reciprocity ? </para>

It is true that there is not a special intermediate rate applied to this item, upon the basis of which bargaining may be undertaken. In order to provide a different rate in the intermediate column, I presume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> would raise the general duties.

                        <para>- I am glad to hear that, and to know that the watchfulness of the Department prevents the intentions of Parliament from being frustrated. No doubt, the Customs officials have become expert in dealing with all manner of trickery. I certainly have no complaints against them except that - holding such fiscal views as I do - I do not think there should be any Customs officials. Some time ago a deputation waited upon me and discussed the subject of box manufacture. I do not know that the Tariff, as it is now about to be modified, will help the people very much, seeing that no considerable protection is being offered; but, without question, the raw material for manufacture may be imported without heavy handicap. A duty of 5s. per 100 super feet is not a heavy duty on partially dressed timber. I suppose it is not more than a matter of 20 per cent, where the timber is purchased; it would certainly not be more than 25 per cent. </para>

                <para class="block">The position with regard to this item  is  that the imported hides are not the same class of hides as are produced in Australia. Owing to the warmer atmosphere of Australia, heavy hides are not produced in this country. The heavy hides, nevertheless, are necessary for certain manufacturing purposes. Our tanners, to meet the demand of the market for the heavier leathers, have to import the heavier hides. These hides do not come into competition with Australian hides. The effect of the duty, if  it  stopped importations, would be to deprive Australian tanners of some of the material with which they at present work. To that extent it would be prejudicial to the interests of Australia. If we are going to develop the leather manufacturing industry in Australia, it is a mistake, when 75 per cent, of the operations are carried on with Australian hides, to stand between the tanners and the source of the other 25 per cent, of their supplies. </para>

I cannot account for the absence of that protest. The roaring Protectionist lion of this Committee has suddenly been transformed into  a  lamb. Here is an outrageous proposal by the Government to abandon the policy of high Protection, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> follows tamely behind them; The fidelity of " poor dog Tray " is nothing as compared with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> on the present occasion. I suggest to the Minister that it would be well at present to retain this duty, if only for the purpose of using  it  later to obtain reciprocal concessions from New Zealand. New Zealand has put up Tariffs against Australia, and Australia has done the same against New Zealand. If we wipe out this duty on green hides, it will leave us entirely bereft of anything to offer to that country. There are some things produced in New Zealand which Australia would benefit by importing. </para>

                        when he makes his little jokes at my expense. I desire, therefore, to say that I am following the Government because I think they are taking a very wise step. Australia is a cattle-producing and meat-exporting country. I believe Australia can supply plenty of hides for tanning purposes, and that there is absolutely no necessity to import them. If, on any occasion, green hides are required for the tanning and leather industries of Australia, I want to see them come in from abroad.  I have never taken any action in the direction of restricting the industries of Australia. I want to build them up. Cannot

                        see that this proposal is not restricting any industry in Australia? It is helping to bring in the raw material. Evidently, when the item was last before this Committee, somebody got a little befogged, and was able to induce the Committee to agree to the imposition of a duty of Id. per lb. on green hides. That duty is not in the interests of Australian industry.  If there were any necessity to protect the production of green hides in Australia, it would be a different matter. We want all the hides we can get, if we can use them and export them as leather.

                    <para>. - I am surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> should take it as a joke when the fact is mentioned that he, the "roaring lion of Protection" on every other industry, is not out to protest the producer of hides. As Queensland is the chief producer of hides, it is getting no sympathy. Nobody appears to have any sympathy for Queensland, whether in regard to bananas, pineapples, or hides. Honorable senators are always prepared to " put the boot " into that State. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> may say it is a joke to call attention to the fact that the "lion of Protection " is lying down with the "lamb of Free Trade," but I see no joke in it. Probably if one lived in Tasmania one would develop a sense of humour. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle's</inline> attitude on this item0 is evidence of what is naturally happening to members 'of this Senate. While this Tariff has been before the Senate every senator who set out in favour of high Protection has given a vote, some time or other, in favour of Free Trade. There is a feeling that the Protectionist cause is getting weaker, and the Free Trade cause stronger. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> realizes that the imposition of high duties is not the way to prosperity, and he has made a start along the road of reform by agreeing to the abolition of the proposed duty on green hides. If the duty on hides is abolished, then why not also on leather; and if on leather, why not on boots ? </para>

In this item they have accepted the duties imposed by the Senate, but make a slight alteration in the date when they are to come into operation.

I have in my mind a statement by an honorable senator on the Government side couched in such language that I would not be allowed to repeat it. The statement referred to the. manufacturers of boots as "robbers." The language that was used would not be considered parliamentary. Notwithstanding that denunciation from the Government benches, the other House appears to be ready to help these ' ' robbers 1 ' by increasing the duty 5 per cent, above what the Senate requested. If the Government has decided to accept the modification, it is no use arguing the point. The honorable senator to whom I have referred denounced the manufacturers of boots because of the bad-quality material they use, and the high prices they charge. </para>

There is little excuse for the manufacturer of shoddy boots in a country where hides are admitted free, and leather is abundant. Why do we want a duty against the outside world as high as that which is proposed? The only explanation I can find is that the Government is out to tax the working classes. This Tariff is a revenue Tariff from end to end. It produced £32,000,000 of revenue last year, and I believe it will produce nearly as much this year. </para>

I do not know whether he indorses it, but I would remind him that all boot manufacturers are not supporters of this Government. The largest boot manufacturer that I know in my State, and perhaps the largest  in that State, who never loses an opportunity of boasting of his wealth, is a gentleman who stands high in the councils of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> party. He is a member of the State Parliamentary party to which the honorable gentleman 'belongs, and he is a capitalist. If boot manufacturers are " robbers," then I have not heard that this gentleman is selling his boots at any lower price than any other manufacturers. As far as my observations go,- he sells them at a little higher price than others charge. Certainly I have never been able to alford to purchase a pair. I understood that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain</inline> intended to he here this afternoon to say that when he made certain statements in a previous debate he did not understand the situation, and that the statements were made without justification. The facts are that boot manufacturers are making far less money than the manufacturers of other items of apparel. This is shown clearly in the Commonwealth Statistician's Bulletin No. 7, where the whole of the articles of wearing apparel, including boots and shoes, are grouped. But if- boots and shoes are excluded, a gross profit of 24.5 per. cent, is disclosed. </para>

The other House, against the wish of the Government, decided that the intermediate and general duty on newsprint should be £3 per ton, and that British importations should be free. The Senate decided to reduce the intermediate and general duties to £2 per ton in each case, leaving the British preferential column unaltered. When the request went to the other Chamber, honorable members followed the example that has been tendered by some honorable senators, and stood fast to the original proposal. As the other House has twice declared in favour of the higher rate, I ask the Committee to support the motion which I now move - </para>

                    <para>. - I think this is an instance in which the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> should give way by agreeing to a duty of £2 10s. per ton instead of £3. The people most interested in this item are the proprietors of country papers, to whom an additional duty of £1 per ton means a considerable sum. During the war there was no section of the community so imposed upon as the newspaper proprietors. Paper that was selling  at  from £10 to £12 per ton in pre-war 'days rose to from £60 to £70 per ton during the war, and after that soared to £100 per ton. Since this duty was proposed paper has been falling in price, and supplies can now be purchased at from £21 10s. to £29 per ton. If £2 per ton was considered  a  fair duty when this Tariff was framed - on the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> basis it would now be much less - a lower rate than that suggested should be agreed to. This is  an  instance in which we could submit a modified request with the idea of meeting the other House half way. I trust there will be no opposition to such a proposal, because there can be no doubt concerning the conflicting opinions which prevail on this matter. I know from information received that three honorable members who paired against these duties would have supported them if they had been voting. I move - </para>

The total importations represent 75,000 tons, and of this quantity country newspaper proprietors use 6,000 tons. A fortnight ago, when speaking to a country newspaper proprietor in Adelaide, I asked him if he used 2 tons per annum, and he informed me that he did not use 1 ton. That is the position of a majority of the country newspaper proprietors. I am acting quite independently in this matter. I use from 65 to 70 tons a year, so that the higher duties will affect me to some extent. I am, however, prepared to vote for the rates proposed, and trust the Committee will agree to them. </para>

                    <para>. -  It is well within the knowledge of honorable senators that when this item was previously before the Committee  an  animated debate ensued, and the position was approached from every possible angle. It was admitted at the time that these articles were not made in Australia, and as the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> has admitted that the duties are imposed largely for revenue purposes, we should know how to vote. Motor vehicles are essential to encourage the development of the interior, and we cannot do that by imposing restrictions of any" kind on means of communication. There is nothing I know of in this great continent which is. more essential than easy and cheap means of transit. I can only repeat the arguments I advanced before, and I again ask the Minister if he intends to press any of the requests submitted by the Committee. Why should we not break new ground and insist on our requests, because in doing so we shall be helping development, and preventing those engaged in the interior from bearing undue impositions. </para>

                    <para>. - This item is not so complicated as a glance at the schedule would lead one to believe. Honorable members in another place have accepted the principle of the Senate's request in separating the original item into subdivisions as proposed, and the imposition of alternative specific duties, but have slightly lowered the specific duties suggested by the Senate. It has been brought under notice that the words of the item embrace linen fabrics used for blue prints, which are cheaper than photographic papers, and in respect of these fabrics the duties suggested by the Senate are unduly high, and run as high as 220 per cent. Honorable members in another place, in re-casting the item, suggest the inclusion of fabric for blue prints under a different heading. This does not in any way affect the purpose which honorable senators had in view in making their request. In paragraph 1 the Senate requested the imposition of duties of 6½d., 8d., and 9½d. per square foot, as alternative duties; and the other House reduced the duties to 5d., 6½d., and 8d. respectively. I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and other honorable senators will hail with great pleasure this evidence on the part' of another place to meet the wishes of honorable senators who favour reduced duties. </para>

We proposed that explosives included in the first paragraph should be dutiable at 15, 20, and 25 per cent., and that explosives covered by the second paragraph should be free from Great Britain and dutiable in the intermediate and general columns at 10 and 15 per cent. The other House has declined to fall in with the suggestion of the Senate. In view of the fact that in another place the opinion of honorable members on this item has been twice expressed, and that there is a considerable section in this Committee who approve of the decision of another place, I move - </para>

                    (Victoria) [3.251. - After very full discussion of this subject on a previous occasion, the Committee decided to request the imposition of duties on coal-getting explosives of 15, 20 and 25 per cent. Our request has not been acceded to by another place. It is unnecessary to go over the arguments used in the previous debate in this Chamber on this item, but it is perhaps as well to remind honorable senators that we are dealing here with a key industry. If we have to import the whole of our explosives in time of war, we shall be unable to obtain necessary ammunition. Of what use will be our Small Arms Factory and the splendid military organization which we maintain at very great expense unless we can locally manufacture explosives? Those who are engaged in the manufacture of explosives at Maribyrnong behaved splendidly throughout the war. They have a clean record from start to finish. They supply a good article at a reasonable price and employ a very large number of satisfied employees under the conditions laid down by the Government of this country. This is a Protectionist Tariff, but it provides for practically Free Trade in the case of this industry, which requires only the moderate Protection for which we have asked. It is necessary that this industry should be protected and supported if Australia is to be properly developed and effectively defended. I can see no justification for honorable senators going back upon their previous decision on this item.

                    <para>. - There is a strong reason why the Committee should make a stand on this item. Some of the elements used in the manufacture of explosives have to be imported, and they are dutiable at15 per cent. I refer to nitrate of ammonia, which is used in the manufacture, particularly, of explosives for coal-mining. If we are to reduce the duty on the finished article whilst the duty on the elements used in its manufacture is retained, the effect will be to give a bonus to outside manufacturers of explosives. Only adults are employed in the local manufacture of explosives, and they <inline font-style="italic">receive</inline> an average wage of £4 5s. 6d. per week, as against an average wage of £1 per week paid in the industry in. South. Africa. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Another point which is worthy of consideration is that the manufacture of explosives involves a very large consumption of cool. Two and a half tons of coal are consumed  in the manufacture of 1 ton of explosives, and therefore the local manufacture of this article  must  give considerable employment to local coal-miners. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister's argument really is that if we permit the admission of explosives manufactured by black labour, it will be more beneficial for coal-miners, since, as a result, they will be unemployed. I have heard it said that it is unsafe to use explosives manufactured in Australia, but I have seen original certificates stating that locally-made explosives have been tested in Great Britain and found to be thoroughly trustworthy. The factory here is capable of supplying Australia's present needs. It would be wise in time of peace to have this article made here, because the industry is tending to become a key one. </para>

Until explosives are produced in Australia on a sufficiently large scale to meet local needs, the proposed duty would make the articles dearer to the men who have to use them. </para>

On many items, the Minister in charge <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> has said that duties must be put on to encourage the manufacturers to produce those articles, the argument being that without protection their operations cannot be extended, while with protection expansion of industry may be expected. I am informed that there have been no actual profits made in this industry. If it is capable of meeting present local heeds, that is all we can expect. </para>

The other Chamber rejected that suggestion on the voices. Inquiry shows that a duty of 6d. would mean the payment by importers of £150,000 per annum. A prominent wool authority has stated that the proposed duty cannot help the wool industry. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator must be speaking without thought. I suppose many honorable senators have, under the stress of circumstances, used wool in either a pack or a (bag for a bed. That might be good enough for the first night or two, but, after that, as far as I am concerned, anybody could have the wool, and I would prefer the empty bag. I do not believe the proposed duty would create an industry worth speaking of. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot allow this item to go without a protest. We went into the matter thoroughly when last it was before us, and honorable senators with the whole of the evidence before them agreed to the request by seventeen to nine. It is absolutely absurd for any person posing as a wool authority to say that these duties would not help the Australian woollen industry. I know who is the so-called authority mentioned by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen).</inline> He is a gentleman who had nothing to do with the wool trade, except in a secretarial capacity, for the last two or three years. </para>

                        <para>- I only wanted the Minister to confirm my statement. We all know what is the present position of the woollen industry. Hundreds of thousands of bales of crossbred wool, some of it particularly suitable for mattress-making, are being produced by our small farmers at very much above present market rates. The statistics show that the Bawra stocks of crossbred wool, instead of decreasing, have increased during the last two or three years by 300,000 bales, although we are able to sell our merino wools at a good price. Wool for mattress-making has been used in Europe for the last hundred years. No one will say, of course, that its use in this country will result in moving a mountain of crossbred wool off the market; but, at all events, it will encourage the use of the Australian-grown product manufactured by Australian people under Australian conditions in preference to a product grown by black labour in Java. Wool is better than kapok for mattress stuffing. Kapok, being a vegetable matter, is inflammable, and is a conductor of both heat and cold -  in  addition to which, it powders, and is liable to attract microbes - whereas wool, being an animal matter, is a non-conductor of heat or cold, and is non-inflammable. It is admitted that those engaged in the mattress-making industry were at first supplied with an unsuitable material, in the Lincoln wool, which was then selling at 3d. per lb, because it felts and ropes. </para>

                <para>The ideal material is the crossbred noils. The wool-combing industry is established both in Melbourne and in Sydney. We are exporting the tops, but there is very little sale for the noils, which are the short bits combed out. There is also a large stock of second crossbred lambs and short pieces, and what we call crutchings, almost wasting at the present time; this also may be used: One firm of returned soldiers, working on a co-operative basis, bought a lot of this cheap wool for mattress-stuffing. We were very glad of their competition. They have invented a machine for cutting long Lincoln wool up into requisite lengths for mattress-stuffing. Treated in this way, it is an ideal material. I have taken the trouble to write to the mattress manufacturers  who have been getting supplies from these returned soldiers, asking if the material is suitable, and I have had a sheaf of replies to the effect that they are very well satisfied, and would not go back to the kapok. It is probable that some of the Minister's advisers - who, perhaps, have never seen wool in their lives except out of a railway carriage window - will say that this is unsuitable because a certain amount of the grease has not been removed. It would not be so terrible after all if, say,½per cent, of grease remained; but if any of the grease is  left in the wool it only indicates careless preparation. The wool can be bone-dry scoured, which means that every particle of grease is taken out of it. Some of the English manufacturers purposely leave a small proportion of the grease in the wool In Yorkshire they put as much as 5 per cent, of olive oil in wool when combing it, but on the 'Continent, and particularly in France, the manufacturers comb the wool bone dry. We can do the same in Australia, and as we can produce the wool at a relatively cheap price, we should be able to build up a first-class industry in mattress-making, using our own materials instead of the product of black labour in Java. What is more, the wool will last very much longer than kapok, and if properly prepared it will neither felt nor rope. A Sydney firm has supplied the Hotel Australia with these wool mattresses, and I understand that the management is delighted with the product. </para>

                        <para>- They can get as much of it as they want. Of course, these returned soldiers for whom I am speaking are not millionaires. They have no huge factory or big plant. We must give them a chance to live and build up the industry. They can already supply the wants of all the mattress manufacturers in this State if they are sufficiently protected from the cheap labour product of Java, and their business will develop. It is not necessary to confine mattress-makers to the use of crossbred wool. They can use the broken yarns from the spinning mills established in Victoria and New South Wales. Some of the mattress-makers prefer these broken yarns. Honorable senators know the position of the wool industry in Australia. We are producing about 2,000,000 bales per annum. Of this quantity 36 per cent., is crossbred, and, unfortunately, about 25 per cent of this class of wool is only saleable at very much below the cost of production. This being so, why should we attempt, by means of this Tariff, to penalize men who are endeavouring to establish a new industry? At all events, they should have protection against the Java product for a few years. </para>
