The opportunity for making that nomination arose inconsequence of a cabled invitation from the imperial authorities expressing their willingness and desire that Australia should be included in the' British Delegation. The Government responded in the affirmative, and have nominated
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                            for that very responsible and, if I may say so, very privileged mission.

                            <para>- Honorable senators are familiar with the practice that has grown up of bringing under the early notice of the Senate the Budget formally presented by the Treasurer in another place. I may be permitted to refer briefly to the reason for that practice. Having regard to the constitution of the two Houses, it is impossible for the  Budget in ordinary circumstances to reach here in time to afford honorable senators the full opportunity to which they are entitled to discuss the national finances. The disinclination of another place - a disinclination founded upon sound reasons - to pass the Appropriation Bill and so to let' the Estimates go from its keeping until the last possible moment is, of course, well understood; but that entails with it a limitation of the time which this Chamber would have to study the national Budget. To get over that difficulty there was introduced, some time ago, the expedient of the Minister representing the Treasurer bringing the Budget papers here and submitting a motion that they be printed. The debate which can follow that motion gives the Senate an opportunity of discussing the public finances and the various matters connected with the Treasurer's statement without any formal submission of the Appropriation Bill itself. Clumsy though that expedient may be, it is the only one that has yet occurred to any of us as affording honorable senators a reasonable opportunity to discuss these matters while, at the same time, keeping well within their rights. </para>

There may not be time, when the Supply Bill is Submitted to this Chamber, to go into these matters of detail, but it will be competent for honorable senators to do so on the informal motion -if I may use that term - I intend to propose. </para>

                    <para>I should like, before I proceed to the statement, to mention another matter. When the Senate was summoned for today it was thought that the Supply Bill, which the Treasurer is under the necessity of presenting to another place, would have been available for consideration today, but as honorable senators are aware, the time of the other House last week was taken up in the discussion of the very important statements made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> upon his return from the Imperial Conference in. London. As a result of that debate the Supply Bill has not been dealt with by that House, and is not likely to be available to honorable senators until Thursday. A Supply Bill, apart from its financial aspect, gives honorable senators an opportunity, on the motion for its first reading, to discuss what are generally known as grievances. Therefore, if the Bill reaches us on Thursday, as of course it should, and it is required to be passed on that day to enable payments to be made to the public servants, it is quite clear that a great restriction will be placed upon honorable senators in the ventilation of matters which they might desire to bring forward. The motion which I am about to move will enable honorable senators to discuss these matters without waiting for the presentation of the Supply Bill. I invite the Senate to take advantage of this opportunity in order that more time may be available on Thursday to deal with the actual details of the Supply Bill itself. </para>
                    <para>In presenting the Budget-papers to the Senate I desire to make a brief summary of their contents. The estimated revenue for 1920-21 was £63,364,700, and the actual revenue £65,517,608, being £2,152,908 in excess of the estimate. The chief excesses were :  - Customs and Excise, £3,876,906; income tax, £751,408; entertainments tax, £299,828; the last-named due chiefly to the Government proposals for the reduction of the tax on small admissions being rejected by the Senate. </para>

Against these increases in revenue there were large decreases, notably, in the Post Office, totalling £933,431, and in the war time profits tax, £1,916,861. The expenditure out of revenue for 1920-21 was estimated at £68,872,578, and the actual expenditure was £64,624,087, or £4,248,491 less than the estimate. The chief items in this decrease on the estimate were - Military Department and Air Services, £452,000; additions, new works, and buildings (chiefly Defence works and buildings in Air Services), £972,000; interest on sinking funds on war loans, £1,099,000; repatriation of soldiers, £1,128,000 ; other war services payable from revenue, £1,328,000. </para>

Whilst no doubt there are some wonderful financiers outside who, if they were only given the opportunity, would be able to accomplish much in the way of economies, I submit that these figures are an indication of a desire On the part of the Government and the Treasury to effect substantial and real economies, without impairing the efficiency of the Public Service. </para>

                            <para>- Savings were effected because it was not necessary to expend the money. No obligation placed by the Repatriation Act upon the Department has been shirked. These savings are due largely to a natural shrinkage of many of the services. Men, as they become re-established in civil life, pass off the books of the Department. The expenditure on vocational training has been reduced considerably, and expenditure in many other directions is shrinking, which is only another way of saying that the Department is steadily progressing towards the end of its job. While during the year there were substantial decreases in expenditure as compared with the Estimates in certain Departments, on the other hand there were several increases, the chief of which was £523,000 in the Post Office Department, due mainly to the basic wage and other payments which could not be anticipated. As previously stated, the revenue for 1920-21 was £65,517,608, and the expenditure out of revenue was £64,624,087, showing a surplus on the year's transactions of £893,521. The surplus brought forward from the previous financial year was £5,724,806, and the accumulated surplus brought forward to the current financial year is £6,618,327. This surplus has been placed in the Trust Fund for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions and war pensions. Up to the date on which the note issue was transferred to the Commonwealth Bank, there were accumulated profits of £7,780,524. These profits were applied in redeeming Commonwealth Government inscribed stock and Treasury-bills which had been issued for Works loan purposes. </para>

It is expected that Customs and Excise will yield only £26,131,000, being £5,678,906 less than last year; that income tax will yield £648,592 more than the previous year; and that profits from the Australian note issue, which in 1920- 21 were only for a portion of the year, will yield £1,105,984 more than last year. </para>

I should like, in amplification of the last statement, to point out that it means that during last year there was a reduction of the public debt of this country by £16,000,000- that is, the gross debt was added to by £38,000,000; but there have been certain redemptions, leaving the net increase at only £20,000,000. These redemptions were due to the accumulated war profits on the note issue which were devoted to that purpose, and the redemption out of revenue of some war gratuity bonds, and certain other sums which the Treasurer had available. I have merely indicated the head-lines of the Budget. I have no doubt that honorable senators, interested as they are in the financial position, will have perused very closely and with considerable interest the statement made by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> elsewhere, and I do not propose to reiterate what he said. I remind honorable senators again that they have now the opportunity to discuss anything they like under the sun on. the motion I am about to move, and that in due course, when the Estimates are before us, they will be able to submit specific and effective motions regarding their contents.

                        <para>.- The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> has taken a wise course in view of the fact that Supply Bills are usually delayed in another place, and only reach us in time for us to pass them but not to discuss them. I congratulate the honorable gentleman on giving us this opportunity to deal with matters which we may think of sufficient importance to bring before the Senate and the public. I shall take advantage of the motion to make some remarks first about the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to represent Australia at the Washington Disarmament Conference. I suppose that, according to all the " rules of the game," I should follow the lead taken by my colleagues in another place and re-echo what they said there, or, probably, owing to the advantage I have of closer personal knowledge of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> add a little more. I am not going to do that. This appointment is one of the most important that has ever been made in this country; and, realizing that, I feel that whoever goes to the Conference must be viewed, not through party spectacles, but in the light of his capacity to worthily represent this great country. Looking at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> record of service and achievements, I know of no man in the public life of the Commonwealth who could perform the responsible duties of delegate to such a Conference with more satisfaction.  His  is a long record of faithful service, and it is one that any man in public life would be pleased to possess. I suppose the viciousness of party spirit enters as much into my nature as into that of any one else; but we have to remember that the Minister for Defence has on five occasions been returned as the representative of a great State, the democracy of which will stand the test of a comparison with that of any other State. As a representative of the_ people he has not only carried out his parliamentary duties, which in themselves are almost sufficient for most of us, but he has served on Select Committees and Royal Commissions, and in a Ministerial capacity, for about ten of the twenty years he has been in public life. In a man with that public record behind him Australia will have a very worthy representative - one whose ability, capacity, character and attainments cannot be questioned - at the Washington Disarmament Conference. Holding these private views concerning the Minister. I feel it my duty to declare them publicly. Of course, there is a feeling in another place that a representative of the Commonwealth should have been selected from that Chamber; but I am not going to argue in that direction. It is simply an attempt to reverse that axiom of Euclid which says that the whole is greater than the part. Honorable members in another place have endeavoured to prove that' the part is greater than the whole; but when one remembers that an honorable senator represents the whole of a State, whereas an honorable member in another place represents only one twenty-seventh, surely the representative of one twenty-seventh is » not of more importance or entitled to more consideration than one who represents the whole. That is a perfectly sound proposition to submit concerning the difference between the two Houses. Viewing the matter from that stand-point, I cannot support the claim that the Chamber which is probably more popular - it dan not, claim to be more democratic - should have representation and this Chamber should not. When it is a question of representation in other countries, we have only to consider the ability and capacity of the gentleman selected to carry out the important work. Viewing the long record of the Minister for Defence as shown by the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Handbook,</inline> and realizing that our delegate has been five" times returned by the electors of Western 'Australia, and has carried out his parliamentary and Ministerial duties with such marked success, the selection is one with which we should be satisfied. There are two possible representatives who could have been selected from another place. I know comparisons are invidious, but they cannot always be avoided. I suppose the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> would be the first choice. No such phrases as " America slamming the door in our face " are likely to be uttered by the selected representative. Another delegate mentioned was the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Massy Greene).</inline> Apart from other considerations, the selected representative is one of Australia's sons. Honorable senators may not agree with narrow sentiments; but to me it is a pleasure to think that on this occasion it is an Australian born who is to represent Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know whether the present Government will be in office the week after next, but if they are not it will be a delightful opportunity for me to show how it can be done. Economy can be effected by men of capacity, energy, and ability by courageously facing a serious situation, and not go on from day to day or from month to month, simply waiting for something to turn up, as the present Government are doing. Now that the war is over, the Government should seriously face the position, and consider the direction in which we are drifting. The financial position is most serious. The Minister for Repatriation has said that a saving has been effected because certain money was not expended; but that is not proof of any actual attempt at economy. During the closing months of the financial year the Government dispensed with the services of1,000 men who were employed on the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide,</inline> and kept them out of employment until after the end of the financial year, and then re-employed them to complete the work. Was that economy ? Was it saving money to discharge 400 or 500 men who were employed at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory and still retain the highly paid staff and the immense overhead charges of the Defence Department in full operation? The Minister may claim that the Government have economized because during the concluding months of the last financial year they threw into idleness 1,000 men who were doing useful work, and also machinery that represents a large amount of capital, and then after an interval during which the expenditure was discontinued, they recommenced operations. By that means they may claim to have saved so much money. They may say that they did not build as many War Service Homes as they intended to build, that the estimated expenditure in that direction was not reached, and that, the houses not having been constructed and the expenditure not having been incurred, they, therefore, have effected a saving. That is no saving. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately there was not; there have been gross and serious losses in connexion with that Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen quoted the estimated cost of government last year, and then, with an air of satisfaction, pointed to the fact that the Government spent many millions less than the estimate. This year the estimated expenditure is £64,000,000, and the estimated revenue about £61,000,000. I am not bothering about the odd thousands, because to the present Government £l,000,000 is neither here nor there. On many occasions I have pointed out in this chamber how savings could be effected, and I say again that the first place to exercise the pruning knife is in the Navy and Defence Departments. I do not suggest that we should make the defences of the country weaker - that we must never do - but we should cut down those costly overhead charges which are no strength to the country in time of war. It is not any saving to spend more money this year on military services than was spent in other years, and while employing fewer men at Lithgow in preparing defence material, employ two officers at head-quarters doing in time of peace the work that one officer did in time of war. I know it would be acting harshly to say to those "very distinguished" men, "We have. to treat you as we treat the workers at Lithgow and Cockatoo Island; on account of the need for economy we give you a moment's notice that your services are no longer required." My opponents will reply to me that those officers never "go slow"; that they go full speed ahead all the time, and, therefore, there is no occasion to punish them. </para>

                    <para>This Budget is unsatisfactory to the whole of the people of this country. I know that the Minister for Repatriation will agree with me that we in Parliament, viewing matters at close quarters, and Ministers in their Departments, viewing them even closer, very often go our own way until we suddenly find that we have lost touch with the people for whom we are governing and legislating; too late we realize that the paths of the people and their legislators are diverging. I warn the Government that we are walking right away from the sense and thought of the community, and that from one end of the country to the other there is a strong feeling that it is time somebody faced the financial problem seriously and earnestly, and honestly sought to curtail the cost of government. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator may, but the liberty he takes with the truth may be allowed to pass unnoticed. In no unfriendly way, I am pointing out that through lack of management in public affairs the desired reduction in the cost of government is not being made. Drastic methods must be resorted to if a reduction worth mentioning is to be brought about. One of the  best  methods of decreasing the cost of government is by amending the Constitution, to abolish to a great extent the sovereign rights of the State Parliaments, and bring into existence one Australian Parliament, with provincial councils to manage affairs that can best be controlled locally. Five millions of people continue to maintain six separate Governments, with sovereign powers for borrowing and taxing, and all the overhead expenses incidental to six distinct governmental systems. </para>

                            <para>- The State Parliaments would be replaced by small governing provincial bodies, perhaps a little more important than municipal or shire councils, but certainly of much less importance than the existing legislative bodies, which require sets of highly-paid officials. There is no need in Australia for six. separate representatives of  His  Majesty the King in addition to the Governor-General. Surely one representative of  His  Majesty is sufficient for this country at any time. Surely we could with advantage and economy dispense with the six others. But the States which claim sovereign rights and special importance would not dream of lessening their status by consenting to the removal of these high and dignified offices. </para>

Some of the children now alive will possibly live to see Australia, not only in numbers, but also in greatness, more important than Great Britain is to-day; but we cannot become a great nation unless we face the problem of living within our means.

                            <para>- I know that our numbers are growing rapidly, but our ideas are growing more rapidly. Any attempt to live up to an importance which is not warranted by numbers is a serious burden on the taxpayers. It is no use whining and saying, " We will cut off 3d. here or 2½d. somewhere else." That is no remedy; it is of no value either to the States or to the Commonwealth, and is simply a cause of irritation and annoyance. . Any move in the direction of effecting economy must be well considered, and should lead to a substantial reduction in the cost of governing the country, and in the amount of taxation burdening the people. Twopence ha'penny economies are of no use to any one. Dispensing with public servants today, and trying to make one man do the work of two is false economy. Real economy is effected by retaining that which is really essential to the good government of the country, and dispensing with everything that is unnecessary. The intentions of Ministers are all right. The trouble is that they cannot make up their minds to carry them into effect. I do not know whether this is due to the fact that they have got out of form. I will not say that Ministers are growing too old for their work. Nevertheless, the fact remains that they cannot make up their  minds to carry out their intentions. Take the case of the representation of Australia in London. The cost of our London Office is proceeding all the time, less the salary of the head of the establishment. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. We sent him there, and increased his salary by £1,000. I read a good deal of press comment at the time the salaries of members of Parliament were increased to £1,000; but I do not think I read one comment on the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd's</inline> salary had been increased. However, I do not wish to discuss a public servant who is not here to speak for himself. We have a costly office in London, and everything necessary to enable Australia to be represented there; but we have a Government here which, for nine months past, has not been able to make up its mind to fill the position of High Commissioner. Out of 5,000,000 people in Australia there is not one man it can choose for the post. Its inaction in this respect is indicative of the manner in which it is dealing with the finances. Ministers' intentions are all right, and I believe they will eventually make a good appointment in London. </para>

                            <para>- That State affords an example of real efficiency and economic administration. The New South Wales Government are facing big problems, and are handling them ably and effectively. Each of the State enterprises which, under the former Nationalist Government, was being worked at  a  loss, is now showing a profit. During the last year of Nationalist administration, the State trawling industry showed  a  loss of £60,000. In the first year of Labour administration a handsome profit was shown. </para>

                            <para>- State Labour administration is efficient. Labour control pays. The Commonwealth Government appear to be unaware that they are out of touch with the whole community. They do not seem to realize that the country is crying out for more careful and more efficient' administration, and that there is a general demand for economy where there is no economy. Expenditures in all directions are growing. The attempts to reduce these costs are not real and earnest. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; but while the Government and the country are being impoverished, the possessions of wealthy individuals are enormously increasing. We are now indebted as a nation to the extent of about £250,000,000. Those who have lent the money are getting huge returns by way of interest. The Commonwealth's war debt - an immense feature of cost of government- while it is a burden to the community as a whole is a wonderfully good investment in the hands of a comparatively few rich people. </para>

                            <para>- I do call it a cost of government. The Government are not realizing their responsibilities. I know the particulars, and have mentioned -them before, concerning ; an Australian who fought at the war, and who has returned, and has been receiving a pension of £1 per week. He is in the last stages of consumption. The Pensions Board takes the view that the man had contracted the disease prior to his leaving Australia for the war. There is, however, an admission of a certain degree of governmental responsibility. The pension is being continued, but has been reduced from £1 to 10s. per week. That is the kind of economy practised by this Government. </para>

                            <para>- A Government, even though so callous as to deal with returned soldiers in the way I have indicated should, at any rate, show sufficient courage to tell people who have become wealthy out of the war that they must pay their share. If we have an enormous debt in Australia, for which  the people are responsible, we also have here an enormous number of bondholders who have made really good money out of the war, and on that account there is a growing dissatisfaction with the management of the country's affairs. There is a widespread feeling among the people that the Government are not facing the position with sufficient earnestness. The Government should deal as drastically with men in high positions as they do with those at the bottom rung of the ladder. I shall not ask the Government to treat the high officers in the Defence Department in the way the men at Lithgow and Cockatoo Island were dealt with, or even the returned soldiers, whose pensions are on a scale that is an absolute discredit to the country. Advantage is taken of any technical reason for which a shilling can be deducted from the amount of a pension. The Minister states that the law provides the rate to be paid. If it is true that the law prevents returned soldiers from getting sufficient to maintain them in their closing years - and it is acknowledged by the Department in the case mentioned that the illness, if not contracted, was aggravated by war service - this or some other Government must face the larger problem of putting the finances of Australia on a much safer basis than at present. I see no advantage in reducing the cost of government by 3d. or 6d., but I do see a great advantage in the early consideration of a comprehensive scheme by which we may secure economy and good government at a much cheaper rate. Bearing on the case to which I have just referred, I have received the following reply from the  chairman  of the Repatriation Commission :  - </para>

                        <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir.- William</inline> I. Kent, ex-No. 3567, Private, 41st Battalion. - With reference to your representations to the honorable the Minister for Defence regarding the case of the above-named ex-member of the Forces, I have to inform you that the Commission recently considered this case, and in view of the medical evidence decided that payment of more than one-half of the maximum rate of pension is not warranted. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kent's</inline> statements and his medical history, his disability pre-existent his enlistment, and it is very doubtful if his condition was in any way aggravated by his military service. The Commission, however, decided to admit the responsibility of active service for a certain amount of aggravation, and it feels that this aggravation is fully compensated for by the rate of pension now being paid. </para>

                    <para>If that is the best treatment the Defence Department can give the returned soldiers, all I can say is that we need bigger men to do the country's work, men with a more generous attitude and a more comprehensive view of our financial affairs. I realize that it is useless to expect that from this Government, which appears to be putting off its responsibilities from day to day instead of facing them. As I understand honorable senators wish to say farewell to the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> 1 shall not continue the debate at this stage. </para>

                            <para>. - I listened to the remarks of the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> in moving the motion that is now before the Senate with a great deal of interest and attention. I realize that at this stage of our national life we are face to face with a very grave necessity which is being forced upon our notice by the public of Australia, by the ratepayers, and by the public press, perhaps to an even greater extent than the facts warrant. It is being forced not only upon this Parliament, but upon all the Parliaments of Australia. We find that, in spite of the fact that we have come through a very serious financial period as a result of the war; in spite of the fact that we are face to face with the necessity for conserving our resources, for fostering our industries and promoting our future welfare, so far as lies in our power; in spite of the fact that the conditions of the world are forcing upon the attention of Parliaments and statesmen the necessity for scrutinizing carefully every shilling and every penny that is spent, so that good value may be obtained, the Government, perhaps rightly, have not applied the pruning knife, as some people might desire, almost without discrimination ; but have, nevertheless, shown some care in their revision of the Estimates. Taking it by and large, there is in this Budget statement ample evidence of that real economy that the public of Australia are demanding to-day. I feel  sure that there is no need for me to dilate upon our financial position. All honorable senators know that this- is not the time to do so; but I desire to say, and I say it with emphasis, that expenditure of money on the unproductive services of this great Commonwealth, to the extent of hampering the productive services, some of which are not within the direct purview of the Government, is not warranted in the present circumstances. So far as the Budget is concerned, and so far as the statement of the honorable the Minister discloses, there has been a very poor case made out to warrant any additional expenditure in certain directions where additional expenditure is contemplated. </para>

                                <para>- That is not an additional expenditure; but I will come to a matter which the honorable senator for Western Australia will know more about than Canberra - I refer to the proposals for military expenditure. I am one of those who hoped that when the great war from which we have just emerged ended we would have been able to limit to a very large extent our expenditure on armaments and military preparations. I find that the Government, instead of restricting the expenditure upon defence matters, propose to increase it very largely in directions which, to my mind, are unwarranted. I ask honorable senators to look at the. position. We have in Australia hundreds of thousands of men who were highly trained in the best of schools - that of actual warfare. Their services will remain available to us for a number of years - let us say ten years. They may deteriorate as soldiers in that period, but to a certain extent every man who has been through training under actual war service conditions, although he may be out of training in ten years' time, can be brought back to efficiency quickly. The majority of our soldiers, after all, were youths, and their knowledge of warfare and military tactics could be quickly restored to them. I speak more particularly of the private and non-commissioned officers, who would require very little additional training if, at any time in the future, they were again called on to give their services to their country. I had hoped, in view of the circumstances, that it would have been possible for us, knowing that we have behind us this magnificent fighting force, which could be called to arms should we want it during the next few years, to carry on our defence programme at this stage with merely the nucleus of an administration sufficient to staff the larger and more effective force. </para>

                                <para>- It may not be necessary to do that. In these Estimates it is proposed not merely to retain the staff that we have at present, but to increase it very largely. The vote for the Permanent Forces has been increased by £292,893 in comparison with that of last year. I would remind the honorable senator that he and other members of the Senate who served with distinction during the war were not permanent officers at its outbreak. </para>

Seeing that we still retain the services of these honorable gentlemen, and of tens of thousands of qualified officers who received their training under better conditions than could obtain in peace time, there is no need to-day for any extension of the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Defence Department. Whilst it is proposed to increase the expenditure on the Permanent Forces by nearly £300,000 a year, it is also proposed to decrease the cost of the administrative and instructional staffs by £249,257. </para>

                                <para>- We are not paying them so much more than we paid them last year as to account for the tremendous difference between the expenditure proposed on the Permanent Forces this year as compared with the expenditure proposed last year. The difference must be due to an increase in the numbers. A very large number of the permanent staff consists of men on the instructional staff. These are the men whom we need to retain, and the men to whom, I take it, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> referred. They will train our Forces should the necessity arise to again ask them to gird on their armour aud go forth in the defence of Australia and the Empire. While it is proposed to decrease the vote for the administrative and instructional staffs the vote for the Permanent Forces shows a very considerable increase. </para>

                                <para>- That may be, but I should like the Minister to point out from the Estimates what those other things are. I fail to see any necessity for the large increase proposed in the vote for the Permanent Forces, especially in view of the fact that a reduction is proposed in the vote for the administrative and instructional staffs. I do not cavil at any proposal to increase the vote for the ordnance branch and the maintenance and equipment of existing armament. </para>

                                <para>- It seems to me that, so far as armament and equipment are concerned, we should spend whatever may be necessary. The point I am making is that we have already in Australia a highly trained Army, dispersed it is true, but capable of being called into existence at very short notice. What we require to be quite sure of is that should we find it necessary in the near or distant future to again call into being the magnificent Force known as the Australian Imperial Force, we would have arms, accoutrements and equipment to enable the Force to take the field with confidence and with some hope of success. It appears to me that the Government are proposing increased expenditure on what might be called the non-essentials and not upon the essentials of defence. </para>

                                <para>- I remind the honorable senator that the increase in the vote proposed for the clerical and general staffs of the Defence Department this year amounts to £68,417. No doubt it is necessary that, we should have a fully-equipped general staff, if we are to have an effective military organization, but that is provided for, and to a greater extent than on last year's Estimates. Where then is the necessity for the enormous increase proposed in the expenditure on the Permanent Forces ? </para>

                        <para>I pass from this to another very important aspect of our Defence expenditure. I refer to the expenditure on the naval arm of defence. The time -has arrived when we should seriously ask ourselves whether at this stage any very large increase in that expenditure is desirable, or whether even the maintenance of the existing high rate' of expenditure on naval defence is justified. I know just what naval defence means to any country. I am aware that without an effective Navy Great Britain would not occupy the position she does to-day. I know that but for the protecting arm of Britain's mighty Fleet Australia would not be in the position it is in to-day. But I see that the United States of America and Japan, in their contemplated naval programmes, are out distancing the programme of Great Britain. When I see these great nations, with almost unlimited financial resources, particularly in the case of. the United States of America, proposing to build huge navies, not only for the protection of their countries, but also for the protection of their interests in every part of the world, I ask myself how can we in Australia, in view of the limitations of our financial resources . expect  to build anything in the nature of an effective naval weapon. </para>

                                <para>- Because in the case of some honorable senators it is necessary to do so. The other units of the Fleet are also to a certain extent obsolete. The work which they will be called upon to do in the next few years will be merely police work in connexion with the mandated Territories and the Territories Belonging to the Commonwealth. I point out that instead of using these expensive, and, after all, impotent weapons for this purpose, it would be much better for us to use the smaller craft, such as destroyers and submarines. We have plenty of them, and they do not cost to maintain one hundredth part of the cost of the huge and useless naval weapons to which I have referred. </para>

                        <para>I find that the Government propose to extend our Air Service very largely in the near future. I believe that in the future this will be found to be the most effective weapon for the defence of Australia, and not mighty battleships, the construction of which we cannot finance; not men-o'-war costing from £2,000,000 to £4,000,000 before they can be established here as fighting units. We cannot hope to maintain that sort of Fleet, and without it it would be  useless for us to attempt to challenge the great navies of other countries of the world. </para>
                        <para class="block">The Government propose to extend our Air Service, and I indorse their action in that regard. Hero we have an arm that does offer some hope of effective defence, and, after all, it is only defence we require. We do not wish to attack any one, but merely to defend this country. We must see to it that the method of defence we adopt, whilst effective, shall be as inexpensive as possible. Here is a method by which we can hope to secure a means of defence more efficient than any other we could provide. I have, therefore, no quarrel with the Government for the proposed increase in the vote for air defence. So far as the other, expenditure to which I have referred is concerned, I say that, for the next- few years, at any rate, we can at least afford to mark time, even should we not be in a position to dispense with men employed in connexion with our military and naval defence schemes. But what do the Government propose to do ? They do not propose to mark time, but to join in the rush to provide "what, after all, cannot be an effective means of defence for this or any other country. I have pointed out that we cannot hope to compete with the great countries of the world in this direction, and we should be eager to put all the money we can expect to raise in the next few years into productive works, and into the extension of- our agricultural,  pastoral,  and manufacturing industries, to insure increased production and settlement to the limit of our capacity. </para>

I am contending that it is impossible for us, with our limited financial power, to build and maintain an effective Fleet. In my view, it would be infinitely better for us to hire the Fleet we require from the Mother Country, or, if that cannot be done, to do as I have suggested, and extend our mosquito Fleet as much as possible. We should not build the bigger ships, which are obsolete, and which cannot be maintained except at very heavy expense, and must be of very little use for the purpose for which our Fleet is required. </para>

I believe the Government are honestly doing the best they possibly can. When
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>
                            asks where the country is to obtain more efficient management than it has to-day, I remind him that it is not likely to obtain it from the Labour party, when we remember by whom the party is composed in this Parliament, and also in many of the Parliaments of the States. It is hardly likely to secure more efficient management from the Country party. I think that to the most casual observer it must be evident that there is only one party in this Parliament which can give the country anything like ' the efficient management it desires, and that that is the party in control of the administration to-day. I believe we can make improvements, so far as the administrators themselves are concerned, and I can say so without in any way making an attack on the party that I have the honour to represent here. We fortunately are not tied hand and foot to any man who may be appointed to administer a Department, and we have a perfect right to criticise the administration of any Minister if we feel that it is deserving of criticism. There is certainly great room for improvement in that direction, but I am not looking to the Labour party, the Country party, or any other party that may rise up in this Parliament within the very near future to bring about that improvement. I repeat that there is only one party that can give to this country at the present time the kind of administration that it wants, and it is up to us, as members of that party, to see that it gives the Commonwealth just that kind of administration for which our industries and public services are crying.

                        <para>There are other matters on which I could speak; but I prefer to wait until they come directly before us for discussion. I refer more particularly to the administration of New Guinea and its management, in so far as the expropriation of the Germans in that Territory is concerned. I have a very grave suspicion, from evidence that has been given, and statements that have been made to me by Australians who have recently returned from  New Guinea, as to the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the administration there in certain respects. It seems to me that there is too much Burns-Philp entering into the administration, and too little regard for the real welfare and advancement of the Territory. The statement is a rather serious one, and I propose at another stage to speak more clearly and definitely, because I have at my disposal certain facts that I believe warrant me in making it. In conclusion, I believe that the Government, considering all the circumstances, are doing fairly well. I believe .that there is an honest desire on their part to meet the insistent demand for economy that has arisen outside; that they realize that unless we do have proper regard to this demand for economy on the part of the taxpayers, others will be put in charge of the finances of the Commonwealth, and I consider that they have that proper regard for it. Although the Budget does not go as far as I should like it to go, it nevertheless goes a fairly long way, and, apart from the items I have mentioned, I congratulate the Government upon their proposals. I am convinced that when the country comes to realize, in spite of the bitter  pres3  campaign that is being waged in certain quarters against the Government and against our party as a whole, the difficulties with which the Ministry have to contend - when it realizes the magnificent work that it has achieved in many directions - it will say to the Government and their supporters, " Well done good and faithful servants, go on with your administration of the affairs of the Commonwealth." </para>

                            <para>. - I do not rise to make any very close analysis of the Budget, because that is a  particularly difficult task for even a Treasurer to discharge. The rank and file in both Chambers very rarely have the time, even if they had the inclination, to make that analysis of the terms of the Budget which would, to the very convincing point, demonstrate whether it was a good ora bad one. I remember, however, the Honorable William Watt, who has had very great experience in administering the finances of Victoria, which is supposed to be a well-governed State, and who has acted as Prime Minister, and has' held office as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, stating, certainly not more than a couple of years ago, that he had been through the Budget with an axe, but could not reduce expenditure any further-, and- at the same time preserve that efficiency which is necessary in the services of the Commonwealth. I' understood' that the figure of speech used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> was intended to convey to his hearers the meaning that he had lapped off all redundancies with an unsparing hand, and did not see his way. to effect any major economies such as many people outside Parliament were demanding. The remark was made by him,I repeat, not. more than two years ago, and I cannot think that the Treasury authorities : and the - Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> could have been insensible to the demands of the public for economy when compiling the Estimates of Expenditure, and preparing what is known as the Budget. I feel sure that in regard to major expenses very great economies cannot be achieved. The public of Australia is probably more insistent than the people of any other Democracy in. demanding that the. Government shall perform a multiplicity of services. If the Government had simply to maintain what is known as law and order, and carry out those major functions always regarded as being within the particular province of any administration, it is possible that the national expenditure could be reduced most substantially. But the people of this Australian Democracy would not permit of that being done. Day after day members of the National Parliament, as well as members of the State Parliaments, Federal Ministers and State Ministers', are importuned by representative men from among the electors to do certain things which cannot be done without substantial increase of the national expenditure. And so I interjected in a friendly way when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> spoke just now of. the growing cost of government, but at the same time confessed that it was essential that the cost of government should be increased, since it was necessary to meet the growing needs of a growing community. We all hope to see the Commonwealth in the near future with a population of 15,000,000 or 20,000,000, and we must be sensible of the fact that all the services necessary for the achievement of. that great end, and for supplying all the conveniences of civilized life in a governmental sense to that- largely increased population, cannot be provided without money. I see nothing for it, therefore, but to increase the national expenditure. Having regard to the temper of this Democracy it must increase. The people are not going' to demand fewer services; obviously they will demand more. If they do, then more money will have to be spent, and that money can be found only by the development of the resources of. this continent at the hands of that increased number of people that we expect soon to have here. It is possible, perhaps, that some substantial economies might be effected in connexion with the working of the Commonwealth services if more attention were paid to the curtailing of what I might call minor expenditures in, perhaps, certain unnecessary directions. But I do not' anticipate that any very great savings can be achieved by a substantial curtailment of the major functions of the Commonwealth Government. Is any one going : to incur at this juncture the possible opprobrium of reducing our Defence vote? I would not care to bethe parliamentarian who' would vote for any substantial decrease of the financial provision which is necessary to defend the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- That is true. I am not .competent, without a very close study of the Budget, to point out where anything in the way of substantial economies can be achieved. We hear people say, "Why go on with the Federal Capital " ? I am one of those who have more respect for the Commonwealth Constitution, and for the promise made to the people of New South Wales, than to say that expenditure in connexion with the Federal Capital should be substantially curtailed. Australia, if it is going to be a nation worthy of the name, must eventually have that Federal Capital which it was intended it should possess at the time when the people entered into the agreement known as the Commonwealth Constitution. For a long time I had a sort of grudge against the people of New South Wales from a Federal stand-point, because of their somewhat lukewarmness in regard to entering the Australian Federation. They secured very considerable benefits, as the result of entering it. New South Wales was the oldest, and, at that time, the most important State, and she is to-day certainly the most important State from the stand-point of, if not territorial resources, at least population, but. she has benefited by no special provision inserted in the Constitution. Up to the present, the only expenditure that has been specially made in New South Wales is that which has been entailed by the comparatively moderate and slow development of the Commonwealth Capital Site. I admit that as a Tasmanian it would be quite satisfactory to me for the Parliament to continue to meet in Melbourne. If the people of Tasmania continued me as one of their representatives it would be more convenient for me to come to Melbourne than to go to Canberra. But, after all, the interests of that very large section of the Australian people who live in New South Wales have to be considered, and the spirit of the bond has also to be borne in mind. </para>

                                <para>- It is possibly not essential to have a Capital at all in the sense of establishing one at Canberra - but that is not the question. It was deemed to be essential when the Commonwealth was inaugurated, and there is ho doubt that the majority of the people still - because a very considerable minority of the 'population of Australia resides iri New South Wales - consider it essential. If we had a referendum to-morrow, the result in the affirmative would, I believe, be a considerable shock to those people who decry expenditure on the Federal Capital. </para>

                                <para>- We cannot complain if New South Wales now displays some insistence in regard to this matter, because nearly a quarter of a century has passed since the inception of Federation and we are still established in Melbourne. If the people- of New South Wales are willing to waive their claim to expenditure' on the Federal Capital at Canberra - if they do not want it - I am certainly not going to thrust the gift upon them. But I am quite sure that not one representative from New South Wales, which contains over 2,00.0,000 of Australia's population. would care to get up in his place in this chamber and say that New South Wales did not want the Federal Capital to be established within Federal territory as part and parcel of the Constitution. </para>

                                <para>- The fact of the matter is that any attempt to defer expenditure necessary for the establishment of the Commonwealth Capital would create a, feeling of resentment among the people of the Mother State, and possibly lead to certain friction which I, personally, would like to see absent from the working of the Commonwealth machine. Therefore, I do not see any particular virtue in urging economy or what may pass for economy in that direction.  Although we seem to be on the threshold of great events, and may faintly entertain very large hopes as to the  future, it would be unwise, seeing that human nature is what it is, for the Commonwealth to contemplate, at this moment,' any very serious reduction in its Defence expenditure. ' Let us remember that we have a continent almost empty of men. The population of Australia, though considerable in a sense and equal to that' of many historical European countries, is' congregated along what is practically the south-eastern seaboard. I read in an Australian publication the other day that if we drew a line across the north: of Australia, we would, find that the area north of the line, although including a very large portion of Commonwealth territory, contains a population of only about 8,000 persons. </para>

The question of defence is becoming a very difficult one for a Legislature to handle. Members of Parliament must be largely dependent nowadays, so far as legislative action is concerned, on the opinions of technical advisers of the Government. War has become a highly technical operation. In the successful conduct of any warlike operations %  sound defence  scheme is just as important as a well thought out aggressive movement. We all know, of course, of the comparatively recent developments in regard to submarines, aeroplanes, and particularly in the field of chemical research as applied to the manufacture of high explosives, and for our opinions on all these aspects of defence we must be dependent upon highly technical and professional advisers. I have no doubt that an attempt is being made to defend Australia on fairly economical lines, but, after all, defence, to be effective, cannot be very economical. If there is any golden rule for the defence of the Commonwealth I should like . to hear of it. If <inline font-style="italic">plonguers</inline> as the French call a certain form of submarines, or as we call them, submersibles, are going to , be the naval arm of the future, let the technical advisers say so. If there are going to be no capital ships in any future scheme of naval defence, .then I, as a legislator, cannot' determine that question. </para>

                        <para class="block">If it be said that high explosives, used by aviators, have placed in the power, of flying men the ability to destroy all capital ships, that is a question which I, as a layman, cannot decide. It must be determined by men of technical knowledge and experience. All I can say is that the defence .of this continent, by 6,000,000 of people,' who want' all the country's financial resources for its material development, is a tremendous task. It is a task that must make any outbreak, or threatened outbreak of war, almost a nightmare to any Government worthy of the name. My vote will not go; in these times, for the reduction of any of the provisions necessary to our defence. </para>

                                <para>- So far as the munitioning of the forces necessary to defend Australia is concerned-and I use the term in its larger sense - I confess myself to be incapable of judging whether we should spend more money on the fleet, on the air, or on our Citizen Defence Forces. Australia really wants peace. We are a peaceful people. We have no intention of being ' aggressive towards any of the other nations of the world. All we sincerely hope is that other nations will cease to be aggressive, and leave us alone. But let us not be weak. Let us do our best to defend ourselves should the occasion arise. Let us take time by the forelock and make the necessary provision against any possible danger "of the future. For what has been one of the most prolific causes of unrest in the world ? Why is our Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> going to. Washington? Why has that Conference been called in Washington? It has been convened, as we know, because of national weakness of a people who ought to be strong. It has been called because a nation that has plenty of men lacks that cohesion, that unity, and that directness of patriotic purpose that should enable it to use these men aright. I speak of China. If China were only a moderately strong military nation, do honorable senators think that there would have been any necessity for the Washington Conference? The state of affairs in China is the bone of contention. Iris the possible cause of another war which may drag the exhausted countries of Europe into its vortex to their hurt, and, perhaps, to the eternal ruin of civilization itself. All this talk about the open door in. China, of maintaining the integrity of. China, is due to the fact that China is too weak to determine these issues for herself. Nobody talks in this way about the sphere of influence in Japan. Why?. Because the Japanese have developed the power  to look after their, own interests ; consequently, nobody is knocking at their door and saying, "Open - you must open, or we shall force it." The outsiders have too much sense; they know it would be a hazardous enterprise to attempt the forcing of the Japanese door. It is because of the weakness of the great nation of Eastern Asia that we in Australia are oppressed, and threatened with a kind of nightmare of another great war to which we might have to become a party, and thus load ourselves and our posterity with a burden almost too heavy to be borne. </para>

                                <para>- It never has been very aggressive. When we consider the peculiar situation of China, and read the history of the nations around her territory, we find that those nations have nearly always been the invaders of China. Very rarely has China invaded the territories of the nations and tribes surrounding what is ordinarily known as the Chinese Empire. Hordes of horsemen have invaded China from time to time; the invaders possessed what the Chinese did not, namely, cavalry, and were mobile and able to impose their rule on China. </para>

                                <para>- Mongols, who were the very men who overran China, They are of the same race, but no more Chinese than the Japanese are; they bear about the same racial relationship to the Chinese as the Japanese. In a sense we might call the Turks Chinamen, seeing that their original home was on the borders of the Chinese Empire. They are not, however, Chinese, nor are the Manchus, although all are of the Mongol race. The Chinese have imposed their civilization on surrounding nations more by example or peaceful penetration than anything else; they have done so on many nations, much as the Romans imposed their civilization on the nations surrounding the original Roman territory- by a kind of innate civilized superiority. If all the nations had the same temperament as the Chinese, and the same lack of desire to interfere in the affairs of foreign nations, we should be a peaceful and happy world. I believe that the Chinese are the only nation which, until the last few years, sincerely believed in and were supporters of the principle of international arbitration. I trust that as one of the results of the, Washington Conference wisdom will be justified of her children, and that the Chinese will peacefully get what they imagine to be their rights in the development of their territory. </para>

I feel sure that that gentleman will play an honorable and distinguished part, so far as his inclusion in the British delegation will permit. However, at this stage, I ask the . leave of the Senate to continue my remarks on another occasion. </para>
