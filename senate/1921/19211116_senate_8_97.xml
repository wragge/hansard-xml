            <para>- I have seen the statement referred to, and I am in a position to say that, unlike most press statements, it is correct. It is possible that some little apology is due to the Senate because an intimation in this regard was not made to honorable senators before the adjournment on Friday. Possibly if any one is to blame in the matter I am. Circumstances necessitated my visiting New SouthWales last week-end, otherwise the duty of making the announcement would have fallen to me. In my &#39;absence something went a little wrong in the channel of communication, and so far as my personal share in the matter is concerned I apologize to the Senate for not being present to make the announcement on Friday last. </para>

Of these a. large proportion, namely, fortynine, have been accepted without modification of any kind. </para>

            <para>- I am not. carrying my analysis as far as that at this stage. I am giving the simple statement) as the figures reveal it. They were requests from the Senate, and the other House has accepted forty-nine of them without modification. Of the balance, eighteen have been modified in more or less important details, while twenty-two requests have been rejected. In addition, one request has been accepted in part and modified in part, and two requests have been modified in part and rejected in part. It will * therefore be seen that the requests made by the Senate have been dealt with by the other House in a very liberal manner. This is especially the case when it is seen that in a number of instances the modifications made in the Senate&#39;s requests are of a more or less nominal nature, the requests being modified only to a slight degree. Instances of this kind may be seen in requests Nos. 35 to 38 relating to agricultural machinery, where the only alteration is an increase of 2&#163; per cent, in the British preferential rate. In a few metal items, where the request was for a reduction of 5 per cent, on the British preferential rate, a compromise is suggested by the other House in making the reduction 2^ per cent. Instances of this are items 180 c and 194 c and d. In some other items the modification consists merely of an alteration in the date of operation or a slight addition necessary to) give effect to the intention, of the Senate. Examples of this are item 34, animals, living; item 126, saddlers&#39; webs, &#38;c. ; item 171 d, metal parts of hay rakes and mowers; item 275, sulphur; item 324 a, chamois leather; item 384 a, photographic dry plates, &#38;c, and item 403, manures. There remain some twenty to twenty-five items in which the request has been rejected or modified in a more or less substantial degree. </para>

            <para>- That is largely a matter of opinion. I am not affirming that the requests made by the Senate were good, bad, or indifferent. They were the requests of this Chamber, and I am merely relating the manner in which the other House dealt with them. I would be the last, person to deny that the Senate has full constitutional rights. It may insist upon all its requests if it thinks fit to do so, and the other House has an equal right. It is a necessary feature of the bicameral system that, where two Houses differ, both cannot have their way entirely. It seems to me that there <inline font-style="italic">U</inline> an obligation on both branches of the Legislature, where differences of opinion reveal themselves, and seeing that finality has to be reached somewhere, to make a reasonable effort to adjust such differ ences  as  occur from time to time. I submit that the other House has approached the; matter in that spirit. A large percentage of the Senate&#39;s requests has been complied with, and an additional number has been accepted with quite modest modifications, thus indicating that there was in the other House  a  desire to come to an understanding with the Senate. I appeal to members of this Chamber to approach the discussion in the same spirit. If they .do that, I feel confident that when we have finished with this measure there will be little outstanding difference between ourselves and the House of Representatives. Honorable members know as well as I do that the trading interests of the country not merely desire, but need, as prompt  a  settlement of the Tariff  as  is possible. Without, therefore, suggesting that honorable senators should curtail any remarks they may feel called upon to make, I trust that they will join with the Government in expediting the further progress of this measure. It is many months  since  the Tariff was first introduced, and, although the Senate cannot be held responsible for the time consumed, it can, at any rate, help in making the period as brief as possible in the circumstances. I, therefore, look to the Committee to make  a  reasonable effort to deal with, this matter as promptly as its importance permits. </para>

          <para>. - I realize with the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> what our position is in, regard to these duties. I look upon it as purely a  matter of taxation. For the first year of its operation, this measure realized &#163;32,000,000, within  a  few thousand pounds. That money was taken chiefly from the working classes - poorer classes - of the community. This year, judging from the first quarter, the revenue will be between &#163;26,000,000 and &#163;28,000,000. In matters of taxation I think the other House has  a  pull over the Senate. They have to take the responsibility of meeting the electors on these purely financial matters. If they have decided to put  a  wall around Australia that will injure trade, penalize people for trading, and set up what, to my mind, is an iniquitous and obnoxious system, that is their business. I am still quite prepared to do my utmost to see that the primary producers get a fair deal, and I think a majority of the Committee are also in favour of acting in that direction. As regards taxation of this kind, it is very evident that the Government have determined to take about &#163;30,000,000-they took &#163;32,000,000 last year - from the working classes, and in this connexion they were well supported in another place. I do not think there were many dissentients there. The only objection offered to this obnoxious system of taxation was when individual interests were concerned; but when it was a question of the other fellow there was no opposition. I view the position as the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> does, and agree that the powers of each House have to be recognised and acknowledged, so that when the differences are distinct and acute we should consider them in a reasonable and sensible manner. We have to ascertain how we can handle this question so that both Houses may come to an honorable and acceptable settlement. It is useless to keep the measure off the statute-book, seeing that it has been in operation since March, 1920. The Tariff is being usedfor raising an enormous amount from the primary producers in the interests of the secondary producers, because if a man in the city engages half-a-dozen men he can secure the highest possible protection for his industry, and can compel the farmers and others from one end of the Commonwealth to the other to help him, when they are very often quite unable to do so. Why should we protect industries that cannot pay their own way? Why should we shut out trade from Great Britain by imposing duties of 45 per cent. ? Some honorable senators pretend that that excessive rate is not sufficient and would favour the imposition of duties of 50 per cent. There is sufficient protection against British manufacturers in consequence of the distance from our markets and the high freights which have to be paid. As an Australian I resent this action. We should trade with. Britain on terms of equality, particularly when there is sufficient natural protection in the direction I have mentioned. This Bill strikes a most crushing blow at the trade of Australia, and those who are supporting it will have to take the responsibility. I have done my utmost to show a reasonable way of conducting trade, but as a majority of members in this and another place do not support my contentions, all that I can say is that the sooner the measure is out of the way the better it will be. If we do not move quickly in this matter Melbourne merchants will soon be going around saying that they are surprised at the moderate requests that they have made. As this Parliament is constituted, it Would be an easy matter to impose duties up to 100 per cent. The sooner we close down on this obnoxious measure the better it will be for the primary producers and the working classes of the Commonwealth. </para>

Ultimately, by the imposition of high duties, and the exclusion of importations,  industries in Australia are assisted, and goods become cheaper. To carry out my desire I would have to transgress the Standing Orders, and as I do not wish to merit your reproach, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> I shall conclude by saying that I regret the Leader of the Oppositiou cannot realize that the establishment of industries in Australia is in the best interest of the workers and the community generally. </para>

The effect of the request submitted by the Committee was, therefore, to make all the living animals specified free except those which came in for stud purposes. The other House accepted the request, and now suggests that we should strike out the words &#34; except for stud purposes.&#34; </para>

In the 1914 Tariff there was no alteration. The 1920 Tariff, as introduced, embodied , the rates of1s. 6d., 2s. 6d., and 2s. 6d. per cental. The House of Representatives increased those rates to1d. per lb. in each column, and the Senate made a request that the duty be&#189;d. per lb. The request of the Senate was negatived by the House of Representatives by a very substantial majority, and the duty now stands at1d. per lb. in each column. I need not reiterate the statements which were made very freely in this Chamber as to the position of the banana industry and its need for this protection. I move - </para>

        <para class="block">We have had two Governments, representing two different parties, which considered that ls. 6d. per cental was a sufficient duty. Then a Government, with a Minister representing banana growers, considered a duty of 2s. 6d. sufficient. Now it is desired to make the duty Ss. 4d., and the Minister in charge of this Chamber says he is going to accept the proposal. If we agree to this, I do not think we can refuse anything. Why should we multiply the old Tariff on bananas roughly by six, when we know that this fruit has become a common article of food? We must realize that Australia has lost a large volume of trade -with Fiji through imposing duties on bananas grown, in those islands. A steamer which used to trade regularly between Fiji and Australia has ceased running. </para>

            <para>-We have actually cut off our trade with a British Colony to the injury, chiefly, of Australian traders. This has been done for the sake of making the Australian banana growers a little more wealthy. Within, the last few months one of the most influential citizens of Suva visited Sydney, and he pointed out that the Fiji trade which had hitherto gone to Australia had now been transferred to New Zealand. I resided for twelve months in Fiji, and became aware of the keenness with which New Zealand business men catered for the trade of those islands. I am shocked at the apathy of the Commonwealth Parliament in neglecting such commercial opportunities. The banana trade has been the most profitable producing industry of Australia. The Minister represents his party, which believes in increasing the duty from ls. 6d. to 8s. 4d. per cental. I do not say the Minister himself believes in this action. </para>

            <para>- There is a difference between the Minister and myself in this respect: I am not advocating what my party advocated in another place. The members of my party there are all out of step with me. The exigencies of government make it necessary for the Minister to press for high duties because the people imagine that high duties mean prosperity. I have watched the growth of unemployment since the banana duties have been imposed. I have been told by the waterside workers in Sydney that the duty on bananas alone has injured them to the extent of &#163;3,000 a month less in wages than they received before the duty was put on. That is a serious loss. </para>

            <para>- We cannot blame them -if they have become inoculated with the pernicious doctrine of Protection. I repeat that the Tariff on bananas has taken &#163;3,000 out of the pockets of the waterside workers in New South Wales, with the result that a large number of them have been thrown upon the labour market in my State, without any corresponding advantage to the banana-growers of Queensland. Can any honorable senator say that there has been any perceptible increase in the production of bananas as the direct result of the duties ? The taunt most generally levelled at those of us who represent the Labour party is that we look after class interests only; but if ever there was a measure designed for the protection of class interests it is this Tariff schedule. </para>

            <para>- I said I was out of step with my party in another place. I can say with every confidence that the whole of the people I represent in New South Wales are in step with me on this question. The Tariff on bananas has, cost us the trade of Fiji, which represents anything from &#163;600,000 to &#163;1,000,000 per year, and which has been steadily developing in recent years. It would be better for the Commonwealth Government .to distribute &#163;500,000 in cash among the banana-growers in Queensland rattier than sacrifice the Fiji trade, because it will not be long before this trade amounts to &#163;2,000,000 or &#163;3,000,000 a year. </para>

            <para>- Of course, I do not expect the honorable senator to see the point I am endeavouring to make, because he represents Queensland interests. As I have already said, the Tariff on bananas has lost to us a valuable and growing trade with Fiji. It has gone elsewhere. I do not know that the requested amendment made by the Senate, reducing the duties to 4s. 2d. per cental, would have retained to Australia the Fiji trade; but, at all events, it would have been an indication to the people and the business men of Fiji that the Senate, at all events, was not anxious to flout Fiji interests, and treat them as if they were foreigners and undesirables. </para>

From a producing point of view, it is unques tionably the richest State in Australia. Notwithstanding this, the wheat-growers of the other States, producers who cannot look to get more than &#163;4 per acre off their land, are called upon to pay 300 per cent, protection to the banana growers of Queensland, men who can get &#163;200 per acre from banana growing. </para>

            <para>- No. The banana growers&#39; Minister asked for it, but as a matter of fact he asked originally for only 2s. 6d. per cental. He would not have had the audacity to ask for 8s. 4d. Another place increased the duty to 8s. 4d., and this Committee requested a reduction to 4s. 2d., but the Minister representing those northern growers, men occupying the richest land in the Commonwealth, has sent the item back to us. </para>

          <para>. - I have no desire to unduly prolong the discussion upon this item, which was very well debated when last it was under consideration by this Committee. Most of the arguments then used are still fresh in our memories, but I want to put this point. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> has suggested that we should try and meet the other Chamber. I am with him to a certain extent. I agree that there should be compromise, but the compromise should be on both sides. When we requested a reduction of the duty to 4&#171;. 2d. per cental, it was, I think &#39; a very generous compromise on our part. Now that it has been returned to this Committee without any concession from another place, it is time we reconsidered our position. If the opinion of honorable1  senators without any sense of compromise had found expression on the last occasion, the item would have been returned to the House of Representatives with a request to make the duty ls. 6d., as it was before. The banana industry has grown up and flourished under a protection of ls. 6d. per cental, and, to use <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> expression, those engaged in the industry have now the audacity to ask for a duty  of 8s. 4d. per cental on bananas, and another place has had the audacity to ask the Senate to agree to that .duty. </para>

The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> has asked that we should consider the message of the House of Representatives in a spirit of compromise, and I say  that if a compromise is to be effected, that spirit must animate both sides.

I ask honorable senators to consider the quality of the bananas that have been delivered in this State from Queensland since this matter was last under consideration. </para>

It is a scientific fact that when tha stalk is removed from a bunch of bananas the fruit will not ripen properly. Queensland and the Tweed River bananas-growers, having been relieved of the competition from Java, Fiji, and elsewhere, have begun to lop off the stalks of the bunches very closely. </para>

They have recently begun to  knock off the stalks, and, as a consequence, an  ingredent  in the- stalks, which, turns the skin of the banana into sugar and starch, is removed, and the absence of the stalk prevents the ripening process taking place. </para>

            <para>- Bananas were imported from Fiji on the stalk, and were ripened on the stalk. Tho bananas that come from Queensland and the Tweed River at the present time are not on the stalk, and cannot be ripened properly, because the ingredient in the stalk necessary for the proper  ripening  of the fruit is removed. The lopping off of the stalk is done by the Queensland growers because they naturally wish in this way to save freight. This is one of the results of giving the Queensland growers of bananas a monopoly of the industry. </para>

          <para>. - Although most honorable senators will recognise in me a fairly strong Protectionist, I am not, as a representative of Western Australia, influenced in the consideration of this  item  by either Free Trade or Protectionist principles. Western Australia is in the unfortunate position that it cannot possibly obtain bananas from Queensland or New South Wales, since the Western Australian market is too far away to be supplied from those sources. Western Australia has been, and will continue to be, supplied from Java. If we do not get them from there we will be completely cut off from the only place able to supply the western State with this food commodity. It is clear, therefore, that any duty imposed on bananas must be paid by the Western Australian people, and the duty under consideration represents a very serious impost upon a most important article of food. </para>

            <para>- I am talking of bananas, and not of oranges, just now. Good fruit of various kinds is grown in Western Australia, but bananas are not grown there. In the more northern latitudes of the State the rainfall is insufficient for successful banana &#39;culture. No matter what duty is imposed on bananas they will not be grown in Western Australia. I shall therefore vote against any increase in the duty on bananas, which can only have the effect of increasing the cost of food in the western State. </para>

            <para>- I see that the amendment I proposed to submit  would be a direct negative of the motion before the Chair, and honorable senators who agree with me in this matter may attain their objectby voting against the motion submittedby the Minister. It is unnecessary that I should delay the Committee very long in referring to this item, as the pros and cons were fully considered on a previous occasion. It is very difficult today to obtain bananas. And it is a very great hardship indeed that the people of this country should be called upon to pay, because of the duty on bananas,1d. more per lb. for what has become almost a necessary household food. In many districts of Australia the apple-grower has to sell his apples in case lots wholesale at about 1d. per lb. There are places where apples havebeen sold at less than1d.per lb. </para>

            <para>- I do not care two straws if the shops charge 10s. per lb. for them. I am talking of what I know. I say that apples are grown and sold in many districts in Australia for about1d. per lb. It is questionable whether, in many cases, the growers will obtain as much as1d. per lb. for them this year. Yet we are asked to give a protection of 1d. per lb. to fruit grown in one corner of Australia. The proposal is ridiculous and absurd. I would never have supported the Senate&#39;s request for a duty of 4s.2d. per cental on bananas had it not been that I was willing to be influenced by the spirit of compromise to which the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> has referred. Our request has been returned to us, and we are again asked to vote for a duty of 8s. 4d. per cental on bananas. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> very fairly and forcibly put the position when he said that Queensland is one of the wealthiest States, from a productive point of view, in Australia, and yet there is no State which requires so much spoonfeeding for its industries. </para>

            <para>- What I am saying is a fact. We know that co-operative societies with large capital behind them in different States of the Commonwealth have, in the last two years, gone under because they could not carryon with the present price of sugar. I have heard a statement put before the directorate of a co-operative society in South Australia to the effect that they, could not carry on unless they could obtain sugar at a price within their reach. </para>

            <para>- I very often enjoy bananas cut into slices with a little sugar sprinkled on them; and as sugar is used in this way in the consumption of bananas, my remarks may be considered in order. Whilst not wishing to take up an antagonistic attitude towards the other House, and whilst endeavouring to meet them in the spirit suggested, I am going to ask the Senate to sit firm, and to give some consideration to those who have to rear large families in the cities. The people in the towns should be allowed to get fresh fruit at a reasonable price. </para>

Millen),</inline> who said that the acceptance by the other Chamber of half of our requests was a prompting to us to approach the subject in the same spirit. Although the. House of Representatives has accepted virtually half of our requests, we have to consider, side by side with that fact, the nature of the requests to which they agreed. Turn to such trifles as &#34; lemon peel&#34; - no doubt that amendment represents a resounding reform in this country. Turn to &#34;Parisian flowers&#34; - I suppose about a barrow load of those would be used in the Commonwealth in a year. That is another one of the Senate&#39;s requests to which the House of Representatives has agreed. The list is full of them. Another one of the same class is &#34;waste for engine cleaning.&#34; </para>

            <para>- If we consider the nature and character of the requests to which the House of Representatives has agreed, as well as the number of them, it means that they have surrendered the shadow while hanging on to the substance. I do not want any apologies to be made in this Chamber. If this Tariff is going to have stamped upon it the <inline font-style="italic">imprimatur</inline> of this Parliament, it is about time the Senate made its influence and voice felt inthe country. It is also time that the Government listened with a willing ear, not only to what is spoken in the other House, but also to what is uttered in this Senate. In regard to bananas, I indorse thoroughly what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said about the prevalent tendency of people in favorable positions to seek still more and more favours. It is about time to raise a protest on behalf of those who, at least, have not lost their sense of decency, and have not been filled to the eyelids with unseemly selfishness. This item is a typical example of the selfish action of these men. We have it on the authority of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> that arable lands in the Queensland jungle are commanding &#163;30 an acre, and that the axe is going into them. He also said that labour in North Queensland was commanding a wage of &#163;9 a week. For dairying and wheat-growing, which employ the overwhelming bulk of land workers, these conditions would be impossible. The wheat-growers would have to go out of business. I re-echo what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said with full justification, that it is time we called a halt to the extremely mad, preposterous demands of those who come to Parliament and ask for favours to which they are not justly entitled. A duty of1s. 6d. per 100 lbs. on bananas was considered to be sufficient, and has been proved to be sufficient, to establish the industry in this country. The Government came down and asked for an increase. A suggestion was made by a member of another House, and the duty was bumped up, even against the expectation of the member who asked for it, to 8s. 4d. This Chamber, in the exercise of its constitutional power, which, I hope, it will always jealously hang fast to and assert, said that 8s. 4d. was too much, and cut the figure down to 4s. 2d. Now we are told that we must accept what the other place has put before us. </para>

            <para>- The Minister proposed that this Senate should agree to what the other place has proposed. That means that the other place shouldbe supreme. It is time that we set a period to these extra demands upon Parliament. I do not wish to obtrude the circumstances of my own State, although Western Australia offers no apology for the stand it has taken in this Chamber. It has shown, if any State has shown, a characteristic unselfishness whenever it was a question of establishing a truly fair and scientific Tariff. When it comes to the balance of equity being tilted, and of men temporarily forgetting themselves, then I must look to the interests of my own State. It has been said by previous speakers that . Western Australia can never hope to get bananas from within the continental area. It is physically and commercially impossible, except, of course, at a prohibitive price. I saw samples of bananas in the western State the other day priced at1s. 6d. a dozen. No one would have taken them out of a rubbish tip in the eastern States. The voice of Western Australiamay not be listened to, but we are not going to be submerged without a protest. In the past we have had to rely upon supplies from eastern countries. A duty of1d. per lb. means that the Java trade is cut out by the root. The policy of revenge or aggressiveness can be carried to such an extreme point that it will land us in trouble. The eastern countries are talking of Tariffs against Australian products. The markets for temperate-climate fruits of the western state are being narrowed. Does not the same statement apply to the eastern fruit-growers as well? If we are going to have a Tariff, let us have a reasonable one, and not stark, staring prohibition. We ought not to have a Tariff which says to the natives of the South Sea Islands or elsewhere, &#34; Stand off the grass. You do not exist as far as this item is concerned.&#34; That is not a sound policy. We have Mandated Territories, and howare we going to treat them ? Are they going to be taxed and take our products, and put no impediment in our way ? They would be less than&#39; human if they did. As one who is, and hopes to be, inseparably associated with country interests, I say this proposition of the banana-growers of this country is absurd, unreasonable, and unjust. I have much pleasure in supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson&#39;s</inline> proposition, believing that it is the minimum that we should get. If I do not succeed, then, like the beggar of old, I shall have to accept the crumbs that fall from the table of Dives, some of whose progeny are well developed in this country. In order to build up ain industry under fair terms and to give the consuming population a fair deal, the Senate should press this request. </para>

          <para>. - Some of those honorable senators who have spoken against the increase of duty on bananas have assured the Committee that the expression of their views has not been prompted in any way by antagonism to what has been done in the other Chamber. I gathered from the vehemence with which they expressed their opinions that their attitude is very hostile to the State in which most of our bananas are grown. A duty of 8s. 4d. per cental, or1d. per lb., is exactly the same as the protection afforded to the growers of citrus fruits, while all other fruits except citrus  fruits  and bananas enjoy a protection of 6s. per cental. I cannot understand how honorable members can justify a smaller measure of protection for bananas than for any other kind of fruit grown in the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- Once a plum orchard has been established it is good for fifty years, and the plum-grower is very much nearer to his market than the banana-grower. Also, he has not to compete with the same class of labour. The basic wage fixed by the Board of Tradein New South Wales is &#163;4 5s. per week. That, I suppose, may be regarded as somewhere near the average wage paid for unskilled labour throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- That may be the honorable senator&#39;s opinion. There the cost of marketing is not the same as it is in connexion with bananas. The wages paid in Fiji average about 15s. per week, so that the prevailing rate in New South Wales and Queensland is at least four times higher than that paid by the Fiji growers. If any discrimination whatever is to be made in considering the claims of the Fiji growers and those in the Commonwealth, it ought to be in favour of those in the Commonwealth. A good deal has been said concerning the alleged loss of trade which has occurred since the imposition of the higher duty, but no figures have been submitted in proof of such a contention. We know that the <inline font-style="italic">Levuka</inline> has been withdrawn from the Fiji- Australian service, and that the <inline font-style="italic">Suva</inline> has taken her place. Last year the Colonial Sugar Refining Company placed the <inline font-style="italic">Fiona,</inline> a very fine steamer, in the service between Sydney and Fiji. </para>

At the outbreak of war the Colonial Sugar Refining Company had a vessel nearing completion which was commandeered by the Imperial authorities. The company then placed an order for a second vessel, which on completion was also secured by the British Government and run under charter for a time. At the termination of hostilities the vessel was handed over to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and was placed in the Fiji trade. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator was anxious to raise a very high wall to protect the timber industry when the Tariff was previously before the Committee. He is evidently one of those Protectionists who wants Free Trade for everything he buys, and Protection for every commodity which he or the State he represents has to sell. He is another geographical Protectionist of which we unfortunately ha.ve so many. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> referred to the reduced, employment on the Sydney wharfs, but surely he realizes that there has been a considerable falling off in the shipping trade of the world, and that the Sydney wharf labourers are not alone in that respect. Nobody knows better than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that owing to a number of causes, of which the duty on bananas is not- one, Burns, Philp and Company, who had a whole fleet of steamers trading between Sydney and the islands, have formed a new company, and that Sydney is no longer the head-quarters of that fleet. A great deal of the products of the islands that came to Sydney for transhipment now go direct to San Francisco, particularly copra, which is one of the principal products of the South Sea Islands. Protection had nothing whatever to do with this development. We had a little dissertation from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> in regard to the difference in the quality of the Queensland and Fiji bananas. Those who are in the business, and who speak with authority, say that the chief distinction between the two is that the Fiji banana has a bitter flavour which is not present in the Queensland product. The very best bananas which are made available to consumers are still labelled &#34;Fiji,&#34; and it is. only those which are over-ripe which are sold as Queensland bananas. I have never seen bananas* ripened on the stalk for commercial purposes because the fruit at one end ripens before that at the other, and consequently  when they go into the ripening sheds they are severed from the stalk. The Queensland and Fiji bananas are ripened here in the same way, and as a rule the process takes about a fortnight after they reach t&#62;he southern ports. &#39;We have heard a good deal of the unsatisfactory position in which Western Australia is placed in consequence of the imposition of a duty of 8s. 4d. per cental. </para>

            <para>- Since then, I understand, a company in Western Australia, which has had considerable experience in the fruit business, has made arrangements to plant 5,000 acres with bananas and pineapples, and I am much surprised that the representative of that great State - because Western Australia, like Queensland, is one possessing vast possibilities - should offer such opposition. The industries of Western Australia will have to be fostered in their early stages, and the proposition now before the Committee will assist in that direction. This is an industry which should be given every protection, because a large number of people can be settled on a comparatively small area. </para>

Tha higher rate is quite unnecessary. We should remember that Queensland has been given special consideration by the people of Australia, because the sugar industry has received handsome protection at the expense of the consumers. </para>

          <para class="block">I have been following the debate on this particular item with a great deal of interest. An ordinary listener who is not seized with the actual position might imagine from the utterances of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> that the Committee was endeavouring to take away protection from those engaged in the banana industry in Queensland. I desire to consider the matter from a reasonable point of view, and, in doing so, recall the words of the Minister, who said that the spirit of compromise should enter into the consideration of the items.&#34; One honorable senator said that the spirit of compromise had actuated the Committee in requesting that the item be amended by reducing the duty from 8s. 4d. to 4s. 2d. per cental, when it was before us some weeks ago. I think the honorable senator was perfectly correct in what .he said. The fact is that before the introduction of the new Tariff the duty was ls. 6d. per cental, and under that protection the banana industry had become established. I personally had never heard of any great hardship being suffered by those engaged in the industry on account of that duty. It was proposed under the original schedule that the Tariff should be increased to 2s. 6d. per cental, in order that the growers might have the necessary additional protection on account of the alteration in the cost of labour in the banana fields. For some reason or other, the House of Representatives increased the original duty of 2s. 6d. to 8s. 4d. I think the majority df members in the Senate took a reasonable view, and followed the course of compromise in requesting the House of Representatives to reduce the duty of 8s. 4d. to 4s. 2d. I intend to support the request of the Senate, because I believe 4s. 2d. per cental will give those engaged in the industry all the protection required for years ahead. </para>

            <para>- ^1 may not know as much about them as the honorable senator, but every member has the privilege of giving expression to his opinions. I shall not be a party to unnecessarily imposing a burden on the consumers. Australia should not adopt a policy of isolation, and tell neighbouring countries, with whom we have been trading for years, that we do not wish to have any more dealings with them commercially. Such an attitude must re-act prejudicially upon Australia. Our trade with Java is no small thing, and it is growing year by year. In 1918 goods of Australian production were exported to Java to the extent of &#163;2,500,000 worth, and I believe the trade now reaches considerably over &#163;3,000,000. In 1918 the export trade with that country in butter represented &#163;368,000; in flour, &#163;391,000; and in apparel and textiles, &#163;35,000. Almost every newspaper of note has published paragraphs urging the necessity to cultivate trade with Java, with a view to considerably increasing it, and also to foster, as far as possible, commercial&#39; relations of a more favorable character with the Pacific Islands. Our export trade withFiji is not very great, but it is worth having. In 1918-19 it was valued at over &#163;500,000. </para>

            <para>- No. I am not adopting a Free Trade attitude when I am, supporting a protection of 4s. 2d. per cental on bananas. I believe that that is a greater duty than tha growers in Queensland ever expected. From conversations I have had with Queensland people, I am quite satisfied that they were very delighted to find that the Senate had agreed to a duty of 4s. 2d., and they believed that that would give ample protection. </para>

            <para>- I do not think so, but they are interested <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the development of Queensland. I say advisedly that we cannot afford to run the risk of losing the trade we have already built up with the Pacific Islands and Java. Prominent men in Fiji and other Pacific Islands have said that if the present prohibitive Tariff is retained it must eventually lead to strained commercial relations between Australia and those islands. New Zealand is carefully watching Australia&#39;s attitude, and cannot be blamed if it endeavours to score a point at bur expense. </para>

            <para>- If we grant a duty of 4s. 2d. per cental on bananas, it cannot be called a flagrant injustice, because it will be giving the growers three times as much protection as they have ever before had. An increase from ls. 6d. to 4s. 2d. is a big one. The Queensland growers have always had to compete with Fiji, and have been able to carry on with a Tariff of ls. 6d. I intend to support the Senate&#39;s request. </para>

          <para>.- Honorable senators seem to have made up their mind on this question, and I do not expect that any discussion at this stage will alter their opinions; but there are one <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> two facts concerning Free Trade and Protection to be considered. I do not think tropical fruit has bv fir been so cheap in Melbourne as it is at present. Bananas are cheaper than ever before. If the people are deprived of Fiji bananas, they can. get others equally as good. There is a special train from Queensland to Melbourne once a week, and bananas grown in Queensland, and on the Tweed River, are distributed at various places along the railway. Australian bananas have been put on the market as Fiji fruit. </para>

            <para>- It has been stated by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.  Greene)</inline> that no Fiji bananas have come into Australia since the Tariff was put on. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> could not have seen Fiji bananas, unless they had been brought to Australia &#39;privately. A couple of nights before I left Queensland prior to the resumption of the parliamentary session, I entered a fruit shop in Brisbane, and purchased a smoothleaved pineapple for ls. 3d. On my arrival in Melbourne I saw similar pineapples in the shop windows for. ls. each. Previously one could not purchase a pineapple at anything less than double the Queensland price. This shows the benefit of the special fruit train. </para>

            <para>- By special arrangement the fruit train supplies all the towns along the railway from Brisbane to Melbourne. A great deal of the trouble connected with the ripening of bananas is due to the fact that the banana merchants have not installed proper plants. If the bananas are placed in a sweating chamber, and the heat properly regulated, the whole of the fruit will mature regularly. </para>

            <para>- If the banana merchants of Melbourne obtain green bananas and make proper provision for them they will ripen satisfactorily. The Queensland and New South Wales growers are anxious  that the duty should stand. What is all the fuss about ? The duty only represents 1d. per lb., and in the Tariff there are very many other fruits carrying duties of from 3d. to 6d. per lb. It must not be forgotten that the banana is a soft fruit, and will not stand a lot of handling. It should be marketed promptly.I have every sympathy with the position of the people of Western Australia, but it appears that bananas can be grown there, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> mentioned a company that had been formed for this purpose. </para>

            <para>- It is strange that Queensland industries found no place at ali in the pictures illustrating the visit of the Prince of Wales, but bananas, said to have been grown in Western Australia, were included, though the fruit shown was the most miserable bunch I have ever seen. If bananas can be grown in Western Australia, the people of that State have not very much to complain about in regard to the Tariff. I admit that at present their position is rather difficult, but every Tariff hits some people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> referring to the sugar industry, said that Queensland was the most spoon-fed State in the whole of the Commonwealth. May we not also say that Victorian industries have been spoonfed? The industries of this State, under the influence of Protection, have become well established, and the banana industry ill Queensland will have the same experience. The cultivation of bananas will go a long way towards solving the labour problem. It is essentially a one-man, or family, industry, and it leads to a great deal of closer settlement. Therefore it should have a chance. </para>

          <para>. - I do not care to give a silent vote upon this item, because in the north of my own State there are some thousands of banana-growers. I do not claim that the area, under cultivation for bananas is large. Nevertheless, it is an important industry, and I do not want to lose sight of the fact that many of the men engaged in it are returned soldiers who had to pay a high price for their land, and who, of course, had to be assisted as far as possible by the Government in order to make their venture a success. Twelve months ago I took the first opportunity that presented itself after the last general election to visit the North Coast districts, and saw a great many banana plantations. I also spoke to a large number of growers, not one ofwhom made any representation to me for an increase in the duty, which then was1s. 6d. per cental. Nor have I had any representations since then. </para>

            <para>- I believe it is, but that does not alter the fact that when the duty was1s. 6d. per cental they had to compete with the Fiji bananas, and I understand they were able to compete successfully.Large profits were made in the industry. If any honorable senator will take the trouble to peruse the advertisements in the Sydney newspapers at any time during the last twelve months or so, he will find that it was stated that huge fortunes were being made, and that values of banana land increased enormously. The duty then was1s. 6d. per cental. Now this Committee is being asked to agree to a duty of 8s. 4d. I am not saying one word against the Australian-grown banana, and I do not believe it is necessary to do so in order to produce evidence against this proposed duty. I have found the Australian-grown banana to be just as good as anything grown in any other part of the world. </para>

            <para>- That raises this issue: If the Queensland banana-growers can place bananas on the market at such a low rate as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> suggests, they need not fear competition from Fiji. The object of the duty is to enable the Queensland and New South Wales growers of bananas to obtain a higher price than they could obtain if they had to compete with bananas grown in Fiji. The banana has become almost a staple article of diet, and is especially used by children. We are proposing, by an excessive duty, to make it more difficult for children to obtain this fruit. If I had received any representations from banana-growers in New South Wales, and theywere able to show me that it was absolutely essential for the success of their industry that this duty should be imposed, I might have been prepared to support it. I have received no such representations, and I can only assume that New South Wales banana-growers are satisfied with the previous action taken by the Committee in dealing with this item. I trust that action will be indorsed on this occasion. </para>

          <para>.- As one who has no special interest in the banana industry, I intend to support the motion. In my view, the price of bananas will not be influenced in the slightest degree by the imposition of a heavy duty. I realize that a duty of 8s. 4d. per cental on bananas is prohibition; but I find that the banana industry, under the system of Protection, and the promise of Protection, has increased by 300 or 400 per cent. during the last three or four years. There is no doubt in my mind that the banana-growing States of Australia, if not immediately, then in the very near future, will produce all the bananas that the people of Australia require if we encourage the industry by protecting our growers against the product of black labour in other places. If that be so, the demand for bananas will rule the price. It must not be forgotten that bananas cannot, like a pair of boots,  be stored for an indefinite time. They mustbe consumed within a reasonable time after they havebeen cut. Once the industry is established we need have no fear of a monopoly, because the law of supply and demand will operate to regulate the price. </para>

            <para>- I believe it Is being well established. But, if we were to allow the product of black labour from countries equal, if not superior, to Australia in natural conditions for the production of bananas to compete with the Australian industry, there is a possibility that we would destroy all that we have already done to establish the banana- growing industry here. I frankly admit that in this case I am going the whole hog for absolute prohibition of the importation of bananas. But, from the figures supplied to me, I have every reason to believe that Australia will produce more than sufficient bananas to meet the Australian consumption. If that be so, there can be no monopoly in the banana industry, and the people of Australia will get bananas as cheaply as they could get them from countries where they are grown by black labour. I prefer the cheap banana grown by the white man in Queensland, New South  Wales,  and Western Australia to that grown by Indian labour controlled by the planters of Fiji. </para>

          <para>. -  I have listened for some little time to arguments as to whether the duty proposed by another place on bananas is too high or too low. One cannot be oblivious to the fact that honorable senators representing States in which bananas are grown have regarded the duty as reasonable, whilst honorable senators from States whose people are only consumers of bananas regard the duty as excessive. This question, however, cannot be regarded from the standpoint of States in that way. If so, we should revise the whole Tariff. Where duties of 30, 40, and 50 per cent. have been imposed on certain items, the result must be to injure some people, and who get the benefit in those cases? Are we imposing duties to help particular States or to help Australia? It is as much to the advantage of Australia that an industry should be established in Queensland as that an industry should be established in Victoria. </para>

            <para>- Is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> as keenly anxious to secure cheap dried fruits for the people as he is to secure cheap bananas for them? One way of testing this duty is to see how it compares with other duties to which honorable senators have agreed. I say that it is not as high as the average of the duties imposed by the Tariff. It is not easy to determine exactly what is the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> equivalent of the duty of 8s. 4d. per cental on bananas. But, so far as I can make out, taking the price of bananas at from 22s. to 25s. per case, this duty represents about 25 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline></para>

            <para>- That is so, but it is rather late to apply it to this Tariff. While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has been here the Committee has passed duties on dozens of itemsof food - fruit, fish, vegetable preserved milks, butter, cheese, bacon, maize, cereals generally, and, if I may include it as a food, beer. It may be an excellent thing to raise the cry of &#34;the free breakfast table&#34; - it worked great charm in the Old Country - but I submit that if we are to go back to that as a guiding principle we shall have to revise the whole Tariff from that standpoint. </para>

            <para>- That is what I am pleading for. I do not occupy the time of this Committee in asking for anything unreasonable. These arguments, if they apply logically to this item, also apply to 95 per cent. of the items in the Tariff. Yet this Committee would not deliberately destroy the Tariff. If the Committee is prepared to maintain the spirit and principle of the Tariff, duties ought to be applied to bananas as to all other articles. Something has been said about the effect of the duty on trade with Fiji. I have no desire to injure the trade with that or any other country, but there is very rarely anything in this world that has not a reverse side. Anything we get we have to pay for in some way or other. Therefore, when talking of the Fiji trade it is well to remember the kind of competition that wo are faced with. I have in my hands a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Wear Burton, who is conference secretary of the MethodistMissionary Society. I take it that from his position he may be accepted as a reliable and truthful witness. In giving evidence before the Inter-State Commission, he said that the Indian coolies received1s. per day, but that he thought the planters would soon have to pay up to 2s. per day. I need hardly do more than read that statement. </para>

            <para>- It was given in 1918. I will read the exact words: &#34; In Fiji among the Indian coolies the indenture system has been broken, and the planters will be obliged to give a higher price. Instead of paying1s. per day, as the standard is now, they will probably have to pay 2s. per day for ordinary labour.&#34; If we go a little further than the witness suggested, and suppose that 4s. per day is paid, I venture to submit that that would represent very serious competition for the banana-growers in Australia, who are obliged to pay the white wages ruling in this country. The margin in favour of Fiji is a tremendous one in the matter of wages alone. It has been said that this duty will jeopardize our trade with Fiji. What does that trade amount to ? I do not wish to decry it by saying that it is not worth anything. It is a valuable trade, but, on the other hand, in estimating the extent of the danger to it we cannot afford to shut out of our minds the valuei of the banana industry. It is a fair comparison to set the Fiji trade against the value of the banana crop. The value of Australian imports from Fiji in 1919-20 was &#163;298,000. I am  going to suppose- which is, of course, in a sense, ridiculous - that all that trade was wealth produced to Australia. We may have derived some profit from handling the goods or shipping them to other countries. It is quite clear that the value of that trade to us could not have been more than the capital value represented by the trade itself. The value of the Australian banana crop in 1919-20 was &#163;496,000. I think we are entitled to consider whether, in preserving the Fiji trade, we may not be threatening a more important industry in Australia. If the monetary value of the Fiji trade were equal to the value of the banana crop, there would still be more profit to Australia in the banana crop than in the Fiji trade. There is more profit to Australia in fi worth of goods produced in Australia than there is in anything we may collect in handling &#163;1 worth of Fiji trade. </para>

If he argues that because this duty was ls. 6d. per cental it should now be only 4s. 2d., he ought to oppose the placing of a duty upon any article that previously had no duty. </para>

          <para>.- The figures quoted by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D.. Millen)</inline> show that Australia was receiving from Fiji in 1919-20 a little over &#163;200,000 worth of goods a year, and was sending to Fiji in return over &#163;600,000 worth. By this banana duty we are, in my opinion, sacrificing the whole of that trade. The business men of Fiji are angry against Australia, and are looking for places where they can carry on their trade elsewhere than in Australia. Has any injury been done by this Senate to the banana industry of Queensland? The banana-growers can sell in Australia every banana that they can produce. It has to be borne in mind that the consuming capacity will be increased if the fruit is marketed at a price that is within the purchasing power of the people. </para>

            <para>- I have an objection to paying the cost of freight and of oases. &#171; The man who goes into the  business and makes the profit should pay those charges. The Minister has compared this duty with other duties. I am an opponent of all duties. A comparison cannot be made between the duty on a pair of boots and the duty on bananas. For the manufacture of boots a large and expensive plant, which is continually wearing: out, is required; but for growing bananas all that is needed is a mattock and a knife. The Protectionist argument is th,at Protective duties are imposed in order to enable a man to invest capital in an industry. Boot factories and woollen factories require tens of . thousands of pounds to be invested in them before they are sufficiently well equipped to compete in the world&#39;s markets. I realize that the Minister has put his arguments very cleverly and very honestly, because all the arguments that have been used against this item apply equally to every other item in the Tariff. The arguments are perfectly sound, and they should convince the Senate and the country that . these duties ought not to be imposed. I, who am always a reasonable man, say that whatever the country decides must stand; but surely we can ask not only the country j but the people interested in the industry, to accept a fair thing. If the banana industry could grow to the extent of producing in the year 1920 over &#163;420,000 worth of bananas with a duty of ls. 6d. per cental, what need is there to ask for a duty of 8s. 4d. per cental? It should also be  remembered that  in the year referred to many petrie who would otherwise have been engaged in production were absent at the war. The industry grew to an enormous extent under the Tariff of ls. 6d., and now the Committee is asked to go out of its way and give a duty which the industry did not ask for, and ona which is three times larger than the Ministry asked for. </para>

            <para>- The other House may have acted impulsively. This is one of the instances in which the revising Chamber should meet the other House and say that neither the Ministry, the Government, the Minister in charge, nor the industry asked for this duty, and that a duty of 30 per cent, should be protection enough. I have discovered that the grower of bananas is getting no benefit from this Tariff, but that the man who imports them is. I can illustrate the position by a reference to another fruit industry. A fruit-grower close to Sydney, who was new to the business, determined to establish a name for himself. He gathered his fruit carefully, sent only the best to market, folded them in paper, and packed them properly. An old hand shovelled the others into a case and sent them to Parramatta market. The latter returned 6s. a case, while the others, properly graded and packed, returned only 2s. a case. If honorable senators will talk to a grower of bananas in this country they will find that this enormous duty has crippled Australia&#39;s Fiji trade. That is my chief objection to all duties - they cripple trade. The banana-growers are anxious to market their own fruit. It is not a question of whether we are to develop or manage the industry or  encourage  people to invest their money in it, but whether a duty of 4s. 2d. per cental, which is six times more than the industry developed under, is sufficient. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir THOMAS</inline>GLASGOW (Queensland) &#91;5.39&#93;. - The discussion this afternoon has covered quite a number of the points brought forward when this item was previously before the Committee. I donot wish to repeat the arguments that have already been adduced; but I desire, for the information of honorable senators who have been wondering how the industry was established with a duty of1s. 6d. per cental, to point out that during the war period there was a natural protection because the plantations in Fiji were destroyed by a disastrous cycloneand freight was  exceptionally  scarce.&#39; In consequence of this, the Queensland banana-growers were able to proceed without much competition, and the industry received an impetus. Why do the Queensland growers require protection? Simply because the bananas grown in Fiji are raised with cheap coloured labour. The. wages in Queensland vary from 10s. to 14s. per day, and, as the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> pointed out, the labourer in Fiji receives only 2s. per day. When the schedule was previously before the Committee, very high protection was given to some commodities at the request of honorable senators. Those honorable senators must now endeavour to be consistent, and not be fiscal chameleons. There is no industry that I know of that assists closer settlement to a greater extent than banana-growing, because a banana-grower can make a living on from 7 to 10 acres of land, whereas a wheatgrower requires anything from 300 to 600 acres. Comparisons have been made with the returns derived by banana-growers and those of wheat-growers; but if a settler can make a living on from 7 to 10 acres when others require from 300 to 600 acres, surely he is entitled to consideration ! The industry has developed on the north coast of Queensland and in the northern portion of New South Wales to a great extent, and I desire to direct the attention of honorable senators representing Western Australia to the fact that as we are now encouraging immigration on an extensive scale, there is no form of settlement that would be of greater assistance than banana-growing. Rich scrub lands in suitable localities along the coast will produce bananas, and if Western Australia wishes to look for new avenues of settlement this is an industry in which people can be profitably employed. &#39; </para>

If we favour the White Australia policy, we must afford adequate protection to tropical products raised in the Commonwealth.

The banana-growers should have a uniform market. In the past, when the monthly boat arrived from Fiji, large quantities of bananas were dumped on to the market, and the Queensland growers could not obtain sufficient to cover the freight. They now know the requirements of the southern markets, and are able to regulate consignments in such a way that the demand can be met without the consumers having to pay an unreasonable price. </para>

          <para>. - During the discussion on this item, reference has been made to the cost of growing other protected fruits. We should consider, for instance, the labour involved in producing 1 lb. of prunes. First of all, the trees have to be attended to for, approximately, six years before there is any return. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> said it required 4 or 5 lbs. of green fruit to produce 1 lb. of dried fruit. The trees have not only to be cultivated for a lengthy period, but when they commence to bear there is all the trouble and expense associated with desiccating the fruit and placing it onthe market before there is any return. The duty on bananas asked for by the House of Representatives is out of all proportion to that granted in the dried-fruit industry. Three times as much labour is involved in the production of 1 lb. of dried prunes as in the production of 1 lb. of bananas. Will any honorable senator deny it ? </para>

            <para>- Not more than one-third of the1s. 6d. per cental duty on bananascould be debited to labour. That would mean 6d. ; but what the growers are asking for now, over and above that1s. 6d., is 6s. 10d., or an increase of nearly 1,400 per cent. on account of labour costs. Can that be called reasonable? I am quite agreeable to a duty of 4s. 2d. per cental being granted, and I do not think that rate would be unjust to Queensland. The cases for dried fruit cost two or three times as much as those for green fruit. As the representatives of a majority of the States are prepared to concede 4s. 2d., it must be admitted that the Senate has adopted a Federal spirit. </para>

            <para>- New South Wales growers are situated a short distance from Sydney, compared with the distance the Queensland growers have to send their fruit, because their principal market is Melbourne. Therefore, the New South Wales growers  are  in a very advantageous position. The official <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book,</inline> No. 13, shows, at page 394, that, in New South Wales, 259,427 cases of bananas were produced in 1918-19, of a total value of &#163;220,510. In the same year, Queensland produced 1,267,641 bunches of bananas, the value of the output being &#163;211,273. According to the authority I have quoted, bananas produced in New South Wales were worth just twice as much to the grower as those grown in Queensland. </para>

            <para>- The grower in New South Wales is certainly in a more advantageous position. Comparisons have been made of the duties which have been imposed on various items, and it has been shown very clearly that quite a number of industries would have more than double the protection which the Queensland banana industry would receive even if the full duty of 8s. 4d. per cental were conceded; and those other industries are in competition with countries where white labour obtains. I can find only one item in the Tariff dealing with an industry which has to contend with the kind of competition, to which the banana grower is subject, and that is eggs. There has been considerable discussion in the newspapers and elsewhere about the competition which egg producers have to meet through eggs being imported from China. The Australian industry is protected practically to the extent of 9d. per lb.&#34; which is nine times the protection desired for the banana industry. Of course, the duty on eggs was very readily conceded, because poultry farming is common to all the States, while banana growing is carried on only in New South Wales and Queensland to any great extent. Certainly it is proposed to grow bananas on a large scale in Western Australia, and I am quite prepared to help in the establishment of the industry on a sound footing in that State. Bananas are undoubtedly the cheapest fruit obtainable in Melbourne at present. I have seen them on sale at 2d. or 3d. per lb., while in the same shop window apples were priced at 8d. per lb. It costs a great deal less to keep apples in cold storage for six months than it does to bring bananas &#39;from Queensland to Melbourne, the latter cost being 4s. 6d. per case. The railways of three States benefit by the Queensland banana trade. Inquiry has been made as to why the fruit is not forwarded by steamers, which one would expect to provide cheaper transport. The actual difference between the steamer and rail freight is less than ls. per case, or about id. per dozen. </para>

            <para>- The number varies from 20 dozen to 24 dozen. There is only one steamer on the coast, the <inline font-style="italic">Levuka,</inline> insulated and suitable for the carriage of bananas. The practice is to bring the bananas down in the summer in louvre trucks, and in cold weather in closed trucks, because bananas are very susceptible to extremes of heat and cold. I understand that if they were being conveyed in a louvre truck on a frosty night they would practically be destroyed, because they could not be kept long enough to ripen properly. The banana-growers have a very good organization both for the transport and marketing of the fruit. They understand their business thoroughly, and we may take it that if they thought it would be more profitable to send bananas to Sydney or Melbourne by steamer they would do so. In the first instance, the fruit would have to be railed from the district in which it is grown to the port of shipment, and, as vessels are frequently held up perhaps a week or a month <inline font-style="italic">en route,</inline> the bananas would perish. There is need to specially protect Australian products that have to be grown in competition with cheaplabour countries. &#39; In the smaller States, the principal industries have the market at their door, so to speak. I direct attention to&#39; the position of the wine industry, which enjoys protection equal to about 200 per cent, the value of the product. </para>

        <para>The duty when the Tariff was introduced was 3d. per lb. It was then raised to 4&#189;d.in conformity with the duties on other fruits, and this Committee requested a reduction to 4d. The other House has dissented from the request, and has asked the Senate not to press it. The position of the industry has been carefully investigated by the Department, and the conclusion arrived at is that a duty at the rate of 4&#189;d. per lb. is necessary for the protection of local growers against the importation of American prunes, which are placed on the market at extremely low prices, when the American markets are no longer open to them. The cultivation of prunes in Australia is a comparatively recent development, and a large number of returned soldiers have become engaged in the industry. The trees are just coming into bearing, and the product has to compete with the end of season fruit from America, which is dumped at comparatively low prices to clear out stocks. The effect is to jeopardize the local production. </para>

          <para>.- I think that we should press our request upon this item, just as we did in connexion with the duty on bananas. In my view the position is exactly the same. The Committee, when this matter was previously under consideration, expressed the view that 4d. per lb. would be a sufficient duty. Honorable members in another place hold a different view. We are informed that there is fear of American importations in this case, just as we were told, in the case of the duty on bananas, that Queensland growers were afraid of Fijian importations. The only distinction that can be made between the two items is that whilst bananas are grown chiefly in Queensland, prunes are grown in more than one of the other States. I do not wish to appear as the opponent of any particular State, but as the Committee decided that 4d. a lb. is a sufficient duty on this item, and the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E.</inline> D.

        <para>As the Tariff came first to the Senate it proposed that calico for bag-making, should be free from Great Britain with the desire - laudable, but mistaken in this case - to assist trade with the Mother Country. The Senate requested that duties of 5 per cent. in the intermediate and 15 per cent. in the general Tariff should be imposed, leaving importations from Great Britain free. The information supplied by the Department of Trade and Customs is that this particular calico is not imported from Great Britain. </para>

            <para>-The request of the Senate, in the matter of calico for bagmaking, was that preference should be accorded to British manufacturers by the imposition of a 5 per cent. intermediate, and 15 per cent. general, Tariff. Originally, the House of Representatives proposed that there should Ibe no duty upon this material, and it has not seen fit to accept the Senate&#39;s request. Australians should be anxious to do all that may be possible to assist Great Britain in the struggle to recover her lost trade. 1 have heard no arguments which might cause me to alter my views. The calico used for bag-making is a low-grade material, which could be turned out from British factories at as good value as from factories in any other part of the world. </para>

            <para>- No. I do not know that British manufacturers turn out this class of calico. The bulk of the material imported for bag-making comes from Japan and America. It has been suggested that the proposal of the House of Representatives to admit the calico free amounts to a form of reciprocity. A fairly large quantity of flour is shipped annually from the Commonwealth to Japan, and the Japanese prefer to re ceive our flour bagged in calico made in that country. That, I understand, is the explanation of the attitude adopted by the House of Representatives; but I repeat that Britain is entitled to preference at our hands. One reads in the press almost daily of the serious extent of unemployment in the Mother Country. This is due very largely to the severity of the competition of foreign countries since the cessation of hostilities. If we can assist Britain, while at the same time receiving good value, we should certainly do so. </para>

        <para class="block">The request of the Senate involved a considerable reduction upon the rates originally proposed by the House of Representatives. That Chamber has made a compromise to the extent of proposing the acceptance of 30 per cent. British, 40 per cent, intermediate, and 45 per cent, general Tariff. It has been pointed out that the rates proposed by this Committee are utterly inadequate if they are to be regarded as protective duties. Honorable senators have already agreed to duties upon cotton blouses, skirts, and costumes, respectively of 40 per cent., 50 per cent., and 55 per cent. </para>

            <para>- The manufacture of corsets is much more difficult than that of blouses. The chief material used in the former, namely, coutil is liable to a duty of 15 per cent., so that the Senate has requested the same duty upon the raw material as upon the manufactured article, which is opposed to the theories both of the Free Trader and oi the Protectionist. </para>

            <para>- That is so; but the general Tariff is 15 per cent., and&#39; most of the supplies used in Australia are imported from foreign sources. It has been urged against the imposition <inline font-style="italic">ot</inline> higher protective duties that local manufacturers cannot make sufficient corsets for the requirements of Australia, or that the quality is not equal to that of the imported article, or that the price of the local product is excessive. As corsets, until the introduction of the present Tariff, were liable to duties of only 10 per cent, and 15 per cent., it would be scarcely a matter for wonder if local manufacturers were not yet in a position to supply all requirements. But, despite the short period during which the protective duty has been in operation, one Sydney firm alone has placed itself in a position to turn out more than 600,000 pairs per annum. The capital invested in the three principal factories amounts to &#163;185,572, and 430 hands are employed at a weekly wage of &#163;1,240. Although the industry is of recent origin, it will be agreed that it has already .assumed fairly considerable proportions. The Inter-State Commission, which went thoroughly into the matter, was convinced that the duty on1 corsets should not be less than that on apparel. </para>

            <para>- The InterState Commission recommended that the British rate should be 35 per cent., and the general Tariff 40 per cent. The original rates imposed on corsets by the House of .Representatives was 40 per cent., 50 per cent., and 55 per cent. As a concession to the desire of the Senate for a reduction, the House of Representatives has in its message set down the duties respectively at 30 per cent. , 40 per cent., and 45 per cent. Thus, the rates have been practically brought into line with those recommended by the InterState Commission. </para>

          <para>.  - This is one of the most important items in the Tariff from the point of view of the general community. Honorable senators will remember that in the previous Tariff corsets were specifically subjected to a duty of 10 per cent. British and 15 per cent, foreign. When the Senate received its present Tariff schedule for consideration, some time ago it was found that corsets were no longer specifically mentioned, but that the item was included under &#34; apparel and attire.&#34; This provided for exceptionally heavy duties, ranging up to 55 per cent, general Tariff. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator should ask the women of Australia whether they are a luxury. Some corsets may be a luxury, but as an article of attire they are a. necessity. We must bear in mind, in discussing this amendment, what the position was before the introduction of the new Tariff, when the duty was 10 per cent. British and 15 per cent, foreign. In that Tariff it was recognised that corsets required special treatment, apart from ordinary apparel and attire. Any one who knows anything of the manufacture of corsets and of the varying needs of the people of Australia with regard to design, must recognise that this should be treated as a special item. I have not a word to say against the corset factories of Australia. I am very glad that we have them, but there is no justification for imposing an unnecessary burden upon the  women of Australia so as to insure that Australian manufacturers can get a still higher price for their manufactures. No matter how many corsets are made in Australia during the next few years, the bulk of those used must be* imported. In the first place, Australia is not manufacturing anything like the number required here, and, in the second place, the corset manufacturing industry cannot be brought to anything like perfection in a period of even ten years. </para>

            <para>- All I can tell the honorable senator is that, whereas ir. prewar times a woman could get a really good, serviceable corset for from 7s. 6d. to 10s., to-day she has to pay anything from 25s. to 35s., and even <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> a pair for them. A shipment of corsets were cleared recently under the 55 per cent. Tariff. They were imported from Canada, and the total expense, including duty, was 95 per cent. A shipment of American corsets may cost as much as 115 per cent, to land, including the 55 per cent. duty. Every pair of corsets is packed in a separate carton, and it does not take many of them to fill a large size case.&#39; The cost of freight and packing has been very high recently, and, on the most conservative estimate that I have been able to secure from those engaged in the distributing trade, 35 to 40 per cent, is a low estimate of the natural protection which this industry enjoys, apart from the duty of 45 per cent. Most of the material used in the manufacture of Australian corsets is admitted free of duty, so that the Australian manufacturer has an absolute protection of anything from 80 to 90 per cent., after allowing for the 10 per cent, reduced duty recommended by the House of Representatives. I do not think the Senate will be justified in accepting the motion submitted by the Minister. The corset manufacturers of Australia got &#34;on their feet&#34; before the Tariff was. introduced. </para>

            <para>- They know that they can, because the natural protection which they enjoy is much greater than that on any other article of attire that could be mentioned. The honorable senator may be thinking of the prehistoric days when corsets were imported and distributed at ls. lid. a pair, and were tied up a dozen in a packet. I am referring to the average modern corset, worn by the average woman. I want to appeal to honorable senators to give a fair deal to the women of Australia in connexion with this item. They are entitled to consideration. I remind honorable senators of the fact, which I mentioned some time ago, that they are as great admirers of variety of form as they are of variety of feature in women. From a medical point of view, it is absolutely suicidal for some women to wear a certain kind of corset, although it may suit another type of figure. A large amount- of care and attention has to be applied by manufacturers in order to supply articles moulded to a great variety of forms. In view of the fact that the corsets manufacturers of Australia were able to get on their feet and to progress wonderfully with a very much lower Tariff, I think the request made by the Senate that the duties should be 15 per cent. British, 20 per cent, intermediate, and 25 per cent, general is a reasonable one, particularly when one takes into consideration the additional natural protection which is afforded to the local manufacturer by the heavy cost of importing. </para>

            <para>- No; and they will not be able to do so for some years to come. The people of Australia ought to be able to get an article that they need without paying an inordinately high price for it, far and away in excess of its true value. During this year an enormous number of corsets have been imported from Canada, America, and England - a fact which proves conclusively that the manufacturer in Australia at the present time cannot meet the needs of Australia. I am hoping that the day will arrive when everything needed in this country  will be produced in it; but I do not want to see the people penalized unnecessarily in order to bring that about. </para>

All the materials used in the manufacture of corsets have to be imported. Although the Minister has said that coutil bears a duty of 15 per cent., I have a. statement to the effect that the coutils used in the manufacture of corsets are a speciality of English and American mills. That article is admitted from England free, and there is a duty 15 per cent, general and 10 per cent, intermediate. </para>

          <para>. - I do not claim to have the expert knowledge of this article which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> possesses; but .1 do &#34;not think it fair to impose excessively high duties and thus penalize the womenfolk of Australia, to whom, I understand, corsets are a necessity. When this item was previously before the Committee we had a long discussion, and decided&#34; to favour the imposition of 15 per cent., 20 per cent., and 25 per cent, duties; and I cannot see, merely because honorable members in another place have expressed a different opinion, why we should pile on higher duties and thus increase the cost of living to the people. Realizing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has had considerable experience in the trade, I would like him to continue and give the Committee the benefit of his knowledge. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">.- Senator Reid</inline>was anxious to ascertain the difference in value of the Australian and imported corsets. I have been assured on good authority that the imported article - I do not wish to criticise the Australian industry - notwithstanding the heavy duty imposed, is regarded as of better value than the locallymanufactured corset. The reason assigned is that corset manufacturers are specialists, and it is essential to have an enormous output to compete with those engaged in the business in a larger way, because the overhead charges are greater where the output is small. </para>

            <para>- I am not suggesting that corsets should be admitted free, but that the duty should be reasonable, and in support of that contention I pointed out that the local manufacturer has a greater natural protection than the manufacturer of any other article of attire because of the manner in which the goods are packed. If I were starting a factory, I would not want a duty on the article I was to produce irrespective of other considerations. I would want to know what it cost to land that article from an outside country. If the duty were 10 per cent., and the freight represented an additional 40 per cent., I would have protection equal to 50 per cent. Natural protection should be carefully considered in connexion with such an item as this. Before the new Tariff was introduced, this industry was firmly established on duties of 10 and 15 per cent. respectively, and we are justified in opposing the motion moved by the Minister in the hope that if we defeat it we shall have the opportunity of arriving at duties which will be acceptable to both branches of the Legislature. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator might have mentioned the period during which this progress has been made, and explained that it covered the years of the war and the period the duties embodied in the schedule have been in operation. It is admitted now that this industry has obtained a certain measure of stability, but that cannot be attributed solely to the moderate duties which previously existed. Conditions are now altering, and, as the protection hitherto afforded is disappearing, it will be impossible for the industry to progress with an impost of 10 per cent. </para>

            <para>- I do not know it. I shall stress the point that, in advocacy of the policy of preference, whateverthe importations may be, if the duties suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> are approved, it is assumed that the bulk of the importations will come in under the 15 per cent. duty, otherwise the preference is of no avail. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paynesaid</inline> that corsets could not be compared with other articles of apparel. I admit that they cannot, and if suchis the case it is remarkable that the honorable senator is in favour of higher duties on other apparel. </para>

            <para>- Blouses and such articles of attire are dutiable at 40, 50, and 55 per cent., respectively, but when it is a question of more complicated articles, such as corsets, he favours, because they are more difficult to manufacture and require superior knowledge, increasing the difficulty by advocating lower rates. It seems to me that the more skill required the greater the justification for giving encouragement to the industry. </para>

            <para>- I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> that he distinctly affirmed that the imported article was regarded as giving better value for the money than the locally-produced one. If that is an argument against a reasonable duty on corsets it is also an argument against dozens of other duties which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has supported. He has favoured a duty of 40 or 50 per cent, on articles which school girls can make. 1 </para>

            <para>- I cannot follow the votes of individual senators, bc- . cause they vary so much. The Senate agreed to duties of 40, 50, and 55 per cent, on many articles of attire which are made within the domestic circle, and the manufacture of which does not entail special skill; but I do contend that on articles such as corsets there should be a higher duty. The Government&#39;s idea originally was that corsets should come under the general heading of &#34;Apparel,&#34; and had the old Tariff been all that was required there would have been no need for a special duty. . The original Tariff withrespect to corsets was 40, 50, and 55 per cent. This Chamber proposed 15,&#39; 20, and 25 per cent., and the House of Representatives now offers 30, 40, and 45 per cent. That would be going a considerable way to bridge the gap between the decisions of the two Chambers, and I hope the modification will be accepted. </para>

          <para>- It is very necessary that country tows should have industries which do not require large factories or any great outlay of capital for plant and machinery. The corset industry, particularly, lends itself to development in inland towns. It could be started in a small room containing a few sewing machines. The. m ufacture of a famous French corset wa&#187; commenced by a widow woman, who lived in a small village in which I was once bil.lected, and that village is now a_ prosperous one .as a result of the industry established there. There has been no great expenditure of capital in the factory. The machines are operated by girls drawn from the peasantry. Skilled cutters are employed, and the girls do the sewing. Once the manufacture of corsets is established in Australia, there is no reason why the industry should not be extended to a dozen country centres. That would soon bring down the price of the article to the Australian buyer. I support the Minister&#39;s proposal. </para>

The industry is now well established, and it is giving employment to a large number of Australian working men and women. There is a great deal of capital invested in the industry, which is worthy of all the support Parliament can give it. There are about twenty-four manufactories in the various capitals, and the four wholesale houses are Berlei Limited, the Australia Corsets Limited, and Messrs. Robert Paxton and Company (all of Sydney), and the Elasco Corsets and Tie Company (Melbourne). </para>

            <para>- It is not my desire to advertise them. Berlei Limited have recently constructed a six-storied modern daylight factory, the value of the building and plant being &#163;60,000. The paid-up capital of the four companies at March last was &#163;176,500. The number of hands employed in the industry is about 450, and the amount of wages paid annually is approximately &#163;50,000. Three of the companies are in-  creasing their plant, so the output of corsets will be considerably augmented. The four wholesale firms, according to figures supplied in March last, were manufacturing 341,156 pairs per annum, of the value of &#163;184,680. I presume that the output and the value to-day would show a considerable increase. This industry should receive whatever protection those who have inquired into it consider necessary. I take it that the Customs authorities have made the fullest inquiries. Certainly, the industry isnot at all hesitant in declaring that it cannot carry on under the duty suggested by the Senate by way of amendment to the original duties fixed by the House of Representatives. The other Chamber has met the Senate in a very fair spirit, because it has not insisted, as it might have done, on its original proposals. It has been stated in this Chamber that the Senate should stand on its dignity, and not give way to any extent. The fact is that the other branch of the Legislature has given way very considerably. It has met our requests for a substantial reduction, and I feel sure the proposed reduction will appeal to honorable senators as reasonable. </para>

            <para>- I cannot answer that; but the output of the four wholesale factories should represent a considerable proportion. The duties suggested by the other Chamber are 30, 40, and 45 per cent., as against the original proposition of 40, 50, and 55 per cent. I hope the proposal of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> will be accepted. </para>

            <para>- A statement appeared in the daily press recently that there were hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of corsets in bond, at the present time, awaiting clearance. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> unwittingly misled the Committee a few moments ago by quoting the lowest of the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties agreed to by the House of Representatives, namely, 30 per cent. British, and suggested that that could not be regarded as a very high Tariff. The Minister quoted that rate to suit his particular case. He knows, I presume, that the great bulk of the corsets imported into Australia are not of British manufacture at all. They are made in Canada and the United States. </para>

            <para>- Yes. The bulk of the corsets imported into Australia come from America, and will come under the general Tariff which is now 45 per cent. When this item was last before the Committee, honorable senators showed their good sense by refusing to allow an exceptionally heavy burden to be placed upon the women of Australia. I believe in compromise, and for that reason I suggest that the Committee reject the motion in the hope that asthe result of a conference a rate somewhere between the two duties will be agreed upon. </para>

            <para>- But we must bear in mind the fact that prior to the introduction of this Tariff the duties were very much lower. I cannot conscientiously support the motion. I am quite prepared to compromise. I hope the motion will be rejected in order that the item may be the subject of a conference. We may then arrive at a real compromise which will give the industry all the protection necessary to insure its development, and at the same time prevent a very grave injustice being done to the women of Australia. </para>

        <para class="block">When the Tariff came to the Senate the duties proposed were 40 per cent. British, 50 per cent. intermediate, and 55 per cent. general. This Committee requested the insertion of the new sub-item, with varying duties in respect of articles of wool or containing wool as distinct from cotton. From the administrative point of view, there is great objection to this attempted classification which will lead to great inconvenience, both to the Department and the importers, because, in order to ascertain whether an article contains wool, it will be necessary to open up the goods on the wharf, and inspect practically all goods entered as cotton, as the presence of wool would necessitate the imposition of higher rates of duties. It must be remembered that it is proposed to impose a duty of 10 per cent., 15 per cent., and 20 per cent. on woollen yarns, to operate on. and after 1st January, 1923. It is, therefore, difficult to see why duties should be imposed on knitted underwear lower than those on apparel made up from cotton piece goods, which is liable to 40 per cent., 50 per cent., and 55 per cent. under item 110 b. As the woollen knitted goods, including the materials used in their manufacture, are entirely produced in Australia, there are strong reasons for giving special consideration to this branch of the woollen and clothing industry, which should be a valuable asset to country districts. In certain Victorian towns, Clunes for one, knitting mills have been established with satisfactory results, both to the people who are provided with employment and the manufacturers. Seeing that the industry is an offshoot of our main woollen industry, I am asking the Committee to recede from its former position in the interests of the woollen industry. To the extent that  we foster this industry the Tariff will do good. As the cotton industry is not yet established in Australia, the duties requested by the Senate can do nothing to assist our primary producers. </para>

          <para>.- The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> has said that the officers of the Trade and Customs Department would have very great difficulty in distinguishing between the cotton and woollen underclothing covered by the sub-items suggested by the Senate. I shall deal with that objection to the Senate&#39;s proposal later on. I wish to say a word or two, first of all, in defence of the Senate&#39;s request for duties of 30, 40, and 45 per cent. on these undershirts, undervests, underpants, and combinations. If honorable senators have kept their eyes open in walking through the streets of most towns in Australia they must often have asked themselves how, with the current rate of wages, a working man with a wife and family can manage to clothe himself at all comfortably in view of the ticketed prices appearing in the shop windows for these essential articles of attire. The question is one which ought to be answered. We should endeavour to make it possible for working men to obtain these articles at a reasonable price. </para>

            <para>- The position is that working men have to wear the class of clothing I have described, and must, if it is of other than British manufacture, pay a duty of 55 per cent. They must wear these goods because they are much lower in price than the ordinary natural wool undergarments locally manufactured. These duties will not affect the man who has plenty of money. Honorable senators can go into a shop and pay any price for these garments that may be asked, but I certainly have often wondered how the average working man earning from &#163;4 to &#163;4 5s. per week, and with a wife and family to support, can clothe himself comfortably, especially during the winter months. The duties I proposed on these garments were, for woollen or containing wool, British, 30 per cent. ; intermediate, 40 per cent. ; and general, 45 per cent. ; and for the cotton goods, British, 20 per cent. ; intermediate, 25 per cent. ; and general, 35 per cent. These duties represent a fairly high Tariff. I can see one way out of the objection put forward by the Customs Department, and it is to include those garments of wool, or containing wool, and those made of cotton in the one item, and impose duties on that item equivalent to those in the request made by the Senate. To revert to the duties as originally proposed of 40, 50, and 55 per cent. is more than I can swallow, and I am not prepared to agree to the motion. If honorable senators will support me in opposing it, I say now that I shall be quite prepared to favorably consider a compromise in the direction of including the two sub-items suggested by the Senate&#39;s request in one, and making the same duties applicable to garments of wool, or containing wool, and to underwear wholly made of cotton. </para>

            <para>- I cannot claim the same experience as some other honorable senators of working&#34; men in large cities  such as Sydney and Melbourne, but I can say that working men in small towns and in the bush always wear flannels. It is only when they get into what they call their Sunday clothes that some of them put on natural-wool singlets. So that there is no victimization of the working class involved in the motion. The arguments which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> used might be used against every item in the Tariff. I am out to encourage every form of industry in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> is aware that we have an unlimited supply of wool, and he knows also that these garments made of wool and cotton combined are the best for working men, because, so far as &#34;wear and tear&#34; is concerned, they give the best value. There are combined cotton and wool garments made in Australia at the present time. </para>

Everything has altered since that time. I am satisfied that Australia will be a great cottonproducing&#39; country. I feel sure that if not in all the States, then certainly in Queensland and in Western Australia, cotton can be grown to any extent. We have wool in unlimited quantities here, and if we encourage the manufacture of these garments in Australia from a mixture of cotton and wool we shall be giving the cultivation of cotton an impetus that is very necessary. I feel sure that honorable members in another place are as anxious as we can be that the working classes should be able to obtain cheap clothing. In the interests of land settlement and the production of cotton in Australia, we should encourage here the manufacture of these garments from wool and cotton mixed. Though the prices charged at present are rather high for this class of goods, their increased manufacture should lower the price. It should be remembered that in all probability these goods will never in future be as cheap as they were before the war. The cotton crop has been . a failure this year, and British manufacturers of cotton goods  are looking for sources from which to obtain their raw materia). </para>

          <para>.- I hope the motion will be agreed to. I understand that capital amounting to &#163;3,000,000 has been invested in &#39;the industry in this State and New South Wales. I do not support the view that Americans, or other foreign manufacturers, should receive encouragement to send their goods into the Australian market, in view of the way in which high duties are imposed on our exported manufactures. Upon Australian wool entering the United States of America, there is a duty of 25 cents per lb. Yet some people favour the imposition, and actively encourage the importation of American goods manufactured from Australian raw material. I agree with the general principle that solid preference should be given to Great Britain. In the present instance the amount of preference is ample. We have a young and nourishing Australian industry, and its claims come before those of either Great &#39;Britain or foreign manufacturers. </para>

            <para>- I have received expert advice that the American rates are higher than those proposed locally. Generally speaking, Americans and British manufacturers possess more uptodate plant for the output of these lines of goods. But, as I have already mentioned, &#163;3,000,000 has been invested in the Australian industry ; and it should not be forgotten that, with only the necessary changes of needles, the same machines are used locally for the manufacture of either wool or wool and cotton goods. Australia ought to be able to manufacture all her requirements of  goods of this class from her own raw material; and, in view of the high wages paid, I hold that the existing duties are not excessive. </para>

          <para>. -  The Senate has already agreed to high duties on all classes of woollen goods except those to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has already called attention. Protectionists say that the more heavily the protective duties are made to bear, the smaller grows the stream of importation and the larger the volume of Australian manufacture. So far as one class of woollen goods is concerned, the facts do not bear out that contention. I read in the press of Saturday last that the Bradford woollen spinners have reported  a  very prosperous period. It was recorded that during October the output was 7,058,000 square yards, compared with 7,343,000 square yards for the same month of 1913, when trade was normal. Those figures reveal that industry in the Old Country is approaching its old basis. The press report continues that, during the last month the export of woollen goods to Australia was about 700,000 square yards compared with only 289,000 square yards in July. Those figures show that there has been a clear increase amounting to considerably more than double the quantity shipped from Bradford alone. In face of those facts, will rabid Protectionists indicate what really should suffice in order that the whole of the woollen goods required for Australia shall be made in this country ? </para>

            <para>- Just so; and that means that whatever may be the amount of duty, it is merely  a  burden upon the community at large, and is in no sense protective of local industry. The folly of piling up excessive duties is exposed. I advise the Government to re-model the Tariff and increase the 40 per cent, duty in this instance to 180 per cent, or 3,000 per cent. They will then be able to see whether local importers, in response to the demand for a material urgently required but not manufactured in Australia, will continue to order from the United Kingdom&#34; practically treble the quantity of goods ordered three months previously. I propose to vote in such  a  manner as may perhaps assist to open the eyes of rabid Protectionists to the foolishness of their claims. </para>

          <para>.- The industry in question is one  of those  which is peculiarly suited to establishment in country centres. At Clunes,  one  of Victoria&#39;s decayed mining villages,  a  successful lead has been given; and  the  example has been followed at  Stawell,  another old mining town, which has  fallen  back upon the establishment of an  entirely  new activity, and has considerably benefited, while, at the same time,  assisting  to decentralize the population  of the  State. Operations are flourishing  also, I  understand, on the border, namely, at Albury.  A  reduction of the duties  has  been urged on the ground that,  despite  the rates imposed, the imports  from  Great Britain are increasing.  That  should indicate that the duties  are  not sufficiently high. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">.- Senator Lynch</inline>has quoted figures  which  record a striking increase in the importation of light woollen textiles from  Bradford.  When the Senate was dealing,  with  the Tariff, some weeks ago, I endeavoured to secure the acceptance of a special item covering woollen textiles not exceeding a certain weight per square yard.  These  were materials which would not compete with Australian manufacture. However, my proposal was turned down.  Those  light woollen goods are being heavily imported into Australia to-day, notwithstanding the high duty, because  people  must wear light-weight garments during the Australian summer. Thus the duties, instead of being protective of Australian industry, merely penalize the Australian public. My references as regards underwear are to the merino- finish and  merino  underclothing. </para>

          <para>- I say &#34; agreeable &#34; to it because the honorable senator succeeded in inducing the Senate to take out  of  the list woven undershirts, undervests, underpants, and combinations. The garment known  as  a sweater - a heavy knitted article - is worn by very many men. Knitted underwear is made in Australia from Australian wool, spun and knitted inAustralian factories. To encourage the Australian factory, the honorable senator proposed to reduce the duty from 40 to 30  per  cent.&#39; About &#163;3,000,000 is invested in the factories connected with this industry in Melbourne and Sydney. As they have been established in many cases since the war, is it to be expected that they have made fortunes? They could not possibly do it. I have seen articles made in Australian factories from best Australian merino wool. They are of high quality, and are much superior to similar articles imported from oversea. It is curious to &#34; encourage &#34; this industry by lowering the duty. If the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> is worth anything, the duty on the previous item - apparel, &#38;c. - should be lowered.

Most of this class of article comes from Great Britain. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne&#39;s</inline> argument means that he will protect an article which is made oversea, but not one which is made wholly in Australia.

          <para>.- I submit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> has overlooked a very potent fact that ought to be considered in discussing the motion. I have pointed out that Australia is not supplying anything like the requirements of the people in these commodities. In view of the fact that we have created a Tariff Board, which will report regularly with regard to the progress of various industries and the necessity for a lower or a higher Tariff, why should we in the meantime impose this unnecessarily heavy burden upon the consumer? The local factories may not be able to supply the requirements of Australia even in ten years&#39; time, so why penalize people who must perforce wear the imported goods ? </para>

          <para>. -  I cannot let the argument put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> go without drawing special attention to it. It advances an entirely new theory to nae. It is a theory that a duty is not justified until there has been a sufficient number of thearticles made in Australia to meet the needs of Australia. I always understood that the object of a protective duty was to nurse and encourage an industry in its early stages. According to my honorable friend, an industry must throw on one side all the swaddling clothes of infancy, and must arrive at full manhood, with all its faculties, before it is entitled to the protection which, at that stage, it can do without. The theory, if it is sound, can be applied to every case. If the honorable gentleman&#39;s words mean anything, this duty ought not to be given in this case because the present stage of development of the industry cannot meet all the local demands. If that principle is applied to all the items in the Tariff, it will be totally destructive of the Protectionist theory. The object of the Tariff is to give to infant industries in their early stages some measure of protection until they have sufficiently developed to be able to stand alone. My honorable friend argues that there should be no protection for an industry until it is so well established that it does not need it. </para>

          <para>.- The statement made by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> would be perfectly correct if the proposal made by me, which was accepted by the Senate and rejected by the House of Eepresentatives, was to remove the duty from this particular article. I have not sought to remove the duty. My amendment was that a duty of 45 per cent., general Tariff, should be imposed. Consequently the Minister&#39;s criticism can carry no weight at all. The Senate has been told, time after time, that when a certain date arrives the duty on a certain item will be imposed if the Tariff Board reports to the Minister and to Parliament that the industry can supply the requirements of the people. I proposed a duty of 45 per cent. general Tariff, as against the original proposal of 55 per cent. Yet the Minister replies in his criticism as though I was not in favour of any protection. </para>

          <para>.- The only reason advanced by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> in support of the motion is that we have in Australia manufacturers of hosiery other than cotton hosiery, and if the duties are reduced it will mean that a large quantity of cotton hosiery will flood the market, to the detriment of other socks and hosiery. But the cotton hosiery in bond to-day will eventually come into the market, whatever the duties may be. There is a fairly large quantity of cotton hosiery in bond, because a great many people find it necessary to wear it. The Minister and those supporting him say, in effect, that they will compel every one in Australia to wear woollen or artificial or real silk hosiery manufactured here. Cotton hosiery is being manufactured in Australia to a very limited extent. When in a city establishment a while ago  I  asked the proprietor if he had any Australianmade cotton hosiery in stock, and at his request an assistant produced some which had just come to hand; but the manufacturers have not laid themselves out to manufacture it to any extent. The duty on cotton hose prior to the introduction of the new Tariff was, British preferential, free, and general, 10 per cent. The request which I submitted, and which was carried, reduced the rates from  30,  40, and 45 per cent., to 20, 25, and 35 per cent. respectively; and if those duties are not agreed to, higher prices will have to be paid by the users without benefiting the local manufacturers of hosiery in any way. To increase the rates from what they were prior to the introduction of the Tariff to 30 and 45 per cent. seems to be unreasonable, because duties of 20 and 35 per cent. should be adequate. </para>

            <para>- Samples of cotton hosiery manufactured in Australia at 12s. per dozen pairs were submitted to honorable senators, and I visited the warehouse in Flinders-lane which had sent out the samples, and asked to see the stock of cotton hose ; but I was informed that they had not any, because there was no demand for them. The Minister and the Customs officers know that there is a demand for cotton hose, and thousands of dozen pairs are awaiting clearance. </para>

            <para>- That is so. I trust the Committee will agree to what was previously decided upon, because the increase on the original rates should meet the case. Additional impositions only mean placing further burdens on the community. I am anxious to see the Australian manufacturers prosper, and under the proposals I have submitted they should be able to do so. </para>
