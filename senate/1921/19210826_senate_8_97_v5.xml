                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave).</inline> - During this week ex-Senator James Guy, who from 5th September, 1914, to 30th June, 1920, was one of the representatives of Tasmania in the Senate, passed away after an illness lasting practically from the time of his retirement. I think it only fitting, and in conformity with the wishes of honorable senators, that I should express, on behalf of Ministerial supporters, our regret at his death, and our sympathy with his relatives. During the six years that he was a member of the Senate, the deceased gentleman earned the respect and goodwill of all his fellow senators. Most of us differed from the policy which he followed in the later years of his life; but his was a lovable character, and we all admired and respected him. On behalf of honorable senators supporting the Government, I express our sympathy with his relatives and our appreciation of the services that he rendered to the Commonwealth during his membership of this branch of- the Commonwealth Legislature. </para>

As a member of the Senate, he gained the esteem and affection of all who were privileged to know him.  His  earnestness and sincerity were outstanding traits of his character, and I acknowledge how deeply his profound Christian sincerity influenced me in our all too brief association in the Senate. A good man has passed away, but his influence will remain.  His  was an example of clean living and simple Christian faith. We all mourn his loss. To his widow and the members of his family we offer our deepest sympathy, and in spirit our tears will fall with theirs over the grave of a good man laid to rest. </para>

The reserve of rifles considered by the military advisers to the Government as necessary for defence purposes is within measurable distance of being accumulated, and it follows that once the reserve is established the normal annual requirements of new rifles will not be large unless some unforeseen circumstances arise. In face of these facts a policy for the future conduct of the factory which will reduce ultimately the factory establishment to a nucleus basis is in view. If the present situation which demands limitation of output and expenditure at the Small Arms Factory were temporary only, and there was a likelihood at the end of a short period of the factory being required to speed up and maintain a considerable output of rifles, the case would be different, but having in view the future position as far as it can be seen at the present moment, it is considered that no good purpose would be served by the adoption of a scheme which merely delays a short time the reduction which must inevitably be made. </para>

                    <para>.- Will the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> explain why the very big preference of 20 per cent. is given to imports from the United Kingdom under this item ? I do not know whether there is any fixed standard, but we find that sometimes a preference of only 5 per cent. is given, while in others a preference of 10 per cent., 15 per cent., and 20 per cent. is granted. This principle can be run to death. How much are we going to pay for it? If there is to be no fixed standard, we shall probably be jumping from a preference of 20 per cent. as in this case to one of 40 per cent. or even more. When are we going to give our own people a little preference ? The appearance of the word &#39; &#39; free &#39; &#39; in the preferential column may be taken to indicate that the articles mentioned in the item are not made in Australia or likely to be produced here. Freedom from the imposition of duty is one thing, but the emphasizing of the preference to the extent of imposing a general duty of 20 per cent. is giving Britain greater favour than she seeks or requires, and is at the same time unduly, and, therefore, unreasonably, taxing the Australian public. The general rate is too high! </para>

                    <para>. - Before the war Australia secured most of her supplies of these scientific articles from Germany. Once their production was a monopoly of Great Britain, but in the years just prior to the war German competition was driving British manufacturers out of the world&#39;s markets. The object in making the importation of British products free and of imposing a general tax of 20 per cent. is to assist the Mother Country to regain and retain her markets, particularly those within the Empire.

                    <para>Prior to the war, by far the greatest quantity of the supplies of scientific apparatus and instruments, as well as of scientific glass and porcelain articles, was imported from Germany. During the past four years many firms in Great Britain, France, and the United States of America have entered into this special field of manufacture in which Germany was formerly pre-eminent. The leading scientific periodicals in Great Britain, France, and the United States of America have furnished information showing that high class scientific apparatus and instruments, glassware and porcelain articles are now made in the countries named equal in all respects to those previously made in Germany. It is of the utmost importance to the Empire that supplies should be manufactured, for the future, within the Empire. </para>

                <para class="block">Efforts have been made in Australia to manufacture these scientific appliances, but, so far, without success. British industries, previously engaged in their production, were turned over to other purposes during the war. Meanwhile, German industries - that country having made all her warlike preparations prior to the actual declaration of hostilities - were ready, so soon as the conflict had terminated, to launch their products, in full blast, so to speak, upon the world&#39;s markets. Australia should be prepared to give Great Britain substantial advantage. </para>

Force of necessity now compels us to turn attention in the direction of our former enemy. But common sense should guide this Legislature. There should he a limit upon the penalties imposed on our own people in the direction of giving preference to the British people. These articles cannot be produced here. The Government are placing upon those persons of scientific mind and those institutions which require the appliances a tax to the extent of practically one-fifth of the value of the appliances. And all merely to give expression to a prejudice! Even so, however, there is no consistency, for the rates set down in the schedule will have the effect of penalizing friendly nations.

If France allows certain of our exports to be admitted free, we will deal with her on a similar basis, but if we cannot come  to  terms, the intermediate duties will  not  apply, and we shall still be imposing a duty of 20 per cent. on scientific instruments imported from France. </para>

                    <para>. - I have  to  direct the attention of the Committee to a few facts in connexion with these items, which I feel sure will induce Senator Duncan to withdraw his request. Before the war, in 1913, the values of the imports from different countries were as follows : - United Kingdom,. &#163;67,000; Germany, &#163;72,000; Japan, &#163;9,000; other countries, &#163;23,000, making a total of &#163;173,000. In 1918-19 the figures were- </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">United Kingdom, &#163;56,000; Germany, nil; Japan, &#163;207,000. What happened, of course, was that, Germany being out of the business, Japan collared the market, and our imports from that country went up from &#163;9,000 in 1913 to &#163;13,000 in 1914, &#163;57,000 in 1915, &#163;90,000 in 1916, &#163;104,000 in 1917, &#163;207,000 in 1918-19, and &#163;132,000 in 1919-20. Some of these goods in small quantities axe manufactured in the Commonwealth. There are seven factories established in Australia - four in Victoria: Australian Porcelain Company, Yarraville ; Sunshine Porcelain Company, Sunshine; Firebrick and Insulator Company, Kingwood; and Miller&#39;s Pottery, Coburg; two in Sydney: Fowler&#39;s Pottery and Miller&#39;s Pottery; and one in Perth: the Calyx Porcelain Company. The raw material used is entirely Australian. There are 200 men employed in the industry, the wages paid amount to &#163;1,400 per fortnight, the capital invested is &#163;116,000, and the value of the plant &#163;89,000. The imports, as I have already indicated, are chiefly from Japan. There are deposits in Australia of the raw materials required. Porcelain and other clays of good quality have been found in Tasmania; and in Kangaroo Island, where the first pottery mill in the Commonwealth was established, there are vast deposits of felspar, china-stone, and silica. There is a large demand for the articles included in these items, and it is expected that, with a reasonable protection, there will be a substantial growth in local manufacture. </para>

                        <para>- They are making some. The honorable senator will find, in the Commonwealth Parliamentary refreshment rooms, teapots and cups and saucers that were made in the Brunswick factory. The 1920 Tariff aims at a reasonable protection for the Australian manufacturer, and at the giving of a sound preference to the United Kingdom. This is necessary, in view of the grip that Japan is getting on the Australian trade. Some reference has been made to what we owe to Japan; but it should not be forgotten that Japan had her own interest in the war, and, though we may owe something to that country for war services, we. owe infinitely more to Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that we send very much to Japan. In August, 1919, the Australian Porcelain Company, of Melbourne, submitted figures showing that several lines of insulators from Japan were sold in Australia at prices up to 35 per cent, below that of the locally produced article. It will be admitted that we should be self-contained in the manufacture of insulators for telegraph and telephone purposes. The company pointed out the difference in wages paid in the two countries at the time. Skilled tradesmen in Australia were paid &#163;3 6s. to &#163;4 per week of forty-eight hours, and in Japan, 7s. 6d. to 9s. per week of sixty hours. Unskilled labour was paid in Australia a &#34; minimum of &#163;3 per week of forty-eight hours, and in Japan from 4s. to 63. per week of sixty hours. So far as the statement regarding Japanese wages is concerned, the Australian Porcelain Company&#39;s figures are not up-to-date. The Board of Trade has supplied the following information, which was taken from an address delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> F. Crowe, C.M.G., Commercial Counsellor of the British Embassy in Japan, published in the <inline font-style="italic">Board of Trade Journal</inline> in July, 1919.:- </para>

                    <para>Wages in Japan: Skilled men, 5s. to 7s. per day; unskilled men, 2s. per day. In addition to these rates, there is always a bonus given twice a year to workmen equal to at least one month&#39;s wages. </para>
                    <para>Hours worked in Japan: The average is given as seventy hours per week. There is no regular half-holiday on Saturday or holiday on Sunday. The general rule is to give two holidays per month. </para>
                    <para>The Japanese Consul in Melbourne, in asking that the intermediate Tariff should apply to Japan, advised that, in comparing Japanese wages with those paid in, Australia, it is necessary to remember that Japanese factories employ two, three, or sometimes four persons to perform the work which one European or Australian might do. </para>

                <para class="block">We should, I think, remember that the pottery industry is one of the oldest established in the United Kingdom. English pottery has. been famed throughout the world. The industry has been dealt a deadly blow by the war, and I think we should do something out of the ordinary in the circumstances to give this industry in Great Britain a definite preference. The difference between the British and general Tariffs now is only 25 per cent., and the Committee has agreed to a 20 per cent, general Tariff in the previous item. I appeal to the Senate to maintain the item as it stands. </para>

                        <para>- No; because if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> does not move for a reduction in the British preferential duty, assuming his present request is agreed to, I shall do so myself. This sub-item covers all classes of chinaware for household purposes. Consequently, the Minister&#39;s references to insulators hardly touches the issue. Insulators are included in the next sub-item. They cannot be classed as china and parian  ware. I do not wish in any way to penalize the British manufacturer because of the fact that he lost the Australian market during the war, unless it can be shown that slightly higher duties are necessary for the protection of an Australian industry in the manufacture of all these necessary china utensils for the comfort of a home. Up to the present the Minister has not been able to give  us  that assurance. </para>

Although imitation china cups and saucers may be described as china, they are not placed in that category by the Customs Department.

The greater proportion of the goods received from that country during the war were practically an imposition on the public, being of poor quality, cheap and nasty. If, as has been stated by the Minister, the great bulk of the importations under this heading are coining from Japan, the only thing I would like to do* would be to increase the general duty from 50 to 100 per cent.

                        <para>- No; but it comes into competition with chinaware, and if we can produce cups and saucers of si&#62;ch good quality now, it must only be a matter of time before Australian manufacturers, working on the great varieties of clays in this country, are able to produce the finest chinaware in the world. Nothing was being done in Australia in this line prior to the war, but of late years a good deal of progress has been made, and some important experimental work is now being carried out in Western Australia. The industry is well worthy of ever}&#39; encouragement. </para>

                    <para>.. - Recently, I had the privilege of inspecting works established at Footscray by two returned, soldiers for the production of hard porcelain insulators. These men before the war were contractors; but having during the war lost their legs, they invested all  their  capital, amounting to &#163;30,000, in these works. Prior to the war, the production of these insulators was a monopoly of Austrian, and German firms; but now dozens of factories have been established for making them in various parts of Australia. The working up .of the clay furnishes very suitable ^ occupation for disabled soldiers, and of the eighty employees in. the  works  at Footscray,  twenty are  returned men. But immediately the Japanese makers found that the monopoly they had secured during the war was -being threatened, they began to quote prices which were actually below the cost price of production in Japan, with the result that the Footscray firm lost a tender at Rockhampton, in Queensland. Evidently the Rockhampton people preferred the inferior Japanese article; but their action in this respect is convincing proof of the necessity of imposing  a.  duty  which  will prevent this dumping. The Victorian State Government have spent &#163;.1.5,000 in erecting a plant at Brunswick for the purpose of training returned soldiers in this class of  work, and  similar plants have been installed nt Maryborough, and other centres in the State. However, these works cannot be established without the expenditure of a great deal of capital. The machinery required for grinding refractory clays, and even quartz, which enters into the composition of porcelain, to very fine powder is very expensive; and costly testing plants must also be installed. The only engineering company in Australia which would attempt the manufacture of the testing plant required by the Footscray firm was one established in Perth; and the final cost of installing it ran into &#163;10,000. In a sense, the manufacture of porcelain is a key industry. Various subsidiary industries spring up around it. First of all, there is the work provided for engineering firms in making the testing plants. The Footscray firm find it necessary to employ a staff of chemists in order to control the glaziers and maintain the kilns at a proper temperature; and, in order to keep their chemists occupied when they were -not employed on tasks attaching to the manufacture of porcelain, they have begun to work up the byproducts of the industry into various lines, the production of which would not have been attempted had it not been for the establishment of the key industry. One of these products is face powder. This class of work is a congenial occupation for our returned soldiers, and I strongly appeal to honorable senator 3 to give them the protection which is so essential to them. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has already shown the advantages which Japanese manufacturers possess in respect to the hours worked and the very low rate of wages paid there; and I am afraid that if we are not careful our works will be swamped out of existence by Japanese manufacturers, who, later on, will take their profit out of us. </para>

                    <para>. -  I have listened to this debate with a great deal of interest, and also to the statement of the Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> in regard to the dimensions of the industry; but I hardly think his figures are up to date. I know that Fowler&#39;s Pottery, in one of the suburbs of Sydney, which is capitalized at &#163;100,000, has recently gone in for very extensive premises for the development of glazed white porcelain, sanitary, and other ware, as described in the sub-item we are discussing. A few years ago, these works confined their operations to drain pipes and such like ware; but in their show-room the other day I saw a very extensive display of white sanitary and other chinaware manufactured by them.  I would like to see these duties retained, giving our porcelain and enamel-ware makers a protection of 25 per cent, against the British manufacturers, and giving the latter  a  protection of 25 per cent, against- the Japanese makers. I have no hesitation in saying that my vote will always be recorded for the development of trade within the Empire. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to have that information, because it supports my argument. It is evident from the figures of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that if we desire to give a greater preference to Great Britain, we must either increase the duty against Japan or decrease it in the case of Great Britain. What I propose is, I submit,  a  fairly high duty against Great Britain on this class of goods, which requires much packing, and has to pay very high freights, the packages being large in proportion to the value of the contents. Altogether  a  considerable degree of natural protection is afforded, as compared with other classes df goods, and 15 ner cent, affords all the direct protection that can reasonably be desired. In Great Britain there are not the low wages and low production costs that we hear, of in connexion with the industries of Japan and other countries. The duty I propose will, I hope, enable the British manufacturer and exporter to more than hold their own, which at present, as the Minister&#39;s figures show, they are unable to do. </para>

                    <para>. -  I wish this item had been made free so far as Great Britain is concerned. I speak with no unkindly feeling towards Japan, who supplied us with large quantities of crockery when Britain was otherwise occupied in the war. That, of course, was all to our advantage, and in return, I suppose, Japan took from us hides, wattle bark, coal, and other materials so necessary in her industries. One of my objections to the high general Tariff which has been passed is that it fakes the superior classes of china and similar wares all too costly. The use of such ware should not be confined to the wealthy, but should be enjoyed by the people of Australia as a whole. The best in the world is good enough for the people I represent, and I would make that beat cheap by reducing the duties. I cannot do that now, but I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> in his proposal. The figures of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> are sadly convincing of the fact that Britain has lost much of her trade in these goods, and certainly 15 per cent. is ample protection. I should say that breakages in transport add 2 per cent. or 3 per cent. to the natural protection. Why Britishers should wish to impose duties against Britishers I do not know, for certainly I have no desire of that kind. </para>

He has evidently forgotten what he told the Committee last night. Insulators and electrical fittings used as porcelain non conductors, as well as dishes of various kinds, which are made from the clays to which the honorable senator referred, are covered by this item. Various byproducts, such as &#34; Clever Mary &#34; and face powders, are produced by the industry, which is well established, not &#39; only in South Australia, but throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

It is the most refreshing and wholesome development of the Tariff debate this week. I object to this item, because it is too general. Porcelain ware includes valuable ornaments, which the wealthy will have at any cost, as well as the bare requirements of the humblest dwelling. And yet both classes of goods are dutiable at the same rate. The aristocrat of Toorak pays the same amount by way of duty on his rare porcelain ware as the man outback has to pay on his cup and saucer. </para>

                        <para>- It has made no requests for increased duties, and in that respect is unlike the fiscal marauders in the eastern States, who, although they are able to declare 15 per cent, dividends, are reaching out for still higher duties. They are a sort of fiscal cancer. They fatten on what they -feed. I object to the unworkmanlike way in which this item is framed. Valuable goods, such as porcelain ornaments, should be dealt with under a separate sub-item, and subjected  to a stiff duty. I do pot like this slipshod way of doing business; but apparently there is no chance of my carrying a request. I voted with the Government on the occasion of the last division almost because I was tired of always being in a minority. But I thought that the re quest to  reduce  the duty in. that case to 15 per cent, was getting &#34; too near the bone.&#34; While I am prepared to get a3 near the bone as possible in imposing these duties, so that we may put our manufacturers on their mettle, I felt that the requested reduction was too great. </para>

                    <para>.- The total value of imports under sub-item e in 1913 was &#163;15,294, of which &#163;10,875 worth came from the United Kingdom, and &#163;2,914 worth from Belgium. In 1920, the value of imports from the United Kingdom fell to &#163;1,950, Belgium &#163;480,. and &#34; other &#34; &#163;837, or a total of only &#163;3,267 for the year. It is not possible to give the exact value of the production of these articles in Australia, but a fairly good&#39; idea of the extent of the output may be gained by calculating on the basis of the value of the raw material imported, namely, polished and patent plate glass under 25 square feet, plus 150 per cent, to cover cost of manufacture. On this basis, which is suggested by figures given in the report of the  Inter-State  Commission, volume XII., page 922, the following values result:- 1913, &#163;155,740; 1914-15, &#163;154,050; 1915-16, &#163;172,500; 1916-17, &#163;214,647; 1917-18, &#163;109,222; 1918-19, &#163;413,347. The statistics do not distinguish bevelled-glass factories from other ornamental glass factories in the Commonwealth, but give the following figures for the year 1917 for the whole of the &#34; ornamental glass factories &#34; :  - Number of employees, 528; salaries and wages paid, &#163;69,627. In pre-war days, the local manufacture was approximately 90 per cent, of the total requirements, but it is now about 99 per cent. of the whole. </para>

                    <para>. - I can appreciate the difficulty of the Trade and Customs Department in securing accurate statistics concerning the number of hands employed. Very often, the firm which is engaged in bevelling and silvering glass is also interested in the manufacture of paint. The two phases of the industry are correlated, and it would not he easy to ascertain the exact number of employees engaged solely upon the one work or on the other. An objection might be raised that only a very few men are employed upon the special work of bevelling and silvering plate glass; but, as I have just indicated, that activity is only a branch of a larger and much lore comprehensive work. </para>

                        <para>. - Sub-item  b,  as it has been amended elsewhere, includes &#34; blanks, fused, for bifocal lenses.&#34; I suggest that the phrase be taken out, and made a new sub-item  d,  upon which the rates of 30, 35, and 40 per cent. be reduced, respectively, to 10, 15, and 20 per cent. Most of the work associated with the manufacture of spectacles is now done by opticians throughout Australia from&#39; imported blanks. I have in my hand two pieces of Optical material. One is the  rough fused blank for a bifocal lens, and the other is the finished fused lens. I have been informed that the procedure involved in producing the finished article consists of importing rough blanks and flint glass buttons, and fusing them. The operation does not engage considerable Australian labour, but, if there is practically the same duty upon the rough glass - that is, upon the raw material - as upon the finished material, there will be a considerable increase in the cost of spectacles. </para>

                        <para>- No ! These fused bifocals are the raw materials required in optical workshops throughout the Commonwealth. If the cost of the raw material is made prohibitive, both labour and ultimate cost will be affected. The wishes of the trade would be met if the duties on &#34; Blanks, fused, for bifocal lenses &#34; were made half those imposed upon fused bifocal lenses partly or wholly finished. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think there is any necessity for that to be done. E. J. Paxton Limited, of Sydney, in making application for a duty of 331/3rd per cent. on bifocal lenses, pointed out that they are the only manufacturers in Australia of these particular goods, and that they have only succeeded in producing a satisfactory article after many expensive experiments and much financial loss. In September, 1919, Paxton&#39;s stated that they were employing forty hands in this industry, and the weekly wages were &#163;130. Up till that time they had spent &#163;7,000 on plant, machinery, and experiments. They further stated that they were prepared to spend another &#163;4,000 on extra plant in order to make the &#34; Toric &#34; or curved spectacle lenses, provided adequate protection was given to the industry. As bifocal and &#34;Toric&#34; lenses, unless edged, would come under item 244a, where the duties , are free, 5 per cent. and 20 per cent. respectively, it appears that adequate protection has not been afforded, and the firm have complained that they cannot compete with the imported article, and will have to relinquish the manufacture unless an alteration is made. They state, however, that if assistance can be given by means of satisfactory duties, they will be able to extend their business to the general manufacture of optical lenses, giving employment to possibly hundreds of Australians. This firm has spent between &#163;25,000 and &#163;30,000 in establishing the fused bifocal lense industry - that is the stage at which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> wishes to reduce the duty - and claims to be able to supply 50&#39; per cent. of the Australian requirement. Up to date 250,000 pairs have been manufactured. The honorable senator suggests that we should deprive the industry of this protection. </para>

                    <para>. -  It is evident that the fusing of two pieces of glass involves the use of different grades of material, otherwise we would not obtain the power of vision by means of a bifocal lens. The fusing is not a difficult process, but it would be unfair to import bifocal lenses. The sub-item reads, &#34;bifocal lenses, partly or wholly finished,&#34; and, as labour may be cheaper abroad, users might obtain the lenses wholly finished, because the cost would not be so great. By making what follows &#34; bifocal lenses &#34; a separate item the position would be met, because we would then be protecting the work of grinding, which is done here. The fusing of lenses, which is based on opticians&#39; prescriptions, can be done quite easily, and the work then given to the grinder. The grinding work would then be protected by a higher duty than was imposed on the blank or fused lenses. </para>

I should say that, short of actual obstruction, we should be able to adjourn at 4 o&#39;clock, but if there is a disposition to obstruct, it must be overcome. Before the luncheon adjournment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> asked me whether the fixed duties in this item bear a proper relation to the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties in the previous item. The Customs officials tell me that in each case the fixed duties correlate, as closely as possible, to the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. In sub-item b, for bottles of over 5 drams, not exceeding 10 ounces fluid capacity, the fixed duties per dozen are British, 2d. ; intermediate, 3d. ; and general, 4d. If what the Minister states is accurate, and the fixed duty of British, 2d., is equal to&#39; 30 per cent, in .sub-item b of item 252, bottles n.e.i., the total value of these bottles will be about 6&#189;d. per dozen. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the Minister, because I am sure he will see the point of my argument when I mention that consideration of the perfumery duties has been postponed. One of the complaints of the local manufacturers is that the specific duties on bottles containing perfumes are not nearly so high as the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties on empty bottles. It is nob a big matter, but it is bound up with an attempt to get consistency in connexion with the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the Minister for the suggestion, but I do not think it will quite cover the point I have raised. The duties on imported bottles for use in manufacture here are in some oases only about one-third or one-fourth of what they ought to be. As we have postponed consideration of items 8 and 9, and as this question will arise again on item 285 (medicines), I suggest that we postpone this item until we know what re-arrangement is going to be made in the other items I have referred to. </para>

One of the finest modem factories for the manufacture of the class of articles mentioned in it has recently been established in Sydney.

                        <para>. - Since these duties were imposed upon marble and granite there has been an almost universal protest from the monumental masons of Australia against the duty on that white marble which comes from Carrara, in Italy, and can be obtained nowhere else. Those of us who, some years ago, subscribed to have a bust of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne made, gave the work to an Australian sculptress with the instruction that preference should be given to material obtainable in our own continent. But as no suitable white marble was to be got in Australia, it had to be imported from the Carrara quarry. The pedestal, being of coloured marble, is of course, of Australian material. The bust when finished was placed in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library. The Australian monumental masons want to know why a duty is placed on a marble for which a substitute cannot be found in Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- The Commonwealth production statistics group marble with slate, so that it is impossible to give individual values for the Commonwealth; but the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book</inline> for 1916 furnishes a little information, so far as that State is concerned, and gives the value of the marble raised in 1915 as &#163;4,1S7. Practically inexhaustible deposits of marble and granite are found in different parts of the Commonwealth. It is doubtful if any other country is so well provided with this material, not only in regard to the quantity, but also in regard to variety. The total annual imports of marble and granite in the rough slabs amount to about &#163;1,000, although last year the value amounted to &#163;1,500. Practically the whole of the marble imported comes from Italy. However, there appears to be no reason why we should not protect our own marble - with which the Italian white marble comes into competition - which has proved its suitability for all kinds of purposes, except statuary. For building or furniture it is unequalled. However, the importation figures indicate that it is not a matter upon which the Committee should delay. </para>

                    <para>. - In 1920, carbide of calcium was selling, c.i.f., duty paid, at &#163;30 to &#163;35 a ton. My information is that the Tasmanian product is selling now at &#163;30 a ton. The company, however, passed through a bad time because a Swedish company dumped the  product in Australia. This, however, was met by the action of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> who prohibited its importation. I take it that the company got into financial difficulties because of this dumping, but I think that those concerned in the industry are satisfied with these duties. </para>

                    <para>.- For the information of the Committee, I may say that I know something of the history of this company. Every provision is now made in the southern part of Tasmania to supply practically the whole requirements of Australia in carbide of calcium. The company referred to had considerable financial difficulties in the initial stage, not only in connexion with the erection of their plant, but also in connexion with the provision of electrodes to carry on smelting. It was found that during the war period the imported electrodes were absolutely unreliable, and, owing to this, considerable loss was suffered. The company then proceeded with the erection of furnaces and presses necessary to manufacture their own electrodes, and the electrodes they are now turning out are equal to any that have ever been imported. In fact, this company is exporting electrodes successfully - quite a &#34; feather in the cap&#34; of Australia. The company, by means of their own electrodes, successfully produced carbide, and filled up their stores, but found that the Japanese and Norwegian manufacturers had got&#34; into the Australian market before them. The market became overstocked, and the Australian company could not sell their product at anything like a reasonable price. Carbide was selling as high as &#163;40 to &#163;50 a. ton, but generally at &#163;37 or &#163;38, and the company made a compact with the Commonwealth Government that if an embargo were placed on importations, they would sell at &#163;30. That compact holds good to-day. </para>

The new duties proposed will mean  an  increase of 5s. a ton in the price of superphosphates. I understand that the Australian manufacturers of superphosphates are entering into an arrangement with the Federal authorities for a supply of rock from Nauru Island, and have undertaken that there shall be no increase in the (price of the product. But now there is presented to us a Tariff which will have the effect of increasing the price of superphosphate by reason of the duty on sulphur, by 5s. a ton. </para>

With that policy  I  have no quarrel; but volcanic sulphur is a totally different thing, so far as its application to the various industries is concerned. Sulphur from pyritous ores cannot possibly be obtained absolutely pure; it contains a small quantity of arsenic. </para>

                        <para>- Quito so. The sulphur required for general manufacturing purposes, for making into sulphuric acid, is of very much greater quantity than the volcanic sulphur which must, under any circumstances and at any price, he imported. Australia has not any volcanic sulphur of any sort anywhere. Volcanic sulphur must be used to obtain the sulphuric acid required for making glucose and soda water  and  other products for human consumption. It is only from volcanic sulphur that sulphuric acid can be made which is chemically absolutely pure. It may be remembered that some twenty or thirty years ago there were many mysterious deaths in England through arsenical poisoning, and that these deaths were traced to the drinking of beer containing glucose .that had been made from sulphuric acid .produced from arsenical pyrites. We must have volcanic sulphur also for making sheep and cattle dips, and insecticide and germicide preparations. </para>

It is common knowledge that chemists, in connexion with their multifarious sulphurous- preparations, must have (pure volcanic sulphur. If the request is accepted, it will protect, as far as it is possible to do so, the manufacture of sulphur from our own sulphur pyrites,, and, at the same time, we shall have a raw material, which many minor trades are hound to use, admitted free under departmental regulations. The request will have the effect of making free the raw material required &#39;for sheep dips and germicides, and will not interfere with the development of our own sulphur production from the only source we have, namely, our pyrites ore. </para>

                    <para>. - I propose in this case to vote for the imposition of a Protective duty. The Committee has agreed to duties on machinery, implements, explosives, and everything else used by the miner, and I think it is time that we gave him a little protection by voting for the retention of the duties on sulphur. If the requirements of the miner were free, I should be prepared to support a request to make sulphur free, but this is the only bit of protection that has been given him. </para>

                        <para>- We have duties on copper as well as wheat and other primary products which we export. What protection do they afford ? The only duty that is likely to be of any service to the mining section of the community is that now under consideration, and some honorable senators who have been voting to add to the taxation borne by the .miners desire to remove it. Last evening when I moved a request that tung oil should be free of duty, on the ground that it was essential to the preparation of certain varnishes, I was met with the reply that we could not allow it to come in free in as much as it would compete with linseed oil. My request was therefore rejected. The sulphur which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> desires to come in free may come into competition with that obtained from arsenical pyrites, and, therefore, I am going to vote for these duties. If Protection is a good thing for the man who lives in Sydney or Melbourne, it ought to be a good thing for the miners of Mount Lyell and Broken Hill. </para>

                    <para>.- I am delighted that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> has seen the wisdom of supporting this industry. Every effort should be made to sustain and encourage the production of sulphur in Australia. Here is practically the sole opportunity given by the Tariff to benefit the miner. A reliable and adequate supply of sulphur or sulphuric acid is necessary not only in connexion with the manufacture of superphosphates, but in the production of nearly all kinds of munitions. Sulphur is produced in the southern States of America at an especially low cost; nearly all the work is done by cheap negro labour. Another source of supply is Japan, where the production, again, is in the hands of cheap labour. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has seen fit to request an amendment of the rates of duty in the interests of those who use only a very small proportion of the production. I ask the honorable senator if he will agree to amend his request in the direction of providing that sulphur, which is admitted free, shall not be used for any of the purposes for which sulphur which can be obtained from any. pyritic or other sulphide ores can be used. Certain Australian companies have expended considerable sums, and are operating in various States. I do nor want to place them in a position of uncertainty with respect to the Customs laws. I do not desire that they shall be subject to departmental by-laws. Their interests will be safeguarded, however, if provision is made in the direction I have just indicated. At the same time, I regret that any amendment has been requested. It is not desirable that qualifying conditions shall attach to the importation of sulphur merely in the interests of the users of that very small proportion which is employed in this country apart from the actual manufacture of superphosphates. At least 95 per cent. of the sulphuric acid used here goes into the production of fertilizers. Some honorable senators look upon the schedule rates as increasing the cost of superphosphates to the farmers. If an abundant and reliable source of supply can be provided, the farmer will benefit. I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> that he would not be acting in the best interests of the primary producers if he should take any step to hamper the continuous production of first class superphosphates. I understand that 1 ton of sulphur is absorbed in the production of sufficient sulphuric acid for the manufacture of 10 tons of superphosphates. The average application of superphosphate to the soil is from¾ cwt. to 1 cwt. per acre. </para>

                        <para>- That being&#39; so, the increased cost imposed on the farmer by the existing duties will amount to l&#189;d. or 2d. per acre. I do not think that honorable senators should be perturbed, when tens of thousands of pounds have been invested in connexion with the production of sulphur, and thousands of men are earning a living in mining the ores from which sulphur is obtained. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. Sulphuric acid is being produced in South Australia and New South Wales, and I have no doubt that if the duties proposed in the Tariff are adopted other industries will be established. Ores containing a percentage of copper, a few grains of gold, and a few ounces of silver may merely pay mining expenses and the cost of extracting their metallic contents, but if there is a sufficiently large percentage of sulphur in pyritic or sulphide ores - say, 10s. worth per ton - it would make the difference between failure and success. Roughly, from 10,000 to 20,000 men are engaged in mines producing low grade ores from which sulphur is obtained, and we are justified in assuming that if we protect the sulphur industry it will not be long before other mines will bo developed and a larger number of men engaged. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> suggests that if volcanic sulphur is admitted free it shall be used only where sulphur manufactured in Australia cannot be used. It is, therefore, a clear-cut issue, and one upon which there should be very little difference of opinion. A majority of honorable senators desire to make dutiable sulphur which is the product of the mining industry, and there should, therefore, not be any misunderstanding. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> points out that there are certain manufacturers in Australia who use volcanic sulphur - which, of course, is not the product of metalliferous mines - in connexion with the manufacture of fungicides, germicides, insecticides, certain medicines, and aerated waters. Those who advocate protecting the sulphur derived from sulphide and pyritic ores are not anxious to penalize those who use volcanic sulphur, which does not enter into competition with sulphur manufactured in the Commonwealth. If the request is amended as suggested, volcanic sulphur will be admitted free, and the matter of determining the purposes for which it is used will then be decided by Parliament, and not left to Customs officials. The only other point is whether sulphur shall be dutiable or not. The Government will accept the request with the addendum mentioned, because we do not wish to penalize those industries using volcanic sulphur. Farmers&#39; organizations recognise the importance of the manufacture of sulphuric acid in the Commonwealth from Australian sulphur, and I understand that co-operative factories for the production of superphosphates are to be established in South Australia andin Victoria. It will, therefore, be an advantage to farmers to have a local supply of sulphur from which to manufacture superphosphate. Those who are considering the farmers&#39; interests would not be justified in voting against the imposition of duties on sulphur produced from pyritic or sulphide ores. </para>

                    <para>. - I curtailed my last remarks because I desired to know the nature of the request that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> intended to move. It certainly never occurred to me that he would submit a request for the free admission of only that class of sulphur which is used with a little treacle on Sunday mornings in the rearing of large families. I have not been at all convinced by the arguments that have so far been adduced in support of the honorable senator&#39;s request. The purpose of the Tariff is to assist local manufacturers; but in this case the proposal is made to permit the free admission of superphosphates made in foreign countries, while the manufacturer of superphosphates within the bounds of the Commonwealth is to be saddled with a duty on a raw material essential to that manufacture. It is difficult to believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> was serious in his reference to the tens of thousands of men who are employed in Australia in the sulphur-producing industry. The honorable senator is well aware that the production of sutyhur is only a little side line in connexion with most of our mines. I am given to understand that the bulk of our importations of sulphur are used in the manufacture of superphosphates. The proposal which has now been made really means that, in addition to the duties which have already been imposed under this schedule on our primary producers, they must pay 5s. per ton on all the superphosphates they use. I understand that some arrangement is likely to be made to adjust the Tariff in respect of sulphur and superphosphates, but it is distinctly the duty of this Committee to protect the interests of those who use sulphur in the manufacture of superphosphates in Australia until that arrangement is made. I intend to ask the Committee to make superphosphates free. If that course is followed, there will be no occasion for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> request with regard to the Sunday morning sulphur. The position in this matter is so- clear that even one of our Free Trade friends had to be rushed in to support a heavy duty on an article which is so useful to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable senator&#39; mean to say that a duty of 50s. per ton on sulphur is not a heavy duty ? The honorable senator to whom I have referred was brought in here at the eleventh hour to scream on behalf of the miners, when he knows that the proposal will not make &#34; tuppenceha&#39;penny &#34; worth of difference to &#39; the miners of Australia, since the production of sulphur is merely a side-issue in mining. Honorable senators are not to be caught napping in that way. We have since had a request submitted with respect to a kind of sulphur of which very little is imported. That is merely another red herring drawn across the trail. </para>

                    <para>. - The proposal before us, as I understand it, is to impose a duty on sulphur. We have been informed by the Minister that the article is imported for household use, for fumigating and hygienic purposes generally. He elaborated that aspect of the matter, but he touched very lightly on the fact that it is used chiefly as an ingredient in the manufacture of superphosphates. We know what occurred in another place in dealing with these duties ; and in my view the action now taken by the Government is intended to pave the way for a duty on superphosphates. When a duty is imposed on one item, it is referred to as an excuse for an increase in the duty on some other item, the next step in manufacture, and so on <inline font-style="italic">ad infinitum;</inline> and if we take the first false step in this case, I have no doubt that the next step we shall be asked to take will be to impose a duty on superphosphates. We should hesitate before taking any action which would add one penny to the cost of fertilizing the lighter soils of this country. We cannot have superphosphates made in Australia without sulphur, or its product, sulphuric acid. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> who put up a plea for the Mount Lyell Company, does not realize that the company has prospered without any duty  On  superphosphates. </para>

                        <para>-The Mount Lyell Company stands out from others in the production of superphosphates, not only here, but in other States of the Commonwealth; and it does not want a duty, or, at all events, it has been successful in its enterprises up to date without a duty, on superphosphates. Why, in the circumstances, is a duty asked for on the raw material of which superphosphates are made? I am satisfied that the object is only to lay the foundation for an effort to be made later on to tax superphosphate. The good sense of this Parliament has so far led it to permit the free importation of fertilizing agents from any country. This matter was discussed in 1908, and at that time the Japanese product was referred to as a reason for the imposition of a duty. The good sense of Parliament enabled it to turn a deaf ear to the appeal, and superphosphates were made free of duty from that day to this. What has been the result? Have any of our manure-manufacturing companies shown any signs of languishing in consequence ? They have, without any duty on superphosphates, been very prosperous concerns, and are spreading from State to State. Here we have a proposal to tax the main ingredient required for the manufacture of superphosphates in Australia, and I will not and cannot agree to it, in the interests of those for whom I have, so far, unsuccessfully, I am very sorry to say, put up a plea: I refer to the people who go out on to the light and dry soils of this country; the nien on the sandy plains of Western Australia; the men who have been pushed out in New South Wales on to the dry and rabbit-infested Bathurst Plains; the men in the Pinnaroo country in South Australia, and the light Mallee country of Victoria. If the settlers in these areas are not able to secure a. cheap and plentiful supply of fertilizer, as well as cheap machinery, they might just as well not go there at all. Some time ago,&#34;in my own State, I met a man - and I am glad to know that such men are to be found in other States as well - who is making a living on light, sandy plains, land that was passed over by others as utterly useless. He is known as &#34; Sand Plain Martin.&#34; He came in some distance to one of my meetings, in consequence, I believe, of something that I had said, or tried to do, regarding the farming industry; and when I met him I realized immediately that he was the very embodiment of that spirit that should be encouraged in every possible way in this country - a stalwart sample of an alert, capable pioneer. He is making a success of farming operations on that barren patch of country toy his native industry and the application of fertilizing agents in the manufacture of which sulphur, which it is now proposed to tax, plays so important a part. If we increase the price of manure in this way, what will become of all the Martins of the Commonwealth ? Inevitably they will drift back to the cities. The good men,&#39; the cream of our manhood, will be turned back amongst those who will not venture out to risk and strive. We should pause before we do anything that will add to the burdens of these men, who are either thrust out from the city areas, or go out of their own free will, in order to make this land of ours productive. Their voice is not heard in these legislative halls, or, if it is heard, it has such little effect that they cannot comfort themselves with the thought that they are getting anything from this Parliament, so far as this Tariff is concerned. They do not owe their success to anything we are doing for them. </para>

Nothing of the kind. They have established themselves in Western Australia without the promise of one penny piece of duty. Make no mistake about it. They would not have gone there if they had not a good prospect of profitable business. If we agree to the duty on this sub-item, the next step will be to put a duty upon superphosphates. Where are we going to end? We must call a halt now, in the interests of these men, who are maintaining their homes and winning success from the light and arid soils of the Commonwealth, and who can only do it with cheap superphosphates. I am quite prepared to put a tax on sulphur required for the other processes of manufacture mentioned by the Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator Earle;</inline> but I stand for free sulphur for the manufacture of superphosphates to fertilize our infertile or impoverished soils. If the Minister will give us an assurance that sulphur for the manufacture of superphosphates will be admitted free, I will be with him in fixing the duty on sulphur required for other uses. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall not delay the Committee very long. I indorse the vigorous statements made by my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> All through the Tariff debate the argument of High Protectionists and Ministers, as regards duties on agricultural machinery, has been to constantly urge the necessity for more and more protection, because the raw materials were dutiable. It was stated that, because we had a duty of 20s. and 30s. on pig iron- and angle iron, the raw materials for the manufacture of farming implements, there should be a duty of 10 per cent. British, 20 per cent. intermediate, and 30 per cent, general on agricultural implements. This argument was constantly used by those who are supporting increased duties. Whenever High Protectionists were in a difficulty, they used the simple plea : &#34; We have increased the duty on the raw material, therefore we should increase the duty on the manufactured article.&#34; Honorable senators should pause before they agree, in this item, to duties on another raw material required for an important manufacturing industry, because if we tax sulphur now. it is inevitable that, in course of time, there will be a demand for a tax on superphosphates. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> in protesting against these duties. I hope that sulphur will be allowed in free, and that the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> will be accepted. </para>

                    <para>.- 1 believe every honorable senator wishes to deal fairly with the local manufacturer of superphosphates. The other House decided to allow superphosphates iu free, and the local manufacturers of superphosphates urged that sulphur should also be free.I understand they were satisfied with that position. The professed representatives of the Farmers Union in another place declared that they were prepared, as a co-operative society, to compete with any manufacturer&#39; outside Australia. They discussed the superphosphates position with their friends, who, no doubt, intended to take up&#39; shares in this co-operative society, and have requested the Minister to impose a duty on sulphur, with the idea of asking for a duty upon superphosphates. If the canting humbugs who claim to represent the farmers have their way they will pull down the pioneer and destroy the primary producing industry. They want this Committee to agree to the duty on sulphur, in order that they may be able to say, &#34; Very good; but if we are to have a duty upon sulphur, we must have a duty upon superphosphates.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. That was very unfair to the manufacturers. In. the circumstances, it should not have been imposed. If there is any raw material in Australia in which there should be no manipulation, it is sulphur, a component part of superphosphates, upon the use of which the whole of our primary production depends. Yet these candid humbugs who declare that the farmers are the back-bone of the country are intriguing behind the farmers&#39; backs to get a duty on sulphur, and thus compel those who are not members of co-operative companies to pay an enhanced price for the article they buy from outside sources. Ever since their entrance into the Parliaments of this country certain individuals have been practising deception upon our primary producers. Apparently their only object is to satisfy their own political ambitions and vanity. It is time they were told that it is their duty to display honesty of purpose wherever they are. </para>
