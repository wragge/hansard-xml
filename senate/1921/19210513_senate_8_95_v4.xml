                    <para>. -  This, I understand, is a Bill for the purpose of varying the Act passed by the Senate some time ago. The contents of this Bill are not before honorable senators, and so I hesitate very much about giving my vote to suspend the Standing and Sessional Orders. The original proposal was passed somewhat reluctantly by the Senate. </para>

                <para>The PRESIDENT <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator the Hon. T.

The honorable senator must confine himself to the question of the suspension of the Standing and Sessional Orders. </para>

                <para>Some months ago the Senate passed a Bill approving of an agreement between the Commonwealth Government and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Basil</inline> Lathrop Murray, under which the Western Australian farmers, joined in a corporated movement, were to raise  &#163;300,000  for the purpose of erecting grain elevators, terminal and otherwise, and in consideration of that expenditure the Commonwealth Government undertook to advance  &#163;550,000  by way of subsidy. Those connected with the movement, after further consideration, have come to the conclusion that it is advisable to start operations upon a somewhat less ambitious scale. It is proposed, therefore, to vary the original agreement to the extent of permitting the cooperative society to commence operations on a. capital of  &#163;250,000,  on the understanding that the amount to be contributed by the Commonwealth Government shall be reduced <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> to  &#163;440,000.  One of the conditions of the agreement is that the farmers themselves must spend  &#163;100,000  before the Commonwealth can be called upon to advance any money. They now propose to eliminate many country elevators for their first effort and to confine themselves to the erection of terminal elevators. The matter was so recently before the Senate that it is not necessary for me to say very much in connexion with this Bill. This is one of those cases in which people coming to the Government for assistance show their willingness to help themselves. It is some evidence of their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> in submitting this proposal that they undertake to contribute their own money to make it a success. There is a vast difference between those who merely sit on the Government door-mat and ask for public money, and those who come forward and are able to say that they are finding their own money as an. evidence of their good faith and their belief in the. soundness of their project, and then ask the Government for the loan of certain sums. That principle has already been approved by this Parliament in the passing of the previous measure. The only matter for consideration now, I submit, is whether the new proposal which, in effect, reduces the Government&#39;s liability <inline font-style="italic">pro rata-the</inline> assets remaining the same - ought to be approved. Those who opposed the original agreement submitted can obviously approve of the present proposal. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend is getting back to the merits of the original agreement. I gather from his interjection that he was opposed to that agreement. It is, however, part of a law passed by this Parliament, and whether this new proposal is approved or rejected, the old agreement remains. I am correct, therefore, in saying that this is a proposal to reduce the liability of the Commonwealth. If it were bad business for the Commonwealth to undertake to find &#163;550,000 for this enterprise under the original agreement, it must be regarded as an improvement if now the Commonwealth is asked to find only &#163;440,000. </para>

                            <para>- The country elevators. A review of the whole position has led those responsible for the venture to come to the conclusion that it would be desirable to start with the terminal elevators only, letting the enterprise develop gradually rather than start with a full-blown scheme. The measure I submit to the Senate is a very simple one. I am not following the usual procedure of the Standing Orders, because, in view of the fact that we are about to adjourn over some weeks, it would be undesirable to leave this company in a state of suspense when they desire to proceed with their operations. </para>

They are raising to-day &#163;123,500, and when they have done so, the Commonwealth Government will be liable under the original agreement to advance them &#163;2 for every &#163;1 of that amount. </para>

                        <para>. - I was opposed to the original agreement, and the reasons given by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> in support of the Bill now before the Senate only increase my opposition to the proposal, because the objections urged against the original agreement have been shown to be well founded. It was anticipated that there would be difficulty in raising the necessary capital, and a proposition which in the early stages suggested a glorious prospect does not now seem so inviting. </para>

We will not construct the country elevators, and, therefore, we want you to alter the agreement you made with us.&#34; I think that that confirms me in my attitude in regard to the first proposal, and justifies me in continuing that opposition to the proposal now before the Senate; though I shall not continue that opposition as I might do until the time at our disposal expires. </para>

We should not condemn a new system on the results of its first trial. Possibly when it is in full working order it will prove to be a splendid system . The money required by this company should be advanced by the Western Australian Government. It is purely a State matter. Money should be advanced by the Commonwealthonly on the condition that the proposal has the indorsement of the Western Australian </para>

The members of that Government know what is being done in their State, and if it is not good enough for them to say to their own farmers &#34; We will pledge the State&#39;s credit to the Commonwealth Government to obtain the money you require,&#34; we should not enter into any undertaking of the kind. </para>

The mills are to be established in conjunction with the New South Wales Government. Provided the State Government agree they are going to take over the old gaol at Parramatta - because in New South Wales, as a result of practically ten years of Labour administration the number of criminals has been reduced to such an extent that the gaols are going entirely out of use. </para>

The Parramatta Gaol is lying practically idle, and a company is being formed, working in conjunction with the New South Wales Government, to establish woollen mills at the gaol. A large amount of capital will be represented in the building, and the unionists are prepared to contribute a large amount out of their own pockets. If that organization came to the Commonwealth Government, and said, &#34; We desire you to treat us in exactly the same way as you propose to treat the Western Australian farmers under this agreement and make us a similar advance,&#34; what would the Minister say to such a request? </para>

                            <para>-I am still waiting fora reply to my question from the Minister ing charge of the Bill. It is a fair question to ask why I should consent to an alteration in the agreement with the Western Australian farmers if the Commonwealth Government are prepared to make advances only to a favoured section. That is not a fair proposition to put before this Parliament. If we are going to enter upon the business of money lenders, it would be far better to pass a special Bill under which people could borrow money from the Commonwealth for starting private business concerns. We should let all come in under the same conditions. I admit that the proposal now made reduces the liability of the Commonwealth by a few pounds, but the responsibilities of the shareholders of the company are also reduced. </para>

                            <para>- I think that these people found that they had entered upon a most difficult undertaking. I admit that no one could have foreseen the change that has occurred in the financial market since the company&#39;s first proposition was made. I do not blame them for that, because I think even the most competent financiers could not have foreseen what has taken place. Noone, for instance, could have imagined that private banks would be calling up the overdrafts of perfectly solvent firms, and preventing them from making investments, which, under ordinary conditions, they might safely undertake. Yet that is what has  happened during the interval, and possibly it has caused the company to somewhat alter its outlook. I wish, however, to stress the wrong principle which underlies this scheme. I need no more convincing evidence that its underlying principle is a wrong one than is afforded by the eloquent silence of the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen).</inline></para>

                            <para>- This is really a farming proposition, and from an interjection which he made a little while ago, the Minister seems to think that anybody who opposes this measure is not a friend of the farmer. But it may not be very long before the farmers will wish that we had saved them from their friends. We all know that schemes which look very nice upon paper frequently fall short of the anticipations of their promotors. An honorable senator interjects &#34; especially Government enterprises.&#34; &#34;Well, here is a private enterprise which is rushing to the Government for the cash to enable it to carryon operations. The opponents of Government enterprise are asking us to approve a Bill which is the very embodiment of the principle which they condemn. </para>

                        <para>. - I well remember when, a few short months ago, the original Act. was before this Chamber how enthusiastic were the promoters of the scheme regarding its early success and the very large savings which would be effected to the farmers. - At that time some of us had the temerity - notwithstanding that to a large extent we rely upon the votes of the man upon the land to return us here - to doubt some of the figures which were then presented for our consideration, and to question whether the complete bulk handling of wheat, particularly in Western Australia, would not cost the farmers more than does the handling of that commodity by ordinary methods. I believe that an intense interest was taken in that debate by the Western Australian farmers, and that the effect of our discussion has been that the enthusiasts over this project have somewhat modified their original ideas, with the result that they propose to spend less of their own money, and, therefore, cannot ask the Commonwealth to subscribe as much as they asked it to spend previously. When this matter was last under consideration, figures were given in connexion with the lining of ships, and of the total cost per bushel of bulk handling, which have been completely borne out by every paragraph which has &#39;recently been published in Australia regarding this question. If I were a Western Australian farmer, I would not put &#163;1 into the whole business. </para>

                            <para>- It is only two or three weeks ago that evidence was given  by a  well-known shipping expert in Sydney that the cost of lining vessels to enable them to take away bulk cargoes of wheat would be somewhere in the region of the figures which were given in this Chamber during the debate upon the original Bill last session. Upon that occasion it was stated that, upon the basis of bags costing 14s. or 15s. per dozen, there would be a saving effected by bulk handling, and it was pointed out that it was unlikely that the price of jute goods would revert to pre-war figures. To-day cornsacks are worth about only one-half of what they were when that discussion took place. Since then we have had further evidence, not of a very satisfactory character, regarding the silos which have been erected in my own State. We have also been told that the Victorian Government unhesitatingly declare that they will not go in for the bulk handling of wheat. Consequently, all the arguments which were advanced last session in opposition to this agreement, as an agreement which is calculated to benefit the farmers, hold good to-day. As a loyal supporter of the. Government, I find myself in somewhat of a difficulty. The original Bill was passed last session. We did not force the motion against its second reading to a division. Those of us who then thought that the measure did not represent good business either to the Government or the farmers of Western Australia should hail with satisfaction the fact that the risk which will be incurred under this measure is less than it was formerly. </para>

I have read most of them, and I think that they are lies. One statement was that the Wheat Board had paid &#163;2,500 for the conversion of a ship into a bulk-carrying vessel in Sydney. As a matter of fact, we have never paid a single penny to convert any vessel. </para>

                            <para>- I was speaking of the evidence which was given before the Select Committee in New South Wales upon agriculture, which was presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers. One of the principal witnesses at that inquiry stated that the conversion of a ship into a bulk carrier of wheat would cost within a few pounds of the figures which I submitted in this Chamber last session. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that both the original. Act and this Bill seek to perpetuate a. false principle. If the Western Australian farmers required any help to build silos for the bulk handling of wheat, the requisite money should have been loaned to the Government of that State, which should have Been under an obligation&#39; to repay it to the Commonwealth Government, just as was done In New South Wales. It would be interesting to know what has actually occurred in connexion with this proposition since it was last before the Senate. I read somewhere that the Legislative Council of Western Australia had thrown out the entire proposition. </para>

I do not intend to vote against the measure, because I recognise the difficulty in which the Government find themselves owing to a bargain already having been entered into. But I am not prepared to say that the observations which I have offered this afternoon will be received altogether unsympathetically by honorable senators. The Bill seeks to introduce an innovation of an exceedingly dangerous character, and to establish a precedent which we need never have created. Whilst I am sorry that this has been done- </para>

                        <para>. - When this matter last came before the Senate, I believe I had a considerable influence in persuading some honorable senators of the wisdom of the course proposed by the Government, and so impressed was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> with the arguments that I brought forward in support of the measure, that when he rose to speak he rather addressed the farmers of Western Australia than the members of this Chamber, and admitted at the time that he was so doing. Had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> only given me an opportunity of speaking before he did, I would probably have taken most of the sting out of what has been said to-day. I considered that the speeches which the honorable senator made to the farmers of Western Australia on the previous occasion were very wise. Because I considered them so, sounding as they did a note of caution, I made it my business particularly to draw the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harper,</inline> one of the managing directors of this concern, to them; and I have not the slightest doubt that they have been given considerable attention by the farmers of Western Australia, and have been in a measure responsible for the reconsidered proposition which is now before the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> insinuated that probably the Western Australian farmers were getting money out of the Federal Government on account of the influence exercised on the Government by Federal members. I wish to give that insinuation a denial, and at the same time to make a protest to the Government with regard to their actions in this matter. Until 6 o&#39;clock this morning, or thereabouts, I did not know that there had been any&#39; revision of the agreement. When the matter was first introduced into the Senate, I did not know it was in existence until the day before. I think that applies to every other Western Australian senator who is not in the Cabinet. </para>

                            <para>- Protests have been made in this Chamber, from time to time, that the Federal Government and the State Governments entirely ignore the existence of senators elected by the States for the especial purpose of looking after their interests. The Federal Government constantly ignore that fact, and so do the Governments  of  the States. Since I have been in this Parliament, I have not heard on a single occasion from the Government of Western. Australia, and, so far as this matter is concerned, although I went out of my way to let the farming people of Western Australia know that I was particularly interested in it, and requested them  to  keep me in touch with what was doing, the fact remains that until 6 o&#39;clock this morning I did not know that this thing had come about. </para>

                            <para>-  I know that other honorable senators have been ignored, and it would have served these people right if we had not been here to attend to this measure. Still that does not alter the fact that it is a very good scheme. The scheme itself I thoroughly approve, but the method of bringing it into existence I thoroughly disapprove. If, when the original scheme was introduced, honorable senators were prepared to advance the larger sum of money, I have no doubt that the point of view of most of them to-day , even of those who opposed it, will be similar to that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> and that they will be willing to grant the smaller sum, in spite of the fact that some of them originally granted the larger sum, with a certain amount of doubt. </para>

                    <para>SenatorPAYNE.- Yes. I am pleased that the Westralian farmers who are interested this scheme have been wise enough to approach the Federal Government for amendments such as are now beforeus,while at the same time retaining in the original Act the full power conferred by that Act with regard to the future extension of their scheme. But there is no amendment suggesting that the total amount which the Common- wealth may advance to the company shall be reduced. By clause 13 of the original agreement it is provided that the amount which maybe advanced by the Commonwealth shall not exceed &#163;550,000. </para>

We are now being asked to approve of relief being granted to the company with regard to the immediate raising of the capital, but at the same time the company retain the right to claim &#163;550,000 from the Commonwealth Government if they go on with the whole scheme, and if, in doing so, they raise the additional capital provided for in the original Act.

                            <para>- That being so, I have no opposition to offer. The company have gone the right way to work. It would have been foolish for them to undertake the liability of the proposed country silos if they are satisfied that the scheme can be successfully carried out in the immediate future by making silo provision at the terminal ports. I did not approve of the scheme originally, and am just as firm in my oppositiontotheCommonwealth dealing with private individuals or companies as I was last year. I believe the medium should always be the State Government, through which money may be lent bytheCommonwealth to the people of any State. </para>
