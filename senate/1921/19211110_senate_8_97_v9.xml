                    <para class="block">This Supply Bill, which was introduced yesterday, is for a total of £2,742,205. It  is  for ordinary services only, and does not contain provision for any items not already approved by Parliament. The amount asked for, in addition to the amounts provided in three Supply Bills already passed, provides for expenditure for November and part of December. Salaries are provided for up to and inclusive of the 9th December, and contingencies and other services generally up to the 20th December. The total amount provided by the three previous Supply Bills passed for the services of this financial year is £9,618,065, and the total appropriation under the four Supply Bills for this year is therefore £12,360,270. From this must be deducted interest and sinking fund payable to the British Government, £1,319,881 ; Treasurer's Advance, £1,750,000; and arrears of overseas mails, £200,000, making a total of £3,269,881. This leaves a total for ordinary items of £9,090,389. This amount is about £1,900,000 less than the proportion of the votes for the corresponding period of the last financial year. The present Supply Bill includes an additional £250,000 for the Treasurer's Advance, making the total in Supply £1,750,000, although only £1,500,000 has been provided for under this vote in the Estimates. It has been found impossible to avoid resort to this course on account of delay in passing the </para>

This condition will continue until the Bills now before Parliament for New Works and Loan Appropriation have been passed. When these Bills have been passed, the Treasurer's Advance will, of course, be relieved of the expenditure referred to.

I desire to ask the Minister in charge of the Bill' <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> what has been done in the direction of staffing the High Commissioner's Office with Australians ? During a discussion in the Victorian Parliament a few days ago, the statement was made that people seeking information in regard to the Commonwealth at Australia House come in contact with officials many of whom have never seen Australia. Would it not be practicable to staff Australia House with Australians possessing a knowledge of the conditions prevailing here, so that visitors and those intending to settle in the Commonwealth could obtain all the information they desire, instead of being misinformed, as is very often the case at present? </para>

I am sure the Government realize that this is most essential, particularly if they desire to achieve the object for which the expenditure is being incurred. It has been said by public men that it is quite a common occurrence for visitors to Australia. House to be passed from one official to another, many of whom do not know anything concerning Australia and its possibilities. Our products should be displayed in London to the best advantage, and the actual conditions obtaining here should be described by persons who are fully conversant with all the circumstances. </para>

                            <para>- Very few. I am sure the Government desire to achieve the very best results in this connexion, and I trust that immediate consideration will . be given to this phase of the question, particularly as the Government are now pursuing a vigorous immigration policy which will result in large numbers seeking information to which they are rightly entitled. If this expenditure in to be incurred, it is our duty to see that those visiting Australia House are supplied with reliable information when they desire it. </para>

                    <para>It is generally admitted that we need a great many more people in the Commonwealth; but great care should be exercised in seeing that those who come here are experienced rural settlers. I am not prepared to support any expenditure on immigration unless, it is in the direction of encouraging country workers, because it will be useless to bring out artisans and city workers, and thus assist in further overcrowding our metropolitan areas. </para>

                        <para>.- It ' was my intention to briefly refer to the points raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> in regard to the staff at Australia House, and our immigration policy. A few weeks ago, when travelling from Port Darwin to Brisbane on a vessel which had come from Singapore, I came into contact with probably over twenty men of a desirable type who had either been rubber planters, or had been managing rubber plantations in the East., On account of the severe fall in the price of rubber, and the suspension of operations on the plantations, they were turning their attention, to Australia. Many of them were well educated ex-Imperial officers, and were likely to 'prove desirable settlers. Some of them were wending their way towards Sydney, but I suggested that they should leave the vessel at Brisbane. I tried to persuade them to remain in Queensland, because of the great advantages that State enjoys over the more thickly-populated States of New South Wales and Victoria. There are more Crown lands available in Queensland". I communicated with the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> and with the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> asking whether something could be done for these men on arrival. The Government had been impressing upon us the desirability of encouraging immigration, and they were offering certain facilities in the shape of assisted passages from the Old Country. These men, however, were travelling at their own expense, and I could get absolutely nothing done for them by the Government. The only assistance rendered was that given by a private body, known as the New Setters League. I am not blaming <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullett</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mapleston,</inline> whom I saw in connexion with this matter, for the simple reason that they have no authority to assist people coming to Australia. I venture to say that those officers themselves do not know just where they stand. There has been no definite policy laid down so far in regard to immigration. I was under the impression that facilities for land settlement were available for ex-Imperial soldiers, the same as for our own returned soldiers. Our men, of course, have first preference; but I ascertained that the facilities for ex-Imperial service men had been cancelled, and that they were now entitled to no benefits under the Land Settlement Scheme. The men to whom I have referred informed me that in Singapore and other parts of the East it is impossible to obtain any information about Australia, although it is only a few days' sail from those countries. The men told me that they could secure particulars about openings for settlers in Canada, Rhodesia, and other parts of South Africa. When I pointed this out to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullett</inline> he agreed that it would be a good idea to have information concerning the Commonwealth made available in the East. There are hundreds of men in the East to-day who, on account of the failure of rubber, are turning their eyes towards Australia. Every boat from Singapore that calls at Port Darwin is bringing down a number of these planters. Some effort should therefore be made by the Immigration Department to meet these boats, and see that these men are welcomed to Australia. They would certainly make good settlers. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that if a member of Parliament approaches the Minister for Railways, a pass will probably be provided; but there is no general policy laid down. It seems deplorable that no information- is made available to these men, who are not only paying their own expenses, but are already acclimatized to the tropics, and have had a good deal of colonial experience. New South Wales is offering considerable facilities for ex-Imperial soldiers. </para>

Western Australia is, I think, shaping better than any other State in connexion with immigration. The Minister for Repatriation will probably remember the correspondence which took place concerning the men to whom I have referred, and I wish to know if he will give instructions that information be distributed in the East for the purpose of advertising Australia. </para>

I am confronted by a couple of responsible Ministers, and I wish to know when the Government are going to appoint a. High Commissioner, who is to be appointed to the position, and whether the appointment is to be made this year, next year, or never? What is the use of complaining of a lack of information in London when the people of Australia, and the members of the Australian Parliament, who are in touch with the Government, are kept in ignorance? If I drew a little on my imagination, I would say that the members of the Government party are in the dark on: this question.  I  might go even further and say that' the members of the Cabinet can get no information, on the matter from the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> The High </para>

                            <para>- There are a great many people who are anxious. We should be desirous of seeing the position either well filled or abolished. I do not believe in any half measures, especially at a time like the present, when there is urgent need for economy. If we can. do without a High Commissioner in London from April of this year up to the present time, why not abolish the office altogether, and save the cost ? I would much rather have no HighCommissioner at all if the office is not filled by a responsible head. The Government appear to treat this matter as if it were one concerning themselves alone, and one in which, the people of Australia had no interest. This is a most discreditable attitude on their part, and it is no credit to the Parliament that it should continue a day longer. I hope the Government will*, without further delay, take the public into their confidence. </para>

If, on the other hand, they do not intend to appoint him., then they have done him a grievous wrong, because for months he has been held up before the people of Australia as the gentleman who has been selected to- fill the position.

                            <para>- Of course they can. All doubts can: be set at rest by a plain statement from- the- head  of  the Government giving the name  of  the-  gentleman who is to receive the appointment, together with any reasons there may be for having withheld it for so long. It has been suggested, I know, that their position in the otherHouse is such that they cannot dispense with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook's services at the present time. But that is all nonsense. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burchell</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> could go to London, without affecting the position of the Government in another place, then <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook also could leave Australia to fill the position of High Commissioner in London. The delay and secrecy concerning the whole business are working an injury to the people of Australia, and to the gentleman whose name has been so frequently mentioned in connexion with the appointment. No one can accuse <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook of having given occasion for the circulation of any of these rumours about his projected appointment. The Government should take the people into their confidence. If <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook is not to receive the appointment, there should be a Ministerial statement at once to that effect in justice to the gentleman mentioned. Is it possible the Government are fishing for some other candidate? Is the position up for sale to the highest bidder ? </para>

                            <para>- I would not mind going to £3,000 a year for it. I am discussing this proposal from the point off view of the importance of the office. It should either be filled at once or abolished altogether. I do not know what Australia House costs, but, speaking from memory, I should say that it involves the Commonwealth in an expenditure of about £40,000 a year. If we can do without an official head for so long, then it is reasonable to assume that it could be done away with altogether. It might be said, of course, that we are represented by an Acting High Commissioner. That is quite true. That gentleman was appointed for six or eight months at an increase of £1,000 a year on his previous salary, and I presume that, pending the appointment of a new High Commissioner, the Government will be saving the official salary, but there should be none of this secrecy. It is possible, of course, that the Government are dangling the appointment as a bait to their followers - as an inducement to them to continue their support. Who knows how many people have been offered this post? </para>

Look at all the hope deferred, the prospective position in another sphere of parliamentary usefulness delayed, by the ineptitude of this Government, who say, apparently, "Oh, this High Commissioner business! What has Parliament to do with that? How does it concern the people of Parramatta ?" I find, however, that even the Nationalist party have called for nominations to fill the vacancy in the representation of Parramatta in another place, in the event of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook receiving the appointment, and, so far as my own party is concerned, well, on Saturday last we selected our candidate to contest the seat. </para>

In all seriousness, I ask the Minister to bring this question before his colleagues in Cabinet and have it finalized without further delay, or else, in the interests of economy, abolish Australia House as - at present constituted, and lease the premises to the State agencies, or any other tenant that may require them, thus saving Australia at least £40,000 a year. This is a reasonable proposition. There are only two courses open to the Government - either to make an appointment worthy of Australia and worthy of the position, or abolish the office altogether. </para>

                        <para>. - Listening to the earlier remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> I thought the Government had, perhaps, been really remiss; but before the honorable senator had sat down. I was furnished with reason to doubt whether I had not formed a. hasty judgment. This change of opinion was due to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> candid admission that, whether the Government did anything or nothing, it was his job to demonstrate, or, at any rate, to assert, that they were in the wrong. I take his remarks to be sincere and genuine, and I compliment the honorable senator upon this rather sudden outburst of unusual frankness. I suggest, however, that he possess his soul for a little longer in patience. The Government have not been as idle, as remiss, as he thinks. As&gt; for his comments concerning the " secrecy " of the Government, I can only say that that word was put to most unhappy and inappropriate use. Because a statement is not made concerning some specific matter the implication must not be accepted that secrecy is being observed thereon. The fact may be that there is nothing to tell. Are Ministers to be expected to announce each day, in the case of the Government doing nothing concerning a certain matter, that there is " nothing doing <inline font-style="italic">" 1</inline> It is time enough to talk of secrecy when the Government have committed some act, and have withheld the communication of it to the country. There can be no secrecy when there is nothing to tell. </para>

                            <para>- Can Australia afford to do without publicity, either in England or elsewhere, abroad ? The trouble with Australia is not that she is being advertised too much. I know of no country where there is. such an unfortunate tendency on the part of its inhabitants to criticise its institutions. During my recent visit to Europe, I met Americans who would reel out yards of figures to emphasize how great a country was theirs. When one got to know them more familiarly one would learn that they might have some doubts concerning certain of their public men and institutions; but, always to the stranger, these people from the United States of America took good care to convey the impression that everything was right with "God's own country." How can one be surprised that people overseas hold doubtful views concerning Australia in the light of the comments of Australia's own. sons resident abroad ? My most painful experience was to find that Australians living in London were Australia's sharpest critics. </para>

                            <para>- Both, and with equal freedom. But, in denouncing the Governments of the Commonwealth, they were depicting Australia as an undesirable place to live in. What is required of Australia House is its reorganization and not its abolition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> raised the question of what had been done there to bring about alterations in certain features which he regarded as undesirable. A great deal has been done. Upon setting out on my mission to England I was asked by the Government to examine the whole situation in order to learn what improvements could be effected. I came to the conclusion, after the first cursory glance into Australia House, that it would be idle to devise reforms and then return to Australia leaving to some one else the responsibility of carrying them out. The only man who can undertake effective reform in. Australia House is the official who is given charge and responsibility, the man whose duty and obligation it is to see to the performance of necessary alterations and improvements. It was. that view which I placed before the Government upon my return, and one. of the earliest duties- assigned to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd</inline> was that he should undertake a close investigation of the staff at Australia House, in order to learn how its work might be made more effective and valuable to the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> upon his recent return, made a public statement which, in its essence, was parallel to that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson.</inline> The Prime Minister stated that <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> was surprised and disappointed to find at Australia House a large number of' officials who had lost touch with Australia and its affairs. Steps are now being taken to see that the staff shall- be equipped to speak with the living voice1 of Australia; that is to say, with personal knowledge and experience- of conditions existing here in these times. That objective, however, cannot be brought about in a day. The changes and transfers must cover a somewhat lengthy period. At any rate, the whole position has to be recognised and appreciated by the Government. </para>

                    <para>With respect to immigration, I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> will not take exception to what I am. about to say, but it is a commonplace nowadays for one to assert that Australia needs immigrants but that they must be of the right type. Quite so! The trouble is not in getting men of the right type. The difficulty is at this end, in malting preparation for new citizens of the right type. There is no need to bother about securing them. If Australia were to hold up her hand in London she could gather, within forty-eight hours, more men of the right kind than she could ship out here and adequately provide for. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. But there must be some prior organization, developed and active, to receive and absorb immigrants upon reaching our shores. It is of no use to dump them down, either in our cities or in the bush, and tell them to go ahead and make a living. Preparation, and the right kind of preparation, must be made beforehand. The principal form of such preparation is by way of land settlement; but that is a matter which is fraught with difficulties. We look to land settlement for the absorption of the great majority of newcomers. But Australia is struggling to-day to- provide land for her comparatively few soldier settlers; these latter number, in all, about 30,000 men. </para>

                    <para class="block">Tremendous effort has been spent in adequately providing for the latter, and, because of the urgency of the task, it has. been carried out in somewhat more costly fashion than would have been the -case had more time been available. Further, with respect to land settlement, the whole undertaking is rendered more difficult because of divided authority between States and Commonwealth. That division constitutes a severe stumbling block. There are the States, with the land and with the land jurisdiction; and there is the Commonwealth, in control of immigration. The Federal Government have endeavoured - not without some measure of success- to agree upon a basis, with the States, for the inauguration of a system which appears1 to me to be the only safe and sound one, and by means of which it is hoped to maintain a. vigorous immigration policy. That is in the direction of developmental works associated with land settlement, thus placing ourselves in a position to honestly invite men to come and settle on Australia's soil. I would shrink from going on a platform in England to-day and asking men to journey to Australia., without capital, and without expectation or promise of  being  provided with land on which to establish homes and make a living for themselves and their families. There are many difficulties, with which honorable members are familiar, in settling people on the land. It is a difficult thing for men without money to get holdings in Australia. </para>

I agree that it is. In my judgment, after having studied the matter, the difficulties in the initial stages of settlement are greater in Australia than in other countries. The advantages after the first stile has been overcome are infinitely greater here. The difficulties in the initial stages are greater in Australia, for instance, than in Canada. Much less money will set a man on his feet there than here, although, after the first two or three years, the balance is all in favour of Australia. But it is of no use shutting our eyes to the fact that there are difficulties associated with land settlement in Australia. Those difficulties spell money. </para>

                            <para>- There is .no difficulty with the men who come here with capital. They can acquire holdings. I take it that when we talk of immigrants we are not so much thinking of that limited class, but of the larger class who are looking for financial assistance from the Government. Take the example of the settlement of our soldiers. I cannot speak definitely, but I venture to say that the cost has not been less than £2,000 per man, taking the value of the' land into account. How many settlers are we going to bring out on those terms ? <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers has said, " A million farms for a million farmers, at a cost of £30,000,000." That .amount of money would not pay their passages at the present moment. </para>

To attempt to bring a million, or even half a million, farmers out here in any short space of time would spell disaster. A lot of preliminary work has to be done. </para>

                            <para>- It is quite incorrect to say that Australia is getting no return for the money that is being spent on immigration. A considerable number of nominated immigrants are being assisted to come out here. They are nominated by their friends, who undertake to look after them when they arrive.  An appreciable number of these immigrants are coming to Australia, but nothing like the broad stream that we want. There is much to commend this system, because the immigrants come to personal friends, who take the responsibility of placing them in the industrial world. I merely indicate the view of the Government in the matter, that it is impossible successfully to bring people out to Australia unless some preparatory work is done before they arrive. </para>

                        <para>.- There is one phase of the immigration policy in relation to land settlement which I have wished for a long time that the Government would deal with. I refer to those companies which, in the different States, acquire large areas of land, which they cut up and boom, and on which they settle immigrants, who have absolutely no chance of success. There is one such company operating in Western Australia, which has recently attracted attention owing to its advertisements of the sale of land. I do. not want to criticise that particular proposition, or others of a similar nature. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so; but . I have seen other ventures with similar indications that have worked out very badly.' I know of a number of people who have come out to Australia, and gone on to settlements promoted in this way, who regretted that they ever saw Australia. I admit that the difficulties are great, from the point of view of the Government. If immigrants are brought to Australia, and by advertisement or other means are induced to take up blocks of land, they ought to be provided with some sort of Government certificate or Government recommendation on which they can rely. I would suggest that the Commonwealth, in conjunction with the States, might consider the introduction of such a scheme. I have in my mind one area that was cut up for orchard land, where, it was afterwards proved, there was never any possibility of the settlers succeeding. I know that as a result of this venture a number of people who otherwise would have come to Australia as good settlers were lost, and our fair name was dragged in the mud in two British-speaking countries, because of the bad deal the settlers received. I suggest that when large estates are being cut up, and offered under the terms and conditions that some of them have been offered, there ought to be an arrangement between the Commonwealth Government and the State Governments, which control the land, whereby an investigation would be made by the agricultural experts of the States, and a certificate given which would be a guarantee that the land offered to a prospective purchaser was what it was represented to be. There is one man in Melbourne who says that he is prepared to sell land adjoining the property that has been referred to in Western Australia for 10s. an acre. </para>

                    <para>SenatorFOSTER.- If the land adjoining the property in Western Australia can be acquired by the Government for 10s. an acre, and if people are settled on it and left to put on their own improvements, it would not be tremendously expensive to the Government, nor would it require a large capita] by the immigrant. If there are Crown lands unoccupied it should be the policy of the Governments concerned to see that they are made available for settlers before they are brought to this country. </para>

Millen must be well' aware that in New South Wales there are millions of acres of Crown lands available for settlement and which might be settled very easily and in a very economical way under a scheme operating over a series of years. It is not proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers that large sums of money should be spent in the repurchase of estates already privately held. Look at Renmark and Mildura as schemes of settlement. There are two settlements on our greatest river carrying thousands of families and paying handsomely. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know whether the British Government will accede to his request or will decline to do so, but assistance from the British Government is an essential feature of .his scheme. The scheme is sound enough, and there is no reason why the British Government should not co-operate with Governments in Australia for the settlement of British people in this country. I believe that the scheme can be carried to fruition. The land is there, and the money to carry out the scheme will be available if the British Government will stand in with Australian Governments. It should not cost the enormous sum to Australia which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen seems to imagine it will. We should give every encouragement to a scheme of that sort. We should not say that it is impossible, and content ourselves with pointing out the difficulties which must be overcome. Difficulties have had to be overcome in the carrying out of every big national project. In my opinion, every credit is due to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers and those associated with him in his great scheme for the work they are proposing to do, and the magnificent enterprise it is proposed to display. I wish them,'.personally, all kinds of good luck, as it would be entirely in the best interests of Australia should such a scheme bc carried out, even to half the extent of success which those supporting it desire. If we can get half-a-million settlers on half-a-million farms, or a quarter of a million settlers on a quarter of a million farms, under the scheme, "wh'6 will then .say that it is a failure ? The ideal is a magnificent one, and though it may fall short of complete accomplishment something well worth while may be done under it, and that will be infinitely better than doing nothing because of this and that difficulty in the way. That is not .the spirit in which to deal with the great question of immigration and land development in this country. We 'should have large ideals, and .should refrain from belittling those who are animated by large ideals. </para>

                        I am one of those optimistic Britishers and Australians who have a great faith in their country, but who, realize that at the present time we are living in a fool's paradise, because we are occupying one of the largest and richest countries on the globe with a handful of five and a half millions of people, and are not able to defend ourselves. We must realize that in other countries facing the Pacific there are hundreds of millions of people of other races jostling each other for elbow room who must by force of circumstances cast their eyes to unoccupied land such as this. The great menace to Australia, to the peace of the world, and to our Empire at the present time is the fact that Australia is dangerously large, rich and empty. It is therefore to be regretted that any honorable senator should, make remarks which, rightly or wrongly, might be construed by people outside to indicate that immigrants are to be induced tei come to this ' country who will not do1 well when they come here.

                        <para>- I agree with the Minister that a comprehensive scheme is essential. There must be co-operation  between, the Federal and State Governments, and the sooner that is brought about the better. I do not think it right to adversely criticise the splendid ideal of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers. I happen to be a. member of the New Settlers League, which' is doing good work in welcoming settlers to Australia, and also endeavouring ; to formulate some scheme in. support of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers' proposals to encourage those of our own race to come to this country. I maintain that the present Federal Government since the war lost, a golden opportunity in not having a scheme of, immigration and land settlement ready, and in not advertising the certainty of success to those who will try their lot in Australia. We know that hundreds of thousands of ex-service men have emigrated from the Old Country to foreign lands, and we have lost that stream of most desirable settlers whom we should have encouraged and welcomed with open arms. I was very glad to see from the press that a steamer arrived in Melbourne only to-day with 1,200 Britishers, and I welcome them heartily. I am glad, to say that the New Settlers League is doing very good work, and it should be encouraged by all who believe in our Empire. I do not see how we can continue to hold Australia unless we take immediate . steps to vastly increase our papulation. I agree that it i3 of no use to bring people here to stand about in the already overcrowded cities of Melbourne and Sydney. A comprehensive  scheme of land settlement and developmental work is essential. Provided that the money can be obtained at a reasonable rate, it does not matter how much we spend on reproductive works, especially in the conservation and distribution of water. By the locking of our great rivers we can throw open to settlement numerous valleys which will carry large numbers of settlers. I think that fruit-growing is overdone, but there are other forms of production in which settlers in the valleys of the Murray and Mumimbidgee might be engaged, and those valleys could accommodate a greater population than we have at present in the whole of' Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but the new settlers need not necessarily grow fruit. Mildura, is one of the finest object lessons in closer settlement to be seen in any part of the world. It is a town of unexampled prosperity and happiness. I may remind honorable senators that the annual increase of population of some of the countries bordering the. Pacific and occupied by coloured races is more than the total population of Australia at the present time. This discussion was started, I think, by a suggestion from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> that Australia should be better advertised than it is. There is no doubt that that is so. It has been my sad experience, in visiting other parts of the world, to find that there were quite a number of persons who did not knew where Australia was, and that was because we have not spent sufficient or spent it wisely, in advertising the Commonwealth and its vast resources. I support the suggestion that ex-Imperial service men should be allotted land on the same terms and conditions as are granted to ex-Australian soldiers, because in "Victoria, at present, there is a surplus of suitable land. Only the other day the Closer Settlement Board threw open for allotment, sixty blocks on the Mount Bute estate), and fifty blocks on the Mount "Violet estate, making 110 blocks in all, only twenty of which, were taken up. </para>

                            <para>- No; the price was right. In Victoria, at least", the demand by ex-soldiers has been more than satisfied, and efforts should, therefore, be made to allot land to ex-imperial , service men on conditions similar, to those offered to our own men. The other day some land was offered at Pura Pura, in- the Western District, and a number, of returned soldiers travelled by train with the intention of inspecting it. A. drag  was supplied to convey them to the spot; but when they alighted at the railway station a gale of wind was blowing, and the men asked the stationmaster if it always blew like it was blowing that day? The official informed them that it was a very windy place, and the men returned without even inspecting the land. It would appear that they were out merely for a " joy ride." Land is available for grazing and wheat-growing; but areas suitable for dairying are not easily procurable, because the dairying industry is very prosperous at present. As the demand for land in Victoria has been largely met, I cannot see any reason why ex-Imperial service men should not be allowed to secure blocks under the conditions I have mentioned. </para>

                            <para>- I know that. The ex-Imperial service men have fought for the Empire just as our own men have, and they should be considered and allowed to settle here under favorable conditions. This question has been discussed by the New Settlers' League, and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> dealt with the matter in an able manner last night. Every honorable senator realizes the grave danger of holding such a rich land, possessing great possibilities, and which is sparsely populated. The Mother Country has protected us for 150 years. Britons discovered _ Australia, and Great Britain has peopled and financed it. Until recent years, we have been depending- on Britain; but now we are led to believe that the Mother Country can no longer assist us, because she has been bled white, in consequence of the terrible war, and cannot now maintain a supreme fleet. It is only right, therefore, that we should do all we possibly can to encourage the people of our own race to settle in this great country, because if we do not do that we cannot hope to hold it, and we will be judged by others as being unworthy of such an inheritance. </para>

It is just as well to realize that the difficulties which may be experienced in connexion with an extensive policy of immigration occurred in the early days at Renmark and Mildura. Those who are acquainted with the position will recall that in both instances the Government were appealed to, and I believe that in the case of Renmark, South Australia had to pay, approximately, £200,000 to assist the settlement in the early days. It is quite feasible to believe, provided the funds are available, that .a. large number of people can be settled in the Commonwealth ; but it is impossible to do&gt; it without the expenditure of a very large sum of money. We would be very ill-advised if we launched out on an immense immigration scheme which had not sufficient financial backing to insure its success. </para>

We have only to revert to the early history of the places that are lauded to-day to find that the statement of the Minister is amply confirmed. I do not suggest that closer settlement at these places should not have been undertaken, or that they have not been a great success. We had similar experiences in connexion with the village settlements along the River Murray, which have been held up as shocking examples; but they paved the way for the present success that has been achieved in connexion with the irrigation schemes along the Murray. </para>

                            <para>- The conditions are not what they used to be, and I can look back many years and recall the day when settlers in one of the healthiest and most prosperous districts in Australia made a success of their undertakings after overcoming numerous obstacles. I can remember the case of a settler who took his family 300 miles from Adelaide in a covered spring dray; which held all his belongings. Immediately he arrived at his destination he started to work, and in less than twelve months rented a section of land from a farmer who was settled there, and who was unable to cultivate the portion he leased. The area was taken up by the new settler under a deferred-payment system, and he had to fence and clear a certain area in five years. He had no capital on which to operate, and was compelled to work elsewhere, whilst others cultivated the land for him. He continued for five years, and in that time had earned sufficient to purchase land elsewhere for himself. That is not done to-day. </para>

                            <para>- What I have mentioned was done in the early pioneering days; but that is not the practice at present. It appears to be the« policy to establish a man on a well-stocked, up-to-date farm with a modern plant and a commodious dwelling. The demand now is for men to be established on the land on an altogether different basis, and if we are to bring people from England to take up farm work with all the privileges now expected we shall have to shoulder a very big responsibity. </para>

                        <para>. -  I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that if there is good country available in Victoria, with a reasonable rainfall, and the returned soldiers do not want it, South Australia, will be very pleased to oblige him with a few of its returned soldiers who are still anxious to settle on the land. It is useless to bring men from the Old Country simply for the purpose of peopling Australia. Australia must be developed on agricultural lines. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D.</inline> Millen) has told us that the Commonwealth scheme has been turned down, but the Government should not be afraid to make a second attempt at solving the problem. It is important to remember that a returned soldier must have an up-to-date plant, and good stock, if he is to make a success of farming. It is useless to start him off with  two or three old horses and a number of indifferent cows. When men take up land in our outside country they must have big areas, and a good banking account. If they are to make good, it is essential to have a fair rainfall, land of good quality, and capital. I believe that in South Australia it is reckoned that a sum in the vicinity of £3,000 is necessary to start a man on a. farm. One of the difficulties throughout the country districts is to secure farm labour. It is almost impossible to get domestic help, without which it is unreasonable to expect women to rear families, and submit to the drawbacks of country life. It seems to me that if we could provide a sufficient number of domestic helpers that would go a long way towards increasing production. </para>

                        <para>. - I protest against any remarks of mine being interpreted as decrying Australia, belittling its possibilities, or introducing a note of pessimism. I yield to no one in my belief in this country, but we should not rush after a flighty ideal without recognising the practical difficulties in the way of its attainment.I ask the Committee to realize that we have been talking of immigration in Australia for fifty years. We have spoken of filling our empty spaces, and getting the right type of people, but we have done practically nothing, for the simple reason that we have not made preparation for immigrants before inviting them to come out. I ask. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> to say, from his practical experience, what sum is necessary for the equipment on small holdings of the various classes of farmers whom he has in mind. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; and as the majority of the people coming here must be men with very little capital, it means that we shall have to find money for them., if we are to settle them on the land. If we bring them out from England without giving them, some preparation for rural life, we run a tremendous risk. They must be financed and acclimatized. It means time, organization, and money. That is what we are trying to do under the arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States. It is best for us to dispense with slogans, and get down to bedrock, as an individual would do in prosecuting his own business. I ask honorable senators to accept my assurance that I believe they are behind me in this matter; but many of them, who are not from rural districts, do not see- the opportunities as I do. I notice them everywhere, but, standing between the opportunities and the men we wish to invite to Australia, is the one need - preparatory work and capital. If we grapple with this question successfully we can ask people from overseas to become citizens of this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> has asked me what period is covered by the contribution to the cost of the Secretariat of the League of Nations. It is not possible to give the period, because the accounts do not come in quite regularly, but the sum of £9,000 represents about four months under the old scale. A scale more favorable to Australia has been adopted, and it will make our contribution less in future. The item " Shipping and Mail Service to the Pacific Islands, £12,000 " represents a period of three months. </para>

                        <para>. - I think all honorable senators are endeavouring to do away with the duplication of services, particularly in regard to the collection of taxes. Some people seem pleased that the Taxation Office in Western Australia has been abolished, and that in future the Federal Government will collect both the State and Federal taxes there. After I had spoken on the Budget the other day, the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> paid me the compliment of replying to one or two of my statements, but he omitted to take notice of what I regarded as the most important one. I quoted a statement made by the Premier of South Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barwell)</inline> some time ago, giving a comparison between the State Taxation Office in South Australia and the Federal Office there. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barwell</inline> said that in the Federal Office there were more than twice as many officers, and the cost of the Department was considerably more than twice that of the South Australian office. I noticed a statement reported in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> some days ago by  the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ritchie),,</inline> who amplified what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barwell</inline> had said. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ritchie</inline> stated that in the Federal Taxation Office in Adelaide there were 156 officers, and they collected something like £639,211, while in the State Taxation Office there were only 40 officers, and they collected £662,324. That means that- there are practically four times as many officers in the Commonwealth. Taxation Office in Adelaide as there are in the State office. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but I think that the experience of the Commonwealth has been a very painful one. I am glad to know that, in the majority of cases, the payment of the maternity allowance has afforded valuable aid to the mother and child, but in a large number of cases, the minority it is true, it has been paid to people in comfortable circumstances, and who have no need whatever of any assistance of this nature-. I. am. not opposed to the principle of giving assistance in cases where it is needed. If this £5, which is paid on the advent of every new immigrant to Australia, is not sufficient to meet the needs of any particular case, I would advocate making the amount £10. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator would be quite right if, by the expenditure of that extra money upon the advent of so many more good Australian immigrants, we could also guarantee a reduction of infantile mortality. In such, circumstances it would be money well spent. I am opposed to the payment of this allowance irrespective of whether the recipients require assistance or not for the child. At present it is paid without discrimination. The intention of the Act waa to insure proper medical care and attention for the mother and child, but when it is paid to people in comfortable financial circumstances it is not serving its true purpose. Why should I, as one individual in the community, have to put my hand into my pocket and help to pay a maternity allowance to people who have no need of this assistance? I know it has been said that any attempt to confine the payment of this allowance to certain sections of people only would mean an inquisitorial investigation into the circumstances of the applicant. But do those who raise this objection forget that every application for an old-age or invalid pension means an inquisitorial investigation in order that the Department may be assured that the income of the applicant does not exceed a certain amount, and a very small sum at that? If it is fair for an inquiry to be made concerning any application for a pension, what objection can there be to a similar investigation prior to the payment of a maternity allowance? I want to make my position quite clear. I am not standing as an opponent to the continuance of the bonus. I am an advocate of its continuance, and, if necessary, I would have it made more liberal in certain cases. But I am not an advocate of its payment to people who do not need it. I think that the whole matter should be thoroughly investigated.  We might get better results by making portion of the money available for the maintenance of some bush nursing scheme or the establishment of clinics, which might be helpful to the mother and child, and in necessitous cases it might be advisable to pay a sum exceeding £5. I am entirely opposed to the payment of this allowance for all time to people who have plenty of this world's goods, and, therefore, have no need to dip into the pockets of the taxpayers, and take something with which, perhaps, to buy a present for the mother or child. We should see to it that the mother and child get the requisite attention, and endeavour, so far as possible, to reduce the infantile mortality rate. I intend, on every opportunity that presents itself, to protest against a continuance of the present system. There is more than .a modicum of truth in the statement that practically every mother claims the bonus to-day. There are,  I  believe, a few exceptions, but the great bulk of those who are well able to meet all maternity expenses lodge their claims with the rest, and receive it. This is not in accordance with the principle underlying the proposal. </para>

                        <para>. - Upon the payment of maternity allowances, I differ somewhat from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne.</inline> From what I have been told by persons who are closely in touch with those mothers who are really in necessitous circumstances, and whom the bonus was intended to benefit, it is clear that the intention of the Act is not being carried out. Instead of the bonus being earmarked for the special benefit of the mother and child at lie birth of the child, in the majority of cases it is devoted to other needs.' For example, 'the husband, if he happens to be a drunken waster, gets it and spends it. It seems to me that the administration of the Act requires radical review. In no circumstances should the actual cash be handed over to the applicant. The Act ought to be administered in such a way as to insure proper medical attention for the mother and child at the birth, and there should be some provision for clothing for the child, I noticed in a report of the Children's Hospital the other day that, notwithstanding the payment of the maternity allowance to all mothers, some of the children have been taken from the hospital with a piece of old blanket wrapped around them, and exposed to a tram ride in bitterly cold weather, with the result that pneumonia frequently supervenes and results in the early death of the child. I therefore suggest to the Government that it should be disbursed through some organization which will insure that the amount of the bonus is properly spent, and that its benefits reach the proper destination. So long as the Act remains in force as it exists at present I shall not quarrel with the distribution of the bonus, no matter what may be the positions of those who apply for it. The bonus was offered deliberately to all, without distinction. The nature of that provision was, in my opinion, wrong. It should have been limited to mothers in necessitous circumstances. A change should be made in that direction, and also the distribution should be through some charitable or philanthropic organization which could furnish, in each instance, medical attention to mother and child, and any other necessary assistance at the time. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Commonwealth authorities have organized, and are running a concern known as the New Guinea Trade Agency, which has its head Australian office in Sydney. I wish to know if the reply furnished to-day means that the business being conducted by that Government agency is to be sold by tender to private concerns in the Commonwealth. The agency is purchasing the whole of the supplies required by the Government Departments and by the returned soldier settlers and other residents who may order Australian articles, and it is also selling in Australia the products of the Territory of New Guinea. I have had an opportunity to inquire into the ramifications of the agency, and I can say that, while there is a great deal to commend it in its work, and while I have nothing to say against the manner in which it is being conducted, particularly seeing that the agency is making thousands of pounds per annum, with the promise of its developing into one of the most prosperous trading concerns with which the Government are associated, limitations are being placed upon its activities, so that it is materially handicapped. The agency sells the copra, which is the principal product, and the money is remitted to the Territory. </para>

                            <para>- Only this week I saw a contract in respect of sales of copra, and the net price was £21 odd. Copra is bought and sold in Sydney at world's parity prices1. One would suppose that the Government, having appointed an officer, and having made him responsible for the sale of the whole of the produce- of the Mandated Territories, would undertake that he should be kept in touch with the world's prices. The truth is, however, that if the manager wants to ascertain the parity he has to go to the only competitor of the Government, so far as copra is concerned - I refer to Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company - in order to ascertain the price. And his position is rendered the more unhappy in that this firm is frequently the one with which he is conducting a sale. </para>

                            <para>- My references are to the Territory, or Territories, for which the agency purchases its requirements. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Neill</inline> makes very considerable purchases, and that the agency is placed in such circumstances that it often has to pay very much higher prices than necesssary.  That, I repeat, is due entirely to the system under which it is worked. It is not fair to the agency or to the officer in charge. The concern is making  thousands of pounds per annum for the Government, but it would be possible for it to give still better results if conducted along lines of commercial intelligence and common sense. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to impress on the Government the vital necessity of hastening a pronouncement of policy with respect to the Mandated Territories. There are, to my knowledge, several parties of ex-soldiers who have been waiting for eight months and longer for permission to proceed to the Territories to prospect their timber and other resources. Certain promises that were held out to them, led them to believe that the policy of the Government would be definitely pronounced soon. Time has gone on, and they are sick, tired, and disgusted with the whole thing. The delay has given opportunities for other people to float companies. I know of one company which holds out definitely to proposed shareholders that the promoters have been to the Territories and have spied out the  land. In the usua I manner of prospectuses, fortunes are promised to those who subscribe. </para>

                            <para>- I think the Minister will find that information in an answer given to a question asked in the Senate to-day. The Minister has definitely pronounced that the companies have no concession. That may put a spoke in their wheel. It is necessary for the protection of the public, and for the encouragement of the returned soldiers, who are anxious to pioneer the country, that the Government's policy should be pronounced as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>. -  To pronounce .the Government's policy is not quite so easy as the honorable senator may imagine. I have 'had a staff working on ten Ordinances for at least the last three months. For the past fortnight, "because of circumstances over which the Government has no control - a want .of confidence motion in the other House - no public business has been done. The Ordinances are complete, and are awaiting only Cabinet's approval. In regard to the criticisms put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> the Commonwealth Government took over the stores in the Mandated Territories. The position in Papua, I think, is different; it is under the control of the Home and Territories Department. When the Government took over the stores in the Mandated Territories, it found an army of fleecers putting up the prices. Practically two merchants in Sydney did all the business in Government stores. The Government stopped them, as any honest Government ought to have done. It established its own wholesale buying agency. At that time no population was allowed to go there, and the Government had to carry the responsibility of feeding the army. When the Government took over the stores it was itself a victim of the people who charged excessive prices. </para>

                        who is temporarily in Rabaul. The action of the Government has effected a wonderful improvement; goods of a- better quality have since been obtainable at a cheaper price. For what has been done, I, as the Minister administering that branch, take the full responsibility. I know nothing of the position in Papua. Statements have 'been made that certain companies were allowed to be formed. I do not know of any company that was .permitted to be formed. They have been prohibited from forming until the time when every man will get an equal opportunity. ' The mining Ordinances are ready subject to approval, which should be granted in a few days. Then all people will nave an opportunity to go to the Territory of New Guinea and engage in mining under equal conditions. The Government has been particularly hard and rough on the man who wanted tr- get in in advance. There are keener men than returned soldiers in Australia who desire to get in first. The Government wants to be able to say to every man and every woman that all will have an equal chance. I do not want to commit 'the Government definitely, but I think that, in a fortnight or three weeks, the Territory will be ready for occupation. The Ordinances will include every form of activity. I do not think they will deal with oil.

                        <para>.- I would like to take this opportunity to refer to a document which was laid on the .table of the Senate yesterday, and was reported in the press as 'being explanatory of the Defence Estimates. It sets forth, amongst other things, that the Defence Department is establishing a research factory, and is going to spend a large amount of money in that direction and on ordnance stores. I would like to ask whether this Supply Bill commits senators in any way to that policy, or whether the Department will wait until the Estimates have been before Parliament and formal approval of the Government's policy has been obtained. </para>

                        <para>. - As I understand it, the complaint arises because of the inconvenient times at which the South Australian Government ran their trains. This caused a difficulty in handling the mails. When the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> returned from England he had to remain in Perth for 24 hours, because there was no train connecting with the boat. The train should depart within an hour or two of the arrival of the mail boat. I do not think the honorable senator is acquainted with the whole of the facts. The Government is trying to remedy the difficulty, so that mails will not be held up for 24 hours or more in Fremantle. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems to me that this clause will put the Board entirely in the hands of the head of the Department. The Board, having gone through the Department carefully and come to the conclusion that a certain officer is inefficient, incompetent, or incapable of discharging the duties of his office, will be absolutely helpless to get rid of him if the head of the Department does not choose to report to the Board that he is inefficient. That is certainly not desirable. If the Board is to have any power to make improvements in the Service, it must be permitted to form its own judgment of the capacity or incapacity of officers, and to dispense with their services if they are incapable. </para>

                        <para>- Unquestionably it should be the duty of the head of a Department to report any incompetent officer to the Board; but there is no use in saying that the Board shall not get rid of an incompetent man unless the -head of the Department has first reported his incompetency. The Board should be able to get rid of him whether the head of the Department reports his incompetence or not. Under the clause the Board may not move in such a matter unless a report from the chief officer has previously been received. If the clause were amended as I suggest, that should not relieve the head of a Department of the duty of reporting an incompetent officer. If the Board is to be anything more than mere " eyewash " and something proposed to appease a public demand, it must be given power to take action without waiting for a report from the head of a Department. </para>

                    <para>. - I have had brought under my notice the possibility of a public servant suffering injustice if the clause is permitted to remain as it stands. . It has been pointed out to me, that if the Board find that an officer is inefficient, he may be dismissed from the Service, or may be reduced to a lower grade. If his reduction to a lower grade, carrying a lower salary, should take place within a year or two of his having reached the age of retirement, he might lose very heavily. It is possible that his inefficiency might be due to no fault of his own. All men do not retain their mental vigour for the same period. One man may be as mentally competent at sixty as at fifty years of age, whilst another at fifty-five years of age may have lost much of his mental vigour. It is suggested that where a man has been reduced to a lower grade, because of inefficiency due to no fault of his own, he should, on retirement, have to his credit the term he served in a higher grade. </para>

There are ample restrictions to prevent any abuse of this privilege; and, as it is necessary, in the interests of the Department, to allow representatives sufficient time in which to do this work, I trust the Committee will agree to the amendment.

Why a limitation of twelve months should be imposed, and the matter left to the discretion of anybody, I do not know. If any officer is called up under the Defence Act, he must serve in the Forces, and for the whole of the period leave should automatically be granted. If we ever had another war, which necessitated an Expeditionary Force being sent out of Australia, a provision identical with this should apply. We know that the Defence Act does not contemplate men being called up for service abroad, but provision should be made for any person joining an Expeditionary Force, authorized by Parliament, to be granted leave of absence as a matter of course, without the leave having to be sanctioned by any other authority.

                        <para>- There is a great deal of difference. Whatever an officer receives in lieu of, or in addition to, salary is pay. Salary would be the total amount received in cash, but pay includes certain privileges which are taken into consideration as part of an officer's remuneration. Salary simply means the cash payment for services rendered. An officer does not receive salary if he is on sick pay. In many instances officers receive so much in salary, and also allowances in the form of fuel and light. </para>

                        <para>- No. The allowances are part of the pay. A postmaster in South Australia prior to 1900 received so much salary and quarters, as well as light and fuel. He got a certain commission on money received, by him on behalf of the State Savings Bank. Those additional amounts were not part of the direct salary. I want the privileges, which go to make up the salary, to be counted as pay. </para>

                        <para>- That is an entirely different question. I am glad to know that the Government purpose reviewing them from time to time; but while cost of living allowances are being paid, they should be regarded as salary. This is the position : Public servants were in receipt of a certain pay under normal conditions, and during the war the Government, believing that they should receive a fair salary in order to live decently, authorized the payment of allowances to meet the higher cost of living. What is the difference? If a man is paid £168 per annum, plus £62 per annum cost-of-living allowance, he gets £230 per year for certain services rendered to the Commonwealth. i maintain that, actually, he is in receipt of a salary of £230 per year. The Minister may call it what he likes - pay, salary, or allowances. a caretaker of a public building receiving £200 a year, with house, fuel, and lighting free, is in a totally different category. When he is on furlough, he is still entitled to the use of the house and the enjoyment of the other privileges mentioned. That is where i differ from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior.</inline> Those allowances should not be taken into account; but where the cost-of-living allowance is really equivalent to an increase in salary to meet the abnormal conditions of the times, it should be taken into consideration when furlough is granted, because a member of the Public Service on furlough still has to maintain his wife and family. Therefore, he should suffer no deduction. i take it that the good sense of the Committee will accept this interpretation of the term "salary". </para>
