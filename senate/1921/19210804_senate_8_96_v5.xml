            <para>- The answers are - 1-5. The Army Legal Department will consist of officers serving in the Citizen Forces not exceeding in number seven lieutenant-colonels,  fifteen majors, and eighteen captains distributed throughout the Commonwealth attached to the various formations. The duties will extend to an equivalent of, approximately, sixteen days a year, which is the ordinary duration of the annual training of the Citizen Forces. Each member will receive the ordinary Citizen Force pay of his rank for not more than sixteen days each year, namely, lieutenant-colonel &#163;30, major &#163;24, and captain &#163;18, on the satisfactory performance of duty. The total annual expenditure will not exceed &#163;894. </para>

          <para>The duties of members of the legal section will be instructional, advisory, and executive. They will be required to instruct officers of the Forces in military law and their duties in the administration of discipline - instruction of great importance, the lack of which in the past was greatly felt during the earlier period of the late war. </para>
          <para>The members of the legal section will also instruct and advise in matters relating to the administration of the Act and regulations especially in regard to the institution of proceedings under the Act in civil Courts for offences by defaulting trainees. They will also advise formation commanders and other convening and confirming authorities on legal questions affecting courts martial. </para>

              <para>It is difficult to submit an estimate, but it is not anticipated that the numbers will be large.

            <inline font-weight="bold">.- Senator Earle&#39;s</inline>proposal seems to be a necessary one, because those engaged in apple-growing occupy a difficult position each year in regard to the marketing of their best fruit, especially that which has to be sent overseas. Difficulties have been experienced for years in securing space in order that the best grade of apples may be shipped to the Old Country. That top grade, however, does, not constitute the whole of the crop, and it is essential that fruit-growers should be given every opportunity to realize upon the remainder, which does not go upon the market through the ordinary channels - that is to say, by being shipped overseas, or to other States. A considerable portion of the crop is composed of apples which, although good and wholesome, do not come under the category set out by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell).</inline> He may have seen a few windfalls among apples which had been evaporated. But there are large quantities which, owing to lack of size and attractive colourings, are also evaporated. Tasmanian orchardists have not had an easy time for years past. One reason has had  to  do with the difficulty of securing shipping space for the export of the best  apples, and another reason concerns the enormous additional cost of all accessories. The cost of labour, too, has gone up very considerably. In view of the fact that evaporation is a new phase of the fruit-growing industry, Parliament should give it every possible encouragement. Even if the orchardists&#39; disabilities were to become no more severe than during the past few years, he would have enough to do to make both ends meet; but, unfortunately, his prospects have been made even less attractive within the &#39;past few days. There has been brought under my notice a new log which has been served upon the orchardists of Tasmania. I shall quote a few items to demonstrate the need for substantial encouragement by means of the Tariff. </para>

            <para>- I have vivid recollections of a log, the rates of which have been imposed within the past twelve months, without any reduction, and which was made retrospective. The log just served upon the orchardists bears the signature of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grayndler,</inline> secretary of the Australian Workers&#39; Union. The rate of wage set out for carters is &#163;6 a week; for male or female packers, if sixteen years of age or over, &#163;5 10s. a week; and, if under sixteen years, &#163;4 5s. With respect to the process of evaporation, employees engaged in fruit-cutting and pitting are set down to receive a wage of &#163;5 10s. a week for any male or female over sixteen years of age, and &#163;4 5s. per week for- those under sixteen. I consider that the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> may be reasonably accepted. </para>

            <para>- That estimate is too low. Five lbs. of evaporated apples equal one case of green apples. Other lines of dried fruits possess a much higher value per lb. when placed on the market, and that is why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has suggested a slightly higher rate of duty upon dried apples. He reasonably contends that the Protection for which he is asking&#39; is only equal to that which has been afforded under the Tariff in connexion with other varieties of dried fruit. </para>

          <para>.-Some of the difficulties of orchardists have been already mentioned. There is this consideration to be added, namely, that the further &#34;the fruit-grower lives from his local market, the more waste there is. The waste fruit must be made use of in some way, if possible, and the only means is by desiccation or drying. Some people, unacquainted with fruit-growing, regard the windfall &#39; as utter waste. The apple tree does not bloom all over at the same. time. The. earliest blossoms provide the first ripe fruit. These are usually the largest apples, and, very often, before the main crop is ripe these large apples fall. Orchardists situated many hundreds of miles away from an ordinary market should have a means of profitably disposing of their product instead of offering it for sale at whatever may be offered. In a number of districts returned soldiers are engaged in fruit-growing, and unless they can dispose of the fruit that is not saleable in the ordinary way considerable hardship and loss will be incurred. The only opportunity orchardists have of disposing of the fruit which is otherwise unsaleable is by drying it. At certain periods of the year dried fruits arrive from overseas and compete with that placed on the market by the local growers; and it is for that reason I intend to support the request, in an endeavour to assist orchardists. During recent years, conditions have altered considerably, as the cost of labour, as well as the price of implements and materials used in drying fruit, have considerably increased. Those engaged in agricultural pursuits know that bluestone, which is used for pickling wheat, and which is also used by orchardists in spraying, has almost trebled in price during recent years. The cost of nitrate of soda, potash, and superphosphate is also much higher than it was a few years ago. If the orchardists  are to carry on successfully they will have to be given every consideration and assistance in making their undertakings successful, and by supporting the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> we shall be helping them. </para>

            <para>- Not if there is a market, because it necessarily pays better to sell them in the ordinary way. In the process of evaporating or drying fruit about 90 per cent, of the weight is lost, and the grower receives only about 4 lbs. of dried fruit from each case of apples after they have been peeled, sliced, and pored. Dried apples have been selling at about 8d. or 9d. per lb., so it will be seen that the actual return, on the basis of 8d. per lb., after paying for labour, would be 2s. 8d. per case. I know of no other dried fruit consumed in Australia that is cold cheaper than evaporated apples, and (he price does not provide a sufficient margin to those who are engaged in the industry.

            <para>- Probably so. The fruit-growers are usually shareholders in drying companies, and if they receive a return of 9d. per lb. it is equal to about only 3s. per case after incurring all the expense of drying. I cannot conceive of any commodity which deserves more protection than this one. </para>

          <para>. - I intend to approach the consideration of this matter with  a  certain amount of sympathy, because I realize the difficulties with which the fruit-growers have to contend. But if the Committee, in its wisdom, is going to increase the duty on evaporated apples by Id. per lb., we shall be in an illogical - position in regard to other dried fruits. Currants, raisins, and sultanas, which are small fruits, are dutiable to the extent of 3d. per lb., and in another place a separate sub-item has been inserted under which prunes are dutiable at 4id. per lb. In the course of my varied experiences, I have been interested in apple drying, and there is no doubt that apples that cannot be sold as fresh fruit are used for drying purposes. In America and in Canada the best fruit is marketed for ordinary consumption, and the balance is saved by drying. If a grower receives 2s., 2s. 6d., or 3s. per case for the inferior portion of his crop, that is a saving, because, until the evaporating or dryin industry was established under a fairly high Tariff, inferior apples were usually wasted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has said that it requires. 9 or 10 lbs. of apples to produce 1 lb. of dried fruit, and those figures may be accepted as approximately correct. Another phase of the question which has to be considered is that there is about Id. per lb. duty on fresh apples, and, to be consistent, there should be a duty of more than 3d. per lb. on dried apples. </para>

            <para>- That is so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has moved to increase the duty on dried apples, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> to increase the duty on dried summer fruits, such as peaches, apricots, pears, and nectarines. I cannot possibly vote for an increase of these duties if the duty on currants and raisins is to remain as it K To do so would be most illogical. Later on we may have some one proposing an increase in the duty on preserved ginger by Id. per lb. If these separate articles are dealt with in the way proposed, the Tariff on dried fruits generally will be a most illogical one. I  suggest that we should have a test division to decide whether the item shall remain as it is, or whether there shall be a rise of1d. per lb. all round on these dried fruits. </para>

I would point out to both these honorable senators that by increasing these duties by 33 per cent., as they propose, they will be penalizing, not the people of the cities, who are able to obtain fresh fruit, but people outside, who require these commodities to vary a diet which is by no means palatable. On the question of values, I find from today&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> that the wholesale price of dried apples is 9&#189;d. per lb., and where the article is put up in boxes it is ls. per lb. I find, from earlier files of the same newspaper, that the price of currants c.r. is 9&#189;d. per lb., and that of a special variety a little more. The price of sultanas is a little higher. </para>

            <para>- It was because the article was so superior to that turned out by private enterprise that it could beat competition from any other part of the world. Sydney grocers were retailing these preserved peaches at11&#189;d. per tin, and they were purchased by speculators at 14d. per tin for sale outside Australia in competition in the world&#39;s markets. New South Wales producers of these goods do not need any of these sham helps. I do not desire to see the products of New South Wales dragged down to the level of those that require protection from the Tariff. The State I represent does not require additional taxation on these kinds of fruit. Fruit is dried in New South Wales by the most advanced and up-to-date processes, and the products can more than hold their own with those produced in any other country of the world. And whom shall we handicap but the families living outback? The people who live a long way from the markets and to whom the growers do not send fresh fruits are the biggest consumers of dried and tinned fruits. If we increase these duties we shall make their conditions of living a little harder than they are. I protest against New South Wales being listed amongst those States which want to be assisted by the rest of Australia. </para>

            <para>- I am merely referring to other products similar to the item under consideration. There is not much difference between dried apples and dates. The Minister might as well have supported his argument by quoting the fruit we have exported during the last twelve months. We have entered into competition with fruit-growers on the other side of the world. Tasmanian apples have a world-wide reputation, but New South Wales grows better fruit. The apples produced at Bathurst and Orange are superior to any grown in any other part of the Commonwealth, and they are so much in demand that they never get beyond Sydney Harbor. Our fruits are holding their own in all parts of the world, and we desire to develop trade with other countries, not to cut it off. We cannot expect Britain and America to buy our apples unless we buy goods from them. Some people are afraid that American dried apples may force ours off the market. I could quote a circular by fruit-growers pointing out that a duty on citrus fruits is of no help to apple-growers. They require the duty taken off the implements which they use for growing their apples, and the materials with which they combat the pests. The codlin moth and other pests are nothing in comparison with what this Tariff will be.  It  will drive people off&#39; the land, because there is no remedy for it. The codlin moth can be destroyed by spraying, . and the grower can take precautions against aphis, but I know of no remedy for the Tariff unless it be the eradication of the Government responsible for it. The independent fruit-growers of New South Wales, who bring their intelligence to bear upon their industry, are not asking for the support of the rest of Australia. </para>

          <para>. -  The remarks &#34;of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> in regard to New South Wales fruit-growers, if taken at their face value, might prove extremely dangerous to the fruit-growing industry. He has referred to the fact that twelve or eighteen months ago speculators were buying up canned fruit for export to London. Not only was fruit canned by the Government being bought up, but also the fruit canned by everybody else, because the prices in London were so abnormally high that the speculator could make a profit by buying up the Australian supplies and shipping them to London. Another point is that the canning of fruit by Government enterprise at Yanco has resulted in a huge loss that is computed at six figures. And there are 4,000,000 tins of canned .fruit in the Government cannery at Yanco for which no sale can be found, either in Australia or abroad. With the imminent possibility of a return to pre-war conditions in regard to dried fruit, with Greece again coming into the market and the American surplus available for export to Australia, our fruit industry, without adequate duties upon fruits of all sorts, will be in a very much worse position, than it is to-day, and goodness knows it is bad enough. The canneries are stocked with goods that they cannot sell, and the Government have given advances that may never be realized. In order to give protection to the fruit growing industry and fair play to the growers, I would prevent even a pound of fruit being imported. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> put the position very well last night when he said that there was an overproduction of fruit in Australia. I, therefore, refute the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> that New South Wales/ by virtue of her development in fruit production, is able to compete with the world without Tariff assistance. </para>

            <para>- I do not wish to fight anybody, but &#34;thrice armed is he who hath his quarrel just,&#34; and the fruit-growers of Parramatta will have something to say&#39; about the honorable senator&#39;s attitude. The statement that an industry such as that at Yanco can exist without any protection at all is dangerous talk. It is admitted throughout Australia that the fine developments at Mildura and Renmark would not have been possible without adequate duties on imported dried fruits, and that those enterprises without Protection would have been smothered by Greek competition before the war.  To  return to the case put up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> for an additional duty  of1d.  per lb. on dried apples, and the further proposal by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> that an additional duty&#39; of 1d. per lb. be imposed upon dried apricots, peaches, and nectarines in the interest&#39; of the Yanco fruit-growers, I would point out that if such a request were agreed to, it would mean that currants, sultanas, and raisins, the preparation of which involves probably far more labour, would be dutiable at . a lower rate. In order to&#39; test the feeling of the Committee, I propose to move at the proper time that the duty on all dried fruits, including apples, peaches, pears, apricots, and ginger, be increased by1d. per lb. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said that Yanco is such a glorious district for fruit production that orchardists there can carry on without any Tariff assistance. I invite him to look back to the inception of Mildura and Renmark and to remember what it cost the Government and the pioneers to establish those great settlements. If he does, he will be prepared to give more consideration to this request for an increased duty. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)has</inline> said that a good many tons of currants and raisins are annually imported to Australia. We should look at the other side of the picture and ascertain how many tons of currants and raisins produced in Australia are annually sent to the distilleries. With such information in our possession we should know the exact position of the industry. In dealing with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle&#39;s</inline> request in an earlier speech, I pointed out that it was necessary to increase the duty in order to assist orchardists who are not within easy distance of the fresh fruit market. Fruit-growers within easy reach of any of our big cities have no difficulty in disposing of their fresh fruits at prices in excess of those obtained for dried fruits, despite the extra labour involved in the process of drying. I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to have regard {o the position of fruit-growers 200 or 300 miles away from a big city. The only course open to them is to dry their fruits, and the prices at which dried fruits are obtainable offer them but a poor remuneration for their labour. Instead of making big profits, as has been suggested, the average orchardist, with his wife and children, is often engaged until late at night in cutting up fruit for drying next morning, and his return does not amount to more than1d. per lb. Some of the arguments that have been advanced in opposition to this request are born of want of knowledge. We must have regard, not only to the consumers of these commodities, but to those Who produce them. Let us hold the balance fairly between them. Considering the increased cost of production, this request for an additional duty of1d. per lb. is by no means unreasonable. I would remind the Committee that the request is not for a duty of1d. per lb. on green fruit, such as we were asked to , agree to in respect of bananas, but for an additional impost, which is about equal to one-eighth of1d. per lb. of fresh fruit. </para>

I was astounded at the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> regarding the condition of the dried-fruit industry in the Mumimbidgee irrigation area. We all know that the industry there up to date shows a colossal loss, not only to the Government, but to those who have been directly engaged .in it. A magnificent example of the value of the dried-fruit industry is furnished by Mildura, which has been converted from what was practically a waste into one of the most prosperous and happy settlements I have visited. That would have been impossible but for a substantial Protective duty on dried fruits. </para>

It has been said that there is a large stock of tinned fruits at Yanco for which there is no sale. On referring to the official statistics issued by the Department of Trade and Customs, showing the Customs and Excise revenue for 1919-20, we find that the value of the imports of fruits preserved in liquid - that is, tinned fruits - for,, the five years beginning 1915-16 has been, in round figures, as follows: - &#163;50,000, &#163;47,000, &#163;42,000, &#163;67,000, and &#163;56,000. For the same period the exports have been &#163;20,000, &#163;122,000, &#163;251,000, &#163;477,000, and, last year, &#163;529,000.

Although last year there was exported over &#163;500,000 worth of tinned fruits, an increased duty is asked for.

            <para>- I am quoting from the departmental statistics of the Customs and Excise revenue for the year 1919-20. I wish to see every industry in Australia, get a fair deal; I do not desire to have any position bolstered up by mere fallacies. In the case of currants, the value of the exports over the same period was; &#163;25,000, &#163;165,000, &#163;134,000, &#163;100,000, and, last year, &#163;246,000, and in the case of raisins the value was &#163;215,000, &#163;166,000, &#163;114,000, &#163;95,000, and, last year, &#163;359,000, while other dried fruits exported were valued at &#163;3,000, &#163;41,000,. &#163;17,000, &#163;57,000, and &#163;37,000. Yet a-.  duty of 3d. is asked for. &#34;Where are we drifting to? A suggestion is made that another Id. should be added to the duty, and that apples should bear the extra impost. Dried apples are not set out in these returns, but we have the figures I have just quoted. The statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has nothing to sustain it as a fact, and the proposal before us simply means penalizing our home consumers for&#39; the benefit qf foreign consumers. </para>

          <para>.- I regret that the request proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has been be clouded to a great extent by some of those who have taken part in the discussion! The figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> are interesting and reliable, but they have no bearing on the request proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> - they have no bearing at all on the request that the evaporated or dried apple industry should have a fair and reasonable measure of protection. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has quoted the export figures of raisins, currants, and other dried fruits; but I have never yet heard that the people interested in the production of such fruits have made any request for an increase in the duties. On the contrary, I was given to understand at Mildura that the producers are perfectly satisfied with the protection which they have had for some time, and which was given in order to encourage the cultivation of such fruit at Mildura and elsewhere. The industry, under the present protection, has been very successful; but this is an entirely different industry from that referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle.</inline> The dried apple industry is quite a new one in Australia, brought into existence owing to the fact that it was found impossible to insure the necessary space for the export of our better-class fruit to the Home Land. </para>

            <para>- Of course, time flies very rapidly, .but it is only within quite recent years that the industry has at all developed. Those engaged in apple growing have been forced to devise means for getting some return for that part of the crop which they cannot market as fresh fruit. The drying and evaporating of apples is an industry which is in a different category from the currant and raisin industry. When primary producers find that they cannot make a profit, they are justified in asking for more protection, and it is not usual for successful producers to ask for an. increase of duty. Australia supplies her own demand for currants and raisins, and her exportation of these fruits is increasing; but I do not under normal conditions anticipate any great exportation of dried and evaporated apples. During the war foodstuffs found a ready market, because the people of so many countries were then forced to concentrate their energies upon warfare, but to-day the position has changed. - Nevertheless, the drying and evaporating of apples is an industry which is helpful to the growers of that fruit, whose difficulties seem to increase every year, and we should do what we can to improve their condition. Iri Tasmania orcharding and the growing of small fruits has been for some years a very important industry. If the returns could be analyzed, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> would find that there has been but - a small exportation of dried apples, and I believe that to-day there is no export trade in them. . </para>

          <para>. - Yesterday, when I spoke briefly in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle&#39;s</inline> proposal, I was under the impression that the price of dried apples was very much le3S than it appears to be according to the quotations in to-day&#39;s newspapers. But 1 am desirous that something should be done to assist the fruit industry generally, because there are indications that in practically every State there is even now overproduction. </para>

            <para>- If they would live on fruit exclusively. I do not know how a greater <inline font-style="italic">per&#39; capita</inline> consumption of fruit could be brought about in this country. But there is room in this country for many millions more than we have here, and if we had the population that we might and&#39; should have, there would be no difficulty in disposing of all the fruit grown. However, unless the policy of the State Governments&#39; changes, the production of fruit is likely to increase, rather than to diminish, in proportion to population. Not only is there a larger area under fruit to-day than there was some years ago, but the area is greater than it was in proportion to the population. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent the importation of all fruit while the position remains as it is. I understand that our factories not only hold very large stocks of jam and preserved fruit, but also that they have no less than 17,000 tons of pulped fruit, and that so depressed is the market abroad that if they could get sugar for nothing they could not at present find a sale for their goods. Apparently, at present the only market abroad for our surplus fruit is that which takes 1,500,000 cases of apples during one season of the year, and 1 have been informed on good authority that the trade cannot be increased unless growers will accept much  lower prices, because there are not enough people in Great Britain - where most of our apples go - with sufficient means to buy apples at what are now considered by our exporters to be profitable prices. I accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle&#39;s</inline> statement that there is not likely to be a combination to keep up the price of dried apples; but undoubtedly the Australian Dried Fruits- Association has kept up the price of currants, raisins, and similar dried fruits. Before the war, the Association used to decide what quantity of dried fruits should be exported, and the fruit was sold abroad for about one-third of the price charged for that sold in Australia. I should not. like that to be done with the fruits now under consideration. The fruit industry in America is at present very depressed, and in a letter which I received some time ago from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Jones he says that, bad as things are in Australia, they are evidently, from cabled reports, very much worse in America, where, from latest advices, canned fruits are selling at 2a. per dozen for standard quality. </para>

            <para>- I am sure that the containers would o cost more than the price mentioned in the letter. Therefore, there is a danger of dumping, and I think that that could be met better by special anti-dumping legislation than by an increase of the duties. If the American situation has been truly represented, I do not think that a duty of 4d. per lb. would keep out imports, and it may be necessary for the Government to absolutely prohibit importation. </para>

            <para>- I understand that a large quantity of apples are used in the making of cider, and perhaps that industry could be extended. Queenslanders are reputed to be thirsty souls, but cider is a beverage which is rarely seen in their State. I do not think that we can pay regard to the circumstances of the fruit industry during the war and immediately afterwards, because there was then a big demand for fruit owing to the purchases of this and the Imperial Government, and we were then getting sugar more cheaply than it could be obtained in any other country. Now conditions have changed. The industry has not the special advantages that it enjoyed during the war, and the production of fruit has increased. Even if another tree or vine were not planted, the production of fruit in Australia would continue to increase for some years. I was a member of a party which in November last visited the Murray River settlements, and although I have a fairly  wide knowledge of the rural districts of Australia I never before saw evidence of such general affluence in any locality. But what impressed me most was the fact that, both in Victoria and in South Australia, extensive areas were being prepared for planting. I do not know where a market will be found for the fruit that will be grown there. </para>

Altogether, the situation with respect to the fruit-growing industry is so difficult that I cannot see how it is to be eased simply by the imposition of a duty of 4d. per lb.

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> I repeat, is a superior authority, having legitimately laid the basis of his ample competence upon the toil and the product of the struggling fruit-growers. To-day he has comfortable leisure in which to devote himself, with that same great intelligence that made his fortune, to the legislation of the Commonwealth. I should add, as further tribute to the honorable senator&#39;s talents, that he not only made his profits out of fruit and fruit-growers, but also out of the tin in which the fruits were canned. But fruit growing, and particularly fruit-drying, has developed consider ably in New South Wales since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> was in the business. The introduction of up-to-date machinery and the intelligent employment of modern methods in the industry may now be expected to do far more for orchardists than all the protection given them under a sympathetic Tariff. In effect, the Government, when they impose high Protection, are giving a bonus to &#34;go-slow&#34; producers. The Government say, in effect, &#34; Go as slowly as you like. You need be afraid of no competition. We shall keep everybody else out.&#34; But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> is not satisfied. He wants to provide that fruit-growers may go still more slowly. I know, of course, that Tasmania is famous for its apples. </para>

            <para>- Tasmania has to be famous for something. Hence I mention apples. It is famed, also, for one  other thing, namely, its superb climate: and -it is curious that the two most favoured States in this respect, namely, Queensland and Tasmania, should be seeking the greatest measure of coddling protection for their products. The duties, as they now appear in the schedule in connexion with fruit, might well remain. The Government have already afforded sufficient encouragement to assist producers of dried apples to conduct their businesses profitably at the expense of the remainder of the community. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has his way, the dried-apple producer will be given an additional1d. per lb. at the cost of the great mass of consumers. The honorable senator claims that unless this extra penny be conceded, the orchardists will be unable to carry on. &#34;What will they do with the extra penny? &#34;Will they pay higher wages, or sell their product more cheaply? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> referred to the splendid market which the Mother Country provided after the war, and he remarked that it was because Great Britain wanted so much of our fruits that Yanco secured such opportunities for development. In opposition to that view, some folk claim that the activities of a certain Combine must be taken into considerable account. Naturally, of course, upon the subject of the actual working of Combines, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> is again much better informed than myself. </para>

            <para>- I can prove it by reference to specific market quotations.  Who will reap the benefit if the duty under review is increased ? The orchardist must fight against pests, and plagues, and storms. He has my sympathy. If I thought that he would benefit, I would support the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle.</inline> But the man who would gain is the man who controls the product. I refer to the party who has the brains to outwit the fruit-grower - the type of man who so successfully outwits the fruit-grower as to be able to retire and cultivate the hobby of Federal politics. Everybody knows that fruit rapidly depreciates in hot weather. When fruit is marketed during a hot spell, the gentlemen, who are able eventually to retire after a lifetime of outwitting the fruit-grower, refrain from bidding, and - there being a Combine - nobody else bids. When the market can no longer hold out, owing to rapid deterioration, the brainy orchardist controllers buy the fruit for less than one-tenth of its value, and turn it into jams and preserves. They astutely bid just when the growers are compelled to sell or to throw their product into the tip. The proposal now before the Committee is to give these intelligent persons who live on the orchardists and their products a little -more lining to their pockets. In conclusion, I may add that I am making this personal attack on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> in the hope that he will be provoked to go a little further into the subject generally. Inevitably, he looks upon it from a view-point which is the opposite of mine. I bring to bear the point of view of the pest-battling orchardist, while the honorable senator takes that of the gentleman who gives the orders to the Combine, who issues directions when to buy and how long to hold off. </para>

        <para class="block">About ten years ago an important discovery was made in Australia in connexion with preserving ginger, which enabled the Australian manufacturers and preservers to capture the trade which was previously held almost entirely by China, and as a result of which practically 90 per cent, of the trade was diverted to Australia. During recent years, Chinese manufacturers have been offering this product in the Commonwealth at a price lower than that at which it can be produced here, because they have been able to secure sugar from Java at a cheaper price than Australian manufacturers and preservers have been able to purchase in the Commonwealth. It was thought by the Customs authorities that that difficulty would -be overcome by supplying sugar to manufacturers and preservers here at a lower rate, but the authorities refused to do so. The only way to save the industry and allow ginger to be preserved by white labour instead of by yellow labour is to give it adequate protection. I submit the request, and trust that it will have the support of the Committee. </para>

Those concerned in the industry here do not ask for an increase in the duty of more than1d. per lb., and there is no reason why we should give manufacturers more than they ask for under the Tariff. </para>

I indicated at the time that, as sub-item a was clearly referred to in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle&#39;s</inline> request, it would, after that request had been dealt with, be still within the competency of the Committee to discuss that sub-item.

        <para class="block">I think that this is quite necessary, because huge islands in the Pacific have been intrusted to us for government. I do not know whether the articles referred to in my request are produced in these islands, but I know that they do produce bananas, and having been intrusted with the government of these Territories, it is our duty to govern them intelligently. - If we have a Tariff operating against them, it will be an argument why we should not retain the government of those Territories. It has not yet been officially settled, and may not be for years, that we shall continue to govern and practically keep . these islands. The decision may hang in the balance with the League of Nations for years to come. I am particularly anxious not to give the people of other nations an opportunity of saying that we have governed the Mandated Territories in such a way as to treat them as though they were foreign countries. There  can be no danger to Australia in admitting fr.ee the products of these territories which for some time will cost us so much to govern. Of course, there will be the objection of the man who objects to using the products of black labour. I have no objection to using the products of black labour countries. Silks produced by Eastern nations adorn the people who wear them just as well as if they were produced by white labour. I venture to hold the opinion that the White Australia policy does not prohibit trading with coloured people. The object of the policy is to maintain the population of this country white by keeping outside the borders of the Commonwealth the people of coloured races, not because we consider them inferior, but because experience teaches that they cannot be assimilated with our population, and cannot become a people similar to the British people. The League of Nations has laid it down that those who are given mandates over these islands must treat&#39; their people as they desire. For instance, in the matter of religion, the missionaries of every nation are to be permitted to enter the islands to put their religious views before the people without interference. The management of these Mandated Territories might come up for consideration at a Congress representative of the nations of the world, in which, by the way, it is quite possible that representatives of coloured races might predominate. At that Congress it might be said that Australia stretched out her hands to secure control over these islands to hold them against the rest of the , world, had then prevented other people trading with them, and at the same time imposed a Tariff upon their products entering Australia. This Tariff, so far as these islands are concerned, will operate against . Japan and other countries and, at the same time, will levy duties on the products of our own Mandated Territories. The sooner we settle down to treat these islands as though they were part and parcel of the great Australian Commonwealth, the better it will be for Australia. </para>

            <para>- It is true &#39;that they may have some means pf imposing taxation upon imports from Australia; but my point is that these huge, rich Territories have been committed to the care of the Australian Commonwealth. We realize that we cannot claim them as part of Australia, as we can claim Australia and Papua, but we should put ourselves in a position to be able to do so by trading with them as though they were part of the Commonwealth. If we adopt that course, it will be very difficult in a few years&#39; time for any outside country to set up a dividing line between us. I desire by trade to link up these islands with Australia, so that they may ultimately become part and parcel of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- No ; but under the Tariff we say that any one in Australia who wants to buy any of the articles referred to in the request I have moved, which may be produced in these islands, must first pay 3d. per lb. duty upon them. Under this Tariff we treat  the Mandated Territories in exactly the same way as we treat China, Japan, Greece, Italy, France, or any other country producing these goods. If we put the people living in the Islands which have been given to us to govern in the same position as the foreigner, we shall do an unwise thing. While these Mandates are still in a state of flux, let us treat these territories as if they were part of Australia, and it will then be much more difficult for the League of Nations to remove them from our control than it will be if we are treating them in the same way as we treat foreign countries. </para>

Australia has made great sacrifices, and will yet make more to hold the Islands, and yet we are deliberately, by the Tariff, refusing to treat them as part of the Commonwealth. </para>

I ask the Minister in charge of the Bill to accept the proposed request. It will not interfere with bur own industries, which he is  so  anxious to build up at the expense of the people. When we take millions of pounds out of the pockets of the people for the purpose of building up local industries, all we get from the persons whom we have thus helped is abuse and denunciation  of  the Australian working man. Therefore,  I  see no reason for increased Protection, but I see every reason why products from the Mandated Territories should be admitted free. </para>

The Administration of Papua collects the Customs revenue, and by that means the Territory has been largely self-supporting, and has not had to make too great a call upon Australia for financial assistance. As soon as this Tariff is disposed of, the Government will consider the fiscal position in relation to the Islands. Personally,  I  feel inclined to allow Papua to continue to collect its own revenue and apply it to developmental purposes. </para>

The position in regard to late German New Guinea will require consideration from a different point of view. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has pointed out, we are desirous of making a good impression in regard to the  Mandated  Territories, because they are the cause of a good deal of jealousy. Although we have the right to apply our laws to them, our title at present is not quite conclusive; therefore, we should proceed warily.  We  have never placed any extreme imposts upon goods imported from Papua, but we have offered bonuses for certain products. However, Parliament will have the opportunity of considering, later, the whole position in regard to the Islands. The sooner this Tariff is disposed of the sooner we shall be able to deal -with the other proposal in relation to trade with the Islands which have passed into our possession temporarily. </para>

          <para>. -It  would be a very serious mistake for  the  Senate to attempt to settle  a matter of high public policy on any item of a Tariff schedule. I am just as anxious as is any one else for the development of the Mandated Territories ; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> proposal is to admit duty free products that will compete with commodities raised in the tropical part of Australia. To be consistent, the honorable senator should propose that all commodities from the islands should be admitted free. I would not be in favour of that; but why should he suggest that two or three items which are raised in tropical Australia should be selected to compete on equal terms with the products of Mandated Territories in which there is an abundant supply of cheap labour? In those islands it is possible to produce, not only tropical fruits, but also citrus fruits, yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> allowed the last-named item to pass without any suggestion that consideration should be given to the islands in respect of it. The islands can produce maize in great abundance, but I am certain that the Committee would not at this stage admit maize from the Mandated Territories free of duty, because the industrial conditions under which it is produced are so radically different from those existing in Australia. If we admit free of duty the commodities produced in cheap-labour countries, eventually our own industries w!111 be swamped, and there will be no employment for our own people. </para>

          <para>.- I hope the Committee will not take it for granted that we cannot grow dates in Australia. Date palms do very well in various parts of the Commonwealth, and the dutyof1d. per lb. may serve as a little encouragement to people to preserve this fruit: Should an attempt be made in that direction, we can later on increase the duty. The point that I wish specially to impress on honorable senators is that dates come into competition with our own dried fruits. I recommend the Committee to reject the request. </para>

          <para>. - I cannot understand the attitude of some honorable senators towards tropical fruits. They seem to hold the view that tropical fruits should be admitted free, and that highly Protective duties should be imposed in respect of such fruits as are produced in the more temperate zones of Australia. The removal of the duty on dates would undermine the additional protection on dried fruits for which we have already decided to ask. The public will not pay a high price for raisins if they can obtain for half, the price dates; which are just as palatable and as nutritious as many Australian preserved fruits. </para>

            <para>- In the western part of the State. I admit, however, that they are not grown in commercial quantities. In the report of a scientific expedition which recently visited the central part of Australia, it is stated that in certain districts date palms were flourishing and bearing a prolific crop. This duty should be allowed to remain. Even with a duty of1d. per lb., dates are not expensive. Surely honorable senators are not hostile to the production of tropical fruits in Australia. The western part of Queensland, the Northern Territory, and also, I believe, certain parts of Western Australia - notwithstanding the bad name for fruit production which has been given that State by some of its representatives in this Chamber - can produce all the dates required&#34; for Australian consumption? </para>

            <para>- We must regard this item from a common-sense point of view. The present duty produces a fair amount of revenue. Large quantities of dates are imported, but I do not see that the importations affect the consumption of other dried fruits in this country. Dates are regarded by the mass of the people as a dried fruit within their reach, and as of a totally different kind from any other fruit on the market. Dates at present are not exceptionally high in price, being somewhere about 5d. or 6d. per lb., though I have known them as low as. 2d. However, I regard a duty as essential in the interests of the revenue, and, as such, I support it. </para>

          <para>. - I am glad to hear the candid statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> that this is purely a revenue duty, because, as a fact, it is of no use trying to claim it as a Protective one. I have an idea that a date tree does not produce in this country under fifty or one hundred years. I got that idea when, as a little boy forty years ago, I was taken to an orchard some distance out of Parramatta, and there shown a date tree which had been planted by my grandmother nearly twenty years before, and I was told that it would be seventy or a hundred years before any crop could be gathered. </para>

            <para>- That only helps my argument A few years ago I met an uncle of mine, and asked him how this tree was getting on, and he told me that it had been supplanted by other trees, because it would be necessary to- plant another date tree before any fruit could be expected. I am rather fond of Protectionists, because they are so delightfully idealistic ! Imagine taxing the people of to-day on account of a crop which will be gathered a hundred years, hence! Of course, I regard&#39; Queensland as rich enough to produce anything, in view of the fact that it has produced Senators Crawford, Reid, and Glasgow. I never refer to Queensland except in terms of admiration for its immense potentialities and possibilities; but Queensland cannot claim to produce dates to-day as a business proposition., It is claimed that this is a revenue duty; but from whom is the revenue taken? Principally from the people least able to pay it: I think that we could well come together and remove this duty; and then we might be able to proceed with the Tariff with proper celerity. The idea of protecting dates which our children&#39;s children will have to gather, is, truly, Protection long drawn out ! </para>

          <para>. - I have listened to this discussion with great interest. I happen to have been in the part of the world where dates are chiefly grown, and I understand from reliable people there that trees will bear in ten or twelve years at the very outside ; in fact, I have seen the fruit growing on very small trees. Of course, dates are grown for commercial purposes in Egypt, Palestine, and the Sinai Desert, and they are a very valuable product. In that part of the world the tree has to be artificially fertilized. </para>

The present duty has been in operation for about eleven years, and has resulted in nothing. Notwithstanding all the Queensland inventive imagining, we have not been supplied with a single fact regarding the production of dates in that State; and yet Queensland representatives have the audacity to ask for a duty in the case of an industry which, I repeat, has not had the energy to be born.

During the war there was a large market in Great Britain and Europe for Californian prunes; but since then the European demand has decreased, and these prunes have been dumped in Australia, mostly to the prejudice of New South Wales growers. The duty is to protect the industry from unnatural conditions. </para>

          <para>. - In my opinion, prunes are plentiful now because they have been- held back to secure higher prices, and there has been a slump. A gentleman living close to me told me that he had kept back a few tons to get better prices. I hope that the Committee will be consistent. We have made the duty on currants and raisins 4d., and that should be a sufficient rate for prunes. Personally, I think that 3d. would be enough for all dried fruits. Last night <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chaffey</inline> told me that there was a movement at Mildura to ask Parliament to increase the duty from 3d., and that the general opinion was that that would be unwise. This Committee has done what the growers seem to think unnecessary. I move - </para>

          <para>. - The figures&#39; which the .Minister  <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> provided with respect to the importation of prunes, apples, pears, and the like afford the fullest possible justification for an increase of the duty by Id. per lb. I am sympathetic with the amendment because it aims at consistency. Up to the present moment the Committee has made inconsiderable progress upon the schedule. Practically the whole of the afternoon has been devoted to an exhaustive discussion of one item, which has not yet been finished with. The Government appear to think that the Tariff should leave the Senate with every &#34;i&#34; dotted and every <inline font-style="italic">&#34;t&#34;</inline> crossed. If the Minister would display a little more elasticity in the consideration of obvious incongruities and anomalies, considerable time would be saved. </para>

            <para>- No doubt, but I am not prepared to tax 1,000,000 consumers for the benefit of two or three, people, particularly when - according to the Government - they have ample protection already. The duty of 4d. per lb. is too high. I appeal for reason on behalf of the people. Apparently, however, this unhealthy encouragement by way of steadily increased protection is to continue for years. When are the consumers to have their turn ? First of all, we are asked to &#34; give the orchardists a chance to establish themselves.&#34; The next cry is, &#34; Give them an opportunity to grow their prunes&#34;; and the next, &#34; Give them a chance to secure up-to-date machinery for preparing the prunes for market, and then the people will reap the benefit.&#34; When? The Australian prune industry would appear to be growing weaker and weaker. Prunes imported from America are not grown with the aid of cheap labour. Freights cannot be secured for nothing. Why should the Australian growers require more and more protection? As for the appeal of the growers in the Batlow district, they have the good fortune to be established on one of the richest areas in New South Wales. Almost anything cultivated in the neighbourhood grows to perfection. </para>

            <para>- My colleague can look after himself. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline> Moloney may be relied on to secure his return to the Commonwealth Legislature upon general merits, and not by the exclusive favour of the Batlow prune-growers. The duty has been increased by l&#163;d. per lb. from what the Protectionists thought was adequate a few years ago. It is not a small increase, because it represents approximately 50 per cent, of the value of the product, and that has to be added to the price the consumer has to pay.. The Minister has said that it is 50 per cent, below what the growers have asked, and we appear to be legislating in this way: The Government impose a duty of 3d. per lb., the producers ask for 6d. per lb., and the rate is eventually fixed at 4&#163;d. per lb. I desire to voice the opinion of the unorganized people who have to pay&#62; because those who are formed into companies and Combines have offices, can frame resolutions and circulars, and distribute them throughout the Commonwealth. In that way their interests are safeguarded. During the last three weeks I have had an opportunity of visiting three States in the Commonwealth, and I have never seen so many unemployed as there are at present, notwithstanding that we have a Protective Tariff in operation, which is bringing in approximately &#163;30,000,000 per annum. If the arguments of the Protectionists are sound, and high duties create employment, one would expect to find every one profitably engaged. </para>

            <para>- The duty on prunes has been increased by 50 per cent, with the object of encouraging more people to undertake prune-growing, and to assist manufacturers in extending their plants. But we have been doing that for years under a Protective Tariff, and what has been the result? After years of what has been considered by the Protectionists a sufficient duty, we now find that the industry is in such a precarious position that the duty has been increased by 50 per cent. If we proceed as we are going, in ten or twenty years&#39; time we shall be asked to impose a duty of 100 per cent., because the .producers will not then be in  a better position than they are in to-day. We are now asked to place prunes on the same basis as other dried fruits by reducing the duty by Jd. per lb.; but when such a proposal is submitted the Minister will not budge. If we continue in this way the Tariff discussion will never end. Personally, I would like to see the whole schedule disposed of by to-morrow. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> seems to have taken a certain amount of umbrage because I am supporting an increased duty on prunes in order to protect the interests of a great many soldier settlers who have been encouraged by the Repatriation Department to take up holdings for the purpose of producing prunes. When I remember the general attitude of the party which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> represents here towards the returned soldier, I am not at all surprised that he should resent any honorable senator saying a few words on behalf of an industry in which so many returned soldiers are engaged. I feel sure, however, that the opinion of honorable senators generally will be that it is wise and proper, in view of all the circumstances, to give some increased protection to this industry. After hearing the explanation of the Minister on this item, I cannot in any way reproach myself for having decided to give my vote for the increased duty. I hope that the Committee will agree to the increase, particularly in order that soldier settlers who have been encouraged to go into the industry may be given that protection against foreign competition which is necessary. </para>

I appeal to the good sense of honorable senators to say whether they think it is likely that any organization connected with the Labour movement would censure the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate because he has expressed himself in opposition to particular duties. 1 cannot imagine that anything of the kind would occur outside of Gladesville. Even if the honorable senator&#39;s statement be true, what is the censure of any organization compared with the votes of confidence which I have received time after time from the whole of the people of the State which I represent. The bitterest censure of any organization in the Labour movement is not to be compared with the favours I have received from the movement from time to time. I know that in the electorate to which the honorable senator referred there is a lunatic asylum known as the Gladesville Asylum. </para>

            <para>-. - I should like to remind you, sir, that I did not introduce it. I think if I had done so I would very properly have been called to order. After considerable stress has been laid upon the fact that I was censured, and although that reference should have been, but was not, ruled out of order, I am not permitted to reply to it. I shall not, of course, contest your ruling, but it is a little hard when I am the only representative of the Labour party in the Senate that&#34; the whole of the members of the Nationalist party, including the  Chairman  of Committees, should permit me to be attacked, but will not permit me to reply to the attack. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline>is supporting the increase of &#163;d. per lb. in the duty on prunes because returned soldiers are growing prunes. How many are there engaged in the industry? I venture to say that within the whole of Australia there are not more than a dozen. I suppose that, in most of the hotels and restaurants throughout the country, a dinner is completed with a dish of prunes and rice. Those who in future partake of this dish will be able to say that, in the interest of returned soldiers, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> made the price of prunes <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> per lb. dearer. &#39; The honorable senator, and, indeed, every other member of the Senate, has admitted that a Protective Tariff does make the articles protected dearer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> is going to vote for the increase in the duty in the  interest of returned soldier settlers growing prunes, and I intend to oppose it in the interest of returned soldier . settlers growing wheat, wool, and bananas. Honorable senators can scarcely blame me fo* the slow progress that is being made with the schedule. They had a fortnight to themselves without me, but they did not get very far with it. Having studied Taylor&#39;s scientific organization for the speeding up of industrial institutions, I again respectfully suggest that the schedule should be put to* the Committee a page at a time. We might conveniently commence with the next page, and the items from 54 to 66 inclusive might be put together. This would not in any way restrict the liberty of honorable senators to discuss or request an amendment upon any item included in the page. </para>

        <para>Senatpr PRATTEN. - Yes, at a price considerably under the cost of production. Owing to this, one very important factory in Sydney, and another in Melbourne, have now practically gone into liquidation, and have lost nearly the whole of their ordinary shareholders&#39; capital. This has been brought about by heavy consignments of canned fruit having been sent within the last six months to the Mother Country, and to a slump in prices having occurred there. Very heavy claims have now been made to cover the difference between the amounts advanced upon canned goods and the prices they actually brought. The slump in the canned fruit market has jeopardized the position of many of our well-established jam and canned-fruit factories. </para>

          <para>- Honorable senators have said something about facilitating the business of the Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has several times preferred a request to me to put the schedule page by page. Many able members of the Senate have occupied this chair before me, and a procedure has been observed in connexion with previous Tariffs which I do not desire to greatly vary; but there is something which the Committee might be willing to do in connexion with the question of the duties to be imposed under the British preferential Tariff. I cannot accept the suggestion that the schedule should be taken a page at a time, because that would interfere too greatly with the right of honorable senators to discuss the various items appearing on a page. But if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> cares to make a statement to the Committee that he is willing to accept a test vote on the first item on each page to decide the manner in which the Committee will deal with the British preferential Tariff, and to determine his attitude with respect to all the duties appearing in the British preferential column on the same page, I shall be prepared to- take the responsibility of putting such a test motion to the Committee, as I think that if that course were adopted it would facilitate the transaction of business. </para>

            <para>-  I have suggested that the schedule should be put to the Committee page by page. We have just reached page 13 in the schedule, and I suggest that the  Chairman  might put items 54 to 66 inclusive in one motion. That would not interfere with the right of honorable senators to discuss any items appearing on the page. After the discussion had concluded, the whole of these items could be put together. If that course were followed, I should be relieved of the necessity, in giving effect to my intention to endeavour to remove from the schedule any duties operating against Great Britain, of moving for a request to omit duties appearing against each of the items and sub-items on the page. When considering a Supply Bill we often deal&#39; with the schedule in Departments, although each Department includes as many items as does a page of the Tariff schedule. That procedure suits the general convenience of honorable senators. Even those who are most desirous of a full discussion on every item must realize that there is a limit to the endurance of the Minister. There is in the Senate only one Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> who is in real sympathy with Protectionist principles, and the strain imposed upon him by. several all-night sittings would be considerable. </para>

            <para>- There is nothing particularly definite in the honorable senator&#39;s suggestion, and, as several Tariffs have been dealt with previously by the Senate, the adoption now of any short cut may only land  the  Committee in confusion. Probably the old adage holds true, that &#34;the longest way round is the shortest way home.&#34; I propose, therefore, to adhere strictly to established procedure, but, in order to expedite business I shall simply call each sub-item, and,- after allowing ample&#34; time for honorable senators to prefer requests, pass on to the next.  They  will understand, however, that, once I have declared an item passed, there can be no retracing of our steps, except according to the proper forms prescribed by the Standing Orders. </para>

A great Dominion like Australia, the people of which almost unanimously are ready to do everything they can for Great Britain, and even to make sacrifices for her, should be quite prepared to trade with her without imposing any special restrictions. The very importation of these articles from Great Britain might improve the standard of Australian products. People might find in the British commodity some feature of make-up or marketing that is absent from our . own, and healthy competition between our producers and those of Great Britain would be beneficial. Moreover, , the wiping out  of  this duty would convey to the people  of  Great Britain an evidence of the  goodwill  of the Senate towards them. We cannot pretend to love them, and be loyal to them, if we will not trade with them. </para>

            <para>- It is grown in Queensland; I cannot speak of the other States. For the little labour and expense involved in manufacturing preserved ginger, even if sugar is dear at the present time, a duty of 4d. per lb. is too high. We have imposed much lower duties upon other products which have to be grown, and passed through most intricate and expensive processes before the finished article can be put upon the market, and if it is desirable to establish an industry for the manufacture of preserved ginger out of the raw article, imported from other countries, it is still more desirable to encourage the production of the raw material within the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>. -  I explained to-day that investigations have shown that on account of the high price of sugar in Australia as compared with the price in China, the manufacturers of preserved ginger in this country are likely, to discontinue operations. We approached the Sugar Board, with a request that sugar required for this industry should be made available at a lower price, but they declined, and I think rightly, to make a special concession for one industry. The alternatives before us were to allow the industry to go out of existence or to increase the duty by Id. We granted that increase to-day after due deliberation. The Committee is now asked to undo its previous Act. Are we to stultify ourselves by negativing in the evening what we did in the afternoon? The recipe for the brine in which ginger is imported is unknown to any manufacturer in Australia, and for that reason ginger in brine has to be imported. I believe that ginger can be grown in Australia, but we have yet to start its cultivation. </para>

            <para>- It is inevitable that the price of sugar shall return to normal unless it is kept at its present level by high Protection. Certain people have established an industry for the manufacture of preserved ginger, but the rise in the price of sugar has made its continuance impossible unless further protection is given to it. </para>

          <para>.- We have already dealt with&#39; the finished product, preserved ginger, and we are now dealing with the raw material used for its manufacture and which provides that industry with the necessary ammunition to enable it to carry on. I find that under the Tariff of 1914 ginger in brine or syrup was dutiable at Id. per .lb. The Government, in introducing the present Tariff, decided apparently to give relief to those engaged in the manufacture of preserved ginger by admitting their raw material free. I regret that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> when we were dealing with the manufactured article, did not draw our attention to this fact. </para>

        <para>Such information would have been a useful guide to honorable senators in voting on the request to increase the duty on the manufactured article from 3d. to 4d. per lb. </para>

          <para>.- The request that has been moved, and the explanation which has been made by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> serve to point out the absurdity  of trying to protect our industries through the Customs House. The Minister assures us that he desires that this item shall be free because it deals with the raw material of those engaged in the manufacture of preserved ginger. He also tells us that the high price of sugar places Australian manufacturers of preserved ginger at a disadvantage as compared with manufacturers abroad. That can be remedied by removing the duty of &#163;6 per ton now levied on sugar. </para>

        <para class="block">Sub-item a is one of those curious innovations of- the Tariff of which we have several samples. So far as we have&#39; heard, there are two reasons for imposing duties - one in order to protect our industries, and the other to bring revenue&#39; to the Treasury. Neither of these reasons holds in the present case. There is no necessity for any protection, because the wheat industry can stand alone. Thewheatgrower, &#39; unlike other producers who have their sponsors in this Chamber,, and come to the Treasury for doles, can stand on his own feet, and not only supply the home market, but send his surplus overseas, and compete in the world&#39;s market. No revenue is received from this sub-item except in years of &#39;scarcity, and then it is so microscopic as to be not worth talking about. In the case of wheat, this is an exporting and not an importing country. During the five years from 1915-16 we have exported wheat annually to the value of from something like &#163;7,000,000 to about &#163;20,000,000. </para>

            <para>- The plain position is that in normal years, which are happily in the majority, we not only supply all cur own wheat requirements, but send  substantial shipments overseas. In abnormal times, when we do not produce enough wheat, we import in order to meet our own necessities; and then the Treasurer, under these famine-stricken conditions, endeavours to exact from the consumers of this country an extra dole. In other words, the Treasurer imposes a tax on the food of the people, and this, in my opinion, almost amounts to an immoral form of taxation. As a representative of the wheat-growers, I wish to show other producers of Australia- that we can stand alone, without such doles as the Treasurer has been asked to hand out at the instance of honorable senators. The wheat-growers, on the poor soils of this country, and in places with&#39; a comparatively small rainfall, do not desire to crawl on all-fours to the Treasury, as do some of the&#34; agriculturists of Queensland. We have heard a good deal about black labour from the representatives of the northern States, just as though the wheatgrowers never experience such competition. The wheat-growers send their surplus to the overseas markets, and have there to compete with the products of the same black labour that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> has been holding up as a bogy during the last week. </para>

            <para>- What is the good of quibbling? The country produced the wheat and it is here. In 1902 and in 1914, when drought swept the continent, we did not produce enough &#39;wheat for our own people, and it was then proposed to levy a tax on the consuming public. I say again that this is a most immoral proposition, which, so far as I know, is not supported by any evidence of economy. The Senate should .not countenance such &#39; a thing, as taxing the food of the people at a time of stress and famine. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford,</inline> and those who support him in asking for high duties on the ground of black labour competition; that the Australian wheat-growers, not on j&#163;20anacre soil, but on soil that is in the least favoured areas so far as rainfall is concerned, are able to hold their own in the markets &#39;of the world. They, do not come here with a lot of &#34; tarradiddles,&#39; and whine to Ministers to sustain them; they&#39; are prepared, not only to .feed the Commonwealth, but to send their surplus abroad in the face of all the black labour competition. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Y ear-Book,</inline> the average price per quarter of Chili wheat on the London market is 30s.; Argentine, 31s. Id.; Bulgaria, 28s. 7d. ; Roumania, 31s. 2d. ; Russia, 30s. 9d. ; United States of America, 30s. 7d.; Canada, 30s. lOd. ; British&#39; India, 28s. 7d. ; New Zealand, 29s. 7d.; and Australia, 31s. 4d. Thus Australia beats the lot, without any protection, and without a brass farthing of Treasury patronage. The Australian wheat-grower has to send his product to a market where it is jostled by the wheat grown by black labour in British India and in other countries I have mentioned; and, without, any protection, they are knocking the stuffing out of all competitors. The Australian wheat-grower has no need to crawl to the Minister, and debase .himself in a fashion not creditable to Australians; he does not seek protection on the ground of black labour competition, although the wheat is grown, not on expensive virgin soil, but on the poorest. There is no whining from the Australian wheat-growers, and I am proud to belong to a fraternity which does not come to the Government, cap in hand, as do the Queensland producers, but which is able and willing to &#39;meet the competition of labour - black, brown, and brindled. </para>

            <para>- Yes. My - desire was to stabilize the industry, and to give heart and hope to the men who are working out in the arid wastes. Their position is very different from that of those who live on the Queensland littoral. They are on the frontiers of .civilization ; they depend upon themselves, and by their inherent energies forge their way in life instead of leaning on the Government, as some of the Queenslanders do. I speak on behalf of no small number.  There are 235,000 agriculturists in this country, of whom 80 per cent., or about 200,000, are engaged in the arduous pursuit of wheat-growing. Theirs is not a spoonfed industry. To them the Government gives no doles. Their energies are something of which the nation may be proud. In a voice without tremor and without the suggestion of a whine, attention should be called to the fact that we produce wheat without help from the Government, and ask for no communal aid. That has been our stand in the past, and will be our attitude in the future. As for this padding of the Tariff with a duty of 2s. per cental on wheat, it is useless to us, and we decline it. </para>

          <para>. - If the Committee wishes to wipe out the duty on wheat, it is free to do so ; 1 rise chiefly to reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> declaration against Government doles, and his objection to whining. The honorable senator has made more applications for guarantees to wheat-growers, and more applications for information as to when the next wheat payments would be made, than any one else. To that I take no exception, but in reply to what he has said I wish to point out that during the war, when the banks had refused to lend -&#39;money on wheat, and a better security than the credit of the States was demanded, the Commonwealth Government borrowed &#163;20,000,000 on overdraft, and kept the wheat industry organized, and&#39; thus greatly benefited the wheatgrowers. To-day in Victoria there is a political crisis because the farmers wish to continue to receive Government assistance. I have never accused the farmers of looking for a dole, but it was from the Commonwealth that they had to get help during the war. The honorable senator is a wheat-grower, and good luck to him; but he must remember that at one time the Commonwealth, had advanced on wheat more than &#163;21,000,000, and that we  thus kept the farmers going. As much as nine-tenths of the value of the wheat had been advanced in some cases before any of it had been sold overseas. The duty in the Tariff was originally imposed at the request of the farmers, but we cannot now shut our eyes to the fact that there has been an immense development of wheat-growing in the East, where for some years Australia had a monopoly of the grain and flour trade. To-day, &#39; Manchuria is delivering flour and wheat there at 20 per cent, less than it can be sent from Australia. That country, with China and India, have captured the Eastern market. The East has awakened; but I hope that the time will never come when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will have to ask for duties on wheat to keep the Australian market for Australian farmers, and to protect them against the competition of men of the Eastern races. On Friday last a deputation of millers complained that Australian wheat was not wanted in the East, because the Eastern market was supplied from the countries that I have named. For many years the London parity has governed the world&#39;s markets for wheat, finally determining prices even in Canada and the United States of America. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has told us with pride that Australian wheat brings the highest price in London. That is because it has a hard, white grain, the flour of which is useful to blend with the flour made from soft wheat. It is this quality of hardness that gives our wheat its special value. But the honorable senator&#39;s sneer against the Government is not warranted. We have not offered doles to the farmers ; but we have &#39;tried to co-operate with them, and we have assisted them. Last year we were successful in .selling their wheat for as much as 7s. 9d. per bushel, a price hitherto unknown for Australian wheat. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">But in June of that year the Wheat Board saw that there was likely to be a shortage of wheat in Australia. It had no authority to stop the exportation of wheat, being merely a selling and administrative agency; but it was then evident to us that if we went on selling wheat abroad, Australia, by the following December, would not have sufficient to provide herself .with bread. We therefore called a Conference of the State authorities, and they as a whole agreed to purchase at the then London parity of 7s. 8d. enough to cover local supplies for the period from June to the end of the year. In the following October and November, the price of wheat rose to 15s. per bushel, and we were so short that we had to refuse business with South Africa at 14s. 6d. to 15s. That was why South Africa started to buy our second and third grade wheat, from which transactions emanated the recent trouble. The present year has been very good. The Government are indifferent whether this item of duty remains or is wiped- out. It was -not imposed by the present Ministry. We have no desire to hand out doles to the farmers. We have done our best, according to our light, to give genuine and, I think, most valuable, assistance .to farmers. So far as the Wheat Board is concerned, it comes with a bad grace, after the Board has given seven years of honorary service, to be told that we have been serving out doles. The duty upon wheat is neither protective nor revenue-productive. It was imposed by a former Government to provide the farmers of Australia with a guarantee that they would not be injured by the importation of cheap wheat, and we have now, as I have shown, to face the possibility of cheap wheat being sent to us from Manchuria and China. If honorable senators consider that this clanger has passed, let them wipe out the duty. </para>

          <para>&#39;. - As a wheat grower and farmer I congratulate the Government upon what they have done for the wheat-growers of Australia. They have done more for the primary producer than any other Government I know of. At the same time, I take exception to the camouflage contained in the Tariff. It is palpably absurd and stupid to impose import duties on live cattle, live sheep, and wheat, with respect to which Australia is an exporter. We never import cattle, sheep, or wheat except in periods of drought and starvation, when no wheat-grower or cattle raiser in Australia desires the operation of a duty. The Government would appear to be endeavouring to persuade the farmer that he is being given the benefit of Protection, whereas he is the only man in all the land who has no protection, and never has had. </para>

          <para>. - -I regret that . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> should have mentioned my name so frequently, and in &#34;such an offensive manner. I have, done no whining with respect to the industries of Queensland or of any other State. I have a public duty to perform, and I endeavour to do so in as manly a fashion as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> When I consider it necessary I speak, and shall continue to speak, regardless of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> sensitive feelings. It is true that there is a number of protected industries in Australia, and it is equally true that there are some which do not directly benefit from Protection. Those countries which depend entirely upon primary production are much poorer than others which have a number of important secondary industries, such as there are in Australia. If we had had to import all those commodities which we have produced under a policy of Protection during the last few years, we would have created a position in regard to exchange which would have made Australia one of the poorest countries in the world to-day. As for the hard-working wheat-growers, I doubt whether they toil any harder than men engaged in other branches of agriculture. Upon the whole, the agriculturist, no matter what may be the commodity he is producing, is among the hardest of all workers. I have no desire to minimize the value of the wheat or the pastoral industry; but the prosperity of Australia cannot be maintained, nor can a very large population be supported, upon primary industries alone. N&#39;o industry in the past few years has received the same consideration from the Government as wheat-growing.

            <para>-  I did not  raise my voice against the proposition, but the security was such that the Western Australian Government would not incur any liability in connexion with it. The statement of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> should receive every consideration. The strides made in the production of wheat in Manchuria have been remarkable. Members of this Parliament were informed not long ago by a gentleman well acquainted with the East that Manchuria had a population of something like 30,000,000, but that it was capable of supporting 250,000,000. I understand that in Manchuria and Siberia, just as in Russia-in-Europe, there are enormous wheat areas. Australian farmers may find in those countries such strong competitors that there will not be the same overseas market for Australian wheat as hitherto. The reminder may impress on honorable senators how necessary it is that other industries should be established - industries which will support a. large population, so that the home market may become ever more valuable. We do not know what is before us in regard to prices ruling in overseas markets for wheat or any other primary products. I would not have risen if it had not been for the personal allusions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynoh</inline> concerning my alleged whining attitude in regard to certain industries which I desire to see adequately protected. </para>

          <para>. -  I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will not persist in his effort to remove this duty.. While I agree with him in many of the arguments he has submitted, I think there is a possibility of his action being misconstrued. The duty is of very little benefit to the wheatgrowers of the Commonwealth, and I do not think it has ever been imposed. It has been pointed out that when there was a scarcity of wheat the duty was valueless, because it was either ignored or temporarily removed. The facts and figures given by the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> as to what happened last year is a good illustration of what could have been done for the farmers if proper steps had been taken. If &#39;the Australian farmers insisted on sending their wheat overseas and selling it at the world&#39;s .parity of 14s. 6d. per bushel instead of accepting the Australian price of 7s. 8d. per bushel, the Australian consumers would have realized that they had been obtaining supplies at a . lower rate than any other people in the world. Similar circumstances may arise in the future, and if the farmers are well organized and are able to, take advantage of the overseas price, through the medium of co-operative concerns or Government Pools, they will be able to secure world&#39;s parity, and the consumers individually or collectively will have to pay, in addition to the cost of the wheat, the extra freight, to bring it back to Australia. That may occur during drought periods such as those referred to by the Minister, and I trust, in order to prevent wheat being dumped into Australia, from black-labour countries - I do not think it at all likely - that this safeguard will be allowed to remain. </para>

            <para>- In the 1901-2 Tariff the duty upon wheat was ls. per cental, and a storm of opposition was raised because it was submitted to Parliament at a time when there was actually a. drought, or a drought pending. Strong representations were made to the Government of the day that wheat&#39; should be allowed to be imported -free. Among those who made strong representations were State Governments, including the Government&#39; of New South Wales, who represented that, in consequence of the -drought conditions prevailing, farmers and others should be allowed to import wheat duty free. The Commonwealth Government at that time informed the .New South Wales Government that if they were interested in achieving that : result they could very easily do so by importing wheat and paying the duty, be-  cause under the Braddon clause they would be returned three-fourths of the  duty paid. I am not sure if the duty has been in operation ever since, but I am inclined to think it has. Even those opposing it have said that it has not done much harm. It  i3  not a Protective duty,  and it will never be a revenue-producing  one in the event of a drought. If that is the position, we have to consider it, not : merely upon its individual merits, but in relation to the Tariff as a whole. This Tariff has been framed in a different manner from any Tariff Parliament has previously considered, because the schedule has three columns. There is a pro-  vision in a portion of the Bill covering the schedule which enables the Government to make arrangements with different countries whereby &#39;a duty can be moved from the general to the intermediate  column. If we haVe a duty such as this &#34; in the intermediate and general columns, we shall have a lever by which we can arrange or negotiate on a reciprocal basis with other countries. That is the position in the case of New &#39; Zealand. Arrangements for reciprocity were entered into in 1906, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon,</inline> the Premier of New Zealand, was in Australia. He took back with him to New Zealand, on that last fatal journey of his, a proposal for duties in connexion with which reciprocal arrangements could be entered into between New Zealand and the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- I am mentioning this as an illustration to show that the duty which appears in this schedule enabled the Government of the Commonwealth at the time to come to a tentative reciprocal arrangement with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon.</inline> The appearance of this duty in the schedule as submitted by the Government to-day, even though it be not operative in normal times, will be a lever to&#39; enable the Government at any future time, should that be considered necessary, to enter into reciprocal arrangements with other countries- to whom it might be a matter of importance to introduce their wheat into Australia. 0 For this reason, I hope that it will be realized that this duty does not appear in the schedule for nothing, nor has it remained in our Tariff since 1901 for nothing. It may be the means of enabling the Government in future to negotiate reciprocal arrangements with other countries; and for that reason I hope the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> will stand by it, and that the Committee will support, it. </para>

          <para>. - I want to touch upon an aspect of the matter which has not yet been considered by the Committee. In my opinion, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> was very wise when last year he included this duty on wheat in the Tariff. It is the first time that wheat has been dutiable since 1908, and my references do not go back beyond that time. It will be remembered that this Parliament and Government have arranged, in connexion with, the Wheat Pool, that the remainder of the year&#39;s sales of wheat for home consumption shall average 9s. per  bushel. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> will indorse what I say when I inform honorable senators that, but for this duty of 2s. per bushel on this wheat, it was within the bounds of possibility, only a few months ago, for cheap wheat from the west coast &#39;of America to have been dumped here at a price below the price fixed for Australian wheat for home consumption. </para>

A price of 9s. per bushel was fixed for Australian wheat for local consumption, in order that, in the interests of Australian wheat-growers, a fair average might be maintained throughout the year as between the Australian price and the world&#39;s parity. It is true that the world&#39;s parity is now below 9s. per bushel, but it also went up to lis. and 12s. per bushel, and the Government very fairly tried to even up the position between wheat-growers and wheat consumers in Australia. I reiterate that, but for the duty of 2s. per bushel on wheat in our Tariff, it was quite possible that at one time wheat might be imported from America to Australia and sold here at a price below that fixed for our wheat for local consumption. </para>

This whiff of fresh air from the wheat fields of Western Australia was very much needed. The honorable senator was right in his statement that the people tilling the poorer lands in Australia are not whining for protection from the Government, and he was right also in his statement that this duty represents no protection to Australian wheat-growers. -I can give honorable senators the importations of wheat for some years past. In 1909, they amounted to 128 bushels ;. in 1910, &#39;325 bushels; in 1911, 113 bushels; in 1912, 1,483 bushels; in 1913, 60 bushels; in 1914, 1,641,237 bushels. </para>

            <para>- There has been no occasion when there has not been some wheat to sell in some portion of Australia. Last year the Minister for Trade and Customs restricted the sale of the Western Australian wheat. Western Australia had a bumper crop, and could supply Victoria. Victoria, also, was in the fortunate position of having a good wheat crop in that season. In 1914-15, when wheat was being imported, the duty was suspended. </para>

            <para>- Exactly. The same thing occurred from 10th August, 1917, to 25th March, 1920. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> was quite correct in saying that this duty is a mere pretence. Why throw dust in the eyes of the farmers by pretending to give an advantage when no real advantage exists? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> took exception to the reference to Queenslanders, who are profitably farming rich lands, whining for more assistance from the Government. It is interesting to note that the averag&#39;e value of the wheat crop for the past nine seasons was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 6s. 3d. per acre. It reached its highest point in 19J5-16, when it was &#163;3 4s. 7d. per acre. In 1916-17 it was &#163;2 10s. 10d., and in 1917-18 &#163;2 15s. 8d. The wheat farmers are not asking for Government aid, but men cultivating banana lands worth hundreds of pounds per acre have asked for the imposition of enormous duties.  &#39; Whining &#34; is a good word to apply to those senators who, .having in their own State the richest lands in Australia, ask that the people toiling on the poorer lands shall be compelled to pay higher prices for the produce of those rich lands. I- find that for the ten seasons, 1908-18, the average yield of wheat per acre was 11.37 bushels. It is pleasing indeed to have two representatives of the wheat growers in the persons of Senators Lynch and Guthrie pointing out that this duty is only a sham. I hope that the Senate will discard it altogether, and not wait till there is a chance of wheat being imported, and then ask for its repeal in order to prevent &#39; the farmers getting  a  higher price for their product. </para>

            <para>- Wheat that was delivered in 1915-16 has not been completely paid for yet, and I think I am entitled to say that those instalments are well overdue. I am one of those to whom this money is due, and I presume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -Guthrie</inline> is another. Will the Minister say that sugar, or wool, or any other product, save wheat, that was delivered six years ago has not been paid for yet? When, in pursuance of my public duty, I asked for the payment of overdue instalments, it was not for the purpose of paying a .wage of &#163;9 per week, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> says he paid in his industry, but to pay a wage of something like &#163;3 a week, to keep the home fires burning in the wheat belts, and to extend the area under crop. </para>

            <para>- The wheat was delivered, and wheat is as good as gold at any time, but especially during the war. In regard to the guarantee, the motion I introduced to the Senate asked that the Government should guarantee a fixed minimum of 5s. per bushel for five years, and if London parity should be above or below that price, the Treasury should be credited or debited to the extent of the difference in each year; 5s. was to be the standard price, but in no circumstances was the Treasury to lose by the transaction. The Government were merely to act as guarantors in order to put the wheat industry in a stable position. I shall not withdraw my request. The farmers do not seek a gratuitous gift such as this duty is. This is merely an attempt to put a fifth wheel on a coach. The proposed duty can be neither useful nor ornamental, and the farmers. do not want it. </para>

            <para>- I felt constrained to reply to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that the farmers were not whining for a duty. We have never required them to whine for anything. We have never exercised patronage so far as they are concerned. We have struggled to make payments to the farmers in respect of their wheat at the earliest possible moment. We went into debt to the extent of &#163;20,000,000 in order to help them at a time when the weevil and mice were destroying their wheat. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has said that we are behind to-day in our payments. That is not so. The Wheat Board has never been behind in any of its payments. As a matter of fact, we have paid &#163;7,000,000 more than we have received from the sale of wheat up to&#39; date, and have a bank overdraft to that extent. In such circumstances how can it be claimed that we are behind in our payments? In 1915-16 we had to buy large quantities of galvanized iron to keep the mice and the weevil out of the wheat stacks. We paid for that iron an average price of about &#163;55 per ton, and to-day it is worth some hundreds of thousands of pounds At the present moment there is probably &#163;750,000 worth of iron and timber surrounding the wheat stacks, but no one can tell what it will Bring when we submit it to public auction. There is still a fraction owing in respect of the 1915-16 Pool, but as against it we have this splendid asset of iron and timber. The accounts of the Wheat Pool are audited by public accountants, and published from time to time. I do not believe in wheat scrip, and have always declined to express an opinion as to its value, since I object to gambling in foodstuffs. Day after day I am asked what wheat scrip is likely to bring, and the only answer I give is that the people should hold their scrip, because, as I have, just- said, I object to gambling in connexion with foodstuffs. The system of issuing scrip was started not by the Commonwealth, but by the States. Returning to the item under consideration, I would remind the Committee that the duty is an old one, and I believe it will be useful to us when we are negotiating for reciprocal Tariffs with other parts of the Empire. It might be of advantage to us when arranging a reciprocal Tariff with Canada. If, owing to serious drought,  Ave  had to import wheat we could make an arrangement with Canada to supply us, or arrange to supply Canada in time of need. No revenue is collected under this item, and the chances are that in the &#169;vent of a serious drought the duty would be suspended. I ask the Committee to allow it to stand. In this Tariff there are many items which will assist us in making reciprocal arrangements with other countries? New Zealand, for instance, does not produce sufficient wheat to meet her requirements, and we might be able to make a reciprocal arrangement with that Dominion in regard to wheat and timber. At one time I found it impossible to get in Australia suitable timber for the making of butter boxes. Large quantities of New Zealand timber are used for that purpose, and we might offer to give New Zealand certain privileges in regard to our wheat in return for preferential treatment in respect of timber f.r butter boxes. Queensland pine is an excellent timber, superior to all others for certain purposes, but I have known Queensland butter to be tainted by the Queensland butter boxes. </para>

When New South Wales some time ago had practically not a bushel of wheat for local consumption, we arranged to supply her with wheat from other States, not at the price we were charging the people overseas, but at the price ruling for it in the State of production plus freight. </para>

            <para>- But it had a larger proportion for export. I hope that we shall not become parochial. Wheat produced in Australia should be available first of all for local consumption, and any surplus should be sold in the best available market I am sorry that the question of the Wheat Board has been raised, but I felt constrained to reply to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator Lynch</inline> that the farmers did not come whining to the Government for a duty. I have never battled for any one so hard as I did to get an extra 6d. per bushel for the wheatgrowers of the Commonwealth. I hope we shall retain this duty, since, it will strengthen the&#39; hands of the Government&#34; in negotiating for reciprocal trade arrangements with other parts of the Empire. </para>

          <para>. - The statement just made by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> calls for a reply. When a self-satisfied Minis ster contends that he has done a good thing for the farmers, it is well, to remind him that there is no justification for his statement. This Government has not handled the farmers&#39; wheat in a satisfactory way. They sold it for 4s. 9d. per bushel at a time when the British Government was guaranteeing 9s. 6d. per bushel, or the highest market value. </para>

            <para>- I was a member of the first Government to form a Wheat Pool. Not &#39;only did the present Government sell the farmers&#39; wheat, at 4s. 9d. a bushel when the British Government were guaranteeing 9s. 6d. a bushel, but they raised the freight on wheat carried in Commonwealth ships from 14s. per ton in 1914 to &#163;7 10s. per ton. This meant an increase from 6&#189;d. and 10&#189;d.  per bushel, as before the war, to 4s. 2d. per bushel; and why? It was in order that the farmers might not see that the freight was being increased so as to bring the wheat sold in Britain in line with the world&#39;s parity. </para>

        <para class="block">I have been waited on by representatives of 86 per cent, of the maize-grower  3  of Victoria, who assure me that in this State the cost of growing maize is at the present, time from 4s. 3d. to 4s. 6d. per bushel, including the cost of delivery to the nearest railway station. Those who are growing maize are mostly settled on small blocks, and their industry is threatened by the competition of black labour in South Africa, Java, and India, and especially of Java. Maize-growing is an industry worthy to be encouraged with adequate protection. Australia should at least supply her own demand for maize, but she has hitherto been- a. large importer of that cereal. A good deal of maize is grown in Victoria, and, I think, in the northern States, too, by returned soldiers. The Tariff liberally protects the manufacturers of maize products, such as starch,, glucose, and cornflour; but the growing of maize is not encouraged as it should be, and consequently in every State the area under crop has decreased considerably during the last ten years. The highly-protected manufacturers of maize products have in Victoria threatened the maize-growers that if they will not contract to sell the coming season&#39;s maize at 3s. 6d. a bushel they will get their supplies from Java. </para>

            <para>- Maize-growing gives employment to more labour per acre than any other crop, the cobs having to be picked by hand. In the period between 1903 and 1913 the average price of maize in Australia was 3s. 6d. a bushel, but nowadays the cost of growing maize is twice what it was then. Yet the highly -protected manufacturers of maize products are trying to force the Victorian growers to sell forward at what was the average price nearly ten years ago, and, as I have stated, the present cost of production, is between 4s. 3d. and 4s. 6d. per bushel. There are thousands of acres of land along our rivers suitable for maize-growing, and if that land were put under maize it would lead to closer settlement, and give a great deal of employment. Australia&#39;s production of maize averages from 8,000,000 to 9,000,000 bushels annually, whereas the black labour of India produces 80,000,000 bushels, and that of South Africa 34,000,000 bushels per annum. In i918, the last year for which figures are obtainable, we imported 255,000 bushels of maize. I do not know what Java&#39;s product of maize is, but it&#39; is from that country that it is now proposed to import supplies to compete with the locally-grown maize. It is wrong that a country like Australia, which can grow maize inferior to none, should import that cereal. The maize growers asked for a duty of 4s., but I told them I thought  tha.t a little too much, and that I was prepared to support a duty of 3s. 6d. </para>

          <para>. - I met the representatives of growers from the Snowy River and other maize-growing districts, but the only statement they made in support of their request for a higher duty was that a threat had been made by, a particular  firm  that it would pay only a certain price for maize. I do not think that we can be governed by such statements. There are ways in which we can deal with those who make threats. The real trouble of the maize-growers was caused by the reciprocal Tariff arrangement with South Africa, under&#34; which maize could be imported at ls. per cental. That maize was grown by black labour.&#39; We are not going to repeat our mistake. Under the present Tariff all imported maize will have to pay 2s. per cental. In addition, there is the consideration of freight. </para>

The duty has to be paid upon the price at the port of shipment, plus 10 per cent.

          <para>. - I support the request. Maize growing involves more labour than the cultivation of any other grain. It cannot be carried on wholly with horses or by power implements. A great deal of the work must be performed by hand. There need be no hesitation about increasing the duty for fear that the price of maize might become exorbitantly high. For all purposes, except in regard to the manufac.ture of starch, maizena, and glucose, maize comes into direct competition with other grains. No  One  would buy maize for horse-feed who could get oats, peas, or the like for very much less. Thus there are safeguards against inordinately high prices. . The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> remarked that, in addition to the duty, adequate protection  wa3  afforded by freight costs. A number of Victorian growers waited on me .and informed me that local manufacturers who use maize had announced their intention to import from, Java. Freight can be obtained, or could have been secured recently, at 25s. to 30s. a ton. I doubt whether the maize grown on the Snowy River can be landed at Melbourne at a lower transport cost.- Considerable quantities of maize are grown in New South Wales, and a fair amount is cultivated in Queensland ; but the companies which use maize for the manufacture of glucose and other products are all situated in Melbourne. Thus, the Queensland and New South Wales growers who might desire to dispose of their products to Melbourne &#171; manufacturers would &#39;have to pay actually higher freights than in respect pf importations of maize from Java or South Africa. The alleged additional protection by  way  of freight may be, therefore, disregarded. Melbourne manufacturers  are  very fortunate in having so .large a market as is afforded by the more than 2,000,000 people in New South Wales and the 750,000 population of Queensland. I am strongly of opinion that the request should be agreed to. </para>

          <para>. - Nearly all the maize land in New South Wales is very expensive. It is situated chiefly in river valleys, and among the disadvantages which growers have to face is the danger of periodical floods. These, if they are sustained, are likely to ruin the crops. The maize grown in the Tumut district is said to be the best in the world, in that it is weevil proof. There is also very fine maize grown on the Hawkesbury River lands. But all of these , areas are apt to be flooded, and there are other disabilities to be contended with. Adequate protection should be afforded to assist maize-growers to carry on successfully. </para>

            <para>- It is about time, because surely we are not going to impose an additional duty in the interests of persons utilizing land in Victoria for maize-growing when it is more suitable for the production of cabbages. The land in the Darling Downs, the northern rivers, and the Tumut districts produces excellent maize, and much superior to that raised on . the&#39; inferior soil in the State of Victoria, where the climate is  totally unsuitable for &#171;the production of this commodity. Those who are not banded together in companies and combines should be protected ; and I am considering more particularly the poor unfortunate teamsters, who have to feed their horses well if they are to derive a satisfactory return from the business in which they are engaged. </para>

I was informed that although the maize does not grow to the same height as it does in the south, the plants stool more freely, and, as a result, a larger number of heads are grown on. each .plant. I was also, informed that the majority of the make-growers in that district were Chinese.  </para>

            <para>- If this duty is intended to protect Chinese labour, it is not fair to the struggling farmers in the south, because the effect will be to make it more difficult for growers in the south to raise wheat. Since the time to which I&#34; have referred, I have seen a gentleman who came from Queensland to purchase chaff in the south for his starving stock. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator proposes that we should stabilize the maize-growing industry in the north at the expense of those engaged in agriculture in the south. We need to be very careful in dealing with this matter, because, very often, we need in the south the products of the north. The maizergrowing industry, as I saw it in Queensland, does not require stabilizing, any more than does the growing of potatoes in the Western District of Victoria.&#39; It is very extensive; a large number of settlers are engaged in the industry, and on small farms. What I saw. in Queensland certainly induced me to believe that maize growing can be carried on in that State successfully under the existing duty. </para>
