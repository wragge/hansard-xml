                        <para>. -  It will probably result in a saving of time when we come to consider the schedule to this Bill if, upon the motion for its second reading, honorable senators outline in a general way the particular items in which they are interested, and thus afford the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> an opportunity of examining their representations before those items are dealt with in Committee. It will be accepted as a general principle, I think, by Free Traders and Protectionists alike that big and important industries, which are employing a large number of persons and which are receiving no aid from the Tariff, ought not to be unduly hampered by any attempt upon our part to foster very much smaller industries. In seeking to build up an industry which employs, say, a hundred men, we shall not be justified in burdening a bigger industry which employs, perhaps, five times that number of hands. </para>

                            <para>- There are two classes of industries in Australia. The first class requires to be protected, and it may possibly be able to pass on any duties thus imposed to quite a number of other industries. But there are some industries which cannot possibly pass on any duties which may be levied upon them. Take, for example, most of our primary industries. Neither the wheat industry nor the gold-mining industry can pass on any burdens which may be levied upon them. Upon the other hand, any duty imposed upon the timber industry, which practically finds the whole of its market within our own borders, can be successfully passed on. No Tariff . burden levied upon the wheat or the gold- mining industry can be transferred elsewhere, for the simple reason that they have to sell their products in the markets of the world. They come into competition with the cheap labour of other countries. </para>

                            <para>- Not necessarily. We know that the removal of duties from agricultural implements in some countries has not resulted in making those implements cheaper to the farmers. Some years ago the Harvester Commission, under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> inquired into this question, and its investigations showed that in the Argentine, where there was no duty upon agricultural implements, the farmers were obliged to pay more for those implements than our own farmers were able to purchase them at in Australia, where a high duty was operative. </para>

                            <para>- That is another matter. In regard to anti-dumping legislation, I shall have something to say at a later stage. I repeat that it does not necessarily follow that I favour the abolition of duties upon agricultural machinery in order to relieve our agriculturists of a burden. Those duties may or may not affect that particular industry. I look for assistance for this particular industry in another direction, and hope I shall not be disappointed. We have great industries in this country carrying very great burdens, and we have to consider whether it is for the welfare of Australia that we should foster them or not. If we come to the conclusion that it is for the welfare of Australia that they should be eased in every way possible, then, I think, a very good case can be made out so far as the wheat industry is concerned. I mentioned some industries that could pass on duties or burdens that are placed on them. For instance, the clothing trade, the machinery trade, and the boot trade all sell their products within Australia, and, being protected, are in quite a different position from the agricultural industry or the mining industry. We must remember that the secondary industries, to which I am referring, do very little to pay our way in Australia. The amount of wealth, that comes into the country because of their efforts is very small indeed. It is the gold, the wheat, the wool, and other big industries concerned with our primary products that we have to depend on to square the ledger. They supply the wherewithal to carry on the affairs of State. </para>

                            <para>- It is not a very big market. So far as wheat is concerned, the home market takes only a very small proportion of the whole production. If the wheat producers of Australia relied wholly on the home market, it would be a very poor industry indeed, and I might say the same regarding meat, wool, and gold. If our export trade in wheat is allowed to decline in the way it has been declining, I am afraid that Australia will get into a very parlous position indeed. I have figures here which show that the position of the gold industry is far from satisfactory. In 1901 it was a most important industry to Australia, and over 70,000 persons were engaged in it. Today it has fallen off so much that one can scarcely believe the figures. According to Knibbs' latest Year-Book, in  1914 2,000,000 ounces of fine gold were produced in Australia; in 1915 the production was 1,900,000 ounces; in 1916 it was 1,600,000 ounces; in 1917 it was 1,400,000 ounces, and for the last year for which he gives figures it was only 1,200,000 ounces. Therefore, there has been a decline of about 200,000 ounces every year, in the output of the gold industry. </para>

                            <para>- I will consider later how far that is possible. I dare say that, on general principles, the honorable senator is right, if it is possible, but I shall show that in some ways it is impossible. The number of persons employed in the gold industry in Australia was 70,000 in 1901, bub five years ago it had fallen to 29,000, four years ago to 26,000, three years ago to 20,000, two years ago to 18,000, and in the last year quoted by <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs</inline> it was only 15,000. There, again, has been a tremendous decline. Honorable senators can easily settle for themselves whether we can place much of a burden upon the fast-dying industry of gold production, which may almost be said to be suffering from galloping consumption. It will be well for us to see what we can do to encourage the industry, rather than to put 'any burden on it. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so, especially where wages have gone up, but if there is any industry in Australia where good wages should be paid, it is in mining of all kinds. No men work so hard, or risk their health to such an extent or' take so much risk of accident, as do those who undertake gold-mining, coal-mining, and other forms of mining. It is an industry in which, if we can possibly afford it, the very best wages should obtain. When we examine the wheat industry, we find the same story of a steady decline, year after year. I quote again from the 13th edition of Knibbs' <inline font-style="italic">Y ear-Book.</inline> I am not taking the year 1914, because, in that year, a most disastrous drought was experienced in all the States. The figures I shall quote are to be found at pages 354 and 355 of the <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book.</inline> Five years ago the number of acres under cultivation for wheat, in Australia, was 12,000,000; in the year following it was only 11,000,000; in the year after that it was only 9,000,000; in the year following it was 7,000,000; and in the last year for which figures are given it had fallen to only 6,000,000. That is a tremendous falling off. </para>

                            <para>- Last year Western Australia had a larger area under wheat than was the case in 1914. For the information of honorable senators, I shall quote the yields in round numbers, apart from last year, which, of course, was a record. The figures were  - In 1915, . 179,000,000 bushels; 1916, 152,000,000; 1917, 114,000,000; 1918, 75,000,000; and 1919, 45,000,000 bushels. These figures show that there has been a remarkable decline in wheat production in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- It will- be more; but it will not nearly approximate the figures for 1916 and 1917. The yield for last year is not given byKnibbs, but honorable senators will agree that it was abnormal, because of the price ruling and the weather conditions which prevailed. Notwithstandingthe high price for wheat, which reached 9s. per bushel, the wheat farmers are finding it difficult to make ends meet, and one wonders how they are to continue on the land when prices come down, which will inevitably be the case. There has been an alarming decline in production in a most important Australian industry, and we shall have to consider whether by placing additional burdens on this industry to foster smaller industries we will not be instrumental in still further reducing the area under cultivation. Are we justified in jeopardizing the interests of the wheat-grower in order to protect the implement manufacturer? If the wheat producer is unduly handicapped there will not be a great demand for the product of the implement manufacturer. </para>

                            <para>- I was coming to that point. Our railway workers are well paid, as also are those who handle the product of the wharfs when it reaches the sea-board. The rural worker engaged in producing wheat has to be satisfied with Is. per hour, whereas the railway worker receives 2s., and the wharf labourer 3s. per hour. The implement manufacturers' employees also receive high wages. . I admit that the farmer depends to a large extent upon the assistance of the labour I have mentioned in marketing his product, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> in moving the second reading of the Bill, mentioned that the farmer is assisted in the production of wheat by the use of up-to-date machinery, which enables him to reduce his costs. The Minister, however, did not lay particular stress on the fact that the man on the land is sweated, and that the return from his product is not equally distributed amongst those who handle it. It is monstrous that the man who toils in our wheat fields should get the smallest share of the product of labour, whilst others who carry the produce to market should work shorter hours and get higher wages and better conditions of labour in every way. This is neither fair nor square. There are many things quite beyond our power to rectify, but I trust the Senate will endeavour to afford relief wherever possible. </para>

                    <para>I have already pointed out that agricultural implements cost more in New Zealand than they do in Australia, notwithstanding the fact that they are admitted into the former country free of duty. New Zealand is no longer a&lt; .wheat-producing country, although the fertility of her soil is undoubted, because when wheat was selling at a low price the New Zealand farmers devoted their attention to other activities which they found more profitable, particularly that of raising fat lambs. In these circumstances, the area under wheat in New Zealand has been considerably reduced, and that Dominion is not now able to supply even her own requirements, which are met by Australia. The cost of agricultural implements in New Zealand is, therefore, not of the importance that it is in Australia, There are, however, Protectionist countries, such as Canada, in direct competition with Australia. Canada is a great wheat-producing country, but agricultural machinery there is only about one-half the price that it is in Australia, because implements which cost £100 in Australia can be purchased in Canada for £60. That is a point that requires to be looked into in order that our farmers may be able to get their agricultural machinery at the same price as is charged in countries with which they have to compete. Our producers are at a sufficient disadvantage already in the matter of ocean freights without being required to pay twice as much for their agricultural implements as, say, the Canadian farmers. Therefore, I cannot understand advocates of Protection in Victoria, particularly that great apostle of Protection, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> continually howling for cheap wheat and protesting against the pooling system, under which the price of last season's wheat was 9s. These advocates mislead people by making it appear that .the Australian consumer has been paying more for his" wheat than is charged in other countries of the world. </para>

                            <para>- That means 6d. in favour of the Australian miller. Taking the prices during and from the war period, wheat has been sold at lower rates in Australia than in any other country in the world. Last year when the price was fixed at 9s., world's parity was 10s. In the previous year the overseas . price all through the season averaged about 12s. per bushel, whereas the Australian consumer got his wheat for 7s. 8d. The <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> notwithstanding that it harangues on "The Great Paradox" from day to day, recently laid special emphasis on the statement that the Australian consumers were unable to get cheap wheat, and so forth, but was careful to conceal  the fact that the people -of other countries were paying  twice as much for their wheat as was charged in Australia. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> seized upon one order placed 'with Germany at7s.6d.per bushel; as against the Australian price i9s. 'That 'journal conveniently forgot that there -'were other orders at other prices, and that if She whole. of the transactions were -averaged the overseas parity would have been nearer <inline font-style="italic">&gt;10a.</inline> than 9s. per- bushel. 1 desire to say a few words -concerning a matter that so far has not received, very much attention at the hands of honorable senators during this debate. I refer to the question of trade reciprocity, Which, was a prominent feature of the first tariff debate in this Parliament. On that occasion -much was made of the benefits that were to accrue to this country from a policy of reciprocal trade with Great Britain. We were told that if we gave the manufacturers of the Mother Country preference in our markets we would receive preferential treatment in the British market.. We have had reciprocity for twenty years, 'but so far have 'received uio '-special benefit from it. I take it that a -Tariff is a business proposition, designed , to increase -wealth production, and that in this matter of reciprocity the advantage should 'be mutual. If we, for sentimental reasons, give Free Trade Britain certain advantages in, our markets, we might very well say that, as one -of the oversea Dominions, we expect similar advantages in the markets of the Mother Country. We ^ 'have a just claim for sympathetic consideration, more especially as at the present moment Britain is considering her own position in this matter. There are signs that should not be ignored by us that the Old Country is at last changing its fiscal views. Great - Britain . now , has , an . anti-dumping, law, quite opposed in its principles to all preconceived Free . Trade ideas, that the best . policy far a country is to buy in the cheapest market. </para>

                            <para>-I am not aware of that, but we know that we. got no preference in the. Old Country. Australia made nothing out of the war. We sacrificed: 60,000 of our . best citizens, and shouldered a- burden of something like £300,000,000 in connexion, with the war, whilst Argentina and. the. mother country of Argentine-, Spain, remained . neutral, and made money out of the- war. We were spending, our' resources on the Empire, and if the Empire is to be something, more than a, name, we- are- entitled, to expect- that our products- will be given- the same preference in the Old Country that- we give here to the products of Great Britain: In the circumstances, I consider it an opportune, time to bring this matter of real, reciprocity 'of trade, well, to the front.

                    <para>In conclusion, I should like to say . that I consider there' are indications of a change of fiscal faith in the Old Land. I think that such a change will be forced upon, the  authorities' there before long, There: are" more Conferences than that to which Mr: Hughes' has been- delegated going on! in London at the- present times Most important negotiations! are! at pre* sent being carried on between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George and' the head of the- Irish Republic; De- Valera I hope; and I am con* fident that it is- the; hope also of every other- member of the 'Senate, that the- two peoples' will shortly- come &lt; together in peace; and- will find it possible- to remain within the one Empire. In my view,: it would be- a misfortune if anything. were to- prevent Ireland continuing' within the British Empire. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline> I thank honorable senators for granting me an extension of time. I shall not trespass much longer on their patience:- I should like, to say that&gt; in my opinion, Ireland has. a great deal more to lose by being outside the British Empire than by being within it. If she  were  an. independent Republic, she would have ta provide an- army  and navy to- de? fend 'herself 'against  some   of the bigger nations of the'world. I believe that the great majority- of ' Irishmen' at Home and abroad' desire that Ireland 'should remain within the'Ernpire; wben'the'-unfdrtu-nate antipathy and1 hatred- between the peoples have1 been brought to an- end by the reasoning 'out of their differences1.' If Ireland remains within the1 Empire,-' and is granted', in common with- the- Overseas Dominions, the right ta'make- her own laws, and fiscal autonomy; it-  seems  certain that she- will adopt' the- Protectionist principle of fiscalism. If she' should do so, Great Britain would'then have greater season to- change her - fiscal1 faith. It is impossible, to believe that with so many colonies and overseas. Dominions, the heart of the Empire can. go on  for ever  without reviewing her fiscal, policy to suit the -altering circumstances. I believe that Great Britain is about to undergo fiscal changes. We have a right to present to the consideration of the... people of that country, the- adoption of reciprocity-, of  trade with Australia that will be to their and our advantage Great Britain cannot hope to supply her own requirements in wheat. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> pointed out the other day, Canada and Australia can supply all the wheat Great Britain requires. At the present time, she gives neutral, and even enemy, countries the same advantages in her market that she extends to her own Dominions; and we are, I think, entitled to greater consideration at her hands. So far as I was able to sound the opinions of the people I met in the Old Land, I am satisfied that they would generally be prepared to give an affirmative reply to a request by Australia for preferential treatment in the way I have suggested. Reciprocity of trade should be adopted between the various component parts of the Empire and the Old Land, and it should prove beneficial to all. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall be as brief as the circumstances will allow in supporting the second reading of the Bill. I do not expect to have to depend upon the courtesy of honorable senators for an extension of my time. This is not the first discussion of a Tariff with which I have been associated in the Senate. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, I well remember the time when the first Protectionist Tariff was introduced in this Parliament. The honorable senator was slightly in error in his references to it. He seemed to imply that in that first Federal Tariff provision was made for a preference to Great Britain. That was not the case. It was a general Tariff, applicable equally to imports from all countries. It was not until some years later that we adopted the principle of giving a preference in the Tariff to goods imported from Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- In 1907-8. The first Federal Tariff was discussed at great length in both Houses of this Parliament, and reciprocity of trade was very strongly advocated at the time in Parliament, in the press, and on public platforms. It was foreshadowed by Ministers, but no definite proposal to give it effect was then introduced. I am very glad to welcome this particular measure, <inline font-style="italic">not,</inline> perhaps, in all its details, but gene rally speaking. First of all, it purports to give protection to all Australian industries by the imposition of a general Tariff upon goods coming into the Commonwealth from abroad. Provision is made for a preference to Great - Britain. That preference was first introduced as a feature of our Tariff legislation in the Tariff of 1907-1908. It was introduced by a Government of which I was a member, and I had the honour, in conjunction with a fellow senator, of piloting that measure through this chamber. That was the first instance of the granting by us of a preference to the Old Country. Although at the time we were ridiculed, especially by the Free Trade press, because it was alleged the extent of the preference was insignificant, the preferences set out in the Government proposals were carried. Notwithstanding that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's experience in Scotland leads him to conclude that quite a number of persons there were unaware of the fact that British goods received a preference upon entry into the Commonwealth, I know that in the United Kingdom the circumstance was not entirely unknown. Plenty of people there were only too eager to take advantage of that preference. They thoroughly appreciated it. But quite apart from those who were commercially interested, many of the press organs in the United Kingdom referred from time to time to : this preference, and actually advocated what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has suggested this afternoon, namely, that there should be something in the nature of reciprocity. They argued that inasmuch as Australia had given a preference in Tariff matters to goods from the United Kingdom, and that Canada had acted similarly, it was the duty of Britain so to arrange its Tariff as to reciprocate that preference. However, we have now recognised the advantages arising from this system of preference. Should the system ultimately result in reciprocity, I shall welcome that. But we ought not to hesitate to extend a preference to the United Kingdom until we are assured that we shall receive reciprocal treatment. Free Trade has been in vogue in the United Kingdom for the better part of a century - for something like eighty years - and, con* sequently, it has become second nature to the people there. The large mass of public opinion there which has accepted Free </para>

                    <para class="block">Trade as axiomatic is very difficult to move. There are other questions which agitate the public mind of Britain beside the fiscal question. There are, " for example, matters affecting the Empire ae a whole, matters affecting the domestic concerns of the United Kingdom as a whole, and matters affecting the domestic concerns of the component parts of the United Kingdom. Those questions are very close to the inhabitants of Britain. They are very important and vital, and when they are present to the mind of a public which- has accepted Free Trade as an axiomatic principle, it is very difficult to divert attention from them to a fiscal question, which, to many persons, seems to be a purely academic matter. For that reason I think that we ought to continue to grant a preference to Great Britain instead of waiting until the people of that country have considered the problems to which I have directed attention, and have resolved to re-adjust their fiscal relations with other portions of the Empire. If they do so re-adjust their fiscal relations, it will only be under the stress of some great necessity. That the war has contributed to some such result is undoubted. Through it, public attention has been directed to the isolated position in which Great Britain has stood in relation- to Tariff matters. Perhaps more attention is now being given to the subject than was ever devoted to it previously. It is true that some twenty years ago attention was directed to it, but that fact was wholly due to the advocacy' of a very forceful and prominent personality - I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Chamberlain. With his death a great deal of the interest which had been stimulates? in the subject waned, and almost disappeared. Since then the war has re-awakened interest in it. But the war has also awakened interest in other questions, and it is the measure df importance and vitality which the British public attribute to each of these which will determine  the order in which they will receive consideration. I cannot believe that other issues, particularly of a domestic character, will be subordinated by the people of Great Britain to the question of Free Trade <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> Protection. But whether they are or not, we are quite justified by past experience, and by our hope of future results, in perpetuating the principle of granting a preference to goods entering </para>
                    <para class="block">Australia from the United Kingdom. As. far back as 1897, Canada, under the leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier, adopted the principle of preferential trade with the United Kingdom. Broadly speaking, that preference- was founded upon the principle that there should be a reduction of 33$ per dent, of the duty upon all goods entering Canada from the United Kingdom. </para>

                            <para>- It is quite true tha he gave his allegiance to Free Trade principles. But he knew too much to attempt to give practical effect to those principles in the form of a policy. Probably he succeeded in reconciling his poli-' tical conscience with the retention of his office as Prime Minister, by reducing the Canadian Tariff all round to the extent of one-third upon goods from the United Kingdom. It was not until 1907-8 that we followed his example, although we did not adopt his particular method. Instead we made specific reductions in favour of Great Britain upon specific items. But we had the .advantage of the experience of Canada in that connexion, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and others who were here at the time will confirm"" my statement that one of the matters which we had then to consider was the possibility of outside countries sending their goods to Australia through the United Kingdom. Whilst that particular Tariff was before Parliament it was found necessary to insert in it a provision that the preference should apply only to goods which were the product " pf the United Kingdom. This Bill goes further than that. It contains an intermediate Tariff - a Tariff which, under certain circumstances, may be applied to goods imported into Australia from other parts of the British Empire, or, indeed, from other countries. I think that that is a very desirable provision. A Tariff containing only one column is a very inelastic Tariff. It may become desirable, for example, to extend specially favoured treatment to particular countries, and it -may be inexpedient or inconvenient for the matter to be brought before Parliament and dealt with specifically. If, therefore, when passing a Tariff of this character, Parliament chooses, having regard to the industries of the country as a whole, to invest the Governor-General in Council or some other authority with.1 power- to  make the duties set out in the intermediate Tariff applicable to goods from British Possessions or from some other country, it has" the right 'to do- so. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. There is" a Bill dealing with the creation of a Tariff Board which, I understand, we shall shortly be invited to consider, and still' another- measure relating to the Tariff has been foreshadowed.  Reference was made to the latter by the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> by way of interjection during the concluding portion, of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's speech this afternoon. He mentioned the. matter of exchange. Before we have finally dealt with Tariff legislation, we shall be asked to consider a Bill' which purports to overcome what may be regarded as abnormalities due to fluctuations in exchange. We know that the world has been considerably disturbed by the war, and in no countries more than in those which were actual participants. Our Allies have all been considerably disturbed, and their exchanges have been prejudicially affected; but neutral countries like- Switzerland, Holland, Sweden, and Norway have not been affected in their exchanges, while one - of the' results of the. war to both the 4united -States of' America and Japan has been that their currency or exchange has appreciated instead of depreciating.

                    <para class="block">I saw originally that there was in these proposals an intermediate Tariff column that was to be applicable, in certain circumstances, to foreign countries, I hoped that it was to enable the Commonwealth, through its Tariff, for the future to reciprocate the sentiments of alliance and brotherliness-in-arms with us which had characterized the British, French, Italian, and other allied nations, during the war. I entertained that hope until quite recently; but now I understand that a Bill has been introduced to' Parliament which has for its object not that at all, but the very opposite to what I conceived to be the purpose of the intermediate column in the Tariff schedule. </para>

                            <para>- I presume we shall ; but -this is not simply confined to trade. We offer preference to Great Britain without asking for anything in return. I believe that this is a good principle, and as I was a member of the Government that was first responsible for applying such principles to our Tariff legislation, I shall support it. Even if it took Great Britain fifty years to change its fiscal faith, I would still support preference to the United Kingdom in any Tariff that came -before me for consideration. </para>

                            <para>- Then, I say, let us have reciprocity if it comes, and let us welcome it when it does come; but let us give preference whether reciprocity follows or not. I thought at first that the motive for the introduction of the intermediate column in the schedule was to give consideration to those who had recently been ' brothers and Allies in arms with us, because of what they are suffer? ing in their currencies to-day in consequence of their participation shoulder to shoulder with us in the recent war. I think, however, that it is not so inteifded, because I hear of a Bill which is being introduced in another place, and which will have precisely the opposite effect. I probably could not refer to that Bill at all if it were not that the intermediate column 'in this schedule would seem to indicate- the extension to allied countries of some such treatment as we are offering to Great Britain; </para>

                            <para>- No doubt; but I thought when I first saw it that it would go further than mere reciprocity, and enable the Government of the Commonwealth to say to other countries, " Your position is rather a difficult one, and that difficulty has been brought about because you and we have been fighting together for civilization, right, and justice. We have power under the intermediate Tariff column to enable you to trade with us under advantageous conditions." I am afraid, however, that that is not the way in which the power is going to be exercised. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent it being done, but the ominous sounds of the approach of another Bill make me feel that it is not one of the purposes of the intermediate column. </para>

                    <para>I have said that broadly, generally, and in the main, I support this Bill. I do not go so far as the Minister, and support it. on the claim that it is an expression of scientific Protection. I very much doubt if we can ever put forward here or elsewhere, any particular Tariff schedule, and say with confidence, " This is an expression in Tariff form of scientific Protection." The question of the Tariff is too complicated, extensive, and detailed to enable us to say, as we can of a general principle, that it is scientific. </para>

                            <para>- It is not on those grounds, at any rate, that I would support' it in the main. After all, wet have to put our Tariff -duties upon numerous 'items. ' There are items appearing in a Tariff schedule descriptive of articles -which members have sometimes heard of for the' first time when they have seen them in the schedule. I know that was the experience of quite a number of members with the items which! appeared in the first Tariff schedule, and I have no doubt that it is true, so far as' members of this Parliament are concerned, of a number of items enumerated in the schedule mow, before us. In dealing with matters so minutely as that, we frequently. and that the finished product of one industry is the raw material of another. ' A conflict then arises as to whether that finished article is to be allowed, to be imported as raw material for the second industry without a duty upon it. Those who are engaged in its production or manufacture in the Commonwealth say "No; this is an industry which we (are building up for the Commonwealth. There is a great demand for this particular article for such and such a- manufacture, and we want a duty on it to protect our industry." But those concerned with the second industry, or second manufacture, which uses that product as a raw material, say, "It is true that they are making attempts to produce it in Australia, but, so far, owing to the little experience they have had, and the small demand that has been made upon them, they are not turning out an article such as has been turned out for generations in some country across the sea, audit we are ever expected to manufacture and turn out a finished product that is worthy of our industry, we must get the best raw material, and, therefore, we must be allowed to import this article from abroad." So we have competition between two industries in Australia, and we have to take all the circumstances into consideration and decide whether we shall protect 'both or. sacrifice one ; whether we shall apply Free Trade to what I may call the minor industry, and let its product be looked on  when imported as a raw material for the purpose of the second industry. That is a condition of affairs which frequently confronts those who are engaged in preparing or considering Tariffs. So, as every set of circumstances has to be considered, one might almost say, separately, it is very hard to say that the same rule applies ' throughout to each item in the schedule. It is for that and other - reasons that I hold that one can hardly properly designate a Tariff schedule as scientific. The best- that one can say of a schedule of this character which one is supporting is that, to his mind, -it is of a common-sense and practical character: that is, that it appears to him, as a Protectionist, that it extends and applies Protection in' a commonsense and practical way to the manifold industries of Australia, both those in existence and those which can be reasonably and suitably encouraged to come into existence. </para>

I shall be glad, at any time and all times, tb support any proposals which have for their object, and may reasonably be expected to achieve,, the protection of the manufacturers or producers, the protection of the employees in so far as wages and labour conditions are concerned, and the protection of the general public from profiteering or from unreasonable prices. </para>

                            <para>- Well, we did not think that they could not do it, but we thought they were not able to do it, in connexion with particular industries and in relation to the Tariff itself, quickly enough. The Ministry  Avith  which I was associated in 1907-8. announced to Australia, through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> a policy known as the New Protection, which embraced those three provisions. We as a Legislature endeavoured to achieve that object in the well-known Harvester case. We passed a heavy import duty on harvesters, and then imposed a substantial, but not so heavy, Excise duty upon the locally-made harvester, and by the amount of that Excise duty we lessened the Protection that was given against the imported article. Thus, supposing the imported harvester had a duty on it of £30, and the locally-produced harvester had. an Excise duty on it of £10, the effective Protection was only the difference of £20? We made a further provision that if the manufacturer of the locally-produced harvester satisfied the authorities that he was paying a reasonable wage to his employees and was selling his implements at a fair price, the Excise duty would be remitted. I have quoted these figures from memory, and, although they may not be exact, they give an idea of the form of legislation which was passed at that time. t, </para>

We have had Tariffs since 1901, when moderate Protection was granted ; in 1907 and 1908 more substantial Protection was given, and now we have even a more advanced Protective schedule. I do not think there is very much of a Free Trade school in Australia, as, broadly and generally speaking, the people of the Commonwealth feel committed to a policy of Protection, and I do not think there is much to be gained in discussing, in an academic fashion, the relative merits and demerits of the, two policies. </para>

Let us take the Tariff duties imposed by this Parliament upon some particular commodity which is used fairly generally. We hoped that the result of that duty would be to promote the establishment in the Commonwealth of an industry which would furnish a general requirement, and . if it does not do that the duty imposed is not a protective duty, but a revenue-producing one. It really amounts to taxing the community for the purpose of swelling the revenue, and not for the incidental advantage of establishing an industry to create ^employment. </para>

                            <para>- Very likely. -But I am sure the honorable senator is not supporting the duties on some items to overcome that. When the Tariff was originally introduced, certain duties imposed on cinematograph films were considerably increased in another place, particularly on films produced in countries outside of Great Britain. Does any one suggest that the imposition of such duties will bring into being in Australia an industry which will produce films to take the place of those which were previously imported, say, from America ? </para>

                    <para>In discussing the items in Committee we may possibly find some duties which will not promote the growth of industries' in Australia, and consequently will only be the* means of imposing a further burden upon the people. We shall, therefore, have to "decide whether it is advantageous or not tb use the Tariff for raising revenue; and if we are satisfied that it is not, but that primarily, as far as we can, we should use it for protective purposes, we shall have to decide what will bo the result of the removal of a duty. These are matters that we shall have to consider in connexion with any requests that we may make. </para>
                    <para>From time to time I have noticed discussions outside of Parliament as to the duty of the Senate. It has been suggested that this Chamber would not give much consideration to the items in the schedule, and in other quarters it has been said that the Senate has power only to " suggest." I do not know where the word " suggest," which is so frequently used in this connexion, had its origin, because the Senate has power to request .the amendment of an item. I may say, for the benefit of those honorable senators who were not here when the last Tariff was discussed' in this Chamber, in January, 1908, and onwards, that the Senate successfully, and with advantage, exercised its powers and requested increases on a large number of items. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not intend to take up much time in discussing this measure, or to attempt to add to the information which has already been submitted to the Senate. I have listened with interest to the instructive speeches on the Tariff, and I think it right that I should, at this juncture, 'briefly express my views on the question of Protection <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> Free Trade. I am strongly in favour of adequate Protection being afforded to Australian industries, and I gave my pledge in that direction on public platforms during the recent election campaign. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> with a twinkle in his eye, said that this was a scientific" Tariff;  His  remarks were received with some amount of merriment by honorable senators, so  we  may gather that neither he nor we are of that opinion. As a matter of fact. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating;</inline> said that even if it were a scientific Tariff now so varying are the conditions in industry that it may be absolutely unscientific, to-morrow. But, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has. pointed out. that the Tariff is an . honest attempt to give adequate Protection to Australian industries, and in. that sense, generally, I intend to support it. I represent portion of the Commonwealth which, is largely interested in primary production, but with unselfish. generosity the people of South Australia are prepared to accept what is best for the whole of the Commonwealth. I take it that no-member of this august chamber is sent here to represent and protect only the interests of his own State. Circumstances may arise in which it would be the duty of an honorable senator to vote against the interests of his own State if they conflicted with the interests of the Commonwealth.I believe in being a good Australian first and a good South Australian next, and I -think this, sentiment is indorsed by every member ; of this Chamber. I am satisfied that if State interests conflicted with Australian interests, honorable senators would place the interests, of Australia first. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Inthe Tariff there are several anomalies which it will be the; duty of this Senate to remedy. Of course there are anomalies in all Tariffs. Recently I was privileged to visit a factory lately established in South Australia for the- manufacture of French clay, and chalks and similar- articles. During my visit I was informed that barytes is protected "under this Tariff to the extent of <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> per ton, but that the protection is of no avail because kaolin and silicates are not mentioned in the schedule. This is an anomaly which I. intend to bring before honorable: senators when we reach, the Committee stage of the measure, so that it may be removed. The company to which I refer have millions of tons of silicates in sight, and they could provide for the requirements of the whole of Australia without the slightest difficulty. Many other industries are affected by the Tariff:; but I do not intend at this stage to occupy honorable' senators' time- by "enumerating them. I simply wish to define my view of the Tariff as affording adequate protection, for Australian industries. I believe it is impossible now to discuss in any academic way the relative rrieritsi of Free Trade and Protection. .  I think, we were' sent here by the people, to pass an effective Protective Tariff, and with that end: in view I intend to support the Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - During the. course, of the debate I have been struck with the wonderful results that may be obtained by quoting figures, but it appears to me that figures, or groups of figures, to be of any value in an argument, must be capable of analysis to the last degree. For -instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> referred to the remarkable progress, made by New South "Wales under Free Trade- as compared with Victoria under Protection during the period from 1870 to 1900. He might have gone a step further and .revealed the marvellous progress which . New South Wales .has made. since 1901 up to. the present day as compared with Victoria, .both States being under Protection. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie referred to the decline in the numbers of men employed in the gold mining industry, and admitted that various causes were responsible for this condition of affairs. He might have referred to the great decline in the number employed in the mining industry in, say, Ballarat at present as compared with thirty years ago, and yet show that Ballarat is a very flourishing city. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>While all the speeches have been intensely interesting, I feel that the most important discussion on this Tariff will take place when the Bill is in Committee. At the same time, I want to take advantage of. this opportunity to state my attitude. I claim to -be a Protectionist. By this I mean that I want to do all I possibly can to protect our secondary industries by imposing high Customs duties on those articles which can and should be manufactured here. There is no doubt that we were at a great disadvantage during the war, because our secondary industries were not sufficiently developed to supply all our requirements. We then found ourselves practically isolated, and realized more keenly than ever before the disability of being' situated so far distant from the commercial centres of the world. We were at the mercy of, and exploited by, the merchants of America, Japan, and some other countries. In fact, our position was much; like the position of the American States during the war of American independence. Alexander Hamilton, the great statesman of that time, and, I believe, the greatest statesman the United States, has produced, was then Secretary to the Treasury .in the Washington .Administration, and formulated the policy for. the new republic. This policy aimed at the encouragement, of manufacturing industries by ,the imposition of high Customs duties, though .he went .out of office before it could be brought into operation. Speaking of the very great difficulties which the. States had -experienced during the war, he said - </para>
                    <para>The extreme embarrassments of the United States during the late war, from an incapacity to supply themselves, -are still .matters of keen recollection. <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> future war might be. expected to again exemplify the mischief and danger, of a situation to which that incapacity is still in too great a degree applicable unless changed by timely .and vigorous exertion. To effect that change -is .the next great work to be accomplished. </para>
                    <para class="block">Those words are equally applicable to Australia to-day,, because- we suffered the same disadvantages and experienced the same difficulties. Though, perhaps, we may not be anticipating another war in the near future., we are making preparations in regard to our naval and military establishments, .and I venture to -say that no scheme of preparation for any future war would be complete that did not seek to render the Commonwealth independent, commercially and industrially, of other -countries. </para>
                    <para>Whether the fiscal policy of the Commonwealth should be Free Trade or Protection was settled in .the early days of Federation'. The decision then was in 'favour of Protection for Australian industries, and, judging by the progress of this Bill through another place, we can safely say that the majority of our people are in favour of maintaining and developing that policy. I was a little surprised,, therefore, that the discussion in this Chamber should have been in the nature of a debate as to the 'relative merits of the two systems. In 'my simplicity I imagined the . debate would merely indicate the length to which honorable- senators were prepared' to go in taxing : goods 'coming into Australia: For my part, I want to see this country as nearly as possible self-supporting. There -is -no reason -why? it should not be because we* have, within .-our borders, the raw materials "for practically all the essential industries ; we have wonderful deposits of the purest iron ore in the -world -and abundance of coal. We are all glad of the progress that has been made in the development of the iron industry in Australia. - If I- had my way I would not  allow a single rail to be laid in the Commonwealth unless it was produced in the furnaces of this country. And so with regard to our woollen industry. It is a subject of amazement to people who come here that we, who produce the finest wool in the World, should have to send it 12,000 miles over the seas and bring it back in the shape of woollen cloth. The same' might be said of many other industries. The great American statesman to whom I referred also had something important to. say on this subject of building up the home industries. </para>

A  nation which was content to drift along the path of least resistance must suffer the inconveniences and dangers of a lopsided development.  A  nation in which the manufacturing or the agricultural interest was in an overwhelming predominance would never be proof against foreign hostility or catastrophe as a nation might hope to be which maintained the principle of a strong internal market for commodities of every kind. </para>

                    <para>I am not in favour of imposing Customs duties indiscriminately. If I am asked to support the imposition of a duty upon any article, I want to be assured that a reasonable amount of capital is to be invested in the industry here, and to be assured, too, that it will give employment to a considerable number of our people. There are a number of items in the schedule to which it is likely I shall propose amendments when we come to deal with them in Committee. I might give an instance of one industry which will altogether employ not more than about fifty people. It is not worth our while to impose Protective duties for the support of such an industry when that involves penalizing the whole of the community to put money into the pockets of perhaps a single firm. </para>

That was done last year, and the result was an eye-opener, not only to the people of South Australia, but to visitors to the exhibition from other States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> and I have been associated in this work for some time. We have endeavoured to do something to break down the unreasoning prejudice that exists amongst little Australians against goods of Australian manufacture. To a good many people, it has been sufficient to mention that an article is Australian-made to prevent them buying it. That unreasoning prejudice has, to a large extent, been broken down. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> referred to this matter when he said that we need a national spirit. That is so, and that national spirit has grown greatly within the last few years. In 1914 our men left Australia to take part in the great war. On the 25th April, 1915, those men made the name of Australia ring around the world. I date the great advance in the growth of the Australian national spirit from that day. Our people have been proud of the achievements of our soldiers, and it was admitted on all sides that our men were the best clothed, the  be3t  shod, and best equipped of all the troops engaged in the war. A great many of those who went to the war had never previously left the shores of Australia. They have  since seen other countries, und have come back convinced that Australia is the best country in the world, and that what is good enough for Australia is good enough for them. The Australian national spirit will be advanced by those men, and they will greatly help to make the operation of this Tariff a success. </para>

                    <para>Something was said during the debate about the artisans of Australia. I wish to add my testimony to the expression of opinion of their worth. I believe that, on the whole, our artisans are more capable than are those of any other part of the world. Only a short time ago I was speaking to the general manager of large engineering works north of Adelaide. He is a man of great experience, not only in England, but also in America, where he had charge of large numbers of men. Speaking to me of the men under him in Adelaide, he said, " These men are the finest class of workmen I have ever had under my charge." I regard that statement,, coming from a man of such wide experience, as a great tribute to the qualities of Australian workmen. </para>
                    <para>Reference has been made to the drift of population to the metropolitan cities. This is true of Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. I suppose that' one-half the people of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia are to be found settled within the areas of the capitals of those States. </para>

                    <para>Another matter upon which I should like to touch was referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> who, I think, emphasized one of the most important*, points that have been raised during this debate. He referred to the attitude of organized labour. This Parliament is convinced ' that it is of the utmost importance to the Commonwealth that secondary industries should be developed here as fully as possible. To that end we are asked to impose duties of Customs which it is hoped will" be effective. But our labours in that direction will go for naught unless all sections of the community, employers and employees alike, co-operate to make our Protective policy successful. The Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> told us that English firms are introducing capital to the extent of £100,000,000 for the establishment of industries here.. We must co-operate with them as fully as possible. There must be no unnecessary dislocation of industry. It must be realized that the Tariff is designed for the benefit of Australia as a whole, and not of a particular class. It behoves all sections of the community to do their -utmost to insure its success. </para>
                    <para>I shall support the Bill, but as I have indicated, there are a number of items in the schedule in regard to which I may deem it necessary to offer certain suggestions for amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not intend to speak at any length in supporting to a large degree, though not <inline font-style="italic">in toto,</inline> the Tariff submitted in another 'place so ably by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> and by his representative in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell).</inline> It may be necessary for me to preface my remarks by emphasizing the fact that' I am not a Free Trader. A,t the same time, I am greatly against mie of thumb protection, or the protection of industries which, in my opinion, do not require assistance. The imposition of protective duties when unnecessary tends merely to increase the cost of living to the, community. I favour protection for young or struggling industries, but not for industries that are well established, and in the hands of persons who, in the favoured conditions that prevail in this country, are making fortunes. Parents naturally (protect their children, but when the children have grown to be adults, have accumulated property, and entered into businesses or professions, their, parents do not continue to feed them.I maintain that some industries in. which fortunes are being made 'in this country are under his Tariff unnecessarily protected. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> when he speaks of the necessity for. encouraging the manufacture here of our raw products. I believe in Australian goods for Australian people. I, of course, believe in the development of our great iron  industry. But. I cannot follow SenatorVardon in his references, to wool. In this . country we produce the most, the best, and the cheapest wool in the world. Our woollen manufacturers are making fortunes. The introduction of Protection has not given the results we hoped for in the manufacture of our wool here instead of its export in the raw state. I shall deal later at some length with this aspect of the Tariff. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I say that it is our duty as public men in Australia to break down the prejudice against Australian-manufactured goods. In this wonderfully productive country, with a versatile and clever people, there is practically nothing that we cannot produce as well as it can be produced in any other part of the world. It is an acknowledged fact that our great volunteer Army was the best-equipped army engaged in the war. In Australia, we not only turned out in our own Federal factory the best clothing I have ever seen, and that in great variety, but our harness, boots, and military equipment generally were acknowledged to be second to none. There is still, however, existing some of the old prejudice against things Australian as there is against Australianbred stud stock. You have only to put the magic word "imported" after the name of a billy goat and he will bring more money at public auction than if that magic word is not printed after his name. It is the same with practically everything else bred in Australia. An imported cat will bring more than a cat. bred in Australia, because there is amongst some people the foolish idea that anything imported must he better than anything we can produce here. As a matter of fact, in the great majority of cases we produce in this country articles quite as good as those which are imported. We have some artificial protection, which must tend to an unnecessarily high cost of living. I believe in protecting necessary and young industries, but I do not believe in increasing the cost of commodities by (making them artificially dear, as unnecessarily high Customs duties must do. </para>
                    <para>I am glad to see that in the schedule to this Bill preference is given to the Mother Country, although we have not had a similar preference in return. I am strongly in favour of Imperialpreference, but I have a grievance against Great Britain because of her treatment of Australian products during the wax, said at the present time.Throughoutthe war, and to this date, the ImperialGovernment have been giving a preference to Argentine as against Australian meat. They have been taking the Argentine article first, and have been paying higher prices for it than they pay for Australian meat. I think it is very necessary in the interests ofAustraliathat we should vigorously protest against that, more particularly at a time when there is a glut of our raw products and we cannot obtain prices for them which will pay our producers. We should make a very strong protest through our able Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who, instead of being hastily summoned back to attend to comparatively trivial affairs here, should be left, for the present, on the other side of the world, where he is doing magnificent work for the Commonwealth. </para>

Most of. us believe: in high wages;. but the increase in the. cost of living during recent years has been in greater- ratio: than has the increase' in wages: . I ' think that our Statistician, who so ably puts before us quarterly statements showing, amongst other things* the cost of living in Australia, should include in those statements the' cost* of clothing. Hitherto he has- dealt only with the cost of foodstuffs, plus rent. As clothing&gt; enters so: largely 'into the cost of living, I suggest that in future statistics relatingHb' that item' should' be' included in his statements1.: Considering' the low price of our raw - commodities in Australia,the high cost of living to our people is a scandal I speak for the man upon the land', 'who 'is  being'  very unfairly treated.' It is the producer upon whom the people of the cities live. We are an exporting nation, and1 yet' we make the man ' upon* the land, who" produces practically the - whole ofour" wealth, pay through the nose for everything that he uses. Every one of his tools, of trade "is so .  '.highly prbr {ecte.d thaV 'his- cost: of. pro'ductipn has been greatly increased.

                            <para>- I have sufficient courage to say exactly what' I" think. Our legislation has not been1 sympathetic enough to- our- out-back residents1.- People are being- driven" off the land to-day, and are being- crowded together- in 'Sydney and Melbourne: Instead of being en^ eouraged' to- occupy this  dangerously empty -continent, the drift of population is -all to- out cities. In some' respects; this Tariff' wilr accentuate- that movement. Under its- operation- a number of industries' will be -built' up which could not live1 if only a reasonable measure 'of protection were' extended' to them. If people are1 to enjoy such good . times -in our cities, what inducement will there be for them to- go put into the country ? We have had, this drift to the cities*' even in seasons - pf prosperity -to- tie producer; vvhen, owing to the -war, our primary products were realizing high prices. But  what is the outlook to-day ? There is a less area under cultivation in Australia than there was twenty years ago, there are. 30,000,000 less sheep than there were in 1896, there are . fewer cattle, and fewer horses. When, then, is . the position likely to be when everything we produce, such as wool, meat, and most of our primary products, is realizing' much less than its cost of production? Everything that the producer has to buy is dear on account of high Protection and high wages. Everything that he has to sell musk be sold at the world's parity, and, owing to the scandalously high freights which obtain, he is compelled to accept ridiculously low prices for his products. The price of Australian lamb in London to-day is1s.1d. per lb., but the price at which exporters are prepared to operate during the next few months is only 5½d. per lb. ; the difference being largely accounted for by excessively high freights. </para>

Twopence per lb. is being offered for mutton in Australia to-day, and 20s. per 100 pounds for beef. The latter, therefore, is commanding only 2.4d. per lb.

                    <para>Although wool and meat are being sold at a very low price, our people are still being charged high prices for both clothing and food. What will be the price of Australian meat in the world's market when the 5,000,000 carcasses of Australian lambs, which are just about to. be sent overseas, are available, goodness only knows. I doubt very much whether we shall have an export trade in meat during the coming year. I doubt whether the inland meat-freezing works, the establishment of which we encouraged in. Australia, will be able to build up a profitable trade during the next few years. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Take the woollen industry by way of illustration. We have a high Protective Tariff against British goods. I admit that that Tariff was necessary at one time when we were engaged in building up our woollen industry, and when the wages paid in that industry in England were only about one-fourth of those which we paid. here. But in Britain to-day the wages paid in the woollen industry are as high as those which we pay. In addition, the buyers of our wool have to pay nearly 2d. per lb. by way of freight on the raw wool. They have also to bear the cost of high wages, insurance, and loss of interest, and the operatives of their mills labour only the same number of hours as do our own. They have also to pay freight to Australia again, and a ridiculously high Protective duty upon the manufactured goods. But as against a country like Japan, where the operatives in the woollen mills work twelve hours daily for an average wage of 9s. per week, our Tariff is not nearly high enough. We shall require to be on the <inline font-style="italic">qui vive</inline> when the various items come under consideration if we wish to do what is fair. </para>

                            <para>-I am in favour of Imperial preference throughout, even though France, our late Ally, is severely handicapped at the present time by the rate of exchange. There are several items upon which I cannot understand why a high Protective duty has been levied. Take, for example, woollen goods. A little coterie or ring has made a fortune out of woollens, and with what result to the people of Australia? Although wool is so good; so plentiful, and so cheap, we have dear blankets, dear flannel, and dear clothing, when, as* a matter of fact, we should have the best and cheapest in the world. Then why is a heavy Tariff imposed upon motor chassis which are required by doctors and farmers in the country districts ? Upon motor bodies, which can be built in Australia as well as they can be anywhere else in the world, I do not care how high a duty is levied. I believe in high duties being imposed upon all luxuries such as jewellery, silks, furs, feathers, cigars, and wines. We have a country which can produce wine's equal to the best French wines. But we have never given the industry adequate protection. We are settling a number of returned soldiers in vineyards, and I would give them a very high protective duty. I should like to emphasize the fact that I am in favour of a very high Tariff upon all luxuries, but I do not believe in taxing the tools of trade that are required for production, especially farming and mining machinery. I am a Protectionist, so far as it is reasonable to go, for all infant industries and essential industries, but I am not in favour of Protection which is going to further accentuate centralization or unduly increase the cost of living, which in this country is, at the present time, scandalously high. </para>

There are, however, some questions upon which he has not expressed opinions, and on those I hope the honorable senator will agree with mine. On Friday last I drew the Minister's attention to the question of the mandated Territories and other Pacific Possessions, and warned him that I would ask for information, so that he might be ready with it when he replied; as to our attitude towards them. I understand that Papua has its own Tariff, which is imposed on imports from Australia and other countries, and that it is contemplated to establish a somewhat similar state of affairs in regard to the mandated Territories. I am not clear on these points, and hope the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> will give full information as to what is proposed by the Government as regards . these islands of ours, and whether it can be effected under the Tariff we are now considering, or whether it must be done by a separate Bill. My idea is that we should not treat these islands as foreign countries, but that the Tariff wall which we are building round the Commonwealth should include within it all our mandated and other Territories in the Pacific. </para>

                        <para>- So far as I can make out, black labour in those islands has not yet been brought into competition with Australian industries to any appreciable extent. The imports to Australia from Papua, New Guinea, and other Pacific Territories, so far as my information goes, are not produced in Australia, or are produced here only to a very small degree, and the amount of hardship that would be imposed on Australian workmen by coming into competition with black labour from the islands is practically negligible. It is, of course, quite possible that when the islands develop in the future, as we hope they will, they may come into competition with Australia. If so, the position may then have to be reconsidered, but at the present time I can see no reason, although the Minister may be able to furnish some, why the Protection that we are establishing for Australia by this Tariff should not be extended also to the Pacific Islands. </para>

Tariff, can be used to, prevent" that- purpose. The so? called scientific Tariff, which- we are now considering does, in effect, in a great meaT sure. prevent. the. peopling; and developing of our, great empty spaces., <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Var*</inline> do% speaking, I am sure, without having quite fully considered this aspect pf the question, said that the only steel rails that 'he - would' allow' to be used-' in Australia, if . he, bad his' way,; would be-' steel rails, from . Australian, furnaces. Steel rails made in - Australia tor-day may be the best in the.- world;  I am npt saying that they are not, but. . I . do say that they are- to-day about, eight, -times as expensive - as steel rails bought- by Victoria for the building pf Victorian railways a number- of. years- ago, and they- ' . are-, more- expensive than, steel rails-, procurable elsewhere. The greatest necessity in this country, particularly in Western Australia, is the construction of . railways, so that we may have agricultural and pastoral development, and anything which we do in this Tariff which makes 'the construction of those railways more expensive is detrimental, to Australia.I had placed before me recently by a very able gentleman a number of facts and figures concerning the steel industry of New South Wales. I warned him before he started that if he wanted my assistance to get even further protection than is provided in this schedule, and that is what he was after, he would have to put up a very strong case to convince me. He said he could do -so.' As he proceeded I began to think he was putting -up a very strong case, until -finally I asked him, " What about your profits <inline font-style="italic">1"</inline> Even then, on the balance-sheets, it looked as though the profits were not too great, but when I began to analyze them, instead of being a modest 4 or 5 per cent, as was shown last year, and 9 or 10 per cent. &gt;a few years ago, they averaged out at something like from 18 to 20 per cent. That is the result of my analysis of the very 'strong case put before me for my consideration, and yet this. is an industry which -demands even greater protection than has been given to it in the past, . and greater protection than is actually given to dt in this -schedule. If we give the industry . more protection than it has . now, we shall be . doing great damage to Australia, <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> looking at the position from a -broad and national point, of view. </para>

It sounds very simple on the prompting of the expert sitting behind the Minister, but there are other experts who could show that it is more than 5 per cent., as it appears on paper.

                        <para>.- Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> I have listened with interest to the debate on .the Tariff Bill, but unlike the honorable senator, I have profited from the discussion. As a good Australian, as I claim to be, I realize that the fiscal policy of this country must be one of Protection. During the period of the war the necessity for such a policy was demonstrated in a very conclusive manner, and when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> said that the industrial efficiency of Great Britain won the war, he uttered a truism. When that little Army which was, in affectionate terms, called the " Old Contemptibles " was, notwithstanding the heroic devotion to duty and sacrifices of its men, almost annihilated by German hordes, when the British Government began to realize the possibility of defeat, and when they saw how inadequately the men were equipped for the great struggle, what did they do? They achieved one of the greatest feats ever recorded in history in an endeavour to defend the honour and integrity of the British Empire by organizing the forces at their command and converting them into a powerful instrument of war, which eventually destroyed their enemies. Assuming that a similar demand were made upon Australia, how helpless we would be, and how futile would be the sacrifices of our splendid manhood. We have not the facilities in this country to manufacture a fraction of the thousands of articles necessary to successfully prosecute modern warfare. </para>

                            <para>- It is. Notwithstanding the security which may be afforded under the League of Nations, or the proposals for disarmament, I am one of those who believe in keeping a hold on what we have instead of depending too much upon the generosity of our neighbours. Protection is essential to this country for safety in time of war and for success in commerce. Although Protection is naturally the fiscal policy of Australia, Protection alone will not make us a powerful or progressive nation, because behind it we must have energy and enterprise. Business men must possess a high standard of commercial morality, and workers must aim at industrial efficiency. The excellence of our work must be sufficient not only to meet the demands in the local market, but those in the markets of the world, and unless a policy such as this gives us that security, Protection will be in vain. Generally, I appreciate and agree with the proposals embodied in this Bill, although it may contain some anomalies. The legislation we are now considering affects not us only, but the interests of those who are to follow us. </para>

                    <para>There is another subject - I refer to the timber resources of the Commonwealth - which, so far, has not received much attention during the debate in" - the Senate. There is an ascertained limit to these resources. If we can visualize the exploitation of our timber from the date of settlement in Australia up to the present time, with a comparatively small population, averaging, I suppose, 2,000,000 people for the last century, we can form some idea of what is likely to happen during the next century, when perhaps we shall have a population two or three times as great. This is a matter which calls for serious consideration. We should realize our responsibilities in this respect to future generations. It takes nearly 100 years to grow some Australian trees to perfection for certain purposes, and, therefore, on this subject, I am not at one with the proposal concerning the duty on imported timber. I have been associated with timber practically all my life, and I agree with much of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> said on this subject. In some respects, oregon is absolutely the best timber for constructional purposes. We have nothing that can quite take its place. We have many timbers that are superior and more valuable, but, unfortunately, these are being destroyed or wasted through being used for purposes for which (hey are entirely unstated. The Semite should consider the advisability of making some effort to alter the duties on timber. </para>
                    <para>Reference has been- made during the debate to the crowded condition of our cities. No responsible public man can review the position without a feeling of grave concern. It seems to me that, in the interests of the city dwellers themselves, it is important that we should realize that we have approached perilously near a state of affairs in which the rural industries of the Commonwealth will be unable to support the populations in our cities. Therefore our legislation should be designed to bring about a more equitable distribution of cur people. Is the Tariff an instrument likely to accomplish this end? Is it in the interests of the city workers that protective duties should be imposed on certain manufacturing industries, such as, for instance, the manufacture of agricultural implements, if the effect of those duties will be such as to penalize those engaged in rural production? What is likely to happen to the workers in the cities iu such circumstances ? </para>

                            <para>- That is on account of the high wages now being demanded in the industry. The dwellers in our cities would, be well advised to encourage in every possible way the development of rural industries, even to the extent of bribing people to go out on the land, and produce. This encouragement should take the form of greater consideration to all connected with the pioneering work of this' country. Recently, I had an opportunity of travelling through a portion of the Mallee district of Victoria, and saw the conditions under which the people there, including the women and children, are living. In some districts the farmers have to cart water a distance, of 10 miles for the purpose of watering their stock. They cannot keep cows to provide milk for their children, for the simple reason that there is no water available. Some of these farmers have as many as 600 acres under  cultivation. and yet they cannot keep half-a-dozen sheep because of the trouble in regard to water. But in spite of .their difficulties, these people are facing the future cheerfully. They .are glad to be living a free life, and are prepared to work hard. -The other might I attended a meeting for the purpose of establishing the organization known as the New Settlers' League, the object of which is to keep in touch with all new immigrants to this country. There was some criticism about farm labourers or domestic' servants coming to Victoria at the present time, the suggestion being 'that immigration was not advisable in view, of the existing unemployment; and the gentleman who presided at the meeting said, " I was in Gippsland the other day, and was informed that thousands ,of pounds' worth of work, for which tenders had been called, could not be done for the simple reason that there was no Harbour ..available." And, .as I have already said, .1 was in the Mallee a little time ago, and I know what is happening there. The difficulty with regard to water is due to the fact that no labour can be obtained for the construction of water channels  T-/bich  have been promised by the Government. There is a mad rush of people to get into our cities and towns. Parliament should take heed of the trend of events, .and our legislation, and especially this Tariff, should be an instrument to remedy this state of affairs. </para>

                        - There was some offering at 40s. per ton, and we have shipped wheat at '47s. 6d., which is comparatively low, but that is not now avail* able. Ships that are carrying our wheat and flour have to come from Great Britain in ballast. This means that we have to pay a freight, sufficient for the running of vessels both ways. It should be our policy to build up the Commonwealth Line ,of Steam-ships by every means in our power, so that, by means of competition between the - several lines, . we may have some (assurance .of reasonable freights in future. During the .whole of the war period, the Shipping Combine charged heavy freights, but they had to pay 75 per cent, of profits in taxation. I have every sympathy with the movement to secure cheap freights for Australian products. We should make special efforts to build up our secondary industries, which need not necessarily conflict with our primary industries, because we have all the necessary raw materials within our own boundaries. I believe that the growth of .our cities apparently at the expense of rural centres, is largely the result of natural evolution. Cities all over the world are growing larger, because the -workers are continually seeking the best employment. If there is one thing that a worker is keen upon, it is to find a better job than the one he holds at present, and therefore this movement of population is not altogether an unmixed evil. I .may remind honorable senators that the Phoenix Foundry, at Ballarat; was one of the finest engineering works in the Commonwealth. It disappeared because it was not sufficiently protected.

                            <para>- Our object should be to encourage business enterprises in country centres, and in other ways to decentralize industry. Some of the aggregation of population in the metropolitan cities has been due -to the adoption of tapering railway rates to give the big cities an advantage. Portland, was kept a closed port for many years in. this way through Melbourne influence. I have done something to open .up. Portland,, and I hope to be able to. do something, for the progress of .other .neglected ports in Australia. The. -adoption of tapering railway -rates iri the interests of, metropolitan, cities has been the work of State, Parliaments,and it needs to be prevented by insisting upon a .uniform charge for. a uniform distance. Honorable senators know that if in Victoria wheat was . shipped from the most convenient: port it. would be snipped from Portland. We 'are advancing the interests of Portland in that way. at the present. 'time. . During the season we have shipped from that port, between  700,000  and  800,000  tons of wheat . without- a single hitch pf any kind,, whilst it has insured the work of loading being' carried out in the day-time,- and 'under better conditions than those which prevail in Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>. -  I . cannot agree with the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> that the request which has been preferred by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> is an unimportant, one. It is so vitally important that I fail to see how we can make progress with the consideration of this Bill until the principle involved in the Tariff Board Bill has been settled. The measure which is now before us provides that the British preferential duties cannot come into operation, until a proclamation has been issued, and that proclamation cannot be issued until after the creation of the Tariff Board. Consequently there is very good reason for deferring consideration of this Bill until we have decided whether or not the Tariff Board shall l?e created. To my mind, that is an insuperable obstacle to the course which has been proposed by the Minister. I hope that he will be reasonable, and that, even at this late hour he will agree to postpone the further consideration of the measure until we have had an opportunity of discussing the provisions of the Tariff Board Bill. </para>

To me it seems that to postpone the work of the Senate this evening would constitute a veritable waste of time. It is obvious that if this Bill be carried in its present form, and if the Tariff Board Bill be rejected, it will be the duty of the Government to amend this measure in such a way as to make it meet the altered situation which will then arise. I have the best of reasons to believe that the majority of the Senate will agree to the Tariff Board. We can surely proceed with this Bill to-night, arid pass it with whatever amendments are desired. Then if it is not in conformity with the Bill constituting the Board as it finally passes, it will be the duty of the Government te recommit it. </para>

Unless this Bill is passed it maybe said that there is no Tariff, and that  we  must lay the Tariff Board Bill aside and pass the Tariff Bill. I am prepared to go on with the work now, and leave to the Government the responsibility of bringing this Bill into conformity with the decision of the Senate on the Tariff Board Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- The whole purpose of bringing this matter under the notice of the Senate during the first-reading debate was that honorable senators should not be committed to any of the items in the schedule until they were perfectly satisfied, and aware of the nature of the safeguard that was to be instituted by means of a Board. The Minister then in charge of the Senate gave a definite promise that the matter would be considered, as far as possible, from that aspect. I therefore urge the Minister to reconsider his decision not to permit the Tariff Board Bill to be brought before the Senate and settled before we go on with the schedule. </para>

                        <para>. - 1 cannot understand why so much heat should be displayed over this simple matter. -We cannot have both Bills .before the Senate at the one time and make any progress. We know the nature of the Tariff Board Bill, and surely we can adopt a simple definition which involves nothing except that there is to be a 'Board known as the Tariff Board. Both measures are complementary to each other, and we must deal with one or the other first. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> that in dealing with the Tariff before we deal with, the Tariff Board we are putting the cart before the horse. It is impossible to deal with the Board if we have not a Tariff. Some honorable senators appear to want to have the cart and the horse abreast of one another. The Minister should be allowed to proceed with the business in the order in which it has been arranged. </para>

                        <para>. - This clause would not commit, honorable senators in the way they imagine to any principle in connexion with the Tariff Board. I have already offered to postpone any clause involving the Board, and recommit it later' if necessary. There seems to be an impression that we are trying to commit senators to the principle of the Board. That is not so. They will vote on that in a separate Bill; and if the Senate deliberately decides to substitute the Minister for the Board, then all the other clauses will have to be amended. I am prepared to postpone certain clauses, but I do not want every clause postponed. We can discuss the schedule and the rates of duty; but I do not want the schedule to be postponed on the ground that the whole thing will be subject to the Board, nor do I want every clause postponed on the ground that it is a distant relative of some other clause. </para>

                            <para>- I thank the Minister for the information, ' but I am rather reluctant to assist in passing a validating clause until I know more about it, because the commercial community may have an injustice inflicted upon it in certain circumstances. The second paragraph appears to validate the Minister's action in allowing any goods to be taken from bond for home consumption at a lower duty than this Bill imposes. I have no objection to that, because I believe the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> possesses not only the confidence of members of Parliament but of the commercial community. I. would, however, like an assurance from the Minister that no validation of either higher or lower duties will in effect inflict any injustice on the commercial community by way of litigation. </para>

                            <para>. - I desire not so much to criticise these duties as to look ahead, and see what may occur in connexion with their incidence. There is in effect now a duty of 6d. per quart bottle on British beer, and in the general Tariff there is an increase of only Id. per quart bottle. I would like honorable senators to consider the position we are likely to be in when we renew trade relations with Germany in the not-distant future, and when we may expect a heavy importation of German lager beer again. I am afraid the difference in duty between the British and foreign beer will not be sufficient. The Minister (Senator Russell) might consider this aspect of the matter. I am informed that a gentleman named Julius Blau is going about Sydney soliciting orders for 4711 Eau de Cologne, which he hopes to place on the market soon and swamp all other perfumery manufacturers. So when we resume our trade relationships with Germany, we may likewise expect heavy importations of lager beer, and I say that if people want to drink that beer they should pay for it. I move, therefore - </para>

                        <para>. - I support" the request for several reasons. I am in favour of imposing heavy duties on all luxuries. I regard German or Austrian beer as an unnecessary luxury in- this country, as the lager beer now being manufactured here is just as good. We have been doing very well without German beer for several years, and we can very well do without it for the rest of our lives. The brewing industry, with which hop-growing is closely allied, is a valuable one to Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - I am afraid the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> has not grasped all my reasons for the requested amendment. Did I not consider the matter important in the not-distant future I would gladly withdraw my motion.. But sooner or later we must resume trade relationships with Germany, and I do not think the time is very distant. Business must then be renewed on the basis of this Tariff. We shall not set to work again aud raise 'a Tariff controversy in connexion with the importations from that country. This Tariff" must meet any special circumstances that may crop up during the next six or seven years at least. Before the war there were very heavy importations to Australia of German lager beer to the great prejudice of the British or local article. I have heard of hundreds of hogsheads and thousands of cases .of  German lager beer being loaded in one ship at Bremen for Australia. I am not a beer drinker, and, therefore, I cannot give honorable senators a disquisition upon the relative merits of the various beers that we drink in Australia; but with Bass' and Guinness' beers coming into Australia at a fairly stiff duty, it should be within the province of this Committee to accept the requested amendment, which, after all, will only put <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> per pint, or Id. per quart, bottle extra on the German product. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that we can do without German lager beer altogether, but there is in our community a certain element which, when trade relationships with Germany are resumed, will drink German lager beer whatever it costs them. If they do that to the detriment of the British or local product, they should be made to pay for it. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has informed us that he is not speaking from the consumers' ' point of view, because he does not drink beer. I am at a loss to understand what his purpose is. First of all, he says that in the not distant future we shall be obliged to resume our trade relationship with Germany, and in view of that possibility he wishes to penalize Ger-' many by giving Great Britain a very much greater preference than is provided for in the present schedule. But he also tells us that the effect of the amendment will simply be to put an extra Id. per quart on imported German lager beer. Now, if Germany is likely to be such a f formidable opponent bf our local manufacturers of lager beer, she can do the extra Id. per quart bottle " standing on her head " in competition, so I do not see that anything is to be gained by the suggested amendment so far as the local industry is concerned. If there is any virtue in the reason the honorable senator has assigned for the amendment, why stop at Id. per quart bottle? "We shall have a substantial number of requests to make in connexion with the various Tariff items, and I, for one, am not going to be a party to loading up our message of requests with what appear to me to be unnecessary requests, or requests for requesting sake. In regard to the question of competition with locally-brewed lagers and beers, I am of opinion that the Australian industry has been very firmly established, and that the prices being charged to the consumer are very much in advance of what they were a few years ago, and beyond what occasion demands. If honorable senators care to study the balance-sheets of our local breweries, they will find that those breweries do not require very much in the way of protection. If anybody needs protection  in regard to this particular industry it is the consumer. I have no doubt that people who prefer imported beers will be quite willing to purchase them, even if the duty upon them be increased by Id. per bottle or more. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> desires to extend a preference to Great Britain over the German product, and if he wishes to persist in penalizing our former enemy, he will go much farther than he has gone in the proposal which he has submitted. </para>

I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> to consider the position in which he is placing us. Before we are asked to determine what these duties shall be, we should be afforded an opportunity of saying whether or not a Tariff Board shall be constituted. For my own part, I am not prepared to vote for high duties in the absence of some means of checking the manufacturers who will reap the benefit of those duties. Other honorable senators are not' willing to vote for the creation of a Tariff Board at all. In view of this clash of opinion, the Vice-President of the Executive Council will be well advised to report progress. </para>

But I desire to point out the practical difficulties of the course which he suggests, though probably the danger which is in his mind can- be avoided'. It is impossible - to proceed with two1 Bill's ' at once.'

                            <para>- That is very complimentary to the Vice-  President  of the Executive Council. But that fear may still be ' present in. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan's</inline> mind, notwithstanding' that the Minister may have removed many of the- doubts which he" at present entertains. What I suggest, therefore, is that before the schedule finally leaves this Chamber, a decision shall be arrived at upon the Tariff Board Bill. If honorable senators decide' that a Board shall not be created, it will then' be' competent for them to give expression to their views. . They will thus have an opportunity of considering the Tariff "Board Bill and the Tariff Bill in. their relation to: each, other. With, every desire to. meet the difficulty as. it. exists, I am submitting- a practicable proposition. Unless, the Senate wishes to adjourn, for some time, I have outlined. - a course which. - offers every reasonable safeguard that : can. be - dee vised .

                        as to the desirableness of saving time. The only difference, between  us  appears to be as to die method by which that desirable objective is to -be achieved. When I spoke a little while ago, I assumed that when
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline>
                        had made his second-reading -speech  on  the Tariff Board Bill there would tie the usual request for an adjournment of the debate'. Then, if we did not go back to the schedule, the Senate would have to adjourn at about 3.30 o'clock to-morrow afternoon until the next day. If the Senate is prepared, however, to go straight  on  with the second-reading debate on 'the Tariff Board Bill, and carry it to a conclusion, well and good. It is not possible to count heads here, but I shall accept the -silence of the Senate as implying consent to the proposition that when the second reading is moved to-morrow we shall go straight  on  with the debate without -any adjournment. If that course is approved, there can be  no  objection to reporting progress  on  the Tariff now.

                        <para>.- I am disposed to think that the Minister's first suggestion  waB  the better one, that - contentious matters in -the clauses and schedule of the Customs Tariff Bill  should be  postponed  Spending  finality with the Tariff Board Bill, and that  Sie  second reading of- &amp;e "Tariff Board Bill should be moved by the Minister tomorrow, and the debate on it adjourned, in which case the Bill 'would probably  be  completed  on  Friday. I would prefer to listen carefully to the Minister's second-treading speech  on  the Tariff . Board Bill, and then bars an adjournment to consider it. I am not in agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DrakeBrookman's</inline> idea of going right on with the Bill and finishing it in one day without further consideration'. ' The Senate . seems to indorse the fundamental principle that we ought to know something about the Tariff Board Bill before we can. go mtrch further with the Tariff schedule, but I do not think it matters much whether we complete the Tariff Board Bill to-morrow, Thursday, or Friday, bo long a B we finish it this week and know its incidence in connexion with our deliberations on the Tariff itself. . </para>
