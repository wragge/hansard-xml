                    <para>. -  I draw the attention of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to the position in regard to sub-item c, which relates to the manufacture of doors. These duties were brought down last March twelve months. Since then the timber duties have been increased to the extent of practically 100 per cent., so that it seems to me that unless we increase the duties on doors, at all events, we shall be placing some premium upon their importation, the duties having been first proposed in order to cultivate their local manufacture. I raise this question more particularly in relation to sub-item c, but my argument also bears on sub-items a and b. </para>

The door making industry has been going on very well, and since no request in regard to the duties has been submitted- to the Department, we do not propose to ask for any alteration of them. </para>

                    <para>. - Within the last day or two, very strong representations have been made to me in connexion with this item by Melbourne and Sydney firms interested in making doors. I can understand how it is that no such representations have been made to the Department for Trade and Customs. It is owing  to  the uncertainty that has existed in  regard  to what this Committee might do in respect to the main timber items. The position is now. settled in that respect. The main timber duties, by the action of this Committee, have been further increased, and now the position is that the duties on doors must also be altered. Otherwise in consequence of the raw material having had twice  the  duty placed on it as was expected by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> in framing the Tariff, the makers of doors in Australia must go out of business. Doors are being offered at extraordinarily low prices to-day. </para>

                        <para>- Doors and window sashes are made of imported softwoods, and the present duties- upon them bear some relation to the original duty of 1s. per 100 super, feet on the raw material, as was originally intended by the Minister for Trade and Customs; but when that rate has been raised to 4s., and another rate of 3s. to 5s. 6d., and still another rate of 3s. 6d. to 7s. - all on the raw material from which these doors are made  - then it follows that the existing duties on doors do&#39; not continue to bear any sort of relation to the rates upon imported softwoods. I hope that the Minister will see his way clear to accept a 50 per cent.&#39; advance upon the duties on doors in order that they. may have some relativity to the action taken by the Committee last night in increasing the main timber duties. </para>

                    <para>. - The protection afforded to the door-making industry is more than generous. A party of Federal members visited Maryborough, in Queensland, some years ago, and saw doors and window sashes being made, for the Sydney and Melbourne markets, from Queensland cedar, a very excellent material for the purpose. I understand that silky oak is also used now for making these doors, but at that time cedar was the principal timber used. </para>

                        <para>- I know it is very superior timber, which ought to be put to better purposes, but it was so plentiful&#34; at that time that complete houses were being built of it. The wages paid to the workmen engaged in the mill were 6s. and&#39; 7s. a day, and youths were working- mortising machines for 2s. a day. I think that the industry is sufficiently protected considering the amount of wages paid and the material used.- </para>

                    <para>. -  I trust that the Government will not yield to this request. I have very good authority for saying that, out of each &#163;800, which is the average cost of building a house for a returned soldier, at least &#163;50 is paid in duties upon the timber used. If we are faced with a problem, it is that of finding houses and homes for our people; and to do anything to make it more difficult to build is a disastrous step. </para>

The schedule proposes 4s. 6d., 6s. and8s. 6d., or1s. more than the Inter-State Commission recommended in each case. That makes up for the increase in the other duties. </para>

We all know that our cedar has in the past been burnt, or used for purposes which were economically unsound, and there is an exceedingly grave shortage of that timber in Australia to-day. However correct the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie may have been in connexion with the environment he was in at the time of which he /spoke, cedar now does not come into consideration for the making of doors and window frames in Sydney . and suburbs. In reply to the Minister, I wish to say that by no vote of mine were the timber duties last night increased or confirmed. I think it is economically an unsound policy- </para>

                        <para>- The Minister ought to put in the whole of the context. The test division was taken on log timber, and as the Committee decided not to reduce the duty on that timber, I allowed the next item to pass. I think we were in general agreement that whatever duty was fixed on log timber, the duties on the other timber should be relative, as a matter of fair play. That was the position I took up last night. </para>

                        <para>- However, if the Minister will not accept my request, I cannot press it, but I again point out that the duty I propose has a fair relation to what we have already done. If the request is not accepted, the inevitable outcome will be that the doors ou which the duty is imposed will be imported from . America already made up. They may be cheaper on that account, and thus fall in with the ideas of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas.</inline> But such a step is not consonant with the principle of the Tariff, which is to keep all the work we possibly can within our own borders for the employment of our own people. </para>

                    <para>. - Under the first Federal Tariff, elm hubs, I believe, were admitted free. A duty of 10 per cent, was imposed in 1908, but that degree of protection was ineffective. The rate is now 15 per cent., but even that does not provide reasonable protection compared with what has been imposed in respect of many favorably treated city industries. Coachbuilding is  a  country industry. </para>

In 1920, about 21,000 American hubs were imported, and, in 1921, about 37,000; the total combined values were about &#163;15,000&#39;. The Australian product is just as good as, if not better than, the American elm hub, although a little on the heavy side. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the request.  In  1901, I secured the imposition of a 10 per cent, duty upon hubs. We had, and still have, a very fine timber in Western Australia., a eucalypt locally known as the York gum. It is a splendid curly timber, specially suited to the manufacture of hubs. Under the 1908 Tariff, the 10 per cent, rate was re-imposed. In 1914 the duty was made 15 per cent., and that rate has continued to date. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the request, and would have agreed to a. still higher duty. During the years- of the war, Australian spotted gum and ironbark practically took the place of imported timber for hubs. Statistics show a tremendous increase in importations since the war; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has already mentioned the approximate, totals for the past two years. I understand that no complaint was made during the war period concerning the Australian woods, but, at the present time, unfortunately, sales of hubs from local timbers have fallen off. One factory in Victoria, which in January last was employing forty-six hands on full time, is now working with only twenty-three employees four days a week </para>

                        <para>- Australian hubs are excellent productions, I admit. Although a few hands may be put off in various factories, it should not be forgotten that it was imported hickory which permitted the country coachbuilder a few years ago to turn out a sulky for about &#163;14. Increased costs, owing to Tariff impositions, have now run the price of a sulky up to about &#163;40, and where one might have noticed twenty, of them on a country road upon a Sunday afternoon ten years ago, there is scarcely one to be seen to-day. That fact indicates the considerably reduced amount of work for country  coachbuilders;  and the example is typical of what always happens under a Protectionist policy. In this instance, while the interests of a twopenny-halfpenny factory in Victoria are being fought for, the rest of Australia is forgotten. </para>

                        <para>- I know that. Hickory spokes imported in the rough have merely to be placed in a turning lathe to be made smooth; and the imposition of these duties assists only the big city firms, which have suitable machinery installed, and which employ very little labour. It is merely a matter of having up-to-date machinery. I do not object to a duty of 15 per cent.; but it is ridiculous for the Minister, in an offhand way, to say, &#34; I shall accept 25 per Cent.&#34; He is playing into the hands of the coachbuilding trade, and assisting only firms who have the particular machinery installed for the dressing of spokes, instead of making them import, and thus prevent huge profits being made. Practically the whole of this work is done in the city by a few firms, whilst in country- towns of a population of 3,000 or 4,000 there are two or three small men who have to struggle -without such assistance. The proprietors of city factories have the business iu their own hands, and, consequently, are able to make the users pay higher prices, whilst those in the country have to fight if they desire to obtain any consideration at all. During recent years, prices have increased by 300 per cent., and the imposition of these&#39;&#39; duties is only benefiting those in the cities who have up-to-date plants. </para>

I am not in favour of going any higher, because I desire to apply the same principle in this instance as has been applied to other industries to which I have previously referred. I do not wish those who are to benefit by higher duties to bc sheltered behind an unnecessarily high barrier; but I desire to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that it is very necessary to prompt, or even compel, certain people in this country to give preference to the timber grown here. We have been using American- axe . handles in Australia for many years, and axemen really thought that nothing produced locally could equal them. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so; because in Western Australia axe handles made from the timber grown on the limestone fringes is as tough in fibre as any timber from which American axe handles are made. I have used the handles made of Western Australian timber, and know that they are equal in every way to the imported article. It is time our people began to shed the scales from their eyes and admit that the Australian timber is suitable in every way for the manufacture of many articles which we have been in the habit of importing. I am not asking for more than 25 per cent. ; and knowing that country industries have not had that kind of soft-hearted consideration which city industries have received, I am thankful for what I am getting. </para>

In 1920, 285,000 hickory spokes, valued at &#163;6,922, were imported ; and in 1921, . 702,542 spokes, valued at &#163;32,175, came into the Commonwealth. As a result of these heavy importations, a factory on the Richmond River in New South Wales, which was partly devoted to the manufacture of spokes from Australian timber, has been compelled to close. </para>

                    <para>. - I am always pleased when Protectionists give information concerning the effect of duties. I have no doubt that the factory on the Richmond River to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has referred as having closed down, is one of those factories that had to get its plant and material from abroad, and twelve months&#39; experience of this Tariff has caused its close, as it has- caused the close of many other factories. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> tells us that the factory was closed down because 15 per cent, duty on these articles is not sufficient, and he thinks that 25 per cent, would revive it. The honorable senator overlooks the fact that the proprietors, of the factory have had to pay higher wages because the prices of boots, hats, clothing, and everything else has gone up owing to the duties imposed by this Tariff. With high prices everywhere, a factory closes down, and the honorable senator looks to the little item in the Tariff, and attributes its failure to the fact that that duty is not sufficiently high. That is quite in accord with Protectionist intelligence. Eighteen months&#39; operation of the Tariff has brought about more unemployment in Australia than we had for fifteen years previously. </para>

There are men who think that woodchopping is not expert work, and men who cannot tell the difference between a good and a bad axe handle. I know the difference, and I know that men who are accustomed to use axes prefer to pay 3s. 6d. at Anthony Hordern&#39;s for a hickory handle to- purchasing any other handle, even at1s. This is not the result of prejudice, but of a knowledge of the work they have to do. </para>

                    <para>. - Sub-item b includes axe handles. I indorse every word that has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> as to the necessity of those who make a living as bushmen being able to get their tools of trade at a reasonable price. It is a fact, also, that any man worthy of the name of a bushman knows that it is absolutely essential to use a hickory axe handle. I saw an exhibit of handles in the Queen&#39;s Hall when the Tariff was being considered in another place. So far as symmetry was concerned, they were a credit to Australian manufacturers ; but any one with any knowledge of what is required of an axe handle, on putting them to an ordinary test, would admit that, although they looked all right, they would not prove to be the serviceable article required by a bushman. A great many locally-made axe handles were used during the war period because they were much cheaper than the imported article; but I have not known any of them to be used by those who have to make their living as bushmen. </para>

                        <para>- We have advanced from the conditions of the olden times. The bushman knows that it is absolutely essential that an axe handle shall have some give in it. With regard to ordinary tool handles, I am pleased to admit that the Australian manufacturer is turning out a very good line indeed. If the duties here proposed are retained, the American axe handle will still be used until we can find a timber in Australia from which axe handles equal to the imported article can be manufactured. For this reason, I move - </para>

At present, as  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has pointed out, he is compelled to pay 3s. 6d. for a handle which a few years ago he could have purchased for1s. 6d.

At Bunbury, in Western Australia, a factory, owned and run entirely by returned soldiers, is turning out axe handles that are used almost universally throughout that State, which has the biggest timber industry in the Commonwealth. &#39; If these axe handles are suitable for the hardwood timbers of Western Australia, they should be quite suitable for the soft woods in the other States. </para>

                    <para>.- I would bo quite prepared to accept the Minister&#39;s suggestion if the axe handles to which he refers were on the market and obtainable in the eastern States, but I have not yet been able to find on sale Australian axe handles that can be regarded as equal in quality to the American article. Therefore, i am not prepared to place this handicap upon the Australian bushman. If, as has been suggested, there should be deferred duties on axe handles, I would be only too pleased to accept it, because I&#39; am anxious to see the industry established in Australia if axe handles of good quality can be produced. No one is more pleased than I am to know that suitable timber has been found in Western Australia. We had a similar proposition at Port Davey, in Tasmania, a few years ago, but, owing to the inaccessibility of the timber nothing came of the scheme, and at present, independently of importations, we are not able to provide for the needs of the Australian bushman. I must press my request, unless the Minister is prepared to suggest deferred duties. </para>

Before the war . the housewife paid something like1&#189;d. for two dozen pegs, whereas to-day she has to pay 1s., an increase of 800 per cent. It cannot be said that the manufacture of clothes pegs is a great industry and as the local factories, are evidently unable to sell at the price of the imported goods, these heavy duties serve only to increase the cost of a very necessary article.

                        <para>- No. In the bush, about thirty miles from Melbourne. I have here two clothes pegs made in Victoria from Australian timber, and I am informed that the industry is in a position to make all the pegs required in Australia. It is hardly fair for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> to talk about pre-war prices in relation to the present duties. 1 had very much pleasure in voting just now to safeguard an Australian industry engaged in the manufacture of axe handles, spokes and felloes, and I appeal to the Committee to pass this item as it stands.I understand that the Department has gone very carefully into the question and that as a result of its inquiries these duties have been proposed by the Government. </para>

Those engaged in the industry complain that since starting operations they have met with fierce competition from importers of American clothes pegs who have been cutting prices. That alone should justify the retention of the duty. </para>

                        <para>- The present duty of1s. 6d. per gross under the general Tariff is equal to a duty of 150 per cent, on the present American prices, so that it is 50 per cent, in excess of the value of the goods. It is all very well to say that the production of clothes pegs- has been commenced here, but it is unreasonable that the women of Australia should have to pay 4d. or 4&#189;d. per dozen for American clothes pegs as against1&#189;d. for- two dozen before the war. Clothes pegs are easily broken and this is an. unnecessary burden. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> did not move for a greater reduction of the duty under the general column. I had intended to submit a request that the duty under the British preferential Tariff be reduced to 3d. per gross and under the general Tariff to 6d. per gross. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that the words &#34; including&#39; hospitals &#34; should be omitted. Many contrivances made of wood are used in hospitals. For instance, there are contrivances for the purpose of lifting the weight of bed-clothes from a maimed limb. I do not want Australia to be stigmatized for having imposed a duty on articles used in hospitals. </para>

In the military hospitals which, during the war, probably treated a greater number of maimed patients than the general hospitals in Australia had in the previous twenty-five years, all these contrivances are made by men who have learned the business while they were inmates of the institutions. In any case the greater part of these wooden contrivances can be, and are being, made here. </para>

                <para class="block">I have with me samples of neck studs and sleeve links which cannot be regarded as jewellery. They are personal requisites. If the words &#34; or imitations thereof &#34; are retained in this sub-item, certain of these articles will be admitted at the rates attaching to the sub-item, namely, 25 per cent., 35 per cent., and 50 per cent., whereas others which are made to imitate jewellery will pay 45 per cent., 55 per cent., and 60 per cent. I am anxious to have these cheap personal requisites, which are not manufactured in Australia, all classed at the same rate of duty. The man who can alford to buy gold or silver sleeve links should pay the higher duties attaching to an article of luxury, but the man whose means will only permit him to buy an ordinary sixpenny collar stud should not be called upon to pay a duty ranging up to 60 per cent. The ordinary neck stud commonly used is not a piece of jewellery, nor is the imitation pearl stud which is now classified as imitation jewellery, but which should be admitted under the category of articles for personal wear. There is no justification for the imposition of a 60 per cent, duty upon such articles. </para>

                    <para>. -  Why the differentiation between imitation precious stones and jewellery, and imitation jewellery and articles for personal wear? These latter are called upon to pay the very stiff duties of 25 per cent., 35 per cent., and 50 per cent., and imitation jewellery, 45 per cent., 55 per cent., and 60 per cent. - the high-water mark, I suppose, of duties on luxuries - while imitation precious stones are admitted free. These duties are a tax on things that people can very well do without, but which some people, in their folly, insist on having. If there is any glint of goodness in the Tariff, it is the effort in these items to put a tax on the  vanity that is characteristic of human nature. These articles are luxuries, absolutely. I do not see why a man who prefers to have a diamond ring, should have the raw material of it free, while another equally foolish, who desires a &#34; brummagen &#34; pin for his scarf, should have to pay 45 per cent. If the Government are really in need of revenue I see no source that could better be exploited than this. I suggest that the rates of duty be fixed at, British, 30 per cent.; intermediate, 45 per cent.; and general, 50 per cent. </para>

I draw the attention of the honorable senator, however, to the fact that these are unset and uncut stones, which are the raw material of the jewellery trade. Moreover, I suppose there is not an item on which it would be more difficult to enforce duties than this ; they are small, and so easy to secrete that it would be impossible for the Customs officials to discover them. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Perhaps I had better read what the InterState Commission reported and recommended. The debate in Parliament on the 1908 Tariff indicates that the duty placed on imitation precious stones, was in order to encourage the use of Australian stones. The Inter-State . Commission, in dealing with an application for a duty on precious stones, reported as follows :  - </para>

                    <para>Any effort to give effect to this application is beset with difficulties. In the first place, if precious stones are made dutiable, it will seriously affect the manufacturing jewellery industry, a very important industry, which has made considerable progress in artistic merit as well as in volume of output; and, secondly, it will be impracticable for the Customs authorities to exercise any reasonably efficient control which would insure the due collection of the duty which may be imposed. Gems in quantity and high value may be so easily secreted that duties would merely offer an encouragement for smuggling, and the higher the duty, the greater would bethe incentive. </para>

                        <para>- Even so, I submit that the balance of reasoning is in favour of imposing a duty on. these articles, which. cannot for one moment; be regarded as necessaries, and should be called upon to contribute towards the revenue. Otherwise we shall have a man called upon to pay a duty on the dungaree trousers he wears, while another man is allowed to get his diamond ring in practically free. Where is the justice or equity in such a position? The argument as to the difficulty in detecting smuggling applies to all articles which can be carried in small compass, and are valuable. What has been the subject of smuggling more than opium? We did not on that account abandon the opium dutj&#39;, though I believe it is modified to some extent when the product is to be used for medicinal purposes. There are other articles also small which are smuggled, I suppose, every day in the week. If these things are the raw material of the jeweller, the man who purchases them to use as personal adornment can well afford to pay an enhanced price. Any duty paid on the raw material is reflected in the price of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> finished article, and the purchaser of a diamond ring can very justly be called upon to pay for the privilege. </para>

Their is no equity or fairness in taxing the necessaries of life, and allowing, these luxuries to come in free.

                    <para>. - I am not in favour of excessively high duties, except upon luxuries. The Committee is now dealing with luxuries; I shall therefore support the request. I cannot follow the arguments of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> when he states that the reason why British imports may be admitted free while the general Tariff is only 20 per cent, is because of the difficulty in collecting&#39; the duty. If there is anything in that remark, it will be, at any rate-, no more difficult to collect a 50 per cent, duty than one of 20 per cent. </para>

Owing to amendments made in another place.. &#34; clocks n.e.i. &#34; are now dutiable at 45 per cent., while - upon watches and chronometers the general Tariff&#39; is only 30 per cent.

                    <para>.- I: regret that clocks : do: not appear in .  a separate suh-itein,. because it would then be very much, easier., to. deal with- -the- que*tion, especially- in view of the, statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> and the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce-)* Senator Duncan</inline> asked a very pertinent question- as. to why the duty, on . clocks is to- be increased, and the Minister said that the object was to. encourage their manufacture in Australia, as&#39; the industry has been established. Clacks always have and always will be regarded as essential in  every household, particularly in the homes - of men who have to begin, their labours, at an early hour.- Compared&#39; with, the duties imposed under the old Tariff,, the - increases are very heavy; and. I have not yet been able to find any justification for the additional impost. I am. assured that up to the present no clocks have been  manufactured in Australia, and if- that, is so, why should we penalize purchasers? The clock industry abroad has been established by the expenditure of enormous sums of money, and, as a result, these useful article&#39;s have- been produced at a reasonable price.- We cannot hope to have anything that can in. any way compete  with  imported clocks- for many years to come.. In., the. following, sub-item, &#39;provision is made for the, duties on. parts, of cloaks to be administered under departmental by-laws at comparatively low duties; but I believe that whatever industry is established &#39;in Australia,  it  will be merely an assembling and not a manufacturing one. In the meantime, we arc imposing on every user of clocks an additional 15 per cent, burden, which does not seem at all reasonable. I am prepared to give every encouragement to any Australian industry that can supply a fair proportion of our requirements, but I am not willing to support the imposition of heavy duties which have to be passed on <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the public,&#39; and which are not of any benefit to an Australian industry. The Minister has agreed to time registers and detectors being included in the next paragraph, and, for that reason, I would have liked to have been able to deal with clocks apart from other articles.  &#39;When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> request has been disposed of, I shall move  in  the direction of reducing the duties- to 20, 25, and 30 per cent, respectively. I would not submit such a request, but I know that the cost of the clocks is very . much higher than it was a few years ago, in consequence of the increased cost of labour, freights, and the exchange position. &#34;We do not want to further increase prices by imposing unnecessarily heavy duties. A nickel alarm clock, &#39;that could once be purchased for a few shillings, is now double the price. </para>

                        <para>- Those interested in the manufacturing jewellery trade of Sydney are very well satisfied with the proposals of the Government as indicated in this schedule; but there is one little matter about which they &#39; are concerned, and that is to develop, so far as possible, the manufacture of watch cases in Australia. Watch movements are not likely to be made here for a long time, but watch cases are now being made in Sydney. Might I submit, for the consideration of the Minister, that, at all events so far as the British preference and intermediate columns are concerned, there might be a reduction of the duty on watch works and movements, otherwise watch cases will have exactly the same duty imposed on them as watch movements. If we could import watch movements at a little lower duty than the watch cases, there would be a consequent encouragement to make the cases here. I suggest that watch movements might be admitted free from Great Britain, and made dutiable under the intermediate column at 10 per cent., leaving the general Tariff as at present. That would permit of the importation of watch movements at a lower duty, whilst the duty as proposed would remain on watch cases. </para>

                    <para>.- If any honorable senator will go down to the premises of Sutton and Company, in Bourke-street, they will find gramophones that have been assembled in Australia from mechanical parts imported under item 404, to which the Minister has referred. I may say, further, that a very high class of cabinet making has developed as the result of the assembling of gramophone parts here. The outside cases of these machines, made -from Queensland maple, and other Australian hardwoods, are absolutely magnificent. Very skilled artisans have been specially introduced from England and elsewhere who are accustomed to the highest grade work of wood polishing and lacquering. Really magnificent work has been accomplished in the manufacture of cases for these machines from Australian hardwoods by employees of Sutton and Company, who are not the only firm engaged in this particular business. The admission of the mechanical parts of the machines free, and the taxation of the complete machine, has resulted in increased employment and the development of a very useful industry in this country. </para>

                    <para>. - Under sub-item a, home kinematographs are imported free from Great Britain, free in the intermediate column, and at a duty of 10 per cent, in the general Tariff. 1 should like the duty on these machines to be deleted. As honorable senators are aware, these home kinematographs are small machines, of about the size of a typewriter. They are used in homes and in schools, and can be made to serve an educational purpose. I understand that the practice of the Trade and Customs Department is to permit their importation free under departmental by-laws, if they are to be used in schools, and that a number of them are already in use in schools in Victoria. If these machines were made in England I should not ask for the abolition of the 10 per cent, duty in the general Tariff. I understand that at the present time they are practically all imported from the United States of America, though previous to the war a good many of them were imported from France. During the war the manufacture of kinematographs in France was knocked out, and America now sends us more machines than are received from France. I believe that the machines are sold usually at about &#163;30 each, and the duty would represent about &#163;3. I suppose very few of these machines would be found in the homes of the residents of cities and their suburbs, because they have the opportunity to attend the big picture shows. I hope, however, to see the time when a number of these machines will be found in the homes of people in the back-blocks. There are two kinds of home kinematographs imported. In the case of one machine, the handle which turns the film also generates the electricity. With the other machine, which is a little larger, use may be made of the electric current where it is supplied. I have not been asked to take this action by those who are selling these machines. They admit that the duty is not a very high one, and that they are free if imported for the use of schools. I saw them in use before the war on two or three occasions, and have used them myself. Their use might be educational, and the more of them that are used in Australia the better. I understand that in France their manufacture is not permitted unless the film used in them is non-inflammable. As the machines are not made in England, we might very well abolish the duty imposed on them, </para>

                    <para>. - I do not feel very strongly on this matter, but I wish to inform the Committee that before the war a considerable number of these machines were imported from France. In 1913, the value of the total importations was &#163;212,000, and of that amount &#163;38,000 was represented by machines imported from France. In the next year the imports from France dropped to &#163;12,000. From 1916 onwards France practically ceased to export these machines to Australia, but she has again come into the market. I have not&#62; the figures for 1921, but in 1920 importations from France totalled &#163;747. Therefore, we might very well give France the benefit of the intermediate Tariff. This may be done by some trade arrangement in  respect of which negotiations are now in progress. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not wish to speak at any length upon this subject. I am delighted that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has moved to1 request a reduction in the duty on these films, in the intermediate and general columns, to&#62;1&#189;d. I am glad that the Government are willing to concede this meed of justice to a very considerable section of the Australian public. Last year picture theatre patrons paid in taxation under the Entertainments Tax Act no less than &#163;258,000, and, therefore, it is up to this Committee to show them, some consideration, or at least to refrain from deliberately adding to their burdens. The Government are doing the right thing in this matter in the best interests of the majority of the people. When the Tariff was increased in another place, and when the position was given over to the importers of picture films, because the Australian production of films is not sufficient for Commonwealth needs, the importing firms comprising the Picture Film Combine increased rates to the picture showmen throughout Australia by 12&#189; per cent, upon each film each time it went out, and as a result they have been reaping enormous profits from the Australian people. It is about time the ramifications of this Combine and its effect upon the people were inquired into. When the Tariff is finally disposed of, I hope the Government will make a thorough investigation into the moving picture industry with a view to insuring that patrons of picture shows shall not be delivered hand and foot into the grip of this powerful Combine, which is operated largely from the United States of America. It is interesting in this connexion to know that none of the picture theatre concerns that are under the regis of the Combine pay anything in the way of income tax in Australia, although their profits are enormous, and they take tens of thousands of pounds in profits out of Australia every year. I am glad the Minister has seen the wisdom of taking this course of action, and I hope the request will be carried unanimously. </para>

I have no intention of doanplimenting the Government on what is proposed to be done in this sub-item. I should like to hear some reasons for this proposed reduction in the duties. We have been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> that by reducing the duties we shall be taking steps to keep this Combine in order. This is the first time that I have heard that a reduction in a. duty may have that effect. I have received correspondence in connexion with this matter, and I must confess that I am all at sea. Those who represent themselves to be the mouth-pieces of the Australian industry deplore the imposition of the increased duties. The Government are now going to reduce them, and we have been told that by this reduction in the Tariff we shall strike the Picture Combine hip and thigh. How is it going to be done? Are we going to do anything to foster our own resources and inventive genius ? We have not had that reason advanced by the Minister. He has simply asked us <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> vote for the item, but I want to hear some reasons for the proposal to cut the duties in the intermediate and general columns in half, because it will rob the preferential Tariff of its value. Where do we stand ? Are there any local film producers worthy of protection ? If not, we should strike the duties out; but if there are, and if they give promise of success, let us, by means of this Tariff, give them &#171;very encouragement. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with the request put forward by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> but, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> I regret very much that he did not advance some reasons in support of it. We all know that the Tariff, as introduced, provided for duties different from those now appearing on this item, and that after considerable discussion the duty under the general Tariff was considerably raised by another place. If the Committee is going to content itself with a mere request to the House of Representatives to revert to the original duties, without expressing here any reasons for that request, we may well excuse another place if it does not comply with it. For that reason, if for no other, the Minister might well have stated the case for his proposal. There is a very good case for the request, and there is no harm in the public knowing what it is. That case, indeed, should be presented to the Committee, and, through it, to the public, by the mover of the request, and I hope that before we proceed to a vote that will be done. I rose, however, to deal with an aspect of the matter which was touched upon&#39; incidentally by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.</inline> The honorable senator pointed out that when this duty was increased a large number of picture theatres immediately raised their prices, and so passed on the increase to the public. They gave as the reason for their increased charges of admission the additional duty which had been imposed. Even if they were not justified at the moment in increasing their charges, they would eventually have been. I now understand that if the original duties are reverted to a compensating reduction will be made in the tariffs of the picture theatres which increased their rates. </para>

                        <para>- I have heard it said that they will do so if effect is given to this request, and that is one reason why we should make it. I desire, however, to utter a word or two by way of warning. Almost immediately after the increased duty had been passed by another place, some picture theatres raised their prices ; but even if we unanimously pass this request this afternoon we cannot expect a reduction in those prices to follow immediately. Some time must elapse before our request can be dealt with by another place, and it will not be until it has been acceded to that a reduction will take place. I rose to make this point clear, so that false hopes might not be raised in the minds of the public, and also to join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> in inviting the Minister, the mover of the request, to put before the Committee and, through the Committee, the public and another place the reasons in support of our request, which, I think, are unanswerable. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> stated that films for educational purposes were admitted free under departmental by-laws, but I learn, on conferring with those mostly concerned, that that is not absolutely the case. It is only films dealing with serious educational subjects that are so admitted. At the exhibition of small films given recently in the Senate club-room it was pointed out that in order to sustain the interest of the children in films dealing with educational subjects it is necessary to intersperse them with films of a lighter character. These are not recognised by the Department as possessing educational advantages, and are, therefore, taxed at the rate of&#189;d. per foot. The sole market for such films is practically provided by the Education Departments of the different States, which make no charge for admission to their entertainments, and, consequently, there are no means of passing on the duty. It is an easy matter, however, for picture show theatres to pass on the duties imposed in respect of ordinary films. Since the Minister, perhaps inadvertently, gave rise to a misapprehension on my part on this point, I ask him to temporarily withdraw his request, so that I may submit a request relating to an earlier sub-item, with the object of making free of duty the films I have mentioned. </para>

                    <para>. -  This is a matter of general importance. We have had in recent years a new world&#39;s force come into operation in the evolution of kineonatograph and picture shows, and the request by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will have my support. Last year we imported 17,500,000 lineal feet of kinematograph films. Of that quantity over 15,000,000 feet came from America, and the increased duty of lid. per foot imposed by another place would mean the payment of an extra tax amounting to about &#163;100,000 per annum by those engaged in the industry throughout the Commonwealth. Seeing that there are slightly less than a thousand picture shows in the Commonwealth, it is obvious that the average tax on each show would be &#163;100 per annum, and that as most of the thousand picture shows are small the extra duty could not be borne by them, but must be passed on to their patrons. Last year we had some &#39;controversy in this Chamber in reference to the entertainments tax. If we had nothing to protect or no industry* to develop, the previous duties could be reverted to, but I believe that the increased rate was imposed in another place for the very proper purpose of developing the film industry within the Commonwealth and compelling our young Australians to look at </para>

                <para class="block">When I previously submitted this proposal I did not think it necessary to take up the time of the Committee in giving reasons for the imposition of a duty upon kinematograph films, because I knew that honorable senators were aware that I was merely seeking to make the rates of duty what the Government originally proposed they should be. It was another place which increased them. When I submitted my request, I heard so many expressions of approval that I felt I would not be justified in taking up the time of the Committee in asking honorable senators to do what they were apparently willing to do. The reasons the Government have for imposing a duty are those which have already been put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> and it will save time if I simply state that I concur generally in his views, but do not think that this is a case for a deferred duty. The film-making industry in Australia is very small, but if the Tariff Board, which can watch its progress, should consider that the imposition of an increased duty would be justified they will so represent to the Minister for Trade and Customs, who will take the necessary action to bring the matter before Parliament. </para>

                    PRATTEN  (New South Wales) T3.40&#93;.  -  The best elements in the kinematograph trade resent a good many of the insinuations that trusts or combines exist among them. They would welcome the imposition of a deferred duty to come into operation in twelve months time, and that would develop the local industry. Meanwhile, a Select Committee of this Chamber, or a joint Select Committee of both Houses, could inquire into the many apparently unsatisfactory features of the trade. There are bitter complaints about the censorship, about the Americanization of our community by the display of =o many American pictures, and about the display bills, a matter which, I believe, the- recently-returned Victorian Government will attempt- to alter. The Committee could also inquire into the avoidance of taxation alluded to by

                    Nothing but good could come out of such an inquiry. &#39;

Why make the two columns the same? If lid. per foot is not an effective barrier and penalty on the Combine. I am afraid there is not sufficient protection for the budding genius of this country. Here is an expression of opinion from a&#39; gentleman named Bryson, the representative of the leading Combine or large organization of America, in a farewell speech on leaving these shores: -

                <para class="block">It. is quite clear that the inmost of lid. per foot on imported films is not regarded with a friendly eye. There must be an effective duty or none at all. If the duty is too high, it only means that we shall have to pay more for our pastime, and there ought to be a difference made between the two columns. I disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> in his reference to American practices and institutions. This Parliament ought not to* be forced into regarding in an unfriendly way things American, and I do not think that the country generally would approve of such an attitude.- The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> urges that we ought to cultivate a friendly spirit with the Republic of the West, and such remarks as we have heard are net calculated to assist in that direction. America is bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh. Who has not relatives there? Probably not one honorable senator. For myself I know my position in that regard. America is in the same position as we are. It put up with our wool duties, which were raised, though not to an unnecessary level. I deprecate remarks in this Chamber such as we have heard about American business methods and character. I am prepared at all times to se comport myself as to conduce to the cultivation of friendly feeling between what Roosevelt described as this great Commonwealth of the South and the great Commonwealth of the West. I call <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> attention to the chance that is now afforded to make a difference between the columns, and so leave room for  an arrangement to be made later on if desired with America. I desire to see trade relations established on the most amicable basis, believing that to be good in the case of peoples with affinity of speech and blood. I remind the Committee that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> proposed, and I seconded a motion in favour of our having a representative at Washington, the idea was not well received. </para>

                <para class="block">I find that during the eleven months up to May, 1920, there were 154,689 green hides imported into the Commonwealth, while for the previous twelve months there were 50,000 imported. These hides have been coming from New Zealand into Australia during a glut in the local market. That is owing to the fact that this local market is a little better than the London market, inasmuch as the exporters in New Zealand are not called upon to pay the freight of1d. per lb. to England. Honorable senators are well aware of the conditions in the meat industry at the present time. Export  is  absolutely stopped, and the industry altogether is in a very bad state. Anything that we can do to preserve for this industry and its by-products the local market I ask honorable senators to assist in doing by means of this request. If this request be accepted, it will not mean an increase in price to the consumer. Last year 1,000,000 hides were exported from Australia. If the whole of the duty were passed on, it would mean only about 2d. in a pair of boots. Green bides in process of tanning lose from 25 per cent, to 30 per cent., and consequently this request will mean no more than1&#189;d. per lb. on the latter, provided the whole of the duty be passed on. I contend, however, that, owing to the fact that we export hides largely, the duty will not be passed on, and I ask honorable senators to support the request so as to retain our own local market. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish, briefly, to support the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow.</inline> We are large exporters of hides, and the trouble is that in New Zealand, on account of the slump, hides have come down in value from &#163;6 to &#163;1 each in twelve months. This is a lower value than I ever remember these hides to be at, and New Zealand does not wish to incur the expense of paying the freight of1d. per lb. to London. The result is that the hides are being dumped in Australia, as the figures of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow</inline> show. Our hide market is consequently in a frightfully depressed state. New Zealand is&#39; the only place these hides can come from, and I ask the Government to accept the request, particularly in view of the fact that the cost will not be increased to the consumer. </para>

                    <para>. - I think there is another view that I may be pardoned for presenting. It is quite clear that Australia produces more hides than we are at present using, and hence our exportation. It has been stated that the exports total 1,500,000 hides, whereas the imports of the same class of hides are a shade over 500,000. It is quite clear that these hides are coming here not to supply the local need ; but, at the same time, they do provide local work. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator would not have said that a little while ago, when, though the imports were still coming, the price soared sky-high. The bringing of these hides here does add to employment, because they are not bought to remain in a green state; they are taken through some process of manufacture, though how far I cannot say. It does not appear material to me whether this duty is imposed or not. </para>

                        <para>- I am not an. expert on &#34; hide &#34; outside this House; I only state the reasons that induced the Government to include these hides in this category, in the Tariff. As I have said, it appears to me that, whether this duty be imposed or not, it -will not materially affect the industry one way or the other. I point out, however, that these hides are not brought here simply for the pleasure of importing them; they are purchased for treatment in some way which it is possible New Zealand does not provide. </para>

I ask the honorable senator to consider, &#34; seeing that we have an exportable surplus, and we are bound to go on exporting, whether there is any detriment in allowing these hides to come here to be worked up into leather, and exported in that form . It is a belief that this is what occurs that leads the Government to take their present attitude. I am. not prepared to accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.:- As the schedule was originally introduced in another place, chamois leather was admitted free of duty. An amendment was inserted that, on and after 1st January, 1922,. the rates should be, respectively, 10 per cent., 15 per cent., and 20 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> It was stated elsewhere that the local manufacture of chamois leather was just about to become established, and it was considered that, by deferring the imposition of duties until the  beginning of next year, the Australian, manufacturers would then be ready to place their commodity on. the market.  I have, an Australian, specimen piece in my hand, however, which demonstrates that chamois leather is being produced here at this moment. As a fact, the- industry is already well under way in this State, and, I understand, in New South Wales also. I desire the. rates to be made immediately operative and that they shall be the same as in respect of other manufactured leathers, such as glace kid, upon which, since the 30th June last, the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates have been 25 per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per cent. Australian chamois leather- is made from the same material as the imported article. Of course, it is merely a name. The Swiss chamois is not nearly numerous enough to provide skins with which to meet the world&#39;s demand. The leather produced in Australia has been supplied . to the local market on the basis of1s.8d. per square foot. During the war the wholesale price of the imported article was 2s. 6d. per square foot. Americans are now exporting it to this country for less than1s.8d., which is the minimum at which our manufacturers can continue to carry on. In view of the impost proposed from the first day of next year, the Americans are. now sending their product over to Australia in great quantities. The local firm from which I have ascertained some particulars states that it is placing on the . market at present &#163;150 worth of chamois leather per month. It is employing a considerable number of hands ; and it can easily double and treble its output if it is not hampered or crushed. I propose that rates, respect tively, of 25, 30, and 35 per cent, shall become operative immediately&#34; upon Parliament finally passing the Customs Tariff Bill. The effect will be, upon the general Tariff, to- add 15 per cent, to that which is proposed to be imposed from the- 1st January next. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - I do not take exception to the requested alteration of the date, of imposition. The situation at this moment is- that chamois leather is admitted&#39; free of duty. That practice will continue - no matter what rates may be agreed upon, or what may be the date from which, they are to operate - until Parliament shall have finalized the whole matter. It is probable that the Tariff will not have been done with much before the end of October, so that the matter of the imposition of a Tariff on chamois as from 1st January next will be almost immaterial. While I am agreeable to the deletion of the reference to a specific date, it does not follow that I can accept the decision of this Committee thereon as a test concerning the actual rates of duty requested to be imposed. Chamois leather is being made here, but in such small quantities at present that the Minister for Trade and Customs deemed it advisable to postpone the date on and after which the duties should become operative. He rightly took the view, according to the information then in his possession, that if that procedure were not adopted users of chamois leather in Australia would be for some time to some ex-  kent penalized. I suggest that the .request for the amendment of the rates be in the form of making them respectively 20 per &#171;ent., 25 per cent:, and 30 per cent. </para>

Only a little while ago- it was not worth protecting, as in April last importations of this commodity were admitted free from all countries; but when the subject was discussed in another place, and it was discovered that it was an industry of feeble dimensions, certain rates were imposed. In the light of the further information submitted, it would now appear that this is rather a robust industry. </para>

I intend submitting a request for the deletion of the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates. In this and the succeeding sub-items the highest grades of leather used in the manufacture of first-class footwear are included. During the last few days I had an opportunity of visiting several Melbourne factories manufacturing high-class footwear from imported leather, which does not enter into competition with the boots and shoes manufactured from the locally produced patent and enamelled leather. The imported leather is entirely distinct in quality from that manufactured locally, and has reached its present state of excellence after many years of careful investigation. I am informed that there are only three or four firms in Europe which can supply the higher grade material, and that most of our importations come from France. </para>

                        <para>- I think dfc will be admitted that Australian leather is eminently suitable for the manufacture -of certain grades of footwear, and that was proved during the recent war, -when the Australian soldiers&#39; boots were found to be superior to any manufactured in any other part of the world; but in this connexion we are dealing with a higher, grade of leather and material of a quality that, up to the present, is not made here. I am informed that a useful type of enamelled and patent leather is being manufactured in Australia, and I have had an opportunity of inspecting some) of the hides supplied to the local manufacturers of patent leather. The local product is, however, not equal to the imported leather. The imposition of <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties places a very high impost upon the higher grades of leather imported into Australia. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Moreover, the local manufacturers are not producing sufficient to meet the local demand, as makers of high-grade footwear find it almost impossible to obtain supplies. During recent years the price of imported leather has been almost prohibitive owing to the Customs imposts and the manufacture, principally in France, being interfered with in consequence of the war. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that is so, because many of them are behind with their orders, and cannot supply any tiling like the quantity required. A fixed duty of 3d., 4d., or 6d. per square foot is imposed, which affords adequate protection to the local manufacturer; but the imposition of <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates makes the price of imported material exceptionally high. This leather cannot be imported at anything like the price at which the local product is sold. There is also a large degree of. natural protection afforded to local tanners. I do not know why heavy <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> duties are imposed, particularly, as the bulk of the imports come from. France, which, places one of our Allies at a disadvantage. If we leave the fixed duties as they appear in the schedule, the local manufacturers will have adequate protection, and those who desire to purchase the highest grades of footwear will not then be unnecessarily penalized. </para>

                        <para>- I say that on other items the honorable senator has moved for <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties. If the honorable senator&#39;s request is agreed to, the duty imposed on enamelled leather will be less than it is to-day. The Government proposal is that the duty shall be a fixed duty or an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, whichever is the higher. It is because the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty would be the higher in the majority of cases that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> in the interests of importers of this class of leather, submitted his request. I have been greatly surprised that the honorable senator should decry the Australian manufacture of this article. </para>

If the local article is good enough for him, it should be good enough for the people who require the imported article to pay a little more for it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> wishes to permit them to escape having to pay more for the imported article. I hope that the Committee will not, for a moment, entertain his request. If it is agreed to, I fail . to see how honorable senators can logically support any other Protective duty included in the schedule. The honorable senator, with myself, has voted for many other duties which are without any more merit than those now proposed. </para>

When I get a circular about an item in the schedule I know that a day or two later that circular will be used in this Chamber in the form of a speech. The present duty, British, of 3d. per square foot would have been as low as 8 per cent, on the price which this commodity has brought of late years.&#39; The Committee should not single out this industry for a higher measure of protection than has been afforded to others in the interests of people who prefer to wear imported leather. </para>

Local manufacturers of boots made from imported enamelled leather demand a high duty on boots, but they wish to be allowed to purchase their enamelled leather in the cheapest market. That is not logical. If they look for a duty on the goods which they have to sell they should not demur to a reasonable duty on the materials they have to buy. </para>

                        <para>- It is not a question, of grades, but of prejudice. A few weeks ago a friend of my wife&#39;s was looking for a pair of shoes to wear with a certain dress. She -went into the city and had a pair set aside which was to cost &#163;4. When she got home she said that these were the only shoes she could get that would match her dress. I met her husband in the street, and he gave me a pattern, which I brought over to Melbourne. This occurred only the week before last, and on my return to Adelaide I took back a pair of shoes with which the lady was exceedingly pleased. She thought them splendid. The husband said to me, &#34; For Heaven&#39;s sake, don&#39;t tell her the price, and don&#39;t tell her that they were made in Australia.&#34; The lady is wearing the shoes, and is thoroughly pleased with them, although they are Australian-made, and did not cost very much more than one-third of the price which she was going to pay for shoes made from leather imported from, the American concern, whose interests <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> is advocating. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend has been misinformed. During the war the Australian factories gave preference  to the requirements- of the Military Forces. They increased their working time in order to meet those requirements. They set aside the manufacturing of this high-class leather so that they might attend to the needs of the military, and, therefore, the argument which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has used in this connexion should have no influence with honorable senators. I And that during nine months ending March, 1921, 2,400,000 square feet of this class of leather were imported. I may inform honorable senators that this quantity of leather would, if manufactured here, have represented many thousands of hides manufactured in Australia. This is certainly an industry which should receive every consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has said that local manufacturers cannot supply  requirements for this leather, and on this point I may quote a statement which I received from one of our largest manufacturers within the last twenty-four hours. He writes - </para>

                <para class="block">That statement is certainly in conflict with the information which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has given the Committee. I am assured that the quality of Australian leather is undoubted, and the quantity unlimited. There is, in my opinion, no argument for a reduction of these duties. I do not believe that there are a great many workers interested in the manufacture of high-class boots from American leather. The best thing that people in this country can do is to use Australian materials of Australian manufacture on every possible occasion. &#34;We should encourage this industry in every shape and form, and by doing so we shall give assistance to primary producers in Australia. </para>

                    <para>.  - I have great pleasure in supporting the proposals of the Government in connexion with this item. The boot manufacturers of Australia conferred enormous benefits on the Commonwealth during the war. They devoted their plants and the pick of their skins and hides to the service of the Australian Military Forces. We were accustomed during the course of the campaign to endeavour to induce the Australian Forces to adopt British-made boots on the ground that they were superior to -the Australian, and that we could not pro duce here leather of the quality necessary for military boots. These proposals were defeated only by the consistency with which the Australian soldiers adhered to their preference for boots manufactured in Australia. Towards the end of the campaign the excellent quality of Australian leather and Australian-made military boots was recognised throughout the Service. As a result of devoting their best leather to meet military requirements the local factories had no great opportunity to develop the production of the special class of leather with which we are now dealing. Now that military requirements have been met they have an opportunity to turn their attention to this branch of their industry, and they have made enormous strides in it. Just as the leather which they supplied for military requirements was spoken of as being inferior, it is now suggested that the glace kid and patent leathers which they produce are not equal to the imported article. It is up to us to support this Australian industry as our soldiers did, and to insist on people in this country being satisfied with Australian leather. If certain people are wedded to the use of the imported article, they should be called upon to pay for it. The leather and boot manufacturing industries and the woollen industry should he made peculiarly our own, and we should feel ashamed to have boots or clothing imported from any other country. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not much surprised at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> but I am surprised at the attitude of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> in defending this proposal to allow the importation of inferior leather at a lower rate of duty than leather of better quality, because that is the effect of the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties. It is the father of tie &#34; go slow &#34; principle as applied to our manufacturers. They are invited to continue making the inferior articles, because, by means of this Tariff, the Government will prevent good quality imported leather from competing with them. This high quality leather is, I think, produced chiefly in France. The duty per foot should be the same on high-class leather as on the inferior article. Why should we allow a foot of inferior leather  to. be imported at a lower rate of duty than that on good quality material, and thus enable the inferior article to compete with the leather produced in Australia ? We want the very beat of everything. We do not want to go out of our way to discourage the importation of first-class commodities in which the manufacturers of other countries have specialized, because it is only a question of time before our own manufacturers will be specializing, and I have every confidence in their ability to produce an article that will hold its own anywhere. Surely fixed duties of 3d., 4d., and 6d. per square foot are ample protection for the good quality material produced in this country. If not, let the Government raise the duties all round. These duties are a direct encouragement of the &#34; go slow &#34; principle with which supporters of the Government are continually charging trade unionists. The effect of this Tariff will be to place the Australian manufacturer in such a position that he need not exert himself, or employ the most up-to-date methods of production, because the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties will discourage competition in the better class article. </para>

                    <para>.- When this item was under discussion in another place it contained a provision for <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties of 25 per cent. British, 30 per cent, intermediate, and 35 per cent, general, but, as the result of the - debate, the duties were altered as in the schedule now before the Committee. I want honorable senators to understand what percentages these fixed duties represent. The ordinary sand shoe is in most general use, especially during the summer months, in localities within easy reach of the sea shore. Prior to the war women&#39;s sand shoes could be purchased at from 3s. 6d. to 3s. 9d. per pair. Until recently the bulk of these sand shoes was made in Britain by the North British Rubber Company, a very old-established concern, but there were also imports from Japan and a fairly large trade with Canada. My remarks will be confined entirely to the British Tariff. At the present export price for the dark-grey upper sand shoe the fixed British duty of1s. 6d. per pair represents a Tariff protection of 104&#189; per cent, on children&#39;s shoes, 82 per cent, on maids&#39; shoes, and 66 per cent, on women&#39;s shoes, as compared with 25 per cent. in. the previous Tariff. This is out of all reason. I admit that a very good article is manufactured in Australia. I have nothing whatever to say by way of depreciation of the Australian shoe. It is a credit to the factory. </para>

                        <para>- I am taking the price of children&#39;s sand shoes. The wholesale prices of the imported and &#39; locally-made sand shoes for women are practically the . same, namely, 4s. 3d. per pair in the case of the Australian-made article, and 4s. 4d. per pair for the imported article. Had this matter received full consideration when the imposition of fixed duties was first suggested in another place, I think that a much lower rate would have been decided upon. If the fixed duty under the British preferential Tariff were reduced by one half it would still be equal to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties of 52 per cent, in the case of children&#39;s sand shoes, 41 per cent, on sand shoes for maids, and 33 per cent, on women&#39;s sand shoes. We have very properly placed heavy duties on imported boots and shoes, because we have a magnificent boot and shoe industry in the Commonwealth. I find that the protection given to our boot  and shoe manufacturers as against imports from Great Britain is 40 per cent. We ought to bring this item into line with those relating to boots and shoes. The adoption of my suggestion would do no injury to Australian manufacturers of goloshes, sand shoes, and similar footwear. I move - </para>

                    D. MILLEN (New South Wales - Minister for Repatriation &#91;5.9&#93;. - I hope that the Committee will not accept this request. In the first place, I remind honorable senators - although it is somewhat unnecessary to do so at this late stage - that we are engaged in shaping what is admittedly a Protectionist Tariff for the preservation of our own industries, and that in doing so it is impossible always to preserve mathematical uniformity in respect of the various items. I submit, further, that it is impossible to suggest that in the whole Tariff schedule there is not a duty which may not in some way or other pinch some one. We believe, however, that the imposition of these duties as a whole will ultimately benefit, not merely one industry, but the industries of the Commonwealth generally. The Australian consumption of the product of the industry now under consideration is, approximately, 6,000 pairs per day. There is in existence here a factory which is producing with its present staff 2,000 pairs per day, and which is capable of turning out 6,000 pairs per day, and so meeting the whole of Australia&#39;s requirements if it is afforded some increased protection on these lower priced shoes. Although it is turning out what is claimed to be a moderately good article, so far as these cheaper lines are concerned, it finds it impossible to compete with the many cheap lines which are brought from abroad. With this increased protection on the cheaper lines it will be in a position, on the employment of additional hands, to supply the whole of Australia&#39;s requirements.

We have in Papua and elsewhere large tropical areas where rubber is being produced, and we should use the produce of the rubber plantations of those Possessions in the development of our local industries. If the request made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> were agreed to local manufacturers of sand shoes would either have to produce an inferior article or go out of business. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has frankly admitted that the imported shoes which he- exhibited are inferior to those of Australian manufacture. If this suggested reduction were made our manufacturers would be compelled to put on the market an inferior article. </para>

                        <para>- They would have either to close down or produce an inferior article. I have had a very bitter experience of the inferiority of some classes of imported sand shoes. When at the seaside some time ago I purchased sand shoes for myself and family, and in a very few days the soles were completely worn out. Some of the imported sand shoes are made for sale and not for use. The Government are doing a service to the community by imposing these heavy duties. In the interests of the public it would be advisable to absolutely prohibit the importation of inferior classes of sand shoes. I strongly support the retention of the duties. </para>

                    <para>. - A duty of 100 per cent, is an enormous protection to give a rubber company which is doing particularly well. It gets its raw material from our Possessions as cheaply as manufacturers in any other part of the world can obtain theirs, and it has the local market for itself. This duty is apparently imposed so that the whole cost of working* this rubber factory may be borne by people who wear sand shoes. Speaking on behalf of the wearers of these shoes, I object to the imposition  of an extortionate duty which purposes to make a wealthy rubber company even more wealthy. </para>

                    <para class="block">My request, if agreed to, would still leave the duty at 40 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> as against 25 per cent, hitherto imposed upon rubber shoes of British manufacture. A fixed duty of ls. .per pair would be equivalent to 60 per cent., but an impost of 80 per cent., as set out in the schedule, is a bit over the fence. I really believe that the local industry does not need it. The boot industry of Australia has gone ahead by leaps and bounds on a Protective Tariff of 40 per cent. The canvas which forms the uppers of rubber shoes is imported free of duty, so that the manufacturer here is practically on the same level as the British manufacturer with the exception of the freight and shipping charges paid by the latter. </para>

                    LARGIE (Western Australia) T5.201. - Blucher boots could be bought in Melbourne at 5s. per pair although at the time the State Tariff was 5s. per pair, showing; quite clearly that the duty was not paid by the consumer. As a result of the operation of the Tariff, the Victorian boot manufacturers had completely captured the whole of the trade in that class of boots, and there were no imports. The same thing may happen in regard to rubber shoes. At any rate, the illustration I have given shows that it does not necessarily follow that the imposition of a heavy percentage duty upon an article means that the purchaser of the commodity pays it. We ought to consider the possibility of developing an industry by the imposition of a high duty which will give our manufacturers the whole of the local market, and we should be more concerned in doing it in this case when we find that our shoe factories are strenuously endeavouring to keep their employees in constant work.

He tells us that he is of opinion that the Australian article, though it may be a little dearer, is of better quality than the imparted. It is economical for the Australian people to pay a little  more for better quality, and when we know that the Australian rubber shoe, from the point of appearance, wear, and finish, compares more than favorably with the imported shoe, there is no necessity for a young country to import what can be made better by its own workmen. </para>

They certainly do nob pay the duties in this case, because, I am pleased to say, during the last year or two the export of Australian-made boots and shoes has increased to a very considerable extent. I believe that that increase will continue as a result of the high development of the industry here. </para>

                    <para>.- If ever duties required reduction, they are the duties before us. This &#34; infant &#34; industry has been protected, subsidized, and spoon-fed by the people of the Commonwealth until it can now meet competition outside Australia. Surely it is time to reduce the duties, and pro vide cheap boots for our people. I pay more for boots for my boy than was ever paid in my case at the same age, and they last as many months as mine, used to last years. Compared with the old boot made on the knee, we are not getting half the value for our money. What does this duty of 50 per cent, mean ? I undertake to say that if I were to look I should find honorable senators wearing boots that have cost as much as &#163;3 per pair. </para>

                <para class="block">I think there is a great deal in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said. We wish to encourage the use of Australian skins and hides, and build up our boot industry; but we must admit that the duties proposed by the Government are excessive. Skins and hides have fallen enormously in value since this time last year, and are cheaper in Australia to-day than I ever remember them to have been in the history of the country. Practically, hides and skins cannot be sold, and pickled sheep pelts are not worth 6d. each; indeed, some people have burnt the coarser wool skins rather than send them to market. Yet everybody has to have boots, and to people with large families the present price of boots is a great burden. I cannot support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> rather drastic request, but I do ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen to accept the proposal I now make. I emphasize the point that the provision of boots, and their upkeep, in the family of a working man, are a great burden. </para>

                    <para>.- I am anxious to give the boot manufacturers of Australia every protection, but I should like to express an opinion based on personal experience. I speak with some authority, seeing that I am the father of ten children who are just at that age when they require much looking after in the boot line. I can honestly say that during the last three or four years, and in the war period, there was greater robbery in the boot business than in any other. Prom my own experience, I can quite realize how difficult it must have been, and must be now, for a working man to supply his family with boots. As I have indicated, I am anxious to give the manufacturers every encouragement, so that the industry may be put in a position to supply the whole of Australia with boots ; but I appeal to the manufacturers, at a time when they are supplied with cheap hides, and when they have the most efficient machinery, to supply an article equal in value to the price paid. This the manufacturers have not been doing - there has been absolute, damned robbery ! I speak feelingly, for I never go home without having half-a-dozen pairs of boots thrown at me, and being informed that they require soling and heeling. As a matter of fact, one feels inclined to tell the family to go and buy boot-laces and hitch up their boots with them. I can quite understand that in some families children have to go without necessary food in order that they may be supplied with boots. I sincerely hope the manufacturers will endeavour to turn out a better article than .that which, at any rate, they have been supplying me during the last few years.- I may, of course, be an unfortunate exception; my children, healthy and vigorous as they are, may wear out their boots more quickly than others; but one is entitled to expect, at the least, that a pair of boots will last a child a fortnight or three weeks. I have known boots, bought for members of my family, to require soling and heeling within three weeks, and, so inferior has been the leather put into the repairs, that they have almost immediately required further attention. While I trust that the manufacturers will always have a fair deal, I hope that they will not forget the public, but will give them an equally reasonable &#34; run for their money.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. - Victoria for years has been practically the home of the boot manufacturing industry in Australia. It is interesting, therefore, to hear a Victorian senator request a fairly substantial reduction of duty, and to listen to the support given him by another Victorian,  who is equally well aware of the whole of the facts. There is a strong feeling that the people are paying too dearly for the degree of protection which has been afforded manufacturers. The National Parliament should give consideration, not only to makers who have been taken very good care of for many years, but to the parents of growing families throughout the Commonwealth. Heads of households are being forced to pay excessively heavy prices for articles which, in many cases, are of inferior quality, owing to foreign competition having been virtually shut out. I am agreeable to afford such protection as will permit the Australian manufacturer to meet competition from, abroad on a fair and reasonably favorable footing, but I do not think he should be so protected as to be made practically free from all regard for overseas competitors. The local manufacturer has been, and still is, taking advantage of the situation, and, unfortunately, the retailer has done the same in many instances. If a duty, of 40 per cent, is not sufficient, it is not Tariff  protection, but &#34;police&#34; protection, that the manufacturers must be in need of. The existing rates may have the effect of forcing many children to go barefooted. In the long run that may not be an evil. If the people are led to boycott retailers who have been demanding altogether unreasonable prices, drastic reductions may be brought about. </para>

                    <para>. - I am. pleased that a note of revolt has been sounded. No honorable senator desires to do injury to the Australian manufacturers, but the best service which can be rendered them is to issue a warning that unless they play fair they need not look for a continuance of the degree of protection which they have been enjoying. Australian methods of turning out leather are far behind what they should be. We send abroad the. best hides in the world, and they come back in the form of very much better leather than that which is being produced locally. </para>

                        <para>- That is true. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain</inline> has correctly stated that the quality of the footwear produced to-day is so inferior that many boots will not stand a second soling. That is not due to lack of adequate protection. A halt should be called upon the insane policy of piling up protection when it is not required or merited. Manufacturers should be made to remember that there is competition awaiting them unless they are prepared to give a fair deal, to the public. Boot manufacturers neither need nor deserve a 50 per cent. Tariff. </para>

                    <para>. - There should be some Balance between the duties upon the raw material and those upon the manufactured article. If the request is agreed to, the difference between tie rates upon leather and on the manufactured article will &#39;be reduced to only 5 per cent. Do honorable senators consider such a margin sufficient? The raw material, when it is imported, emanates from countries whose products come under the general Tariff. American leather imported to Australia is subject to 35 per cent, duty, and that from Great Britain to 30 per cent. Will this Committee be going a little too far if it agrees to the request? </para>

Milieu).</inline> While I have considerable sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain</inline> in regard to his complaints concerning inferior leather, there may be reason for the poor quality of much of the footwear sold to the public to-day. During the war the Government insisted upon getting the very best quality of leather for the boots worn by Australian soldiers. The result was that a certain quantity of inferior material remained on the hands of local tanners. This was bought, in many instances, at exceedingly high prices, for civilian footwear. The manufacturers must get rid of those boots in some way or another. Factories are absolutely stocked up. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but American and Continental representatives outbid the local men for the best leathers. And even the remainder, which the Australian manufacturers were able to secure, were unreasonably costly; they were far above normal market values. The makers are now saddled with that expensive but inferior stuff. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so. Manufacturers were forced to purchase inferior leather at high prices in order to carry on business, and it is unfortunate that a certain quantity of this leather had to be made into boots. The remedy does not lie in allowing importers to bring hoots into Australia. Our manufacturers -should be encouraged to make boots from Australian hides at reasonable prices. </para>

I shall tell them that the boot manufacturers, who were making good boots for 12s. lid. before the war, and were selling them at 14s. lid. after the war, are now asking at least 20s. a pair. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> says that these have been manufactured from inferior leather that could nob be utilized for military purposes. The Australian manufacturers were not compelled to utilize second-grade material, although they secured the best to carry out military contracts. I am glad <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain</inline> gave the Committee the benefit of his experience, because his interjection may become famous, because he has shown what has happened after fifty years of Protection. </para>

                        <para>- During the war the boot manufacturers secured prices which paid them handsomely, .because they contracted on flat rates, and as one who had considerable experience in the letting of contracts in the early stages of the war, I know that all manufacturers were included. Every firm, capable of manufacturing in. sufficient quantities was able to tender, and boots were produced at a price that showed a good profit. I admit that the boots compared favorably with any manufactured in any part of the world ; but surely that is not a reason why outsiders should not compete with Australian manufacturers. Competition will compel them to sell at reasonable prices, and surely a duty of 40 per cent., as suggested, is sufficient for a firmly-established industry. On principle, I shall vote for a duty of 40 per cent., and on the platform. I shall make it known that the Nationalist Government are keeping up prices by asking us to adopt such unreasonable duties. </para>

                    <para>.- This is a very important item, as it affects the mass of the people. A State Minister said a. little while ago that it cost as much to buy one pair of boots as it did to purchase three hides, which indicates that, there is a great difference between the cost of the raw material and the- price which people have to pay for- footwear. There is a plentiful supply of raw material of good- quality in Australia, and as we have the best workmen in the world, a duty of 40 per cent, is reasonable. I support the request. </para>

                    <para>.- Many of the articles mentioned in this item, particularly those in sub-item  a,  are used in hospitals, and when it has previously been pointed out hat articles were necessary, for invalids they have been admitted free. If. these are required in our public hospitals they should not be dutiable. </para>

There does not appear to be any valid reason why those who use glazed, millrglazed, or coated newsprint in their publications should be compelled to pay a; &#39;higher rate of duty than those who use inferior paper. This matter has been brought raider my notice by the proprietors of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> which is &#176;a great Protectionist paper. In fact, they have said that I have created a good deal of fun in the Senate in  advocating Free Trade principles, and that my attitude has been amusing. I venture to say that when I read a communication I have received from the proprietors of that paper it will cause a good deal of amusement, and will show that the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> proprietors are not at all consistent.

                    <para>I wish to draw your attention to what, appears to be an anomaly in the recent- Tariff amendments made in the House of Representatives. Under those amendments newsprint would come in free and &#163;3, wheroasno mention being made of higher grade of printing paper such ttB is used by the Bulletin, the Sydney . Wait, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Punch,</inline> and many other papers, the rate for this would remain at 5 per cent., 10 per cent., and 15 per cent. This is really penalizing a newspaper for using high-grade. paper. The present price of glazed paper is from &#163;65 . to &#163;70 per ton, while that of news is &#163;30* to &#163;35. The Bulletin alone uses from 10 . to 12 tons per week. No attempt is being made in Australia to rrannfacture high-grade printing paper, nor does it seem that any will be made, some time ago when an extra duty was . put on glazed printing paper, I pointed out . to the Customs authorities in Sydney that since our paper was being used exclusively for newspaper purposes, and 1 was prepared to make a declaration to this effect, it should be admitted as&#39; newsprint. They did this, but later put it back into the glazed paper section, and: made it liable for the higher duty. I would, therefore, ask you to consider an amendment to 334  c  (2), so that printing (glazed, unglazed,  mill-glazed, and coated) would be admitted the same- as newsprint. In other words, that all paper used solely for newspaper purposes be admitted under the one heading. </para>

Here is a paper that stands solidly for Protection, and, naturally, one would have thought that its proprietors, who so strongly advocate Protection, would have favoured a duty  of  at least 200 per cent, on newsprint, because their arguments for years&#39; past have been that if we establish our own industries we will secure cheaper articles. </para>

Some time ago when visiting New Zealand, I was struck with the high standard of the illustrated papers in that Dominion. When I came back to Australia I commented on the fact, and I was told that it was because of the difference in the class of paper used in New Zealand. The reclassification I propose should be made to give the people who use the best class of paper an opportunity to secure it at a reasonable price.

                    <para>. - I. am ve-ry pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gai&#34;-,</inline> diner has moved his request. .1 received,&#39; as he has done, the&#39; letter which he read from, the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> manager. He describes it as a case of a Protectionist crying out for Free Trade for himself; but I take a different view. In my opinion, the. writer merely points out that the Tariff, as it stands, unfairly discriminates between the users of what, for&#39; Tariff purposes, should- be regarded as the same necessarily imported commodity. The proprietor of the ordinary daily journal is allowed to import his newsprint free under the British preferential Tariff, and at a duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;Z</inline> per ton under the intermediate and general Tariffs. The proprietor of a newspaper which uses the class of paper that is used by the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Mail,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Australasian,</inline> and other weekly newspapers for the illustrated portions of their issues is called upon to pay for this better class of paper about <inline font-style="italic">&#163;Z</inline> 10s. per ton if it is imported from Great Britain, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7</inline> 10s. per ton if imported under the intermediate Tariff, and &#163;10 10s. per ton if imported . under the general Tariff. It is because &#39; of this - unfair differentiation that the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and other honorable senators has been directed to the item by the writer on behalf of the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> and. others. The matter is one which does not concern only the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin.</inline> It affects the proprietors of Australian newspapers who use this better class of glazed paper for the illustrated portions of their issues. It concerns the proprietors of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Mail,</inline> the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Punch,</inline> which I believe is printed wholly upon. this glazed paper, and it concerns also the proprietors of weekly newspapers in Tasmania. I, too, have frequently had my attention drawn to the superiority of the illustrated newspapers of Now Zealand over those of the Commonwealth. I venture to say that the only newspapers in the Commonwealth that, so far as illustrations are concerned, can hold their&#39; own with the New Zealand newspapers are the Tasmanian weekly illustrated newspapers. But because of this differentiation of duty they have to pay heavily for the paper which they use for purposes of illustration. </para>

                        <para>- I could not say. I expected <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> when raising the matter of New Zealand, to give some information on that point. I think we may assume that there is no differential duty imposed in New Zealand, or the , better class of paper would not be so freely used there as it is. Honorable senators must be aware that for purposes of illustration the better class of paper must be used. They have seen that attempts made to illustrate ordinary daily newspapers printed on the ordinary newsprint &#39; give results that are not at all comparable with those obtained by the use of glazed paper. The case for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> request is a very strong one indeed. If ordinary newsprint is admitted&#39; free under the British preferential Tariff, there is no reason why this glazed paper, when used for newspaper purposes, should have to pay a duty of &#163;3 10s. per ton. If ordinary newsprint is imported at &#163;3 per ton under the intermediate Tariff, there is no reason why , the glazed paper, used solely for newspaper purposes, should have to pay &#163;7 per ton if imported under the same Tariff. In the same way, if ordinary newsprint can be imported at &#163;3 per ton Under the general Tariff, there is no reason why glazed paper used for exactly the same purpose should have to pay a duty of &#163;10 10s. under that Tariff. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> request&#39; is a very fair one, and should commend ..itself to the Minister in charge of the Bill as well as to honorable senators generally. I had just now an opportunity of discussing this matter with the departmental officers in attendance, and they suggested that there might be some difficulty in tracing the paper brought in under this heading - that is for newspaper purposes ; but 1 have uo doubt that the skill of the officers of the Trade and Customs Department would overcome any difficulty that might present itself. Certainly all engaged in the newspaper industry in Australia should &#39; be placed on the same footing, and those who use the better class of paper should certainly not be penalized for doing so. </para>

                    have to consider at the same time how far we are justified in going in imposing, purely for revenue purposes, a duty on those in Australia who must use this class of paper. The Government have considered that a . duty of &#163;2 per ton represents a fair . adjustment of the conflicting claims.  The duty on newsprint represents a considerable addition to the cost of production of the country newspaper, and in the circumstances - it is deemed to be quite a reasonable proposition to make the duty on this class of paper as low as possible, having regard to the desire to give preference to imports from Great Britain. It is in that spirit that I have submitted my request.

I do not know what may be the financial position of the proprietors of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Punch,</inline> the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Mail,</inline> and other newspapers who use glazed paper for the illustrated portions of their issues, but they are to be highly commended for not having approached members of  the  Committee in connexion with this item. I wish to direct attention especially to the fact that if no difference is made between the duties imposed in the intermediate and general columns no opportunity will be afforded to deal with Canada in the way which has been previously suggested from the Ministerial table, although we obtain a great portion of our supplies of paper from that Dominion. </para>

                        <para>- Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> I have received a communication from the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> which desires to have the special class of paper required for that journal and others placed in the- same category as newsprint, but I am doubtful if that course would . be quite satisfactory. The present cost of glazed newsprint, we are told, runs from &#163;60 to &#163;.65 per ton, but when prices become normal again the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> and other weekly newspapers, using the some kind of print may not be on the winning side if we do as has been suggested. Newsprint, as we know, was quoted at &#163;9 per ton at port of shipment prior to the war, and the Ministerial proposal for a duty of &#163;2 per ton represents on that figure about 20 per cent. It&#39; would appear, therefore, that the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> in endeavouring to get its newsprint into the same category as ordinary newsprint, is really seeking a disadvantage rather than an advantage, assuming, of course, that values will become normal in- a few years. - I am, of course, prepared to be guided by the statements made by the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> which, I presume, understands its own business, and especially when it speaks on behalf of other weekly newspapers using the same high-class newsprint; but I direct attention to the fact that the British preferential duty may be very much of a delusion for this reason : Britain does not supply her own requirements. </para>

Accepting as accurate the statement that Great Britain does not supply her own requirements, is is conceivable that she must import the raw material and export the finished product.

                        <para>- Assuming that Great Britain does not supply her own market, the inevitable result of preferential treatment will be to admit material against which there should be a stiff duty. To meet the position I suggest that the intermediate should be lower than the general Tariff. In regard to the general question of imposing a duty at all, unfortunately it is true that at present we are not manufacturing this commodity in Australia, but there is no reason why we should not be doing so in the near future. Every year we are making bonfires of hundreds of thousands of tons of excellent material on our wheat farms throughout the Commonwealth. This straw, which is being sent up in smoke, is at least as good as the softwoods of the Atlantic coast&#39; for paper pulp, if only we can hit upon the right process to convert the material to its proper uses. There is also some prospect of being able to treat the banana leaves of Queensland plantations, as well as other tropical fibrous products, in the same way. It is discouraging to think that while there is an abundance of the raw material in this country we have not yet devised a means of converting it into paper pulp. I would be opposed to these revenue duties but for the fact that those who are engaged in the industry say that they are prepared to put their hands into their pockets and contribute a substantial sum towards the public revenue. In the meantime I suggest that the intermediate Tariff be reduced to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1.</inline></para>

During the war her paper mills were diverted to war purposes. The troops were supplied with food packed in paper containers; the first gas masks were made from paper, and practically every shell fired in France had a paper core. The waders and waterproof clothing for that awful first winter on the Somme were also made of paper. After 1916 our supplies of paper from England practically ceased. We were then at the mercy of foreign manufacturers, and any one who has purchased paper knows how we were treated by them. It may be interesting to honorable senators to learn that the manufacture of paper from wood is a comparatively recent discovery. As a matter of fact, the first patent was taken out in 1873. Prior to that time paper was made from rags, and its price was1s. per lb. The first paper made from wood to be placed on the market was sold at exactly half that price, namely, 6d. per lb., and its advent practically revolutionized the paper trade. </para>

He was informed that when he went to the Canadian Export Company, which was the selling company, the price would be 5&#189; cents. He asked who the Canadian Export Company was, and he was assured that it was the millowners under another name. In the course of conversation he discovered that 3&#189; cents was a big price at the mills, and they could not ask more, because the mill employees would come out for higher rates, and the taxation would be heavy. Therefore, they floated the Canadian Export Company. On inquiry he found that the selling price was 6&#189; cents; but he was told that they could not sell for Australia, and that he would have to go to the Packing Company for that. He found that the Packing Company was the same people under still another name. . . He was also told that the price for export to Australia was 13&#189; cents. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the prices of other commodities went up in anything like the same proportion. Before the war we were paying l&#163;d. or l|d. per lb. for newsprint, whereas in 1919 and i920, as I have said, we were paying practically ls. per lb. for it. There was no reason whatever for that great advance except that some one was making inordinate profits at our expense. I desire, if possible, to retain this preference for Great Britain so that it may get back this trade. I am. assured that we shall obtain large supplies of newsprint from England. It has been said that she is not in a position to supply her own requirements and those of Australia. My information is that she is able to do so. Earlier in my speech I referred to the crude machines employed in the manufacture of paper forty years ago. &#39;Practically all the paper-making machines in Canada and the United States of America come from Great Britain. Just recently there has been set up in Canada a British machine which makes newsprint 216 inches wide at the rate of 1,000 feet per minute, or 11-J miles of paper, 6 yards wide, an hour. That is done with British machinery. It .has also been, said that Great Britain is at a disadvantage in that she has to obtain from foreign countries the pulp required for the manufacture of newsprint. It is true that she imports her pulp, but she has interests in Scandinavia and also in Canada. For every ton of pulp made 2 tons of coal have to be used, and Scandinavia has to import her coal from Great Britain. &#34;What is more, both Canada and Scandinavia have to import from Great Britain the china clay used in the manufacture of newsprint. The finest deposit is in Cornwall, and nearly 15 per cent, of newsprint consists of china clay. </para>

                        <para>- I have heard the statement, but have not had any evidence in support of it. It was suggested that such evidence would be forthcoming, but it has not been produced. The <inline font-style="italic">British. Paper Maher</inline> of 21st April, 1921, stated that of 50,000 employees in the paper trade at the end of February 26,000 were without employment, and 16,000 were working only half time. It is beyond doubt that&#34; England is in a position to supply our requirements, and we know that we can expect a fair deal from the Old Country. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know that I can add much to  what I have already said, but I should like to refer again to one aspect of the question. It will be clearly seen that this is not in any sense a Protective duty. Two interests appear to be involved. There is, first of all, the desire that Great Britain shall be given a preference. Since we do not make this paper ourselves, . we are anxious that, as far as possible, Great Britain shall have an opportunity to supply our requirements; but we have to ask ourselves what is a &#34;fair preference to give in the circumstances, remembering that the preference we are giving in the shape of this duty under the general Tariff will be collected from those who use newsprint. That point must not be overlooked. If the duty remains at &#163;3. per ton, it will give a greater preference to British companies, and therefore enhance their prospects of supplying the Australian market; but it means an additional impost on those who use the paper. </para>

                        <para>- I have heard the same principle enunciated by men who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> pose as strong Protectionists. The statement I have made does not rest on fiscal faith - it comes from some knowledge of human nature. Every man is going to get the best possible price for what he has to sell, and those who pretend to be influenced by any other motive are merely humbugging themselves; they are not likely to deceive anybody. This proposal to fix the duty at &#163;2 against other countries but Great Britain is a balancing of the strong and genuine desire on the part of the Government to give the Mother Country a preference with its regard for those who have to pay the duty. In other words, the Government consider that we can give Great Britain substantial preference without unduly taxing those who require to use the paper. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> says that he hopes that Great Britain will regain its trade in newsprint, and I have no doubt that it will do so so far as Australia is concerned under a preference of &#163;2. He says that the paper it produces is the best in the world. That very fact should open the door of many markets to British manufacturers, irrespective of any preferential rate of duty or Tariff encouragement, and when to the skill of the British workmen is added a preference of &#163;2 a ton, Great Britain should be enabled once more to exercise in the Australian market that dominant influence it possessed before the war. The Government consider that a preference of &#163;2 a. ton is sufficient. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but I do  not wish to sound a personal note in the matter. I would rather deal with the facts underlying the case than, with the persons appearing in the matter. At any rate, the Government regard a preference of &#163;2 as sufficient, and contend that there is no justification for levying an additional toll on those who require to use paper. </para>

                        <para>- I can give other examples. A little while ago I had occasion to cable to London for a price, which was given as 5&#189;d. per lb. f.o.b. London, I wired to Melbourne makers, and ascertained that their price was 5&#188;d. per lb. f.o.b. Melbourne. In addition to the price of 5&#189;d. per lb. f.o.b. London, the importers would have had to pay packing charges, duty, landing charges, and the cost of cartage from the wharf to the warehouse, which charges would easily amount to 3&#189;d. per lb. Clearly the Melbourne people were not taking advantage of the duty. </para>

At no time during the war did the mills in Sydney charge more than &#163;40 a ton for Manila board, whereas the price of the imported article was about &#163;90 a ton. These instances I have mentioned clearly prove that the Australian manufacturer does not in every case seek to take advantage of the Tariff. </para>

                    <para>. - I first became interested in the duty on newsprint about July of last year, when two or three proprietors of country newspapers in New South Wales, friends of mine for many years, asked me to use whatever small influence I might have in the direction of securing a duty of &#163;3 per ton against other countries than Great Britain, and I know that newspaper proprietors subsequently waited on the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> and asked him to impose that rate of duty. They had had a very rough spin from the newsprint manufacturers of Canada and other parts of the world, and they believed that the best thing they could do in all the circumstances would be to give Great Britain the opportunity of  entering into competition with those other countries for the supplying . of newsprint to Australia. They thought that that would be the means of keeping down the cost of the article to themselves. The Government accepted the suggestion submitted, which was also supported by some of the proprietors of metropolitannewspapers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has told us that the rate of &#163;3 per ton was forced upon the Government in another place; but I know that a great many followers of the Government, who knew the whole of the facts, supported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lamond&#39;s</inline> amendment to increase the duty proposed by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene).</inline> As a. matter of fact, the amendment was tacitly accepted by that gentleman. The duty which was thus increased to &#163;3 per ton. is now before us for our consideration, and the Government asks us to request the House of Representatives to reduce it to &#163;2. In the meantime, the very people who originally asked for a duty of &#163;3 per ton- </para>

                        <para>- Many of the newspaper proprietors are still prepared to adhere to the rate of &#163;3 per ton. They are eager to get away from the domination of the newsprint manufacturers of other countries. They know that Great Britain will treat them fairly. They remember that during the war the British newsprint proprietors, at the request of the British Government, turned their factories over to the manufacture of munitions while manufacturers in other countries, by taking over the trade their British competitors formerly had, were able, not only to build up their own industry, but also to fleece the very men who were forced to use the paper they, were manufacturing. They fleeced our Australian newspaper proprietors. In the words of our Minister for Trade and Customs, these men, whose interests some honorable senators are so anxious to protect, &#39; &#39; bled Australia white when they had the opportunity of doing so.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- These are not my words, they are the words of a gentle man who had the advantage of advice from his officers from one end of Australia to the other, and was aware of the whole of the circumstances. The British manufacturers have not bled Australia white. The aim of the duty as fixed in another place was to give an effective preference that would enable British manufacturers to regain their place in the newsprint trade and meet the competition that has grown up in other countries under conditions that I have already described. Unless we give an effective protection to British manufacturers, they will be unable to face that competition. Great Britain is just beginning once more to develop this line of manufacturing industry; and unless she receives from us, and the other Dominions, some degree of assistance, she will not be able&#39; to compete with those men who made enormous fortunes during the war by &#34;bleeding&#34; our newspaper proprietors, and through them the public. Those foreign manufacturers can use the reserve they have been able to build up against the British manufacturer; and, apparently, it is we who are going to provide fighting funds to help them against our own people. I hope the Committee, will not consent to depart from the duty now before us. We can afford to adhere to that duty, which will not impose any additional hardship on our newspaper proprietors. If it would do so, we should not find so many of them in favour of a duty of &#163;3. Some of these proprietors believe that Britain will give them a fair deal, and have entered into contracts with her at what are regarded as satisfactory rates, though these may not be as low as might, for the time being, be offered by the manufacturers of other countries. But once let the British factories be closed down, how long will it be before the foreign manufacturers will raise their price? I cannot understand the attitude of the Government in proposing such a substantial reduction. They may have on their side what they consider to be good reasons, but even from a sentimental point of view we ought to stick to the country that has stuck to us. </para>

                    <para>. - What we have to do is to try to reconcile the interests, concerned. There are on one side the newspaper proprietors, and with them the general public, and on  the other, the policy of the Government to give the favoured nation treatment to countries trading with us. There are three columns in this Tariff - a general column intended for the least favoured nations, an intermediate column for those countries with whom we can make reciprocal arrangements, and then the British preference column, which gives the most favoured nation treatment to the 0(ld Country. The newspaper proprietors say that they are satisfied with &#163;3 per ton as the general Tariff, and &#163;2 per ton as the intermediate Tariff. If the Ministerial proposal is given effect to, and the &#163;3 in the general column is reduced to &#163;2, it simply means that there will be no chance of giving any preference to our sister Dominion of Canada. It is news to me that the Government is so overburdened with revenue that they do not require the extra duty. Wo can easily, I submit, reconcile the structural gradation of the Tariff in the three divisions with the desire of those who wish to pay something towards the revenue of the country, but that cannot be done unless the general column is maintained at &#163;3. I am afraid that what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> fell too lightly on the ears of honorable senators. There are prospects of competition from Japan. I am not one to decry that country, as my utterances in this Chamber have proved. I rather welcome her competition; but I say that we here are entitled, just as the Japanese are entitled, to protect our own interests, and to take our own means of doing so. Japan has suddenly come to the front and developed so rapidly that, even during the short course of the war, she supplied us with commodities that we never dreamt of as possible; and it is within the range of possibility that she will become one of the largest suppliers of newsprint. In the <inline font-style="italic">Times Trade Supplement</inline> of 16th April, 1921, there is some reference to the progress of industries in Japan, and I hope honorable senators will take what I am. about to read to heart, as showing the immediate prospects of that country - </para>

                    <para>There are some sixty large .paper and pulp mills in Japan proper, including seven establishments recently opened in Saghalien and Chosen. Paper is made of all qualities, and to meet practically all requirements, from heavy art paper to cigarette paper and common wrapping paper. Strawboard and pasteboard of excellent quality are manufactured in large quantities, and even wallpaper is now made in Japan, though chiefly for export. Like most other markets and industries, the paper trade is just now in a curious position. The prices accepted by Japanese mills for orders coming from overseas arc below those charged for orders placed to meet domestic requirements. </para>

                    D. Millen has put it very clearly and candidly to honorable senators that if we impose a duty which is higher than this &#34; scientific&#34; Tariff deems necessary we shall put an impost on those in the Commonwealth who use newsprint. We all admit the active part that the press plays in the education of our people.

                        <para>- My friend speaks for himself j and it is not every one who so worthily earns the vilification. We know the valuable work that the press does; and I think that in regard, to this item the Committee will live up to the principle that has been, laid down of preference to Britain. As to the statements we have listened to from Senators Duncan and Vardon as to the great desire there is to trade with Britain, I can * only describe them, if I am allowed to use an Australian term, as so much &#34;flapdoodle.&#34; The Tariff is free to Great Britain, and we cannot have it lower; It is claimed that the British paper is superior to all other. I remind honorable senators of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating&#39;s</inline> speech tonight, in which he told us that in New Zealand, where British paper is used, there is an illustrated publication which . stands out because of the high quality of its production. We are told of what Japan may do; but surely the Senate of the Commonwealth is not to l;e guided in its making of the laws by mere statements in the public press of the Old Country? We admit the quality of i he British paper; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> informs us that Britain can supply the whole of our demands; but, on the other hand, there are many senators who tell us that that is not so. </para>

Ho put up a better case&#62; indeed, in support of my proposal for an intermediate rate of 30s. per ton than, in advocacy of a Tariff of &#163;3. The only real argument advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> was that Australia should give back to- Britain the trade she lost as a result of the war. The Committee is asked to put on one side all question of relative quality, and blindly give preference, so that Great Britain may re-establish her trade relations. I intend to press strongly for a reduction of the intermediate Tariff in the manner just indicated, and I trust that honorable senators will remember that the Government have described the incidence of the paper duties as being revenue-productive rather than a matter of Protection. I shall support the re* quest of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D.

                    <para>. - Reference has been made to the country press. Some time ago that body suggested that the general duty on newsprint should be &#163;3 per ton, and that British paper should be admitted free. In a letter written &#39;by the secretary of the Provincial Press Association, dated 14th June last, there appeared the following : - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>Conference also wished to formulate a clear motion, so as to prevent the  necessity  of registering its clear and unanimous objection- to any preference or concession whatever being given to newsprint manufactured in Canada, where the mill-owners have, during the past few years, combined to rob Australian consumers of several millions sterling. By omitting any mention of its willingness to concede preference to Great Britain, it obviated the necessity of defining its equally emphatic opposition. Every country newspaper proprietor throughout the Commonwealth warmly welcomes the news that the Mother Country is about to re-enter the Australian market, and warmly supports preference being granted to her products. In view of the disturbed state of exchange in both America and Canada, and the cruel exactions of the Paper Rings in both those countries, as well as Norway and Sweden, the entry of Great Britain into our market at the present time is providential, and should result in millions being expended within the Empire to revitalize trade that has, as a result of the war, been diverted into the hands of foreigners, to the injury and undoing o&#163; Great Britain in particular and the Empire in general. </para>

                <para class="block">Despite the contents of that letter - in the face of its professions of loyalty and the expression of the wish that Great Britain should regain her paper trade - I have learned from a very reliable source that, in the same month in which the letter was indited, namely, June last, the Provincial Press Association received a consignment of paper by the <inline font-style="italic">Tango Maru,</inline> from Japan. The country press are the parties who are moving the most eagerly to secure a reduction of the present duties. Evidently, Japan is to be feared among other foreign competitors of Great Britain. </para>

                    <para>. - Some reference has been made to the attitude of the Provincial Press Association. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> stated that tha.t organization had approached the Minister for Trade and Customs, and that it was hysterically anxious to secure a general duty of &#163;3 per ton. The honorable senator ought to have indicated what the country press submitted as an alternative. Their representations suggest the position of a delinquent who has the option of paying a fine of 40s. or going to prison for two days. The guilty party may reply that he prefers to pay the 40s., but he would rather not be called upon to pay anything. The provincial press representatives submitted a suggestion for a duty of &#163;3 per ton, not because they wanted to pay any duty what ever, but as an alternative to the imposition of a 10 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> Tariff, when such a rate would have been equivalent to a fixed duty of &#163;6 or &#163;7 per ton. I do not suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> desired to mislead the Committee; but it is misleading to state that the country press agreed to a &#163;3 duty unless it is further pointed out that the preference so expressed was in lieu of something less palatable. The Provincial Press Association preferred to pay a fixed duty when the price of paper was high rather than run the risk of paying 10 per cent, on an uncertain market. Now that the price of newsprint is coming down, however, they have made representations in favour of a rate of &#163;2 per ton. </para>

Britain will be able to maintain her prestige, and defy that competition, with a duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> per ton. </para>

                    <para>. -  I wish to deal with only one point, and that is the question of Japanese importations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> finds it difficult to understand why a certain section of the Country Press Association has changed its views. I am wondering, but not so much as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> why certain proprietors have changed their attitude upon this matter. I have gathered from official statistics that in the year 1919-20 nearly &#163;11,000 worth of newsprint was imported from Japan. That represents a considerable quantity. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> seems to forget that newsprint factories can readily be turned into establishments for the production of munitions in time of war, and in this way we may be assisting Japan in a way that we do not desire. I have been elected to Parliament to render assistance in building up Australian industries, and I am supporting the Nationalist platform in an endeavour to assist in consolidating the Empire so far as we are able. This is one direction in which we can help by maintaining an important industry at the fountain head of the Empire, and if I have to decide whether I shall assist Japan or Great Britain, my vote will be for Britain every time. </para>

                    </talker>
                    <para>. -  I intended to refrain from participating in the debate on this item ; but as there has been such a conflict of opinion it appears to be necessary to express one&#39;s opinion. I desire to deal with the question from the point of view which must occur to honorable senators to be the correct one. I am distinctly in favour of giving preference to Great Britain over Canada, America, or any other country. If we accept the proposition of the Government, which is a good one, we shall have to bear in mind that we may jeopardize even the trade we wish to do with Great Britain. If we establish trade with Great Britain we are more likely to get paper made in Australia than in any other way. If, for instance, we were to place Canada on the same basis as Great Britain - I have nothing whatever to say against that Dominion or the desirableness of entering into reciprocal trade arrangements - Canadian manufacturers would not establish the paper-making industry in Australia; if ever newsprint is made in the Commonwealth the work will be undertaken by British manufacturers. It seems, therefore, that we ought to be sure that the preference given to Great Britain is a real preference, and if we impose a duty of  &#163;2  per ton the rate might be a popular one, but would it be sufficient to enable Great Britain to retain the trade until we become manufacturers of paper ? I am convinced that before many years manufacturers of &#34;paper will see what our Australian forests are capable of producing in the matter of paper pulp, and I am confident from what I have seen that before long Australian timbers will be utilized for this purpose. I feel that we are compelled to make a striking differentiation between the nations we are willing to trade with and those with whom there is no immediate necessity to encourage trade. Why were the three schedules embodied in the Tariff if it were not intended to differentiate between exporting countries? The proposition that would serve the interests of Great Britain. Australia, and Canada would be free imports from Great Britain, an intermediate duty of  &#163;2,  and a general rate of  &#163;3.  I was particularly interested in the letter read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> who is fully conversant with the paper trade, because he has had practical experience of it. I was surprised to learn that a consignment of Japanese newsprint is on the way to Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I suggest that the fact that the Committee has reduced the duty in the general Tariff from  &#163;3  to  &#163;2  lessens the necessity for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson&#39;s</inline> request, even from his own point of view. I do not wish to stress the fact unduly, but I do point out that the users of newsprint in Australia are under no overpowering debt of gratitude to the Canadian paper manufacturers for the treatment received at their hands when they were practically helpless. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that this is the psychological moment at which to say it. I repeat that Canadian manufacturers of paper have no claims upon our gratitude. Another objection to the request is that while there is no direct evidence of the fact, there are very . strong reasons for assuming that there is a very close intimacy between American and Canadian manufacturers of paper, and that if it does not exist today it would not be long before it came into being if the duty in the intermediate Tariff were reduced as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson.</inline> My last request affected the general Tariff, and I intend to follow it up by a request for the imposition of a similar duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> per ton in the intermediate Tariff. </para>

This is really a proposal to impose a lower duty on the better paper used for the same purpose as that covered by paragraph 1. 1 shall not object if the Government persist in pushing their hands against people who might add to the revenue through these Customs duties, but I shall not fail, when they reach out for further revenue by the imposition of duties on the absolute necessities of life to ordinary people, to say that I cannot reconcile their action with this consideration for newspaper proprietors. </para>

                    <para>. -  The purpose of the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> which I am willing to accept, has already been explained. The honorable senator pointed out that newspaper proprietors who publish magazines or journals printed on the cheaper paper paid duty at a certain rate, whilst those who published magazines or  such a newspaper as the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> mentioned, and which is a very warm supporter of his, used paper of a better class, and paid a higher rate. The honorable senator asked why those who used the better class of paper for newspaper purposes should be called upon to pay a higher tax than those who use ordinary newsprint. He desired that they should both be put on the same footing, that whether a newspaper proprietor published a journal with the inferior or with the better class paper, he should be called upon to make the same contribution to the revenue, and that we should certainly not, by means of the Tariff, penalize those who sought tq publish the higher class journals. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has asked where this glazed paper comes from. A considerable quantity of it was imported from England, but those importations were disturbed during . the war period, and most of it is now imported from the United States of America. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> request is agreed to, one effect will be to give an additional preference to the United Kingdom. </para>

Paragraph 2 <inline font-style="italic">covets</inline> paper which is largely used as newsprint by the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Punch,</inline> and publications of that land. I wish to remind the Committee that this glazed paper is used also for other purposes, and, among them, for the printing of jam labels. As a consequence, by the adoption of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gar.diner&#39;s</inline> request we shall be permitting the free admission of this glazed paper, or its admission at a reduced duty, for purposes to which I think it is not intended that a reduced duty should apply. Whilst  I  agree that the daily press can. obtain newsprint free from Great Britain, the weekly and monthly press&#34; will, under this request, be placed in the same position in respect to the glazed paper which they use. As a consequence, the proprietors of daily newspapers will be called upon to pay practically twice the rate of duty to be paid by the proprietors of the weekly and monthly papers, because whilst the price of newsprint is &#163;25 per ton, the glazed paper used by the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Punch,</inline> and such publications costs between &#163;60 and &#163;70 a ton. The request therefore, in my opinion, creates an anomaly and represents somewhat of an injustice to the proprietors of the daily press. </para>

                        <para>- Then does it matter under which item it. is included ? I am advised by the Customs officers.- that, in view of all the circumstances, it ought to remain in sub-item g 1, unless <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> can show some good reason why it should come in at lower duties. The fact that it may not be properly classified is not a very strong argument. Classification does not matter so much as the amount of the duty to be levied. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, I know that. Since the war, the Cumberland Mills have regularly employed, amongst others, about 100 men who had been at the Front. They have in every way assisted returned soldiers to get back into fully active civil life again as speedily as possible. One factor which should ma,ke us hesitate before reducing the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties in the way suggested is the very real menace of competition in the near future in this commodity from Japan. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator &#34;Vardon</inline> quoted from the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> special edition of 16th April last, which I have just been perusing. This supplement is largely devoted to Japan, and makes reference to the way in which this particular industry is going ahead in that country. I have been informed that Japanese steamers, which are heavily subsidized by the Japanese Government, amongst other activities whilst in our waters, pick up as much as they can of the raw material here and take it back to Japan to be converted into these boards by pulping and even into paper. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and other honorable senators, in addressing themselves  to previous sub-items, have referred to the fact that w&#169; have in the Commonwealth at the present time a great deal of what are ordinarily designated as waste products which could, be profitably utilized by industries associated with the item, now under discussion. The Japanese in that regard have been both frugal and economical. They have taken from Australia a great deal of what we have regarded as rubbish and waste, and by means of their newly-created industries have converted it into marketable products which will rapidly be placed on the Australian market. </para>

                    <para>.  - I protest against any decrease of the duties on strawboard. The strawboard-making industry has been built up here, and those engaged in it during the war were very reasonable in their charges, The official statistics show that Japan is our principal competitor, and that out of a total importation of 3,000 tons of strawboard for the last nine . months the imports from that country amounted to 2,000 tons. Those engaged in the industry in Japan work seventy-two hours per week for a wage of 12s. &#39;6d., whereas the men employed in the industry in Australia work forty-four hours per week for wages ranging from 85s. to 117s. per week. Prior to the war the brice of Japanese strawboard was &#163;7 7s. per ton, but during the war it was raised to &#163;38 10s. per ton. On the other hand, the Australian manufacturers, who before the war were charging &#163;8 10s. per ton, only increased the price of their product to &#163;20 per ton. Many other reasons could be given in support of the retention of the present duties. Our two principal competitors are cheap-labour countries. I have already referred to the competition from Japan, and I would remind the Committee that we have to fear also imports of strawboard from Germany, where men are working at the present time long hours for a wage which is equal to ls. 3Jd. per day in English money. Another reason why we should encourage this industry is that it uses an. enormous quantity of straw which would otherwise be of no commercial value. I find that one mill alone can use 20,000 tons of straw, 20,000 tons of Australian coal, and 1,000 tons of lime per annum. We accepted the Government proposal to reduce the du tj on newsprint because we recognised the difficulties with which country newspaper proprietors have to contend, and were desirous also of enabling the people of Australia to obtain the news of the world at as reasonable a price as possible; but 1 do not think we would be justified on any ground in reducing the duty on strawboard. </para>

                    <para>. - I have been using a very considerable quantity of strawboard, and I look upon this industry as of great importance to Australia. A large amount of capital is invested in it, and it gives remunerative employment to a great number of men. . Ab <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has painted out, another important aspect of this question is that the industry is using a considerable quantity of what would otherwise be treated as waste material. Waste material from printing offices and drapery stores, in the shape of old boxes and scraps of paper, which only a few years ago waa carted away to rubbish tips and burnt - an operation for which payment hod to be made - is now being purchased and converted into strawboard. If the. duty is reduced, the effect on the industry will be serious. I hope the request will be rejected. </para>

                        <para>- We had bumper seasons in 1915 and 1916 when we organized the Wheat Pool, and straw, which is really a waste product of our farms, was obtainable by those engaged in this industry at a price very much below that at which it could be secured in other countries. Although I om a Free Trader, I am anxious that every industry should have a fair deal. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has mentioned the Cumberland mills in my own State. We are told that the Cumberland mills treated the public generously during the war. I find that they declared a dividend of 14J per cent, on their reconstructed capital. The original &#39; capital of the company was &#163;150,000, but that capital was doubled by a further issue of 150,000 shares, so that the dividend of 14$ per cent, paid on the reconstructed capital of &#163;300,000 was equal to a dividend of 29 per cent, on the original capital of the company. In dealing with these duties, we must have regard to the interests of those engaged in the manufacture of cardboard cartons and boxes, in which many of our commodities are packed. There are hundreds of towns in which these cartons and boxes are made. If I were asking honorable senators to conform to my own views as a Free Trader, I should not expect to receive their support, but surely a duty of 30 per cent, is ample, mo-re especially having regard to the position of the industries the raw material of which is strawboard. I think I have made out a reasonable case for a reduction of the duty from 40 per cent, to 30 per cent. </para>
