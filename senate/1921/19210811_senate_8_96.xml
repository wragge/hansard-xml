            <para>- That is so. It appears in paragraph 3 of. sub-item  h  of the item now under consideration. This is &#39;the first Tariff in which it appears as a separate entry. Leather cloth, as known to the trade, is practically the same as oil baize, and is used by householders for the same purposes. Oil baize, as honorable senators probably know, is oiled muslin, or other fabric, samples of which I have here. Leather cloth is a material of much the same kind, .made in various colours, but for household use is usually <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> darkbrown or black. I have samples of it here, which honorable senators may .inspect.  Leather cloths are used in many ways, and chiefly for upholstering and other manufacturing purposes. They are used very extensively in the upholstering of cheap furniture which is within the reach of the masses of the people. This article does not enter in any way into competition with leather. The person who is in a position to buy a leathercovered suite of furniture will naturally do so&#93; but the ordinary individual whose income is limited may look at a leather suite with admiring glance, and wish that he had sufficient capital to purchase it, but his means prevent him. from doing so. As a result there has been brought into -existence an article called leather cloth, which is used for manufacturing purposes, particularly to meet the needs of the masses of the community. I do not know why there has .been a departure from the practice adopted in previous Tariffs of including leather cloth in subitem a, unless it is contended that it enters into competition with leather. I contend, in the interests of the users of leather cloth, that a duty should not  be  imposed upon it, because the material is not manufactured in Australia. No industry for its manufacture has been com- - menced nor has there been any suggestion that its manufacture is likely to  be  started here. A great deal of the leather cloth imported comes from Great Britain, where its manufacture is a very large industry. </para>

            <para>- Yes, a great deal. The name &#34;American cloth&#34; does not necessarily mean that the material is made in America. It was originally made in America, but British manufacturers established the industry in such a way as to be able to more than compete with the American product, and it is a ,very large industry in Great Britain at the present time. The Americans still continue their industry, and have enlarged it considerably, especially since the advent of motor cars. Leather cloth plays a very important Dart in the upholstering of motor cars. Motor traffic has come to stay in Australia, and I am sure we are all anxious to. see it increased as much as possible, Rapid transit is very important to our business community, and people, of small means engaged in business find it essential to provide themselves with the  mo3t  rapid means of locomotion.. </para>

            <para>- We might say 10 per cent. That calculation is based on the average profit received by distributors. It might be more in some cases, and as the article upon which the figures I quoted are based takes up much less room than leather cloth, it is possible that, in the case of leather cloth, the 5 per cent, would represent 11 or 12 per cent, when the article reached the consumer. </para>

No suggestion has been made, so far as I am aware, that theproposed duty on leather cloth in paragraph 3 of sub-item h has been imposed to produce revenue; and in view of the fact that we do not manufacture leather cloth in Australia I desire it to be free. </para>

            <para>- It may be inadvisable to prevent the introduction of leather cloth altogether, because it is useful for certain purposes. The Australianleather industry is a very important one, and it should he our purpose to protect it against cheap imitation materials, theintroduction of which might seriously injure one of our basic industries. This  material is not accurately described, because it is really enamelled cotton goods. If people buying it knew that they were not purchasing leather, there would hot be the same objection to it. </para>

            <para>- The article is an imitation of leather, and is being used as such. We ought to stop this, <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> far as possible, though I understand we have not the power under the Customs Act to do that. Those who handle the article should not be allowed to deceive the people. I believe that one of our officers discovered the other day that American leather cloth was being supplied instead of the real article, and as there are big possibilities for the Australian leather trade, not only in this country, but overseas, we ought to do all that is possible to protect it. Leather cloth is really enamelled cotton, and its name should be changed. This deception is going on all over the world. A little while ago the Japanese were selling inferior flour as &#34; Brunston&#39;s flour,&#34; suggesting that it was the output of Brunston&#39;s the well-known Australian millers, and in that way they did some injury to the Australian flour trade. This is happening everywhere, and we should do all we can to stop it in Australia. </para>

          <para>. - If, as the Minister states, the duty of 5 per cent, is placed upon leather cloth in order to protect the Australian leather industry, it is totally inadequate. I do not look upon leather cloth as a substitute for, although it certainly is an imitation of, leather. In the course of my business I purchase thousands of yards of it under various names. It is used mostly for upholstering purposes, and also largely in connexion with bookbinding. </para>

            <para>- Not at all. For book-binding purposes it could not take the place of leather ; it cannot be used, for instance, in the manufacture of accountbooks. If the Government require this duty of 5 per cent, for revenue purposes, I am content to let it pass, since it will not materially affect the price. Leather cloth, however, cannot be described as a substitute for leather. It certainly is an imitation of leather, and serves a very useful purpose in connexion with many manufactures. </para>

          <para>.- I am very glad that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> has not said that the duty of 5 per cent, under the British preferential Tariff has been imposed for purely revenue purposes, since I am satisfied that it has been introduced for a wholly different reason. Leather cloth, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> has said, is used largely in the book-binding industry, and the duty will increase the price of many of the articles used by the masses. It will really mean an increase of 10 per cent, in the price of articles in which a certain &#39;proportion of American leather cloth, is used. The average man on wages cannot afford to pay more than &#163;10 for a suite of furniture, and purchasers of suites covered with leather cloth will have, as a result of this duty, to pay &#163;10 10s. instead of &#163;10, as&#39; hitherto. Why should we penalize such individuals to the extent of 10s.- when there is no good reason for the impost? </para>

            <para>- But suites of furniture covered with genuine leather are beyond the reach of the masses. The price of leather in &#39; Australia to-day is probably three times greater than it was a few years ago. We must refrain from doing anything that will increase the cost of living to the poorer sections of the community. I have here a lot of samples of leather cloth, but shall not .attempt to describe the various uses to which the material is put by many manufacturing industries. It is used in connexion with book-binding as well as for upholstering purposes, and surely a suite of furniture covered with leather cloth must be far more economical than is one covered with., ordinary cotton fabric. Leather cloth. has met a need in Australia in connexion with the manufacture of furniture. It is a good-looking, useful substitute for the cotton fabric with which cheap furniture was formerly covered, and it gives four times the wear. No one with any intelligence would mistake a suite so covered for a leather suite. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator LYNCH</inline>(Western Australia) f3.39&#93;. - Will the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> be good enough to inform the Committee of the extent to which cotton&#39; piece goods are manufactured in Australia, and the number of persons employed in the industry? While the request is that, in accordance with what has been the practice for the last eleven years, the sub-item shall be free so far as British imports are concerned, we are asked to agree to an increase of 10 per cent, in the duty on imports from other countries. A duty of 15 per cent, is neither for protection, purposes nor for revenue purposes. If it is for the latter I want to know the justification for it. If it is for the former, I want to know what it will adequately protect. The great bulk of the cotton piece goods used in Australia come from Great Britain, and it is proposed to admit them free from that country, but America and Japan are also sturdy competitors with the Old Country in regard to supplying this household requirement to the vast majority of our. working people. But what reason can be advanced for imposing this duty on goods coming from those countries unless a corresponding gain is to be derived, according to the theory of the Government, by the establishment of a local industry?&#39; We may be straining this tendency to give a preference to Great Britain to an undue degree. Hitherto in going through this schedule we have been affording preference to the United Kingdom in respect of a lot of products that do not come from that country, but we are now on the threshold of a portion of the Tariff covering items which have been coming to Australia from Great Britain for years past. The British Parliament has not given any. protection to British people who are engaged in the manufacture of cotton piece goods, yet we propose, in effect, to tell the Mother of Parliaments that it does not know its own business in this respect and seek to penalize ourselves by doing something which the Old Country has shown an unwillingness to do. The immediate effect of our action will be to increase the price of cotton- piece goods. I want to know what people are engaged in the manufacture of cotton- piece goods in Australia, how many persons they are employing, and what their output is. I want this information so that I may. understand what I am doing in agreeing to impose a duty of 15 per cent, on a necessity of the people, which .comes to us from countries other than Great Britain. </para>

          <para>. - The protection suggested is not for the purpose of affording an opportunity for the establishment of the manufacture of cotton piece goods in Australia, but is to give the British manufacturers of cotton piece goods an advantage over the manufacturers of these goods who are established in other countries. In 1918-19 we imported &#163;10,485,200 worth of cotton piece goods from the United Kingdom, as against &#163;5,560,183 worth in the previous year, but the value of our importations of these goods from Japan has increased from &#163;49,508 in 1913 to &#163;1,542,400 in 1918-19. Surely these figures show that Ave ought to afford some advantage to Great Britain in respect of these goods, particularly when we do not manufacture them in Australia. The rates, as proposed in the schedule, will give the United Kingdom a preference of 15 per cent, against the products qf any country to which the intermediate Tariff is npt extended, and 5&#39; per cent, preference against any country .to which the intermediate Tariff may bc extended. While the value of imports of United . Kingdom . origin advanced by 167 per cent, from 1913 to 1918-19 that pf Japanese cotton piece goods imported into Australia increased by 3,015 per cent, and that of United States of America origin by 755 per cent. The increased value of cottons imported from the United Kingdom does not indicate an increase in the quantity of such goods, as is evident from the fact that the price of American raw cotton, which chiefly controls the price of the cotton piece goods, advanced from 13.31 cents per lb. in July, 1914, to 30 cents per lb. in July, 1919, this being an increase of 135 per cent. The comparatively higher increase in the cost of labour and coal in the United Kingdom added to the higher price of the raw material would certainly show a greater percentage increase than is observable in the value of the imports from that country in 1918-19, as compared with 1913. The advance in the value of imports from the United States of America and Japan- represents, on the other hand, an enormous increase in the actual quantity of the goods supplied. </para>

        <para class="block">This simply leaves the words &#34;as prescribed.&#34; The words &#34; as prescribed by departmental by-laws &#34; occur so frequently in the Tariff that it seems to me necessary for Parliament to retain the power of imposing duties, or, at least, be in a position to know what duties are imposed, removed, or modified. If we leave the words in as they appear, too much power is given to the Customs Department without any supervision from Parliament, which should be the real author of all duties. In the case of the Defence Department regulations are from time to time laid upon the table, and we have an opportunity to approve or disapprove of them; but in the case of the Tariff we are asked to place all the power in the hands of the Comptroller of Customs. The words &#34; as prescribed by departmental by-laws&#34; occur four or five times on this one page of the Tariff. </para>

It may be said that Parliament has not time to attend to such matters, but we are paid to do so, and ought to do our duty. </para>

          <para>. -  When this matter arose earlier  in  the week I undertook to make inquiries concerning whether it would be advisable or feasible for the Government to accept an amendment of the phrase. Regulations ordinarily laid upon the table  of  Parliament deal with legislative matters. In the present instance, however,  the  Minister for Trade and Customs  has been  given certain powers.  To  cite  an example,  calico used for making bags  in  which to export flour  may be  imported free. Every care has to be taken,  however,  to insure  that  this special permission is not abused. Guarantees are  required  from millers that the calico which they desire to import free of duty shall be wholly exported as flour bags. </para>

            <para>- But there are probably thousands of decisions of this character throughout the year. If every by-law had to be laid upon the table of the Legislature in the form of a regulation, the work would be endless. Parliament would be flooded with documents. The Governor-General would never be free from the task of affixing his signature to them. If the words &#34;as prescribed &#34; remain alone, the effect will probably be to give the Minister much wider powers that those to which  he is  limited to-day. Every time an individual in the commercial (community sought to evade the Customs laws, to meet which evasion the Department framed a new by-law, there would be required an Order in Executive Council. Altogether, the situation would be chaotic. The same phrase to which some honorable senators are now objecting appears in practically every Tariff in the world ; and, so far as is known, neither abroad nor in Australia have there been complaints on the part of the commercial community. </para>

            <para>- The enormous powers of the Minister for Trade and Customs are not generally realized. He lias authority to prohibit the importation of any article. He possesses the power to determine whether an article shall enter free or be dutiable^- at any rate, in very many cases. First, there is the power of prohibition, as provided in section 52 of the Customs Act, which sets forth what are prohibited imports. Then there is power under which goods may be prohibited from importation by proclamation. When the Minister takes upon himself the power of prohibition he entrenches on the rights of Parliament, and assumes the prerogatives of the National Legislature. Any layman, reading the sections of the Customs Act which hear upon the power of prohibition, would come to the conclusion that they must be read in conjunction with certain other sections, and that the goods prohibited by proclamation from importation must- be shown to be goods that might be harmful to&#34; the community. The High Court has recently decided that the Minister for Customs undoubtedly has the powers which he claims under the Customs Act, and that he possesses a discretion, in the exercise of those powers, with respect to almost every commodity that can be imported or exported. </para>

            <para>- Formerly shovels were imported from the United Kingdom free of duty, and were liable to a duty of 10 per cent, if imported from foreign .countries.  They are now declared to be subject to a duty of 30 per cent. when imported from the United Kingdom and 35 per cent, when from foreign countries. Plough and teamsters&#39; .chains were once admitted free or dutiable at 5 per cent., according to the country of origin, but since the 1st December last they are dutiable at 30 per cent, and 35 per cent., according to the country of manufacture. Those are two specific instances where the Tariff has been amended and duties imposed under departmental by-laws. </para>

            <para>- Shovels were classified as tools of trade and were largely imported, free of duty, from the United Kingdom until, owing to the exigencies of war, supplies were received from the United States. Since the Tariff has been in operation that classification has been altered, and these particular articles have been brought under the item, &#34;manufactures of metals n.e.i.,&#34; and are now held liable to a duty of 30 per cent, when imported from the United Kingdom, and 35 per cent, when from foreign countries. Needless to say, very strong protests were made .to the Minister, but without effect. Here we have a specific case where tools of trade - and. surely to Heaven, ,a shovel is a tool of trade! - came in free until the classification was altered and the duties &#39;I have mentioned were imposed. If the request is adopted it. will be necessary for such alterations in duties to be embodied in a regulation which would have to be laid on the table of the House and accepted or rejected. I do not think a regulation imposing such duties would be accepted by this Parliament. </para>

          <para>. - I am intervening at this juncture because the question under consideration is not really a Tariff matter,, but one which concerns the machinery of our administration, and in the hope that honorable senators will not adopt the suggestion put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> and supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten. Senator Pratten</inline> has made certain statements with which we  Gan  all agree, particularly concerning the imposition of taxation being a function of Parliament. Of course it is. These words in the Tariff do not in any way interfere with that function; it is Parliament&#39;s way of expressing its authority. The reference of the honorable senator  to the powers given to the Minister under the Customs Act have no bearing on this question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> complains that the Minister for Trade and Customs has taken on himself certain powers, but that is not so. The honorable senator&#39;s reference to the Customs Act shows that these powers have been conferred on the Minister for Trade and Customs by Parliament to facilitate the administration of the Tariff and to protect^ the interests of the Commonwealth. Parliament would not have given these powers to the Minister for Trade and Customs had it not been convinced that they were needed. The honorable senator says, further, that the power of the Minister to determine what goods shall be admitted free, and what shall .be subject to duty, is affected by the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior;</inline> but that is not so. Section 2 of sub-item a says that calico for bag making, as prescribed by departmental by-laws, shall be admitted free; that is, that whereas calico imported for anything .but bag making may be dutiable, that material, when imported for bag making under conditions which the Minister for Trade and Customs shall prescribe, will be admitted free. The Minister for Trade and Customs must be satisfied that the calico is imported for bag making. Members of Parliament cannot wish to be bothered with all the details of importation, and the safeguards necessary to protect the revenue by preventing importers from improperly taking advantage of this provision. It is not necessary that the conditions of importation shall be set out in Executive minutes to become regulations to b&#39;e laid before Parliament. Members complain already that they have, too many regulations to read. The Minister for Trade and Customs has his directions from Parliament. He is told that calico imported for bag making must be admitted free, and it is for him to prescribe the conditions with which the importations must comply. If a Minister for Trade and Customs dishonestly, corruptly, or wrongly uses the power given to him, some person interested in the importation of calico will soon make known the facts, and answer must then be made to Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> in trying to make his point, cited an item which he said enabled the Minister for Trade and Customs to use his power to do some thing contrary to the will of Parliament; but he could not have made a more unfortunate citation. The implement to which he referred is a tool of trade which Parliament has declared shall be dutiable. But Parliament also says that if the Minister is satisfied that this tool &#39;of trade is not made commercially in Australia, he may put it on the free list. When the Minister found that these particular tools of trade were being made in Australia, he exercised the power which Parliament had given him to levy a duty on them. </para>

            <para>- &#34;As prescribed by departmental by-laws.&#34; There are fifty-four items in the Tariff which may be affected by departmental by-laws, and if the Committee were to adopt the proposal which has been put forward, it would be taking a course which has not been taken in connexion with any other Tariff in the world, and has never been followed in Australia, either since or before Federation. If we took from the Minister for Trade and Customs the power of making departmental by-laws governing the importation of certain articles, we should hold up business, and subject this community to the ridicule of the world. I ask honorable senators to think of the expenditure of public money on clerical labour and printing which would be uselessly&#39; incurred if the proposal were adopted. By-laws have, frequently to be altered. You cannot make a set of them, and say that you have finally dealt with the subject. Every manufacturer may wan,t some variation of a by-law, because variation is required by all manner of conditions. . I am assured by the Customs officials that in regard to nearly every application some variation i3 required to meet the convenience of a manufacturer, whilst at the same time giving effect to the will of Parliament. To deal with these matters by regulation, with all the routine that that would involve, would be very clumsy in comparison with the method now followed. </para>

          <para>. - The astonishing reference of the Minister for Defence to the way in which the powers given to the Minister for Trade and Customs are used confirms my determination to pursue this matter further. In regard to shovels, the Minister told us that if ,the Minister for Customs&#34; is satisfied that they are being manufactured in the country, he may impose a duty on them. That is the sort of thing to which I object. &#39; Recently, in the course of conversation, the manager of our State Brickworks told me that the cost of shovels was now 14s., whereas before the war it was 4s., and he asserted that there was a heavy duty on shovels, which, at first, I was inclined to deny. </para>

            <para>- The question is: Shall the Minister or shall Parliament determine whether a duty shall be levied on any article? As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> has pointed out, there are, on the page of the Tariff with which we are now dealing, no fewer than five kinds of imports in regard to which the Department may pass by-laws affecting the duties. The  Minister  might allow calico to be imported free for the making of bags to contain flour, and might make it dutiable if imported to make bags for other purposes; or he might allow calico to be imported free for the use of one person; and not for the use of another. I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that there is as much cost in preparing and publishing a departmental by-law as in preparing and publishing a regulation; but the regulation has to be laid before Parliament, and may be objected to. I do not read all the regulations put before Parliament; but I know that if a commercial man finds that  a charge is made on him to-day which he was not asked to pay yesterday, and that this is in consequence of the passing of some regulation, he soon complains to a member of Parliament, and the regulation .can then be called in question. I realize that it makes it easy for the Department to have the power to prescribe conditions by by-laws. This arrangement takes power from Parliament, which is constituted of the representatives of the people, and gives it to those entrenched in the Public Service who, though responsible to the Minister, as he is to Parliament, are so far removed from popular control that inconveniences are constantly being heaped oh the commercial world. These are not suffered in silence. One has only to move among those who have business with the Customs Department to hear complaints, whisperings, and suspicion. Dissatisfaction and discontent are rampant in the commercial world of Australia, and one of the chief causes of this state of things is this power to make departmental bylaws. Just as the Minister for Trade and Customs can benefit one set of candlemakers to the injury of another, so he can act unfairly towards some manufacturers and importers, and help others. </para>

            <para>- It is the Minister for Trade and Customs himself who proposes that it shall be given, and the servile following of the Government that agrees to his proposal. If the Minister for Trade and Customs is given this power, why should he not be allowed to prescribe exactly what duties shall be imposed, and what exemptions shall be made? When the Department discovers that things are not being used for the purposes for which they were admitted &#39; duty free, it makes them dutiable; but I ask why cannot that be provided for specifically in the Tariff? </para>

When the Minister should intervene, how, and on whose initiative, are all matters which I claim should be left to Parliament. If we want proof that in the opinion of the community these matters should be left to Parliament, all we have to do is to go amongst the people who suffer from departmental by-laws.

            <para>- Yes, but he has no remedy. Who is to take a hand to help him? If these matters were dealt with by regulation the regulations would have to run the gauntlet of public discussion. At the present time they are dealt with by the Minister in his Department, where everything is smothered up, which is itself an encouragement to injustice. I brought this matter up myself only the other day, but I am afraid that there is very little hope that we shall be able to secure any improvement in the practice adopted in view of the majority behind the Government, the members of which, by the way, are outside while matters are being discussed, and enter the&#39; chamber only when they are being decided. </para>

          <para>. - If I thought that the words objected to authorized the Minister for Trade and Customs to impose a duty or to remove a duty, without the authority of Parliament, I should support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior&#39;s</inline> request. If, again, I mistrusted the Minister as generally as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> appears to . do, I should support . it. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has very properly pointed out that these words appear in all the Tariffs &#34;of the Commonwealth since its inception. A practice has grown up under them. I do not suppose that any individual members of this Parliament, unless they may happen to have held office as Ministers for Trade and Customs, know very much of the practice. There has been established, during the last eighteen or twenty years, a practice in connexion with the prescription of departmental bylaws which I personally do not consider altogether satisfactory. Parliament is not given the same opportunity of reviewing departmental by-laws that it has of reviewing regulations under ordinary Statutes. I think there is not one of us who does not realize that already there are being issued far too many regulations under different Statutes for any one to properly read, much less understand. If  that volume of ordinary regulations is to be swollen by Customs regulations similarly framed, I do not know that we shall be very much better off as a Parliament or as individual members so far as exercising a check on what is done is concerned. I believe* that the departmental by-laws that have been made in the past have been very numerous. They have been varied from time to time, on occasions, very suddenly, and in many intances, without any (notice whatever to those affected by them. I do not know whether there is any publication in the nature of a compilation of by-laws of the Trade and Customs Department, or whether they could be published in a single volume or in volumes as large as those which now contain the regulations under ordinary Statutes. I have heard complaints in the past, though not, so many recently, that some business people arc absolutely unacquainted with and uninformed as to departmental by-laws which affect them in their relations with the Trade and Customs Department. They have sometimes found that these by-laws have been framed almost on the very eve of their approaching the Department m connexion with certain business, and apparently in view of that particular business. Again, I have heard it complained that a departmental decision may be one thing this morning and another this afternoon; one thing to-day, and another tomorrow. Individuals throughout the Commonwealth have been subjected to very unfair competition as a result of these sudden changes of front on the part of the Trade and Customs Department. I do &#39;not know that we should gain much by multiplying the regulations circulated amongst us, but I do think that the practice of prescription by departmental bylaws needs something in the nature of a general review and the adoption of some procedure under which these by-laws may be given more publicity, &#39; be made more readily accessible to the public than they have been in the past, and also be given a greater degree of permanence than has characterized them in our past experience. For the present I cannot see my way to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior&#39;s</inline> request. The same point was raised on an earlier item, and I then understood the Minister in charge of the Bill to indicate that it wa3 his intention, if the objection to the USE of those words was lot pressed at that time, to give consideration to the whole position. I was under the impression that before the Customs Tariff Bill finally leaves the Senate it would be settled one way or another, whether the past and present practice of carrying on the administration of the Department under the system indicated in the use of these words in the Tariff should be continued or some other method adopted. If the Minister is still of that mind that is one more reason to justify my refusal to support the request. I should like the Minister to say whether I have correctly indicated the position he takes up, and whether a*n opportunity will be afforded us to deal with the question generally. I understood from the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> that, there are fifty-four items yet to be considered in the words to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> takes exception appear. If we could get some assurance from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> that the procedure in connexion with these matters will be open to discussion at a later stage of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> might be willing to withdraw his request. </para>

            <para>- We &#39; are dealing with a practice that has existed since the establishment of the Trade and Customs Department of the Commonwealth, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says, a similar practice was followed in the different States before Federation, and is adopted in other countries of the world in which Tariffs are imposed. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior&#39;s</inline> request were agreed to and accepted by another place, it would involve a very radical departure from all past practice and experience, and I hardly think we would be justified in deciding to adopt such a course in connexion with the discussion of a single item of the Tariff. I should like to have some assurance from the Minister in charge of the Bill that the whole practice of the Trade and Customs Department with regard to these matters will be considered before the Bill leaves the Senate. If an opportunity is afforded to discuss the matter thoroughly, the Minister can put the whole case for the Department, and those. who desire to submit an alternative procedure will be in a position to do so. If an assurance that we shall have an opportunity to discuss so important a matter in all its bearings is given definitely now, it will facilitate the passage of the remaining items of the Tariff in which the words under consideration occur. If it is not given, we may have a repetition of the present discussion on every item in . which the words occur. </para>

          <para>. -  I have only a word or two to add to what I have already said on this subject. I have expressed the view that it is utterly impossible for this Parliament to discuss the many decisions and departmental by-laws which may be promulgated from time to time by the Trade and Customs Department. We have been told that there have been some 14,000 different decisions given in connexion with a Tariff consisting of 450 items. If this Parliament insisted upon its right to separately discuss all these decisions, we should hardly have time to do anything else. The rest of the public business of the country would be sacrificed to the discussion of the details of the administration of a Department in charge of a responsible Minister. I do not think that Parliament should take upon itself such a grotesquely impossible task. With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> allegation that good citizens _ are called upon suddenly to pay an increased duty on their importations, it is hard that they should be so called upon at any time, whether suddenly or after notice. But it may be equally hard for other persons if the course objected to were not adopted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> shield, like every other, has two sides. People who manufacture shovels in this country under the wages and conditions attaching to their manufacture here may not unreasonably feel aggrieved if they find that they are called upon to compete with shovels more cheaply manufactured in Great Britain and admitted to the Commonwealth free of duty. There are two sides to this question. The manufacturer was suddenly given a measure of protection, but, I believe, the general policy of other manufacturers is to get protection by means of this Tariff, and, therefore, the manufacturer of shovels, if his operations warranted the imposition of the duty, was  entitled  to consideration. I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> would not deny the manufacturer this privilege. But I do not like the very liberal use that has been made of this power. It is introduced three times in one item. It did not appear in the former Tariffs, the duty then being directly prescribed in the schedule. Wow we nave three special provisos that goods as prescribed by departmental by-laws may be admitted according to the exercise of the discretionary power of the Minister for Trade and Customs for the time being. But the principle is working somewhat in my favour, for the reason that I regard this Tariff as a monstrosity, and the power vested in the Minister under these headings may be exercised to give relief to an already overburdened community. I am delighted to think that by the exercise of this majestic power the Minister may admit an article free or at a lower duty than is fixed in this schedule. </para>

            <para>- All along, shovels have been interpreted by the Customs authorities as tools of trade, but departmental by-laws changed that. There was the same trouble over infants&#39; and invalids&#39; foods, which hitherto had been admitted free; but by virtue of departmental by-laws the Tariff was varied and certain lines were made dutiable.  For these reasons, I think it is very desirable that the Minister should make a statement to the Committee. </para>

I shall endeavour to make a statement before the schedule is finalized; but I cannot undertake to submit a definite proposal, because that is the province of the Minister for Trade and Customs, and he will probably want to look into the matter very carefully.  </para>

          <para>. -  The Minister, I think, has made a very fair statement. I am glad this matter has been raised, because the commercial community is in a difficulty with regard to the operation of departmental by-laws, under which dutiable articles may be transferred from one part of the schedule to another, or duties imposed or reduced. I am sure the Minister will realize that the commercial community desire uniformity of administration. Take the case of shovels, which have been mentioned. Clearly, they are tools of trade; but when a manufacturer of shovels established himself in Australia, shovels were removed from the free list to n.e.i., and chargeable 35 per cent, and  40  per cent, respectively as manufactures of metals, though shovels contain wood. An importer of shovels, expecting them to come in duty free, would thus be unexpectedly met with a duty. I am not quarrelling with the policy of giving every encouragement to infant industries, but as the matter has been raised I think some means could be devised by which the business- community could get uniformity in regard to Customs duties. </para>

            <para>- Th,at is so; but the publicity that would be given to a proposal to vary a Tariff item if i.t came ^ before Parliament would prove a solution of the problem. At present honorable senators are unable to follow Tariff alterations made under departmental bylaws, and often their first information of such changes is received from importers who, because of them, have been called upon to pay additional duties. If some means could be devised whereby the Parliament would be apprised of what is going on in regard to Tariff alterations under departmental by-laws, and could disagree to anything that it considered objectionable, that, I think, would meet the requirements. </para>

By making dungaree free under the general Tariff we should open the door to large imports from Japan and other countries where the labour conditions are not as good as those prevailing in Australia. I read to-day what I believe to be a true description of the industrial conditions of the cotton workers in Japan, and I am sure we do not want to come into line with them here. </para>

            <para>- Dungaree is brought in from Japan, but I am assured by the Customs officials that we also import it from the United Kingdom. Is it the desire of the Committee that Great Britain shall not be given a preference in respect of imports of this material? There are other countries which are able to produce more cheaply than we can do, not because their workmen are smarter or their workmanship better, but because their people live on less than we are prepared to do. </para>

          <para>. - We are somewhat in the dark in dealing with this request, since we have not had put before us Customs statistics showing the countries from which our imports of dungaree chiefly come. I am convinced, however, that dungaree is largely manufactured in Manchester, the seat of the cotton industry in the British Empire, and that we obtain considerable supplies from that source. Although we are anxious to have the most amicable relations with the United States of America, we cannot lose sight of the fact that that country has imposed a duty of 100 per cent, on Australian wool. That being so, why should we allow their cotton piece goods to come in free? If we allow dungaree from the Old Country to come in free, I think we shall find that mo3t of our imports of that material will come from there. I feel sure that the workers and the Toorak sportsmen, to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has referred, will not be heavily penalized by the passing of the sub-item as it stands. </para>

          <para>. - Even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> request were carried, I am afraid it would be very difficult for the Department to determine what is and what is not dungaree. I know of quite a number of cotton piece goods which are used practically for the same purposes as is dungaree. Cotton khaki i3 used to a very great extent in Queensland in ihe manufacture of working garments, and quite a number of varieties, of cotton piece goods coming from India are used for the same purpose. I should think that hundreds of thousands of yards of cotton khaki are imported every year into the Common wealth. I see .no more reason for admitting dungaree from all countries duty free than there is for admitting free of duty cotton goods of a similar character that can be put to the same uses. It is probable that more cotton goods are produced in India, than anywhere else in the world, and some are of a very high quality. </para>

          <para>. - As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> has pointed out, we ought not to import material from America free of duty so long as that country prohibits the importation of our wool. I object to cotton piece goods coming into Australia from America for the purpose of. making dungarees and competing with our low-grade crossbred wools, which can be manufactured into even better dungarees than can be made from American cotton goods. I understand that we get a lot of our dungaree material from Manchester, and I object to allowing American and Japanese material to come in free of duty when we can supply a- suitable wool for the purpose at 3d. per lb. </para>

            <para>- I wish to correct an impression my previous remarks seemed to have made on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> He says that I seemed to treat the Minister with suspicion. As a matter of fact, the Minister in charge of this Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> has no connexion with the Customs Department, which is controlled by another Minister, and as I know nothing to the detriment of that Minister in connexion with his administration I could not treat him with suspicion. I was referring to a system which is apt to create suspicion; I had not the slightest intention of saying anything personal in respect to the Minister for Trade and Customs, or any one in his Department. My argument was that any alteration which might bestow an &#39;advantage on some firms and place others at a disadvantage would be apt to create sus&#187;picton.  When I have suspicion against any Minister I&#39; will&#39; say so in straightforward language. &#39;In regard to -these particular duties, I am pleased that what I have been struggling for all through in the discussion of this schedule is conferred, namely, a real preference to Great Britain, in respect to goods which that country can produce. But, as it is the working man who will be called upon to pay for the cotton piece goods imported, I see no reason why we should not allow these goods to come in free from America. I am not particularly keen about Japan having the trade in these goods, but I venture to say that both Japan and America will need to turn out a better article than the manufacturers of Great Britain can supply to us before Australians will prefer to buy them. </para>

          <para>.- 1  am sorry that I cannot support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> proposal. I do not think that he has quite grasped the position. He is anxious to provide that certain material used by a large number of working men shall bo admitted free from any country; but it is already provided in the schedule that this material shall -be admitted free -if it is of British manufacture, and as far back as I can remember dungarees have been manufactured in Great Britain. I admit that other materials which may be used for the same purpose are imported  in very large quantities from America, and even from Japan, but they are not dungarees, and I doubt whether the dungaree material manufactured in America is of better value than that turned out by the British manufacturer. We must do all we can to assist and encourage the industries of the Motherland to recover their former position, and we can do this by giving Great Britain a certain amount of preference, particularly in respect to that article known to the trade as dungaree, of which England can supply us with quite as valuable an article as that produced in America. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> has mentioned that there are many other cotton substitutes for dungarees. We are not manufacturing anything in Australia that can be used as a substitute for this material. It is made of a strong class of cotton, and thus has a strength not possessed by similar material. </para>

            <para>- I hope that the time will come when we shall manufacture everything we require in Australia, but for the present we ought to be satisfied with the fact that dungaree material is to be admitted free from Great Britain, while it will pay 5 per cent, duty under the intermediate Tariff and 15 per cent. under the general. I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is as anxious as I am to help in the restoration of the manufactures of Great Britain. It is not a reasonable suggestion that we should put America and Japan on the same plane as the Mother Country in respect to goods which can be supplied to us by British manufacturers of a quality equal to the money we are prepared to pay for them. </para>

          <para>. - While I am sympathetic with the request, so far as Great Britain is concerned, we have to remember that Englanddoes not supply anything like the requirements of calico for Australia. We have, therefore, to be very careful what we do in this regard. The Senate would  not, I think, deliberately place a duty of 15 per cent. on the calico which is so essential in this country, and which we do not produce ourselves. I have known cases in which a commodity wrapped in tissue paper could be bought for less than the same commodity wrapped in a calico bag, owing to the cost of calico during the war time. That was so in the flour trade, at any rate, and possibly other trades were similarly situated. Consumers of flour in the East demand their flour in small bags; and if the request be agreed to it will mean a heavy impost on those who have to use calico bags in their export trade. The flour industry is one that we desire to build up, because the more flour that is sold to the East, the better it is for the wheat-growers and the millers. In  order  to  keep  the fruit export trade going, an opportunity was offered for importing sugar practically free of duty; so, in the present case, it is desired to enable the millers to supply as much flour as possible to consumers in the East. &#34; </para>

I have always been under the impression that no part of the world can give better value in ordinary plain manchester goods than England. My experience in trade was that I could always rely on bedrock values in these plain goods from the Old Country.

That is to say, it is difficult to tell where the calico comes from ; but I believe the bulk has been coming from America. </para>

          <para>. -  It is probable that cotton goods were imported from America during the war. English factories and English workmen were then being used for far different purposes than that of producing piece goods. But in Manchester to-day there are thousands of factory hands out of work because the manufacturers cannot get sufficient orders to keep their mills going. To say that Manchester cannot supply the Australian demand is absurd. Here is an opportunity to help Great Britain. If cotton goods can now be secured more cheaply from Manchester than from American makers, Australian exporters of flour in bags will bo able to provide all the discrimination necessary. The Customs Department need not keep constant watch to ascertain whether the calico comes from America or Great Britain. If the Australian millers can buy English calico for less than American they will use the English production. </para>

          <para>. -  There are several activities, in various parts of Australia, which will derive protection from the ratesjust quoted. There is one, for example, at Clunes, in this State, where cotton mills are producing goods in a kind of tubular mould. Where knitted cotton goods in tubular form are imported from Britain for use in wrapping meat, no duty is imposed. But with respect to tubular goods made for &#34;other&#34; purposes - namely, for wearing apparel- the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates of 20, 30, and 35 per cent. will be imposed. </para>

          <para>. -  I am still at a loss to understand the real purpose of section 2. The British duty of 20 per cent. on cotton piece goods, knitted, in tubular form, must have been suggested with some specific objective. What was that purpose? I would like to know with what Australian industrial interests these tubular importations come into competition. Unless there is actual and direct competition I am not inclined to support an impost of 20 per cent. upon any form of cotton goods made in England. Are there any factories in any other parts of Australia than at Clunes? </para>

But he refuses to divide the Committee, merely because there is a small factory at Clunes producing this material. Whenever I see high duties being imposed I know there is some &#34; tinpot &#34; industry in Victoria which has to be protected and paid for by the people in the other parts of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- I am glad some one agrees with my contention. I could go through the Tariff item by item and in almost every instance where a high duty is imposed I would find that there was some industry in (Victoria which had to be protected at the expense of a large majority of the people in the Commonwealth. But that is Protection. I do not think the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> will claim that the Victorian industry to which he has referred supplies one-tenth of the people of the Commonwealth with this article, but, notwithstanding that, the other nine-tenths have to pay a duty of 20 per cent. on the importations from Great Britain. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> keen Protectionist  as  he is, does not agree with the imposition  of  such a heavy duty, because it is ridiculous. I intend to call for a division, but as I do not expect sufficient support to divide the Committee, I- must take this opportunity of recording my protest. </para>

Qf course, this is the result of having the Federal Capital in the city of Melbourne. It is admitted that the merchants and manufacturers in Melbourne can approach Ministers and officials in a way that those in the other States cannot, and, consequently, they are able to receive consideration which is denied to others. t </para>

          <para>. - It has been said that this duty has been imposed because there are one or two &#34; tin-pot &#34; industries in Victoria requiring protection. The policy Victoria has adopted in the past has made this State the most prosperous in the Commonwealth. In one factory alone 800 people are employed in producing this material; factories are also being established in New South Wales; and I understand that another establishment is being erected at Albury. The Committee should allow the duty to stand, as it will not only protect Australian manufacturers, but be the means of creating employment for our own people. </para>

          <para>.- The garment produced by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> appears to be a lady&#39;s undervest; but, although there is nothing on the label to indicate that it is made in Victoria, I accept the Minister&#39;s assurance that such is the case. I find that the wholesale price is 35s. per dozen, which means that the retail price to the purchaser would be 4s. 6d. to 4s. lid. each. In pre-war days an article of similar quality could be imported from Great Britain and sold to the purchaser at from 2s. to 2s. 3d. each. If we are to bolster up industries and compel people to use Australian goods at double their actual value I do not intend to give my support to the proposal. </para>

          <para>.- This is an industry which deserves all the encouragement we can give it, more particularly as one factory is employing over 800 operatives. In portions of Queensland, Western Australia, and New South Wales there are millions of. acres of land - which does not require to be rich in quality - suitable for the production of cotton. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crawford</inline> Vaughan, an exPremier of South Australia, has, in company with two other gentlemen, been touring the Commonwealth in the interests of a British syndicate, and I had the pleasure of recommending a friend of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vaughan&#39;s</inline> to a friend of mine in North Queensland, who has helped him to settle on the Burdekin. I understand that approximately 200 &#39;tons of cotton have recently been exported from Queensland, and that a good deal of money is being invested in the industry. Cotton production could be successfully undertaken in various parts of the Commonwealth if the necessary labour could be secured at a proper time. The Committee should not lose sight of the prospective value of the cotton industry to Australia. In Queensland a man can make a good living by growing cotton, but the difficulty is to find labour for the harvesting of the crop. I trust that everything will be done to assist the cotton industry. </para>

At the same time, I do not see why the wearers of cotton garments who live in New South Wales, or the other States, should pay exorbitant prices for them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has produced a sample, which he says would sell for about -4s. lid. - the wholesale price being 35s. a dozen - &#39;but the full value of which is about ls. 6d. Why should we have a duty of 20 per cent, against British cotton goods ? </para>

            <para>- For every &#163;1 worth of cotton garments that they buy, the people of Australia are required to pay 4s. in taxation. Would it not be better, if our .desire is to establish the cotton industry in Australia, to invest in the erection of mills a sum equal to that which is taken from our 5,000,000 of population in duties on cotton goods than to continue this Protective policy? When a duty results in the establishment of a factory, the proprietors of that factory make the things which are most profitable to them, and keep out of use, not only goods of the same class which could be imported, but also similar goods, and the community derives no advantage from the high prices which it has to pay for supplies. It would pay this community better to settle life annuities on all those who are connected -with many of our protected industries than to continue to bear the taxation which the Tariff imposes for the protection of those industries. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s statement bears out what I have already said about the value of this garment. Largely because of the duties, the public now has to pay practically 5s. for a garment which, twenty years ago, cost ls. lid. The Tariff makes everything dearer, and increases the cost of living, and the effect in the end must be to so overburden industry&#39; as to break it down. That is my reason for attacking .each -item as we come to&#62; it. It is not the public that benefits by Protective duties. I do not regard these proposals from the State point of view. The industries of Victoria are &#34;well looked after, and there must be a good reason for that. </para>

He referred to bags for the export of flour, arid I remind him that these are made from calico goods brought here in the piece. The work of making the bags is done in Australia. The printing of the bags also gives work to &#39;local printers. Sub-item b covers piece goods that are practically manufactured. They are designed for different articles, and though a little hemming may be necessary in the case of each article, it is practically the finished article that is im: ported.

The pig iron in the machine might be worth only  &#163;4  or  &#163;5,  whilst the machine might be worth as many thousands of pounds.

          <para>.- I hope to throw a little more light upon this sub-item than has the Minister. He has given us an explanation of what is meant by cotton and linen piece goods (being &#34; defined &#34; for cutting up for the manufacture of the articles referred to in the sub-item. A piece of linen may be introduced free of duty for the manufacture of serviettes; but if it has woven marks on it to show whore it ought to be cut for the- manufacture of serviettes of a particular size, it is liable under this Tariff to a duty. The con.sumer is penalized by the imposition of a special duty if these goods are so marked as to enable the ultimate user to cut them into the correct sizes required. </para>

            <para>- Yes. The same thing applies to these goods introduced for the manufacture of window blinds and the other articles referred to. For instance, a roll of window union may be imported  30  yards in length, and it vill be marked at every two yards to in dicate the places at which it should be cut for the manufacture of blinds. ^ The Minister contends that that marking constitutes a certain portion of the manufacture of the blinds. It has nothing to do with their manufacture, though it may be an assistance to the manufacturer of the .finished article. Up to the introduction of this Tariff these goods were admitted free from Great Britain, whilst there was a small duty on the foreign article. I should like to know why it has been considered advisable now to impose a duty of  5  per cent, on these goods imported from Great Britain merely because they are marked by the manufacturer to assist the ultimate user in cutting off the required quantity of the material for the article he wishes to make. I do not see how this marking of piece goods interferes with the manufacture of articles from them here. If they were imported as finished articles they would come under a different item and &#39;be dutiable at  25  per cent. </para>

            <para>- Of course it has. I can give honorable senators a simple illustration. A piece of linen damask, for instance, is sent out for cutting up into serviettes. The serviettes required are, say,  24  inches square, and at every  24  inches of this piece of material there will be an extra thread, or one thread short, in the weaving of the piece, to indicate where the user of the material is to cut it in order to make a serviette. </para>

            <para>- Of course it is. The work in connexion with these articles, the cutting up and hemming by seamstresses, represents a fairly big industry, and, therefore, the marking of the article in the way I have indicated&#39; should not be sufficient to justify the imposition of a duty. I am prepared to support a more liberal British preferential duty than was fixed in the original Tariff, and I cannot see the advisability of imposing a duty on the British article in this sub-item. </para>

          <para>. -  In considering this schedule we should, I think, remember that the Tariff is designed to serve a double purpose, namely, to protect such industries as can be established in the Commonwealth and to yield some revenue. It seems to me that there is a disposition to put on the free list all articles which, it is thought cannot be manufactured immediately in the Commonwealth, but if this purpose 13 given effect to the country will be placed in a very difficult financial position indeed. </para>

            <para>- Our knowledge of Australian industries, actual and potential, ought to guide us in determining which duties are designed to be protective and which are expected to yield revenue. Direct taxation in Australia, both Federal and State, is exceedingly heavy, and if we remove the duty upon articles which it is thought cannot be manufactured in this country, we shall be doing a great deal more harm than good. Although I am aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has had considerable experience in the softgoods line, I cannot accept his interpretation of what is meant by the language in this subitem. I think that if, say, half-a-dozen serviettes are imported in the piece, and if each serviette is a separate pattern, the piece will come within the definition of this sub-item, and be dutiable. It is not necessary that there should be a missing or coloured thread between serviettes, handkerchiefs^ or even table cloths imported in the piece in this way. The goods will be dutiable in the same way as if each article was imported in a separate piece. </para>

          <para>. -  I propose to support the amendment, for the reason that I have seen statements in the press to the effect that the increased duties in this Tariff over the former Tariff on cotton goods alone amounts to over &#163;300,000, and I think that whenever we can give consumers a little relief without inflicting an injustice upon local industries, we should do so. The articles referred to in this sub-item constitute the raw material for those dealt with in item 120, and this is purely a revenue duty, so that it will hurt nobody if we take it off. If the amendment to give preference to Great Britain is -agreed to, we shall then be extending muchneeded support to Lancashire and Yorkshire industries. Even as a revenue duty, the requested amendment would mean a considerable advance on the old general Tariff of 5 per cent, on American and German goods, which came here in large quantities. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> now proposes to impose a duty of 15 per cent, on goods from those countries and to allow British goods to come in free. This, I think, is a matter in which sentiment should have some play. We should give some advantage to our kinsmen across  the water, and see to it that if, in future, goods do come from Germany, they shall, at least, pay a reasonable duty, not 5 per cent., as in the old Tariff, but 15 per cent., as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline></para>

          <para>. -I am led to believe that sub-itemc, piece goods, n.e.i., relates to flannelette. I cannot understand the basis upon which this Tariff has been drawn up. On flannel, which is a much safer, cleaner, and healthier article, made of Australian wool, duties of 30 per cent., 40 per cent., and 45 per cent, are imposed; whereas flannelette, which is inflammable, dangerous, unhealthy, and a rubbishy imitation of flannel, is free under the British preferential Tariff, and is subject to duties of only 5 per cent. and 15 per cent. respectively under the intermediate and general Tariffs.Flannelette, which is made of American cotton in England, America, and Japan, and enters into competition with Australian flannel, made of Australian wool, is free under the British Tariff; whereas in section 2 of sub-item  aa,  duties of 20 per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per cent., are imposed on other cotton piece goods. Evidently,- this Tariff is designed to encourage the people of Australia to wear flannelette made of American cotton rather than flannel made of Australian wool. I therefore intend to move a request that the duties under sub-item c be 20, 30, and 35 per cent., which will bring them into line with the duties we have just passed in respect of another branch of cotton goods. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I have always had an objection to flannelette, which is highly inflammable and dangerous. During the last six years an average of eighteen women and children per annum have died from burns caused by their flannelette clothing catching fire. Our importations of flannelette have run from &#163;320,000 worth in 1917-18 to &#163;432,000 worth in 1919-20. Seventy-five per cent. of it comes from Great Britain, but a large quantity is also imported from Japan and America. Thisrubbish is made of American cotton, which to-day is nearly double the price of the Australian wool which enters into the composition of Australian flannel. My desire is that the people shall be encouraged to wear the healthier article. Let me here point to another inconsistency on the part of the Government. This afternoon, when we were dealing with leather cloth, which is used in the kitchens of the poor, the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> said that it was necessary .to impose a duty on that material because it entered into competition with Australian leather. In order to be consistent, surely the Government will agree to impose the duties I have mentioned on flannelette, which enters into competition with Australian flannel. I am pointing out as politely as possible the glaring inconsistencies in the Tariff. It is full of anomalies. </para>
        <para>The Minister said this afternoon that oil cloth - that horrible stuff which enters into competition with Australian leather - was largely the product of the cheap labour of Japan. He was quite right in referring to the cheap labour of that country. Those employed in Japan&#39;s textile trade work seventy-two hours aweek for a weekly wage of 20s. That is another reason why I want substantial duties on foreign-made flannelette - the product of the cheap labour of Japan - which competes with our splendid Australian flannels. By encouraging the use of flannelette we are fattening up the cotton-grower of America, and the Americans, in return, have put a prohibitive Tariff on Australian wool. I repeat that we are encouraging our people to wear flannelette made of American cotton, yet when we want to &#34;sell our wool to the United States of America we find the door definitely closed against us. As every one knows, flannel is a healthy material. It is a non-conductor of heat and cold, and is almost uniflammable whereas flannelette is not only a conductor of heat and cold, and therefore the cause of much sickness on the part of those who wear it, but dangerous also because of its inflammability. Having regard to the price pf wool to-day, it should be possible for us to make flannel at a price equal to that at which flannelette can be obtained. The average price of cotton is just on 8d. per lb., whereas the average price of the wools used in the manufacture of flannel - such as second and third lambs, locks, and second cross-bred pieces - is about 3d. to 4d. per lb. Thousands of bales of such wools are obtainable in Australia to-day at about that price, and it should be our object to encourage the use of the more healthy Australian article by the Australian people. </para>
        <para>The Government, again, are going to reduce the duty on luxuries such as vel vets, yet they have carried duties of 20, 30, and 35 per cent, on cotton piece goods. Flannelette, on the other hand, for some extraordinary reason, is free when it comes from Great Britain. If I had my way, I would prohibit its importation, since it is dangerous to the community. As illustrating how cheaply pure woollen flannel can be made in Australia, I would mention that the owner of a certain mill in Geelong made a huge fortune out of a Government contract for 4,000,000 odd yards, at ls. 3 1/2 d. per yard. That gentleman boasted that he had put over &#163;100,000 into the war loans. I had the unpleasant task of exposing his firm in this House, pointing out the immoral way in which portion of the huge profit had been made by the adulteration of the flannel. This fortune was made during the war period, and even at that time the firm in question could have made flannel at lid. per yard. The average price of greasy wool was then 154d. per lb., and the wools which go into the manufacture of flannel were at least double their present-day price. If the gentleman to whom I have referred could make a fortune out of a Government contract for the manufacture of flannel from wool purchased on the basis of 15 1/2 d. per lb., there is no reason why, with an abundance of much cheaper wool in Australia to-day, flannel should  not be available at a greatly reduced price. </para>

I want our trade to go to the British manufacturers, and I do not wish to see any impediment placed in the way of the rebuilding of our British industries. I think we ought to do all we can to encourage the Australian people to use articles of British production, while at the same time giving fair and adequate protection to whatever goods we can manufacture ourselves. But we cannot manufacture flannelette, or any substitute for it. Let us compare its price with that of the article which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> suggests should be used by the people of Australia. Ask the average housewife how she would like to be compelled to clothe her children and herself with flannel.

            <para>- If the honorable senator would come with me and interview some of the housewives in the industrial suburbs of an Australian city, he would get direct evidence from those who have to make ends meet, and are just as solicitous for the welfare of their children as arethe wealthiest of women, that they are ready to do all they can for the comfort of their children by clothing them with an article which is within the means at their disposal. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> proposal is agreed to, the same quantity of flannelette will continue to be imported, but its price will be at least 30 or 35 per cent. more than it is to-day. A good serviceable plain flannelette, which has taken the place of calico and other cotton materials, because it is more comfortable to the skin, and is considerably warmer, could be bought retail for 9d. per yard before the war. Flannelette of the same quality will be sold retail at1s. 3d. per yard within the next month or two. That is about the price of the next shipment coming to hand. Compare that price with the 3s. or 3s. 6d. per yard one is asked to pay for Australian flannel, which before the war was sold at1s. 3d. per yard. </para>

            <para>- Nonsense! The honorable senator had better bring in a regulation prohibiting the use of gunpowder, because some people get blown up through sitting over it with a lighted match. I shall not give a vote to place an additional duty on an article we are not producing ourselves, but which is manufactured in Great Britain, whence we draw our supplies of it. </para>

          <para>. -  I do not know that I should have spoken on this item but for the remarkable speech we have just heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> to whom I listened with great interest as an authority on flannels. While I do not profess to have anything like his knowledge on the subject, I should like to refer to one or two of his statements in order that I may, to a certain extent, support the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> In the course of his speech <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> said that since flannelette had come to be extensively worn in Australia, it had been a cause of illhealth, and of an. increase in the death rate. In reply to that, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> asserted that the health of the community had improved, thereby asking us to infer that that improvement was due to the wider use of that material. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> apparently attaches no importance to the vast sums of money that are spent by the various Health Departments throughout Australia in the advancement of public hygiene, and he attributes the happy conditions shown in the health reports to the use of flannelette. The honorable senator also warns lis that&#39; unless the people can obtain flannelette they will have to go naked. I must say that that warning caused me to pause before I decided to support the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> It would, indeed, be shocking if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> were forced to the extremity of having to walk about without any flannelette. </para>

            <para>- The high duty can only have the one effect of increasing the price of flannel to the consumer, whereas the admission of flannelette at a low rate of duty will have the opposite effect on that material. If the price of the local article is increased, while that of the imported article is decreased, the community will be practically forced to use the imported article. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has pointed out that we produce all the low-grade, cheap wool necessary for the manufacture of flannelette. </para>

            <para>- What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> said was that certain cloths manufactured from, the wool were controlled by profiteers. We have the wool, and we have factories, and, previous to the war, it was possible to produce flan&#39;nel at a price within the reach of every section of the community. All medical and other authorities agree that it is infinitely better to wear flannel than to wear cotton, and that if people wore lees cotton and more flannel, influenza, pneumonia, and other similar diseases would not be so rife. The arguments against the proposal of the Government are so forcible and so logical that I shall be surprised if the Minister does not consent to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> and I believe the Senate will insist on giving every encouragement to our own primary producers, about whose interests we ought to be most careful. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> allies himself with the Government in an attempt-- </para>

Further, our experts . examined every piece of flannel, and whenever there were more threads of cottonfound than the contract permitted, thecontractor reimbursed tha Government according to the decisions of the experts. This manufacturer was compelled by the Government to supply flannel at ls. 3d. a yard, and that was at a&#39; time when a market could have been found for as much as could be supplied at 2s. 6d.

Why rage in Parliament, where one is protected by privilege, at a man who was compelled to supply flannel at ls. 4$d. ? Why complain if a fortune was made? I am glad our manufacturers did well, because they supplied us with good material at half the price which we should otherwise have had to pay. I believe in both sides of a question being considered, and, so far as I am concerned, I shall see that both sides are considered when any man is attacked in this way. Contractors were prevented from making any extraordinary or exorbitant profits.

            <para>- No doubt, they will -be very great. A country cannot engage in the luxury of war without paying for it. During the last financial year this Tariff took from the pockets of the people &#163;32,000,000. During last month, the first of the current financial year, the Tariff extracted more than another &#163;2,000,000. The&#34; workers chiefly Contributed, and I shall not be expected to complain of the bearing, of taxation upon the fortunate possessors of large incomes. Wages are not sufficient to maintain families to-day. They are far below the basic.- standard determined by a Commission appointed by this Government. But for the extravagant methods of the Government, added to the costs of the war, there would have been no need to employ the Tariff as a means for raising money from the workers. The effect of imposing Customs duties upon materials used by the working classes is to make the latter provide the great bulk of the revenue for carrying on the affairs of the country. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> purpose in seeking to impose a high Tariff is to encourage greater production, he is going the wrong way about it. If he desires to discourage the use of flannelette, which he regards as a dangerous material, the logical course would be to make the duty prohibitive. Then, I suppose, flannelette would be manufactured here. </para>

            <para>- The interjection reminds me that Australia is nowadays as close to the world&#39;s cotton fields as Great Britain was at the time when it built up its great textile industries. However, I am not surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> should endeavour to clear the field of rivals in order to make room for his wool.  His  policy is, &#34;Let wool be the material for the masses.&#34; No doubt, the outcome would be very good for the wool-grower and manufacturer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> would be content to let the people pay. </para>

          <para>.- I cannot support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> request. The honorable senator is going the wrong way about securing his ends, and his statements cannot be borne out by facts. I can corroborate the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> with respect to the use of flannelette. Speaking for the poorer people of Queensland, and I think I can  say for the public generally, flannelette is the most popular material used. In Queensland, very few people wear flannel in the summer months.&#39; Flannelette is almost universally worn, . and it has proved to be the very opposite of detrimental to health. Previously young and old were compelled to wear calico; flannelette is very much warmer and in every way better. Another important consideration, in comparing the two materials, is that flannel cannot be washed and kept clean as can flannelette. The better the quality, the harder flannel gets with washing, and the more it shrinks the sooner the garment becomes useless. In Queensland, unless the people wear flannelette pyjamas they must wear silk, and the great bulk of the public cannot afford silk. No one would think of wearing flannel pyjamas. Most of the flannelette worn in Australia is imported from Britain. Very little comes from Japan, and that is of low grade. Although Queensland is a great woolproducing State, I have no hesitation in expressing myself a3 I now do; for I know that even the wool-growers refrain from wearing flannel garments, and they certainly do not wear silk pyjamas. Flannelette is the universal material. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> doubts me I invite him to take a train journey through. Queensland or any of the States. And I will ask him to pay particular regard to the washing on hack-yard clothes lines., He will quickly perceive the proportion of flannelette garments to that of other materials. I shall be no party to forcing the Australian public to wear a material which is not half so sanitary or cheap as flannelette. </para>

          <para>.- The reiteration of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that flannel supplied by the contractor in question was not up to the quality which he had contracted to furnish to the Government is probably justified. But the honorable senator should &#39; have learned - or,, if he knew, he should have stated publicly - that the contractor reimbursed the Government in satisfaction of the difference between his sample and the material supplied. Possibly, the Government may have perceived that, although the flannel was not up to sample, the fact of its being mixed with cotton made it a better wearing material. The fact remains that the Government used it. There was no question of a swindle. I shall be surprised, indeed, to learn, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has followed up his acceptance of the challenge. I feel confident that if he has the temerity to do so, that will not be the last of it. </para>

          <para>.- I desire to make a further brief statement in opposition to the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> If I had anticipated this evening&#39;s discussion I would have secured many samples of materials and garments with which to prove my case. It has been urged that the use of flannelette has proved injurious to the flannelmaking industry of Australia. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will give me the opportunity, I shall undertake to prove to him tomorrow that the Australian mills have been unable to supply the quantity of flannel required by the people of the Commonwealth, because the demand has largely exceeded the supply. Although the mills have been working longer hours and producing a larger output,- there is a good market for all they manufacture. No injury is therefore being inflicted on the flannel industry by the use of flannelette. If I could be convinced that the use of flannelette was interfering with the output of the woollen mills I would not so strongly oppose the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> I have been informed that retail establishments in Victoria and Tasmania have been unable to obtain all the flannel they require, and distributers generally cannot procure sufficient quantities from the Australian mills. </para>

          <para>. - When the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is disposed of it is my intention to move to make the duty under the general Tariff 20 per cent. Whilst I am particularly anxious to protect and advance the interests of the woollen industry and the manufacture of flannel  and tweed in Australia we have to remember that two-thirds of the people in the Commonwealth live in a climate where woollen garments cannot be worn throughout the year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has said that the demand for flannel cannot be met by the Australian mills, and if such is the case it is our fault. It has been said that wool is one-half the price of cotton, -and as wool can be woven just as cheaply as cotton there is no reason why we should be compelled to pay the exorbitant prices demanded for woollen materials. Even if we detain the Committee at some length in discussing this question we shall bo able to show that woollen goods are dearer than they should be according to the price of the raw material of which they are composed. If we desire to encourage woollen manufacturers we must discourage the use of materials containing cotton..The effect on the people&#39;s health depends very largely upon the climate in which woollen or flannelette garments are worn. It would be unhealthy to wear flannel in Queensland and in parts of New South Wales, and it would be equally undesirable to wear -cotton goods in the southern portions of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- Yes, I desire the duties to be 5 per cent., 10 per cent., and 20 per cent. respectively. The imposition of such duties would not result in raising the price of flannel if the output from our woollen mills is being increased. The impression prevails that a number of our mills have not been working up to their full capacity, and if they are able to nearly double their output we should encourage the use of the locallymanufactured material. It is difficult to overcome prejudice in this regard, and if the Australian people had been accustomed to wearing woollen garments, it would be just as difficult to thrust cotton goods upon them. </para>

          <para>. -  In another place members generally referred to silk as a luxury, as, no doubt, it may be in the colder parts of the Commonwealth - in Victoria, for instance - but in Western Australia, Queensland, the Northern Territory, and a great part of New South Wales silk clothing is as much a necessary as cotton clothing. I admit, of course, that articles like silk stockings and silk brocades are luxuries, but ordinary silk wearing apparel is necessary in a hot climate, and the greater part of the Commonwealth has such a climate. Silk is not produced in Australia, and does not come from Great Britain as an origin  nal  product of the country, all our importations being therefore, in origin at least, from foreign countries. There is no silk industry in Australia which it is desired to protect; and, presumably,  the  duties here set down are proposed as revenue duties. The policy of  the  country, however,  seems  to  be  that revenue duties should be levied, not upon essentials, but upon non-essentials, and I therefore move - </para>

            <para>- A duty on kerosene would be a duty on an article used by only a section of the people, because kerosene is very little used by the population of our cities. Honorable senators must remember that if we do not get sufficient revenue from the Tariff, we must increase the direct taxation, and, although the alterations that have been made in the schedule may not separately affect the revenue much, in the aggregate they have made a difference that is becoming serious. In my opinion, silk goods are fairly taxable, especially goods of superior quality. If the course suggested by the honorable senator is followed in dealing with the Tariff throughout, it will involve a reduction of about &#163;1,000,000 in the revenue from Customs duties, and that must be made up by additional direct taxation. I am not fond of revenue duties. I believe that all those things which cannot be produced in Australia should be admitted entirely free, and where Australia produces the raw materials of industries I believe that the duties imposed upon them should be much higher than those which are imposed by this Tariff. However, I am not free to carry .out these theories, because to-day Australia owes war debts, and we must have  revenue  with which to meet our financial obligations. If the matter were referred to the people, I have not the slightest hope that they would express themselves in favour of higher direct taxation than they are being called on to pay now. Some are paying as much as 14s. in the &#163;1, and the average taxpayer,&#39; especially the family man, with five or six children, is at the present time called on to pay very heavy taxes.. We cheerfully undertook big responsibilities, which have involved us in heavy debts; and I think it would be difficult to suggest a more suitable article than silk as the subject of revenue duties. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DrakeBrockman</inline> would deprive us of some of the revenue obtained from the duty on silk, he should accept the responsibility of suggesting some other article from which revenue might be derived. He has suggested tea; but I think that is a very unsuitable article for revenue duties. I think that if a man wants a silk suit, or a lady a silk dress, it is not too much to ask them to pay taxation on this material. </para>

          <para>. - I have been particularly impressed by the ingenuity of the Go-1 vernment in their efforts to squeeze revenue from this particular commodity, which is made dutiable at 20 per cent., from the countries from which it really comes, and 15 per cent, from the Mother Country, from which it does not come. In endeavouring to preserve something Uke a balance between the taxation of what I call the necessities of the people and the taxation of luxuries, the Government in this Tariff have marked the difference between the two by 5 per cent. I disagree with my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> on this subject, as I consider that silk is a luxury. In the Tariff as originally introduced, it was dutiable at SO per cent, in the general Tariff column, but for some reason not stated by the Minister it is now proposed that it should be dutiable at 20 per cent. It must be a source of gratification to the wharf labourer who lives at Toorak to find that he is asked to pay 15 per cent, on his dungaree, whilst the lady of fashion who lives at Collingwood or Footscray is asked to pay a duty of only 20 per cent, on her silk dress. According to the Government, the difference between rich and poor is 5 per cent. That is the Government policy up to date, as disclosed by this scientific Tariff. The Minister does not attempt to suggest that this is a protective duty. What the Government have managed to do is to mark the difference between the denizen of Pott&#39;s Point and the denizen of Footscray by 5 per cent. Unlike <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> I suggest that in this particular matter the Governmentshould return to the frame of mind inwhich they were when the Tariff wasoriginally introduced, and&#39; impose a reasonable duty of 30 per cent, on this articleof luxury. If we desire to do justice to- the man who wears dungarees we should not charge him 15 per cent, duty on it if we only charge a duty of 20 per cent, on silk. I think that the Government should make a wider difference between the duties on silk and on dungarees than 5 per cent. Therefore I intimate that I intend to move for an increase in the general Tariff on silk beyond the 20 per cent, fixed in the schedule. </para>

          <para>. - I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has taken this line of thought, because we are not  a  silk-producing nation, and therefore there is no good reason to increase the duty on silk goods. If the duty is raised, silk as wearing apparel will become so costly that only the wealthy people in the community will be able to wear it. I want the workers also to be in a position to wear silk, and I am sure that quite a number of them would look a great deal better in silk than do many of the people whose wealth enables them to wear it. I ask for the very best that is obtainable for the toilers of Australia. They are entitled to the best, and should get it. I can quite understand a certain section in this community taking the view at one time held in England, where a penalty was sought to be imposed on those who attempted to wear the kind of clothing which the titled people affected and desired  to  reserve for themselves. I want everything, including silk, to be made available at the cheapest rate, so that the people of this country may become the best dressed people in the world. Silk is not produced in Australia, and, so far as I am aware, we have no industry big enough to justify Tariff protection on the article. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> does not want to get the duty back to 30 per cent. ! In &#39;my opinion, 20 per cent, is too heavy altogether, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> is quite right in moving for a reduction. In view of the invaluable service I rendered to the Government on the last division, I think they might accept my suggestion now, and allow silk to come in free, so that our people may be clothed in silk and other fine raiment. </para>

            <para>- It is protective to that extent, tie-making being a fairly important industry. Silk ties which were usually obtainable at from 3s. 6d. to 4s. before the war, rose in price to 13s. and 14s., owing to the increased cost of the silk, and as the situation is becoming more normal, it is desirable to do what is possible, by means of the Tariff, to keep such industries going. </para>

Not only is silk a necessity as an article of wear for the people in the hotter portions of Australia, but it is also the raw material for certain manufacturing industries in the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, I know that in Melbourne, not very far from Parliament House, there is a factory engaged in the making of ribbons, for which silk is the raw material. -My request is a most reasonable one. I have not asked that silk be introduced free, although I would have been fully justified in doing that. </para>

          <para>.- I feel inclined to resent SenatorReid&#39;s reference to the ladies of the southern States, who, he tells us, do not know how to dress attractively, but wear dull and stuffy things. My observation leads me to say that no branch of the industry in the southern States of late years has grown to such an extent as has that engaged in the making of silk blouses and ties. Those industries have grown up under a Tariff which has been in force for some time, and I am glad that it is not proposed to increase it. I do not want the cost of living to be increased, and, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> I desire to sec the womenfolk of those who earn their living by the sweat of their brow given an opportunity to make themselves as attractive as possible. They have a perfect right to such an opportunity, and have enjoyed it under the Tariff which has been in operation for some years. The Government in the Tariff as introduced proposed that the duties on silk should be increased, but that proposal was defeated in another place, so that we are back again to the rates prevailing under the Tariff of 1914. We should allow them to stand. The Treasurer will have a difficult task in making ends meet, and we should hesitate to deprive him of a considerable amount of revenue, as we should do by securing a reduction of the duties on silk. There is no justification for such a reduction as is requested unless it can be shown that the duties have become a burden. I hold that they are not too heavy. They cover all classes of silk. I -believe we could impose a heavier duty on some classes of silk without affecting the welfare of the people, but itwould be difficult to differentiate. </para>

        <para class="block">I intend further to move requests for a reduction of the duty - intermediate, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> to 30 per cent., and British, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> to 25 per cent. I think the time . has arrived when we should refrain from imposing heavy duties on the imported woollen materials referred to in this sub-item. I am as much in favour of the continuance and extension of the woollen industry in Australia as is any other person in the community ; but I think our woollen mills can do without this prohibitive duty. The people of Australia require flannel for underwear, tweed for men&#39;s apparel, and tweed and other fabrics in thousands of forms for women&#39;s attire. Before the war our mills had made a reputation with the limited plants in operation for turning &#39;out flannels of better value than those produced anywhere else, and having the raw material at their door they were in a position, if they could have turned out a sufficient quantity, to export and compete with the rest of the world. Also in certain classes of tweeds they were just as favorably situated. They were able to produce cloth equal in value to the tweeds manufactured in any other part of the world. But in respect to cloth for women&#39;s attire we have practically done nothing in Australia. We have certainly manufactured admirably- serviceable tweeds for women&#39;s winter wear in the colder portions of the Commonwealth, but there is a large list of other fabrics essential for the comfort of our women folk which have to be imported. Textiles, fabrics of excellent quality, are produced by the Bradford mills of Great Britain, and Australia has always been a good customer for them; but Prance is the home of the best dress fabrics so much favoured by women. Cashmeres, voiles, and all sorts of materials are woven there as they cannot be woven anywhere else. This industry has been built up in France as the outcome of applied scientific research extending over many years ; and as the Australian mills are not in a position to produce these fabrics as they can be turned out in France, there is no neces sity to impose a duty of 45. .per cent, against that country: particularly when it really means 50 per cent, to the people here  without  taking into consideration the cost of transport. I  want  to bring under the notice of the Committee an article which shows that, notwithstanding the wonderful advantages the Australian manufacturer of flannel enjoys, he has not within the last few years been entirely fair to the people whose patronage has enabled him to build up his industry. I have a sample of all-wool flannel, manufactured by a mill in Tasmania, and whatever I say in regard to this fabric can be said in regard to the product of mills on the mainland. Flannel of at least 25 per cent, better quality  Avas  sold by this mill in 1914 to a retail establishment at 11 1/2 d. per yard, and the user of the flannel could buy it anywhere at the retail price of ls. 3d. per yard. Another mill was producing a slightly superior flannel at ls. $d. per yard, and it Was retailed at ls. 4Jd. per yard; but the mill which sold the flannel at 114d. per yard in 1914 sold on the 16th May of this year a flannel inferior in quality at 2s. 6d. per yard. The flannel sold at 11 1/2 d. per yard was, as I say, 25 per cent, better in point of quality. Is there any justification for such an imposition? </para>

I have another sample here of very excellent Crimean flannel, though I do not think it is of quite such good quality as that produced at the same mill in pre-war days. However, before the war this flannel Avas sold at the mill at ls. 4 1/2 d. a yard, whereas the invoice of 1st May, 1921, shows that the price to the retail distributer this year is 3s. 6d. per yard. </para>

            <para>- Taking into consideration all the increases, in overhead charges, this flannel, I should say, could be produced at the date of this invoice  for ls. 7d. per yard, arid show a larger proportion of profit than when it was produced at ll$d. I understand that quite recently the mills have reduced the price of flannel by 5d. a yard; and this is a matter to which I referred on the second reading of the Bill. The facts are that, at the beginning of this winter, just when people were wanting flannel, the mills, instead of, as every one anticipated, reducing the price as compared with the high-water-mark price of last year, put it up 5d. a yard, and within the last week they have reduced it to the previous high figure. </para>

            <para>- The demand for Australian flannel ever since the industry started has always been greater than the supply. Flannel was manufactured in pre-war days at the prices I have mentioned, and the industry was built up on such prices, at which the mill-owners did very well. What &#34;kind of profits are they making at 2s. 6d. a yard for material not quite so good as formerly? Is it reasonable that those engaged in the textile industry should be given more protection?

            <para>- The protection under the 190S Tariff was 25 per cent., and under the 1914 Tariff it was 30 per cent. ; and I propose that the local manufacturer shall have less protection now because he has taken advantage of the people of Australia., As a matter of fact, there is no need for protection to such an extent. The Australian mills are not producing a great many woollen textile fabrics which must be used in Australia. I wish to see our tweed industry go ahead, and I dare say that other speakers will submit to the Committee prices at which good tweeds can be produced at a profit. 1 leave honorable senators to decide whether the public have been getting a fair deal in view of the prices that consumers have to pay. However, I now wish to refer specially to materials which are not produced in &#34;Australia, but which  aTe  in everyday use here. I refer to dress materials worn by our wives and daughters. </para>

            <para>- The duty on. these materials has been imposed for many years, and I am not prepared to put them on the free list, simply because I believe we cannot afford to give up any revenue at the present time, in view of our financial obligations. I advocate no big reductions in any hitherto existing duties, but suggest, fair duties in order to return the necessary revenue, and, at the same time, adequately protect our local industries. 1 might have brought with me to-night hundreds of samples of. different fabrics which I say advisedly are essential to the comfort, well-being, and general appearance of our population, but which, although they are not manufactured here, have to bear a duty, if manufactured outside Great Britain, of 45 per .cent. That, of course, means 45 per cent., plus at least 15 per cent, or 20 per cent, transport and other charges. Further, it does not mean simply &#163;45 on every &#163;100 worth, but, in view of the departmental 10 per cent, on every &#163;100 worth, duty has to be paid at 45 per cent, on &#163;110. I think I have shown conclusively that my proposal is worthy of consideration, and that the industry will flourish with the protection I propose. I do not suggest anything that might cause difficulty to the Treasurer, but I submit that it is a wrong attitude to impose a heavy Tariff on articles which the people need, and must have, and which are not produced in Australia. </para>

          <para>. -  It cannot be said that the Government have unduly pressed the Tariff  upon the attentions of honorable senators. There are still about 50 pages of the schedule to be dealt with, and not one page has been turned over to-day. Bearing in mind the days on which the Senate does not sit, it would seem that another three months will be occupied  in  completing the Committee&#39;s deliberations - that is, unless there is more rapid progress with the schedule. </para>

          <para>.. -  I have anticipated that the debate upon the duties in connexion with woollen goods and materials would be the most interesting of all. The Senate meets tomorrow at 11 a.m.; this is not a good night for a prolonged sitting. I support the request that progress be reported, in order that honorable senators may come to-morrow with refreshed minds to deal with sub-item f. The Government will find that no time has been lost. It is my purpose to contribute to the debate, but I shall not have a great deal to say upon much else in the Tariff. Much important information will be provided for honorable senators and the country in the course of the consideration of the imposts upon woollen goods. I understand that the Government are about to propose that the Senate shall sit for considerably longer hours next week and thereafter. Any such proposition will have my support; but my desire for an adjournment at this stage is due to the importance of the matter under discussion. Honorable senators should be able to bring alert minds to its consideration. </para>

          <para>. - As the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> is not prepared to grant an adjournment, I shall endeavour briefly and plainly to give my reasons for supporting the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne.</inline> This extraordinary Tariff is full of anomalies and contradictions, and is an indication of Protection run stark-staring mad. As a shareholder in, and a director of, woollen mills, there is, in my opinion, no proposal in the  whole of the Tariff more ridiculous or unreasonable than the attempt on the part of the Government to impose higher duties when they are not required, which in this case results only in fattening the rich and forcing up the cost of living to such an extent that the Government will in the end be compelled to pay the basic wage recommended by the Commission they appointed. It will be hard indeed for the Government if they insist on imposing such heavy duties to prevent the country population being driven into the cities and millionaires becoming &#39;multimillionaires. This Tariff is an instance of Protection run mad, and a. strong indication of that can be found in the fact that the Government have actually imposed a duty of ls. per cwt. on straw, a product which is burned in thousands of tons every year. </para>

            <para>- One wealthy Victorian woollen manufacturer died quite recently, and left close on &#163;4,000,000 sterling, and in my own town, the executors of a comparatively small manufacturer paid probate duty on &#163;680,000. In dealing with this question I shall be as fair as possible. Protection such as this will cause&#39; a steady drift to the cities, which National Governments have at all times stated that they deplored. On &#39; every public platform in every State, Federal and State parliamentarians have said that they favour decentralization, but what has been the result? Instead of giving effect to that desirable policy they have been spoon-feeding city industries, which are highly protected, and which are making huge profits, to such an extent that it will not be long before every one will be leaving the land. In the State of Victoria 52 per cent, of the people are living in one city, and the number is likely to increase, because the legislation which the Government have been passing is favouring only the city dweller. </para>

            <para>- Yes, but not as many as there are in the country. What are&#39; the Government doing under the Tariff to protect the interests of the primary producer? Imposing duties on straw and wheat! The Tariff has been framed with the object of fattening Melbourne city manufacturers, and in encouraging centralization. What consideration has been shown to consumers? Everything is unnecessarily high in price, and the cost of living has increased out of all proportion to the rise in wages. I was not elected to the Senate to represent the interests of Labour; but I claim to be able to speak for all sections of the community in this State, and I can say without hesitation that the Government cannot prove that wages have increased in the same ratio as the cost of living. These excessive duties on woollen goods will mean that higher prices will be charged, and that consumers will be robbed although large quantities of wool are practically going to waste. </para>

So much for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ambrose</inline> Pratt&#39;s statement. He seems to be quite an important man in the opinion of the Government, and is endeavouring to mould the opinions of honorable senators. I am not attacking the woollen manufacturing industry, because I believe in Australian goods being used by Australian people. We should be manufacturing the whole of our requirements here, but we have to consider the effects of the duties proposed, not only on the manufacturers, but on the consumers. I believe in reasonable Protection, not in the fattening, at the expense of the people, of those who are already fat, which is what will take place if we pass the duties here proposed. The schedule actually increases the duty on woollen goods. </para>

            <para>- The duty on importations from Great Britain is 30per cent., which is an increase on the rate in the 1914 Tariff, with which the local manufacturers told the Inter-State Commission they were well satisfied. The rates proposed on woollen goods are so stupid as to cause one to lose faith in the whole Tariff. I wish it to be clearly understood that I am in favour of protecting our industries, especially our infant industries. I would like to see the whole of the woollen goods required by our people manufactured in Australia, and that could be done. </para>

            <para>- Yes. Without any protection, we could make a profit out of this manufacture, and a rattling good profit with a duty of 25 per cent. I have always considered it an anomaly that Australia should manufacture for its own use less than 5 per cent, of its wool, though, if we supplied all our requirements in woollen goods, we should not use more than 10 per cent, of our wool. But why increase the duties, and add to the cost of living ? To do so is unnecessary, and enrages the public, which reads the balance-sheets of the woollen companies, and knows that the Inter-State Commission reported that higher duties were not needed. I shall show that the Inter-State Commission, the Bureau of Science and Industry, the chief Protectionist journal of the land, the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and that high Protectionist, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ambrose</inline> Pratt, do not apparently support the proposal, of the Government.

          <para>One of the applicants (for specific duties), in referring to woollen piece goods, said, &#34; The higher the duties, the cheaper are the goods imported - the quality deteriorates.

          <para>The local manufacturers of woollen clothing desire a wider margin than at present exists between the import duties on woollen clothing and that on woollen piece goods. They prefer, in lieu of an addition to the import duty on apparel, that woollen piece goods should bc admitted free. This applies particularly to women&#39;s light dress material in the piece. </para>

        <para>The Government propose a duty of 45 per cent, on goods which we do not manufacture, and which Great Britain does not manufacture, a duty which will injure our Ally, France, who sends these goods to us. That will cause every woman in Australia to pay exorbitant prices for her clothes. &#39; lt is, however, in the greater variety of patterns of piece goods for men&#39;s clothing, and especially in the light materials for women&#39;s clothing, that the woollen mills have shown, so far, but little disposition to meet the demand. </para>

        <para class="block">This is the summing up of the Commission - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The woollen mills, apart from flannels, blankets, &#38;c, are only devoting their energies to making tweeds of simple .pattern, /or plain serges, for which there is a large demand. The limited population of the Commonwealth, and the local demand for small quantities of a great variety of patterns -in other lines, do not at present justify the general local manufacture of the latter. The duty, especially on the light material, which the local woollen mills do not intend at present to make, embarrasses the clothing industry in its competition with imported woollen apparel. Several of the women&#39;s clothing manufacturers said they were compelled to import a 11, i and others 90 per cent., of their raw material. The duties on the materials the woollen mills now make would seem ample to enable them to compete with imports and sell to the clothing manufacturers at a profit. It would, therefore, appear that no Protective policy is to be served by maintaining a heavy duty on the light woollens so &#39;largely imported and used by clothing .manufacturers. </para>
          <para>It has been stated that to admit women&#39;s light material free, or at a reduction of duty would lead to difficulties of administration; but in the Canadian Tariff, &#34; women&#39;s&#34; and children&#39;s dress goods, &#38;c., composed wholly or in part of wool, not exceeding in weight 6 ounces to the square yard,&#34; when imported in a certain condition, arc admitted at a lower rate of duty, and it should be easy to decide on a standard of minimum weight which would involve no disadvantage to the local woollen mills. The question of ^dealing with the importation of &#34; end of season &#34; goods is altogether another consideration. It must be remembered that, we make 80 per cent, of all the apparel consumed locally at present. The Australian manufacture is steadily growing, and the suggestion to remove, or substantially lower, the duty on women&#39;s light woollen dress material will add considerably to the output of the woollen branch of our clothing industry. </para>
          <para>The Commission is strongly of the opinion that, to largely increase the clothing duties, as proposed by a few applicants out of several hundred manufacturers, would tend to <inline font-style="italic">imduly</inline> increase the cost of living, with little compensating advantage. Of the total consumption of apparel in Australia, it is estimated that not more than 4 per. cent, in value consists of what is termed &#34; end of season &#34; goods, imported at a low price. To place duties which may&#34; range from 100 to 300 per cent, on many articles of apparel, 30 per cent, of the total of which is made in Australia under present rates (1008 to 1911) of 35 per cent, and 40 per cent., in order to particularly catch 4 per cent., would give the manufacturer opportunity to increase prices all round, for which there would appear to be no warrant. The principal manufacturers state that they prefer free raw material. If they had all their woollen piece goods free, they would have a manufacturing margin of 35 and 40 per cent. Their requests for additional heavy <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> and specific duties on the manufactured goods are disproportionately greater than their alternative proposal.. </para>

            <para>- Yes. He deals with the matter particularly well. He is of opinion that there should be a considerable extension of woollen factories in Australia. I claim myself that we should have them all over the country. &#34;We should manufacture in Australia as much of our wool as we possibly can. That would give employment to our people, and would turn the wool into a more profitable article. At page 34 of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stirling</inline> Taylor&#39;s very excellent report, he says that an increased duty is not necessary, and that we possess so many advantages that we can make a fortune from our woollen manufactures. He suggests that we should put &#163;14,000,000 into the business.

He is speaking of the use of wool at an exceedingly high price, and sets out every detail of manufacture, including wages and everything else.

          <para>After making all allowances for writing off capital in former years, it could be said - and the Commission adopted the company&#39;s own figures - that shareholders had put more than &#163;60,000 original capital into the business. In addition, within the last few years &#163;30,000 of reserves had been capitalised and issued in shares to the shareholders. According to published statements, at an interim meeting of the company held a few weeks ago, the following distribution of profits for the half-year was made, partly out of accumulated but previously undistributed profits, namely: - Dividend distributed (half-year), &#163;27,000; issue of shares, as a re&#39;sult of writing up plant, &#38;c. - face value &#163;30,000, market value about &#163;90,000. Apart from the shares, the dividend was at the rate of 45 per cent, per annum on the total nominal capital of &#163;120,000, 90 per cent, per annum on capital subscribed by shareholders, and about 90 per cent, per annum on the capital used in the business as shown by the last annual balance-sheet. </para>

            <para>- They all had a finger in it. The manufacturer, the people in the &#34;Lane,&#34; and the large shopkeepers made exorbitant profits. My tailor wanted to charge me &#163;18 for a suit of clothes, and when I protested, he said, &#34;Oh, but look at the price of wool.&#34; The pre-war price of wool was 9 1/2 d. average, and during the war we sold it to the Imperial Government at 15 1/2 d.  but the Australian manufacturers got their raw material at the original appraised price. Even supposing they had to pay 15 &#163;d. - but &#39;they did not - the increased cost of wool in a suit of clothes would have been only 3s. 6d., yet suits of clothes, which formerly were &#163;5, were raised to &#163;10, and &#163;10 suits were increased to &#163;20, all on the score of the increased cost of wool ! As the result of exposure and propaganda- - I have been hammering at this matter for a long time - prices have come down again within the last few months, and suits are now &#163;5 to &#163;10 again. </para>

            <para>- It is down to &#163;10, and you can now get a suit of good English tweed, if you prefer it, at &#163;5 5s. in the leading shops of this city. In order to show that the increased price of clothing during the war period was a scandal, I propose to quote some figures relating to the Commonwealth Woollen Mill. There were three or four parties exploiting the public. The manufacturers were concerned in it to a certain extent, &#34;Flinders-lane&#34; was in it all the time, and the large retailers were also concerned in it. There was no necessity to compel the people to pay &#163;10 and &#163;20 for a suit of clothes. The Commonwealth Woollen Mill, although at the beginning of the year it naturally had dear stocks of wool on hand, has been making the most beautiful material, out of the very best fleece wool, for 5s. 6d. a yard. </para>

        <para>Bult of clothes.&#34; The- Commonwealth Woollen Mill is selling this beautiful tweed at 5s. 6d. a yard, blue serges at 7s. a yard, and one special class, 56 inches wide, made of what is practically the very best merino wool, at 6s. per yard. Honorable senators will say that the mill cannot be making any profit when it sells its products at such prices. I have here its balance-sheet for the year, and it shows that it is. It- is admitted that it opened the year with stocks of dear wool, which it had obtained from the Pool at very high prices, and that since then the market has been falling. Wool that you purchased last week at what you considered to be a low price is dear this week, because the market has been slumping. Yet, after writing off &#163;18,449 on account of depreciation, the Commonwealth Woollen Mill, which, has been selling magnificent material at these extraordinarily low prices, made a profit of &#163;26,000 for the year. Had it been able to concentrate on two or three particular lines, it would have made enormous profits. The position, however, is that it is called upon to make small quantities of a variety of goods, and that, we all know, adds greatly to the cost of production. It has had to make a special twill for the Air Forces, highquality thick material for suits and overcoats for naval officers, and special lines for the Defence Department, the Navy, the Railway Department, and trainees, &#38;c. I was astounded when I took  His Excellency  the Governor of Victoria over the mill the other day to see that it was producing some forty or fifty different lines. If it were able to concentrate on one or two lines it would make far greater profits; but, despite the fact that it has been called upon to produce an infinite variety of material, ranging from rugs and blankets to the finest of tweeds, it shows for the last twelve months a profit of &#163;26,000, plus &#163;18,449 written off in respect of depreciation. And this notwithstanding the low prices charged for its products. </para>
        <para>I think I have shown from the report of the Inter-State Commission, as well as from statements by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ambrose</inline> Pratt, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stirling</inline> Taylor, and the balancesheet of the Commonwealth Woollen Mill, that the industry does not need this increased protection. I do not say that we should remove the whole of the protection which it enjoys. We want to make sure of our position, because the high wages now ruling in England and France, as well as the high freights, may fall at any time. When the woollen industry of Australia was started, it was very much in need of protection. When I was working some years ago. in the woollen mills at Home the hours of the operatives were very much longer than they are here, while the wages were only a fourth of what we pay. The freight on our wool to England was only from 1/4d to id. per lb., and the freights back were the same. Here to-day we have a wonderful supply of the raw material. The wool used in the manufacture of flannel, for instance, is obtainable at 6d. per lb. in Australia. That same wool costs, landed in Bradford, 9d. per lb., so that in respect of that one item alone we enjoy an advantage of 50 per cent. Our competitors there have also to lose interest on their money in respect of the time spent in getting their wool Home and sending back the manufactured article. The woollen mills here have at hand the pick of the best wool in the world - they can obtain it to-day and have it on their looms to-morrow - whereas our competitors at Home have to pay delivery charges, freight, insurance, and railage to the mills and back again, plus a highly Protective Tariff on the manufactured article. Since the framing of the Tariff of 1914, under which the woollen manufacturers were making fortunes, wages in the woollen manufacturing industry of England and France have increased 400 per cent., while freights have also increased about 400 per cent. In these circumstances, I ask honorable senators to have regard to the enormous advantages that we have over our overseas competitors, apart from any increased duty. </para>

            <para>- The wealthiest class in the community is not the woolgrowers, but the over-protected manufacturers. Wool-growing,&#39; the greatest industry in Australia, has been built up by the pluck, brains, and hard work of the people of this great country, and to-day we have the cheapest wool in the world. On the 2nd September, 1920, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> in a leading article said - </para>

          <para>Rates of wages and hours of labour are now very much the same in this country as they are in countries from which we import, and it is acknowledged that the Australian workmen and workwomen are as adaptable as any. The raw materials are here, and manufacturing costs in all respects ought to compare favorably&#34; with those elsewhere. There is big money in Australian industries, and especially in Australian wool. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">These words are very true, because the cost of labour has gone up in Great Britain and France to the extent I have already .shown. When the 1914 Tariff was framed, giving what was considered to be adequate protection to the Australian in  dustries, and which was sufficient to enable the manufacturers to make the big profits they now acknowledge, and which were exposed by the Inter-State Commission, wages in those countries were frightfully low, and the woollen manufacturers of Bradford were getting their raw material carried to their mills al &#163;d. per lb. The natural protection afforded to the Australian manufacturers is from 25 to 50 per cent., according to the value of the raw product, but they also a-void the payment of freight, interest, and duty charges. Yet it is proposed to further penalize the British and French&#39; manufacturers, though in doing so we shall really be penalizing ourselves. It is unnecessary for me to quote anything further in proof of what I am saying. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor,</inline> as Minister for Trade and Customs, in 1914 raised the duties to 25 per cent. British, and 30 per cent, general, the Australian manufacturers were making fat profits, which they now admit; yet it is proposed to in-&#39; crease these duties to 30 per cent, and 35 and 45 per cent, respectively. The duty against France - our brave Ally, and the best customer we have for the finest merino wool grown in Australia - which makes the ladies&#39; dress wear and babies&#39; wear which England does not make, and which we have never attempted to make, because it would not pay to do so, owing to the comparatively limited demand, is thus increased by 50 per cent, as compared with the former Tariff. To-day the wages of those engaged in the woollen trade in Franca -and England are slightly higher than they are here. One would think that this Australian industry to which we are giving such an extraordinary protection was a specially good trade for the workers. As a matter of fact, it is a fairly low-wage industry. In 1916, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Tariff* Hand-booh,</inline> page 180, there were 3.900 employees in the woollen mills, who earned &#163;357,000 for the year; that is to say, &#163;91 10s. 9d. per head per annum, or &#163;1 15s. 2d. per head per week. Wages are as high in France and England. </para>

            <para>- Not in detail. I have the figures for Roubaix, but I can assure honorable senators that I have evidence to prove that the wages of those employed in the woollen industry in Great Britain and France have increased 400 per  cent, since 1914. I am making no comparison with Germany or Japan, and it is in regard to those countries that I would like to see different rates provided in the Tariff, because, although wool is not manufactured for export in Japan, those engaged in the industry there work seventy-two hours a week for 20s. The time will come when we shall require a very high protective duty against Japan. The wage earned by the average adult male engaged in the woollen mills of Australia for forty-eight hours a week was &#163;3 6s. in 1916, the latest figures made available to us by the Statistician. Even adding 25 per cent, to that amount, to allow for increases awarded since that date, the wages earned by those engaged in a similar occupation in France or Great Britain are, if anything, higher. I have shown the natural protection the Australian manufacturer has, that he has at his door 847 different kinds of wool of the best class in the world to choose from, 2,000,000 bales per annum, and practically no delivery charges to pay; that Australia produces 50 per cent, of the merino wool of the world, and that the Australian manufacturer has no duty to pay, and avoids the payment of interest on outlay of capital which his European competitor is obliged to pay during transit delays. . Is there any reason for this increased duty? I wish success to every mill in Australia. I want mills to flourish all over the place and work up as much of our wool as they can, but, in view of this irrefutable evidence from the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ambrose</inline> Pratt, the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, and the InterState Commission, and in view of the extraordinary natural protection we have, and the huge profits made by our manufacturers under the old Tariff, is not the duty now sought to be imposed&#39; Protection running stark, staring mad? </para>

In view of all this irrefutable evidence I ask the Committee, in fairness to the growers and the manufacturers, and, above all, in fairness to the poor unfortunate people of this country, who have to buy clothing, <inline font-style="italic">to-</inline> refrain from imposing duties which are not required. Let us keep the high duties for items in regard to which they are necessary, and in a sensible way adopt the Tariff as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> thus securing prosperity for the woollen manufacturers of Australia without unduly penalizing the people. </para>

          <para>. - The speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> more than justifies the request I previously made, that progress be reported. For the sake of the prestige of the Senate it is always to be regretted when an honorable senator, having prepared material for a speech, is not afforded an opportunity to deliver it at the most suitable time; It is most unfair that such a speech, which might have been anticipated from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> should have, to be delivered at midnight. The Government, I think, might have so arranged matters that we could have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> remarks at a time when it would have been possible for them to have appeared in the press reports of our proceedings. The <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which has attacked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> accuses me of desiring for Australia the cheap products of other nations. I ask for nothing of the sort. I desire Australian money, contributed by Australian people, to be devoted to developing our industries in an intelligent way, without resorting to the indirect method of protection. Ten years ago the Commonwealth Woollen Mill came into existence, and it can now turn out material equal to any in the world. Despite high wages, the year just closed showed a profit of &#163;20,000, and, in addition, the deficit of &#163;18,000, due to the cost of the establishment of the factory and the wastage of machinery, has been wiped out. That is an example of real protection and real development of  industry. Give me the &#163;32,000,000 taken out of the people&#39;s pockets last year under the name of Protection, and I venture to say it could be used so effectively that all our natural products could be worked up, and there would not be one unemployed man from one end of Australia to another. </para>

            <para>- That is the full extent to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is capable of understanding Free Trade.. What I say is that Protection is stupid in its incidence. The Commonwealth Mill, by the material ft produces, by the wages and conditions it offers to employees, and by the profit it earns, shows that high duties are not necessary, or, at any rate, that higher duties are not required. Of course, we have not the balance-sheets of the other mills before us, but in view of the fact that, unlike the Commonwealth Mill, they do not&#34; endeavour to turn out a great variety of materials, but concentrate on one material which pays best, we may conclude that they are earning enormous profits in proportion to the capital invested. We have a statement showing that practically all that capital has been returned to those mills in the years 1916-17-18. </para>

            <para>- The mills arc turning out material at 6s., and the very finest at 6s. 6d., so that they can compete even with Great Britain; and the reason is very simple. Britain has to convey all the wool from Australia, whereas we incur no greater cost in transporting the manufactured material than Britain does in securing the raw material. It has been clearly and unmistakably shown that in the case of the woollen industry, when we increase the duties, we deliberately put our hand into the people&#39;s pockets. </para>

            <para>- Of course, if a statesman like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie were to undertake the development of Australian industries, we should soon be able to compete with Great Britain or any other country. The honorable senator&#39;s desire, however, is not to utilize Australian labour in the most profitable direction, but to create a condition of things under which employers may become as rich as woollenmill balance-sheets show them to be; then, when a Tariff comes before us, not to impose duties for the protection of in- fant industries, but to create greater profits for those which have developed into sturdy manhood. My idea is not to ask the community to put its money into concerns for the profit of individuals, but to undertake enterprises for their own benefit. The statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will stand searching tests. The more closely they are examined the more clearly do they reveal that the Government will be ill-advised in giving manufacturers further scope for accumulating profits while adding to the cost of the materials with which the people must clothe themselves. In everything pertaining to wool, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is a recognised expert. He has been able .to convince me that, even when the very highest prices were being charged for wearing apparel, the cost of the wool made a difference of only about 3s. 6d. in the price of a suit. For the Government to demand from the community the payment of increased taxes by way of Customs collection, in order to add to the already exorbitant profits df the manufacturers, is utterly without justification. &#39;&#39; As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> emphatically stated, the woollen manufacturers themselves did not ask for what the Government have conferred upon them. The makers realize that they are already upon an excellent wicket. I look with grave concern to the financial prospects of Australia. We shall not be improving the outlook if honorable senators support the Government in further enriching one very small section of the com- munity while further, impoverishing the great mass of the people. </para>

          <para>- The Tariff of 1908 gave woollen manufacturers ample protection. That has been proved by the wonderful expansion of the industry. In corroboration of a statement which I made earlier to-day, to the effect that manufacturers are not able to cope with the demand, I quote from a letter which a warehouseman has received within the past day or two from a prominent woollen manufacturer, as follows : - </para>

        <quote>
          <para>We beg to advise you that the above company is prepared to allot your firm twenty-eight pieces, for delivery between July and December 31st, 1921. The reduced quantity is brought about by making allowance for probable reduction of working hours in the textile industry. Herewith enclosed is price list for the period mentioned, and we trust to hear from you, by return post, that the allotment has been accepted. </para>

        <para class="block">I said, also, that there had been a scarcity of flannel, notwithstanding the enormous profits made. I believe that without any _ protection there would have been the same demand for the output of the factories. My request is not in any way an attempt to secure a reduction upon the duties imposed in 1914. Since the 1914 Tariff was never discussed by Parliament - its imposition having been ratified by legislative enactment year by year - the present is the first opportunity given to the representatives of the people, since 1908, to debate individual items of Customs duties. That being the case, honorable senators are entitled to deal with the numerous matters arising upon their merits and as they are applicable to presentday circumstances, the Committee need not be influenced in any way by the 1914 Tariff. </para>

          <para>. - I cannot allow the remarks made in connexion with the Australian woollen industry by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> to pass without comment. The latter, I admit, delivered a strong and wellreasoned speech that calls for and necessitates a reply, but a good deal of the argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> was based upon wrong premises by saying that the duties in this Tariff .have been increased as compared with those in the 1914 Tariff. Before proceeding further with my reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> statement, I may point out that the British duty now proposed by the Government is exactly the same as embodied in the Tariff adopted in 1914, which duties, as compared with those in 1908, were increased by 5 per cent. There was a duty of 25 per cent, on woollen goods in 1908, 30 per cent, in 1914, and 30 per cent, is now proposed. We are more interested in these British rates, because importations of woollens or articles containing wool into Australia in 1919-20 were valued at &#163;3,429,000, of which &#163;3,323,000 worth came from the United Kingdom. </para>

            <para>- Exactly. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> admit that the present Tariff differs in comparison with the 1914 Tariff, which comprised only two schedules, and in which we imposed 35 per cent, on goods coming from countries outside the United Kingdom. The duties in this Tariff are 30 per cent., 40 per cent., and 45 per cent The 40 per cent, and 45 per cent, practically do not apply, because, the bulk of the woollen goods imported into this country which enter into competition with our woollen materials comes from the United Kingdom. Honorable senators supporting the request have made their first point on the assumption that the duties have been raised, and their second point is that they apply to woollen goods, particularly of French manufacture, which are not made in Australia. </para>

            <para>- Honorable senators have said that the duties, particularly those under the general Tariff, apply to goods not manufactured in Australia, as well as to those which are, and if they had submitted a proposal to differentiate between woollen goods manufactured here and those imported and not made here particularly from France, a better case would have been presented to the Committee. In discussing duties on woollen goods, we have to remember that we are dealing with a basic industry, and one that is rapidly developing. I believe I am correct in saying that during the last three or four years approximately four times the amount of capital has been made available for investment in woollen manufactures as was offering a few years ago because it has been shown by reports quoted that the total capital invested in the woollen industry in Australia five or six years ago was a little over &#163;1,000,000 sterling. Within the last week or two a statement appeared in the press that for developments proposed in Tasmania and the States of the mainland nearly &#163;4\000,000 has already been ear-marked for investment in woollen manufacture, inclusive of the capital already employed. I desire to meet the accusation that the Australian tweed manufacturers have not &#34;played the game.&#34; </para>

            <para>- I accept the disclaimer. I thought the honorable senator was also referring to tweeds. To prove that the Australian tweed manufacturers, at all events, have been fair to the Australian consumers, I desire to refer to some remarks I made on the 27th August, 1919, when we were discussing the Commercial Activities Bill. I then gave, on the authority of one of the oldest established tweed manufacturers in Australia, the prices at which his tweeds were then being sold ex-factory. It is by the prices that the manufacturer charges to the merchants that he must be judged; he cannot be blamed for what may occur in the wholesale and retail distribution of his cloth or the making of it into clothing. At that time, when wool was considerably dearer than it is now, the lowest price charged for this tweed was 6s. 6d., and the highest 10s. 6d., per yard. The Australian manufacturers at that time supplied only one-third of the cloth used in the Commonwealth, two-thirds of it being imported; and I believe that a good deal of the Australian tweed was bought from the factories at low prices, and illegitimately retailed at a high cost as imported tweed. That, in my opinion, was how much of the profiteering was done in connexion with clothing. The figures which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has quoted from the Inter-State Commission&#39;s report are, no doubt, accurate; but I would point out that they are for the four years 1914 to 1917, and not for three years ; so that the average profit, which he spoke of as 33 per cent., was really only 25 per cent. </para>

          <para>. - I am obliged to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> for the opportunity to continue. The profits which I have just mentioned are high, and are not justifiable; but in view of the very big figures mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> in connexion with the operation of two or three concerns - he stated that one Victorian factory made &#163;100,000 in. one year, and another, I think, about &#163;90,000 - it is reasonable  to  assume that the old-established - and, shall I say, respectable? - woollen manufacturers of Australia did not make an average profit of more than 20 per cent, on their capital for a few  war  years. Moreover, it is to be remembered to their credit that during nearly the whole of this period they were working for the Defence Department in the manufacture of cloth for military purposes. The Department directed their output, and arranged the prices they  should charge, and in some cases three shifts were worked, which meant a great deal of extra wear and tear on their machinery. They did get -20 per cent.; but do honorable senators know what occurred at Bradford during the same period? The whole of the Bradford manufacturers were grossly profiteering upon the world. Mushroom millionaires sprang up there in plenty. It should be remembered that even if the Australian manufacturers did make abnormal profits, and I admit that they did, because 20 per cent, profit is abnormal, there was an excess profits tax in operation at the time, and most of those who made 20 per cent, paid a considerable amount of that back into the revenue as excess profits taxation. I put that forward in fairness to them. I wish now to refer to the report of the Bureau of &#34;Commerce and Industry, of which the Director is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stirling</inline> Taylor, which was quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> I do not accept many of the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stirling</inline> Taylor, &#39;for the reason that he has grossly misrepresented the amount of capital that is required to manufacture woollens. In his report, speaking from memory, I believe that he fixed the sum necessary to carry out a scheme he suggests at &#163;14,000,000. I am informed on irrefutable authority that in view of the price of machinery to-day, which is three or four times what it was before the war, the capital required to carry out that scheme would not be &#163;14,000,000, but would certainly be over &#163;40,000,000, and probably nearer &#163;60,000,000. </para>

            <para>- I have informed the Committee that the money invested and ear-marked for the development of the industry amounted, according to the latest information, to &#163;4,000,000, which covers the establishment in Tasmania of a worsted factory that will be able to supply the whole of Australia&#39;s requirements in that direction. If our woollen industry had been sufficiently extensive to have supplied the whole of the treed Australia required during the war we should not have been blackmailed to the extent we were by the high prices charged for imported tweeds. I go so far as to say that if Australia hal been producing the whole of her tweed requirements during the period of the high profiteering by Bradford manufacturers, when we were charged four, five, and six times the prices of prewar days, we might have saved two or three, guineas on every suit of clothes worn in the Commonwealth during that time. </para>

            <para>- I want to put the position moderately. I have no hesitation In saying that if, during the war period, this industry h&#39;ad been developed as we hope to see it developed within a very short time, we should have saved two, three, or even four guineas a suit, which we had to pay to the profiteering manufacturers abroad. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> speaks of millionaire manufacturers and of the manufacturing industry as if it were the only industry making a reasonable profit, I should like to remind him that the wool-growers aTe, on the average, the biggest individual income taxpayers in Australia. I may inform him that 11,493 of them pay an average income tax of &#163;170 each, whilst the manufacturers pay an average income tax of less than &#163;100. The pastoralist companies in Australia pay an average income tax of &#163;1,100 each, whilst the manufacturing companies pay an average income tax of &#163;250. I bid the honorable senator remember these figures when he makes so many unfair references to successful Australian manufacturers. That is all I have to say, and I have made these remarks in justice to a very reputable Australian industry. </para>

            <para>- I am glad to have that statement. The weekly wage I have quoted is higher than that mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> This was my reason for joining in the debate, and, perhaps, a reason for continuing is lack of knowledge as to when the Government propose to adjourn. If they intend to put the Tariff through to-night, one might just as well say all that one can on every item. I do not know that there is any wisdom in an attempt to force the Tariff through Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne&#39;s</inline> request scarcely provides a fair opportunity to get anything like Free Trade with Great Britain in those industries in which for centuries the Mother Country has been supreme. Why should Australia, this far-flung outpost of the British Empire, refuse to trade with Britain in this particular commodity except at an advantage of from 25 per cent, to 30 per cent, in Customs duties? On the admission of our manufacturers, there is no occasion for this handicap. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has proved, I think, to every honorable senator&#39;s satisfaction that, as far as the woollen trade is concerned, the natural protection afforded Australia, approximating 50 per cent., is ample; so why add another 30 per cent., par- &#39;ticularly against our own kith and kin? The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> in introducing this matter, emphasized the superiority of our- operatives. Ha dwelt on the subject at considerable length. I rather agree with him as to the great capacity of the Australian worker. I like to hear the Australian workman thus described, because we may depend upon it, other nations will do all they can to discount our value. The Minister proved to his own, and, I think, to every one else&#39;s satisfaction, that our operatives are so intelligent, and can so adapt themselves to new industries that they are the equal of any other workers in the world. What necessity, then, can there be for thus handicapping the operatives of the Mother Country <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It is difficult to understand why any barrier against trading with Great Britain should be raised by those who profess love for the Motherland. If an enemy had done this thing I could have understood it; but when it has been done by one of her household, so to speak, it must be hard for Britain to bear. I am quite aware, of course, that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> will attack me on this matter, and suggest that I am displaying more interest in the profitable employment of British than Australian workmen. I am doing nothing of the sort. We have not developed our industries to the extent of being able to supply all our own requirements, and if British mills are idle and British operatives are out of work, surely we can take counsel together and consider whether in trade, as in war, we cannot assist the Empire by the adoption of a policy acceptable to both countries. I should have thought that this Government and their supporters, elected, as they were, chiefly because of their professions of loyalty to Great Britain, would have led the way in this matter. Surely they do not want members of a party, who they suggest are disloyal to the- Mother Country, to point the way in which Australian and  British policies may operate for mutual advantage? Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> is only prepared to reduce the trade barrier by 5 per cent. On this question I accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> opinion, because I realize that he has expert knowledge of all aspects of the wool industry. I believe that the industry can be carried on in Australia without any duty at all, but the Government, in their desire to protect this most profitable business, evidently think otherwise. That the .Australian mill-owner with the raw material at his door can successfully employ Australian workmen is proved by the results at the Geelong mill, managed by the Government. I do not think there has been any industrial trouble there. </para>

            <para>- There is no question about that, for a well-paid community soon becomes an intellectual community. If we could extend that principle to the employment of all Australian labour instead&#39; of the haphazard system of seeking to handicap trade with Customs duties in the hope that they will lead to the investment of capital and the employment of our operatives, our industrial position would be most satisfactory. Instead of having only one mill of our own in Victoria, why should we not have a mill in every State, and, in this way, further help our primary producers? If our secondary and primary industries can thus progress side by side we shall be rapidly nearing that millennium which some people think is far away, because they cannot see beyond the industrial possibilities of their own lifetime. I confess that I commenced consideration of this Tariff schedule with grave forebodings as to the result of its passage through another place. I had publicly stated that I thought the intellectual outlook of Australia, on account of the war, has slumped 300 years. However, judging by the manner in which Protectionists here have met the Minister in his absurd proposals, I feel I can leave the subject, recognising that we are now much nearer an intelligent solution of labour troubles and the question of the development of Australian industries by the Government and people of Australia for the benefit of the people of Australia. We are rapidly approaching the time when the development of any industry will not be left in the hands of private enterprise. I do not speak with an intimate knowledge of the woollen industry; but I received to-day from a gentleman engaged in the manufacture of clothing in Victoria an interesting letter on the subject. I have not met this gentleman, but, becoming interested o in the report -of the Tariff debate in this Chamber, he wrote to tell me that Victoria, after fifty years of Protection, is still unable to produce the serge required for a policeman&#39;s uniform. Whether that is so or not I cannot say; but the statement comes from one who ought to know. </para>

            <para>- That is an ex0cellent illustration of the direction which the development of Australian industry should take. If Victoria, after being the home of Protection in Australia for fifty years, is unable to boast of a woollen mill, apart from that owned by the Commonwealth, that can produce the material required for a policeman&#39;s uniform, then there is something defective in Protection as a means of establishing native industries. The Labour party was scarcely in power for a year before it established a Government woollen mill that could produce such material, so that the Labour party&#39;s methods of solving such a difficulty are more intelligent than are those offered by the Protectionists. I am glad to have had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> confirmation of the statement contained in the letter addressed to me by a local clothing manufacturer. </para>

          <para>. - No honorable senator appreciates more than I do <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> contribution to this debate. I recognise the care he has taken to place clearly before the Committee his views with regard to the position of the Australian tweed manufacturers, and I desire to assure him that in the course of my remarks at the outset of this debate I made no attack on the Australian manufacturers of tweeds. I know that they have been producing during the last few years tweeds at the prices quoted by him. That must be patent to any one who has availed himself of the opportunities offering to visit the local woollen mills, to inspect their products, and to ascertain the prices charged for them. But every word uttered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> supports the request I have submitted to the Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> contribution, splendid as it was, was not more strongly iri support of my request for a reduction of these duties than was that made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> My honorable friend has shown clearly that there is no need for this highly Protective Tariff. At the time referred to by him there was nothing that could compete with the excellent tweeds turned out by the Australian mills at the prices quoted for them., nor is there at the present time anything that could compete, in so far as value is concerned, with them. </para>

            <para>- While that is so, it is unnecessary to impose this exceptionally high Tariff in order to bring about a considerable expansion of the industry. This industry can stand on its own bottom. I am hot proposing Free Trade in respect of woollen materials; I am merely trying to show that it is unnecessary to continue the operation of a duty of 30 per cent, on woollen textile fabrics imported from Great Britain. In regard to one class of those fabrics we could hold our own even if there were no duty in operation, while as to the other class we do not. attempt its manufacture in Australia. As to the general Tariff, I am quite prepared, to discriminate between British and foreign manufactures to the extent of 15 per cent. The duty for which I ask on the British, article amounts really to 27J per cent., since an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 25 per cent, means 27i per cent., while the general duty of 35 per cent, amounts to 38&#163; per cent. Surely such duties are high enough to meet the requirements of the industry in Australia. But for the fact that revenue is sorely needed1, I should certainly have moved a request for a much  greater reduction. What I propose is actually no reduction upon the rates operating under the last Tariff discussed by the Australian Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> waa mistaken when he suggested that I had tried to make it appear to the Committee that the duty under the British general Tariff had been raised. I said nothing of the kind. I realize that my proposal in respect of the British Tariff means 5 per cent, less than the rate which appears in the schedule at the present time.  We are now for the first time discussing these items, and we should go back to the rates of 25 per cent. British, and 35 per cent under the general Tariff. </para>

            <para>- No, because the call for Australian woollen goods has not been such as to induce people to invest their money in the industry and attempt to supply the demand. The public will have imported goods. Any tailor will say at once that until recently the majority of his customers preferred to buy imported tweeds. </para>

            <para>- I am saying nothing against the Australian-made article; but I contend that we have not yet reached that stage at which we can produce a cloth up to the standard of the imported material. That is why I support these protective duties, because they will enable the industry to be built up, and will induce men to invest their capital and use their experience in producing a material equal to that which is produced in the Old Country. We have heard a lot of facts of what it costs to make a suit of clothes. Three and a half yards of the excellent segette turned out at the Commonwealth Woollen Mill at 7s. 6d. per yard will cost &#163;1 6s. According to the latest arbitration award, the labour employed in turning that cloth into an ordinary suit of clothes such as is worn by the majority of people should not cost more than &#163;2 4s. With an allowance of &#163;1 at the outside for trimmings and cutter, and it is a liberal allowance, it should not cost more than &#163;4 10s. to produce that suit of clothes; and whatever more is charged for it goes to Flinderslane or the retailer. English material of the same quality costs 30s. per yard. </para>

            <para>- The Australian article may have been sold to the public as English made, but the manufacturers sold it to the wholesale houses or the retailers as an Australian cloth. If the Australian mills had seen that their own material was put on the market, and sold at a proper price, the industry would have obtained such a hold that no more British goods would have been handled. But I am ashamed to say that there was profiteering going on, though for that, I do not blame the mills. </para>

            <para>-I am comparing wages in 1913 with the wages in 1921. In 1913, coal was 14s. 6d. per ton as against 34s. 6d. to-day, an increase of 130 per cent. ; oil, per gallon, in 1913 was ls. 3d., as compared with 2s. 9d. to-day, an increase of 120 per cent.; while dye wares in 1913 were 2s. 6d. as compared with 9s. per lb., an increase of 260 per cent. Wages and conditions in Europe may once more reach a low level, and, if so, Australia will not be able, to hold its own even with a high Tariff. The Australian market will be flooded with European goods, and one of our most important industries may have to struggle for its very existence, as it had to do ten or twelve years ago, when many mills - one to my own knowledge, for years - were not paying dividends. That they are now solvent is due to the fact that they were commandeered by the Government to produce flannel and other goods required for war purposes. Then the machinery was kept constantly going. </para>

            <para>- The mills did not do that until they were commandeered by the Government, and, as I say, made solvent. I am afraid that if we lower the duties we shall find our market flooded with cheap foreign goods. Germany was formerly one of our greatest competitors; she imitated $11 the British patterns, and sent the goods in large quantities to Australia. Some of these goods were of high quality, while others were quite the reverse; but if Germany regains her former position, and acts -in the same way, our mills will have very little chance. </para>

          <para>. - I do not think that all-night sittings will assist our progress with the Tariff, and although we have not got as far as we should have liked to-day, I suggest it would be only fair to report progress now. The supporters of the high duties ask why the consumption has not been overtaken, and why the duties have not enabled the manufacturers to succeed. I remind honorable senators that Australia has been federated for only twenty years, and that Victoria, which was then the one Protectionist State, imposed a duty of only 15 per cent, on woollen goods. At that time Victoria was competing against Great Britain and all other countries which desired to get control of her market. The wages and conditions in Great Britain then were, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has said, and as most of us know from experience, much inferior to those in Australia. Furthermore, the freight on raw material from Australia to the Old Country is now three times what it was prior to 1902. It will be seen that the Victorian manufacturers were Competing against the British manufacturers under most disadvantageous conditions. What did Federation do for the woollen industry? The only Protectionist colony in Australia a little more than twenty years ago was Victoria. </para>

            <para>- At any rate, Victoria was regarded as the Protectionist State, and the rate of duty imposed upon imported British woollens was only 15 per cent. That was inadequate, bearing in mind the conditions under which Australian manufacturers had to contend with outside competition. Wages are now becoming equalized all over the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ambrose</inline> Pratt, in his publication, uses a new phrase when he states that there is an international labour charter to-day. At the time in question, however, wages in England were from a third to one-half of the rates paid in Australia, which fact reveals that the local manufacturers had to fight fierce competition, and were scarcely able to hold their own. When Federation was accomplished, the Victorian Tariff was adopted, and the duty remained at 15 per cent. The difficulties with which Australian manufacturers had to contend were not lightened. The 1908 Tariff provided the first attempt to place the woollen manufacturing industry of the Commonwealth upon a fair footing. The duty was raised to 25 per cent. That marked the point from which the industry began to hold its own. From 1908 to 1914, when the war broke out, the young industry was given a chance to overtake local consumption. Manufacturers had only five or six years in which to perfect their organization, set up plants, meet the worldspread competition, and overtake local consumption. The brevity of that period really explains why the Australian demand has not yet been filled. Now comes the question whether the present duty is fair. Under the conditions, and in all the circumstances, I hold that it is. At any rate, it is one which should be given a fair trial before a heavier impost is placed upon imported woollens. I am prepared to make due allowance for the war period, and for the disturbing effect which it had upon production and consumption. Parliament is endeavouring to frame a Tariff which will cover the transition period during which conditions are sliding down from abnormal to normal. It would be wrong to place an exaggerated value upon the conditions pertaining to the war years. To do so would lead Parliament, perhaps, to cut down the degree of protection to a dangerous margin. The best authorities concerning whether the duty hitherto ruling was fair or insufficient are the manufacturers themselves. What do they say? One of the leading Australian woollen manufacturers - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vickers,</inline> of New South Wales - stated in the course of a public speech about the beginning of last year that the time was fast approaching when the manufacturers of woollen goods in this country would overtake consumption. He said so without asking for increased protection. </para>

            <para>- If such is the case, my argument is to some extent weakened. Possibly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vickers</inline> had in mind the lower rate of duty. Certainly, he would not go out of his way to state that the imposition of  30  per cent, was unduly high, even although, in his heart, he might feel that it was. At the same&#39; time, there are the statements of witnesses called before the Inter-State Commission, not one of whom asked for an increased duty. Before I record my vote I desire information from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> or some one else concerning the &#34;hard times&#34; the factories of the Commonwealth experienced prior to the imposition of the higher duties. We shall then have an opportunity of balancing those arguments against the statements submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> one of which was to the effect that a comparatively small mill-owner in Geelong had made a fortune of  &#163;680,000.  We hear on one hand that struggling millowners have been driven into liquidation or that they had such a bad time that they could not carry on profitably, and on the other that huge fortunes are being made. I do not wish to do anything which would press unduly upon these men, and I would like some information before a division is taken. </para>

            <para>- There is nothing extraordinary in an industry working three shifts a day, and there is no valid reason why extra profits should be claimed on that account. There are ^ other industries which have to work.three shifts per day throughout the year in order to remain solvent. The Golden Mile and other mines in Western Australia have to work three shifts, and blast furnaces used in smelting have to operate  continuously. These industries do now show a profit of 30 per cent. In the absence of further information concerning the Government Woollen Mill, I must support the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne.</inline></para>

          <para>. - As the Government intends to continue for a considerable time yet, and as I wish to. help Ministers in passing the Tariff, I propose to quote from a book which I am reading with a great deal of interest. It shows that the Protectionists of to-day are just where the Protectionists of 100 years ago stood, having made no intellectual advancement. The book to which I refer is the <inline font-style="italic">Life of Friedrich List,</inline> by Margaret E. Hirst. List was a German, and a highlyeducated man, who was driven out of his native State ; but after his death a monument &#34;was erected to his memory because he had been a Protectionist. The .writer says - </para>

        <quote>
          <para>By the modern bureaucrats and official professors of his native land he is remembered as a rebel against their own class, a rash and dangerous champion of free speech, a believer in democratic institutions, and a Tariff reformer whose doctrines would be altogethersubversive of the so-called &#34; scientific &#34; Tariff of modern Germany. If List had had his way there would have been Free Trade from Rotterdam to Memel, and from Memel to Trieste. This great territory he would indeed have surrounded by a temporary Tariff for the purpose of protecting manufactures (but not agriculture) until its &#34; infant &#34; industries wereable to resist the competition of their stronger rivals in England. When the time came, and the industries reached the stage at which they could export and  compete successfully in neutral countries, the Protective Tariff would be removed, and the consumers who had been taxed during this period of probation in order that the productive capacity of the nation might be nursed into life and vigour would be relieved of their burdens and allowed to enjoy the blessings, not only of cheap food (of which List would never have deprived them), but of  cheap clothing, and boots, and tools, and of all the other conveniences  of life. This idea of the Tariff as a nursery, grew upon List during his stay in America. Had he lived another half-century to see the American Tariff on worsteds and woollens raised higher and higher, until the natural cost of warm clothing was doubled for the whole American people, he might have begun to question the working value of his theory. Instead of Tariffs falling as industries grow, colonial, American, and European experience tells us that the reverse is usually the case. </para>

        <para>I have pegged away night after night in the hope of inducing senators to discontinue taking money from the pockets of the people to put it into those of the manufacturers without hope of getting cheaper materials from those manufacturers. There should, however, be a quorum to listen to my remarks. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed,&#93;</inline> I see that Tariff history is not appreciated at this hour of the morning, and therefore I shall not weary the Committee with further quotations, but will allow honorable senators to read the book for themselves. They will find it full of interest. I am reading it because it contains the opinions of persons who think differently from me. </para>

            <para>- I thank the honorable senator. The reading of the book to which I have referred convinces me that the growth of Protection during last century was fostered by the antipathy of Germany and the United States of America to Great Britain. The German States were then struggling into unity, and after the War of Independence a large section of the American public was always anti-British. But why should this country show antipathy to Great Britain, and impose a duty of 30 per cent, on goods which Great Britain makes better than any other country? There might have been a reason for American prejudice arising out of the struggle with Great Britain for American independence. There might have been some influence exercised by party spirit in America, since a political party might hope to secure a&#39; powerful political pull by pandering to the prejudice against Great Britain. But one would think that political advantage here would be with the party that would try to do something for both Australia and Great Britain. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has moved a request for a reduction in the proposed duty on British imports by 5 per- cent., and I appeal to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> to consent to that reduction. The difference between a duty of 30 per cent, and a duty of 25 per cent, against British imports is not a matter about which the Minister should be obstinate, and he would place his supporters in a better position before the electors if he consented to the reduction than he will by asking them to take part in a division against it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> was right in saying that the Tariff of 1914 was never discussed. It was a Tariff of the Government and not of Parliament, because Parliament shut out the discussion of Tariffs during the period of the war, and the 1914 Tariff went through in one day in order that it might have the sanction of Parliament before it was prorogued. I know that my appeals fall upon deaf ears, because the Minister has made up his mind as to how far he will get with this schedule during the present sitting. I think that he will get as far as he intends, but he would get there much more quickly if he displayed a certain amount of reasonableness in dealing with the different items. How he could have sat unmoved after a speech such as that delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guth&#39;rie</inline> I cannot understand. A reasonable man would have said that in view of the facts presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> he would be prepared to compromise in the matter and accept a reduction of duty which would be more favorable to imports from Great Britain by 5 per cent, than that proposed in the schedule. There &#39; would still be a duty&#39; &#34;of 45 per cent, against Germany when her goods again came into the market, and 35 per cent, against Canada or New Zealand. </para>

        <para class="block">I hope that, in this matter, honorable senators will give Great Britain a fair deal. It is absolutely useless to urge that a Tariff of 30 per cent, against British manufacturers of woollen goods is necessary to protect the Australian industry. It has been proved conclusively during the debate that the Australian manufacturers can carry on successfully without any duty at all against British goods. </para>

            <para>- And I propose to give the Government a few more &#34; bobs &#34; than they collected under any previous Tariff. This Parliament has never imposed a Tariff equal to that which is before us to-day. It applies to goods which are not manufactured here, but are made in Great Britain, and are necessary for the comfort and well-being of our people. I hope, at all events, that so far as the British preferential Tariff is concerned the majority of honorable senators will grant this slight concession. After all, we want the manufacturers of Great Britain to realize that in Australia they have not a fiscal enemy, but a Dominion, which, while giving its own industries a fair measure&#39; of protection, is prepared at the same time to afford Britain every opportunity to recover the position that she partly lost during the long years of the terrible war. </para>

        <para class="block">That, after all, is a very heavy duty. I cannot understand the attitude taken up by the Government. It seems to me that they have made up their minds to be as stubborn as mules. They are not prepared to accept any advice from their own supporters, but, on the contrary, seem to be ready to antagonize them. They have not even had the courtesy to reply to the arguments that have been advanced in favour of a reduction of the duty on British imports under this subitem. The Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> stands stubbornly to the duties proposed by the Government, because he knows that he has here some supporters who will vote as the Government please, at any hour of the day or night. If that is, to be the attitude of the Government, it will not receive my support now or at any other time. If they think they can pull the strings, and&#39; induce a majority of honorable senators&#39; to vote as they please, without debate, and without offering any defence of a Tariff which is absolutely ridiculous, they are making a mistake. They talk of being Britishers, and yet when they have a chance of giving a little preference to British imports they are practically antiBritish. Although the British Government in four years paid us &#163;176,000,000 for our wool, plus 2Jd. to 3d. per lb. to get- it to Bradford in order that it might be worked up, and huge freights to bring the manufactured articles back again to Australia-r-freights and charges which give our manufacturers an enormous advantage - the Government want to penalize our own kith and kin; they want to penalize the manufacturers of .the Motherland by imposing a Tariff which is almost prohibitive. I cannot understand this penalizing of British imports, which means at- the same time penalizing our own consumers and increasing the cost of living. The Government appointed a Commission, which recommended the payment of a basic wage of &#163;5 16s. a week; and the cost of living, owing to this policy of Protection run mad, will soon become so high that we shall have to pay that basic wage. The cost of living is far too high. </para>

            <para>- Is a duty of 30 per cent, on British woollens a fair thing ? Why have the Government, while increasing the duties on woollens, reduced the Tariff on luxuries? It seems to me that this is a Tariff for&#34; the rich, and not for the poor. It provides for a reduction of the old duties on velvets, plushes, furs, astrakhan, laces for attire, Bouncings, nets, embroidery, and other frills and furbelows. The old duties on such articles are reduced from 30 per cent, to 20 per cent, under the general Tariff. The Government is putting up a very bad case to present to the electors at the next general election by bringing down the duties on luxuries while increasing the duties on woollen goods, which the people of Australia should all be able to use, and which the doctors tell us are absolutely necessary. 1 </para>

            <para>- That has nothing to do with the point under consideration. Britain, to begin with, does not go to Canada for her wool. I undertake to say that the Canadian Tariff, taken as a whole, is not as high, in so far as British imports are concerned, as is this Tariff, which will make living in Australia very dear. I cannot understand why the Government refused to adopt the proposal made by us earlier in the debate. We are not asking for a drastic reduction. We are merely re-, questing a reversion to the old Tariff, and no argument has been brought f orNard in opposition to that proposition. The Government, however, are stubborn, and I suppose will adopt the same attitude throughout the consideration of the </para>

          <para>. - I do not desire to antagonize my honorable friends from Victoria or Tasmania by continually recording a silent vote on these questions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> seems to think that those who vote for the maintenance of the present Tariff are blindly following the lead of the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell).</inline> I assure- him that he is mistaken. I made up my mind weeks ago that I would vote to retain the duties in respect of this particular sub-item. The argument advanced so eloquently by the honorable senator was well thought out. We know that the present, producers of woollen goods in Australia have been, to some extent,- exploiting the people. I referred to that fact in my speech on the motion for the first reading of this Bill; and if the Commonwealth has not the constitutional power, I want to see the States, which have, take action to prevent such exploitation. But I desire, first of all, to see our industries made secure. Then having made them secure, it will be within the power of the people of Australia to control them. It seems absolutely absurd that we in Australia, where every facility exists for the manufacture of all woollen products, should ship our wool away and buy back woollen cloth made by people overseas. In the Tariff we are giving 15 per cent, preference to Great Britain over, foreign countries, if I may use the term, and 10 per cent, over countries with which reciprocal arrangements may be made. Beyond that I am not prepared to go. I am looking forward to the time when Tasmania will be one of the most intensely settled manufacturing communities of Australia. At the present moment a company is making preparations to commence operations there with a capital expenditure of &#163;250,000. </para>

            <para>- Undoubtedly. I want to see these industries going. I have explained over and over again that unless Protection is controlled it will be to a degree harmful to the consumers, and that if we are to reap the full benefit of it we must control it. The fact that an increase in a duty may give the local manufacturer an opportunity of exploiting the consumers is no reason why it should not be given. Our proper course is to increase the duty and get industries established here. The responsibility will then lie upon the people themselves to preserve their own interests by controlling these industries and providing against exploitation. </para>

            <para>- I have not the slightest doubt upon that point. Some of the material manufactured in Tasmania compares very favorably with anything imported. The preference of many persons for the imported article is largely, due to the prejudice against the local product. If people care to exercise that prejudice in future the Treasury will reap the benefit. I do not want <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> to think that I am blindly in opposition to him. I studied this matter long ago, and I do not intend to budge one inch in my effort to retain the duties set out in the schedule. I hope they will be agreed to, and that as a result many new woollen mills will be set up in Australia, when instead of exporting half of the raw material we produce, we shall ultimately be in a position, not only to provide for our own requirements, but also to export and compete successfully with the woollen products of older established industrial centres of the world. We have an opportunity to do so. We have the artisans, cheap power, a suitable climate, and the raw material. What more do we want? If we apply ourselves to the task we must be in a position to successfully compete with any other part of the world in the production of these goods; and that is the object I have in view in supporting the Tariff as it stands. I do not wish to be on my feet continually explaining my position, but I do not want it to be thought that by giving a silent vote I am a blind follower of the Government. The schedule before us is in the best interests of Australia, and I shall vote solidly for it. </para>

            <para>- I can quite believe that his speech was so unanswerable that there could be no reply to it. It is said that there is a wide field for the expansion , of our woollen industry. Let me repeat that we only made a start to manufacture woollen goods in Australia in 190S, when the duty was increased to 25 per cent. It was impossible to do anything under the previous duty of 15 per cent, at a time when the manufacturers at the other end of the world were so heavily advantaged as compared with those in Australia, but now, on the authority of the hand-book prepared by the Government for the information of honorable senators, conditions of labour have been evened up. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has seen this hand-book, and learned from it that labour conditions in the Old Country are now equal to those here, how can he support a duty of 30 per cent., especially when he cannot furnish a single instance of a woollen goods manufacturer in Australia who has gone into liquidation, or is in a bad way, or is not paying decent wages? The honorable senator is prepared to vote for this increase in duty, although all the facts . supplied in this publication, go to support the arguments put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> to whom up to date not a single reply has been vouchsafed. </para>

            <para>- That is. true, but no thanks are due to the Government for <inline font-style="italic">them.</inline> I am not here to give a silent vote on such a matter. I have my own opinions, . but propose to keep an open mind in dealing with this Tariff. As a matter of fact, if it were dealt with on its merits, if convinced Free Traders would vote Free Trade and convinced Protectionists were willing to adopt a policy of giving adequate protection and nothing more, those who are in accord with my views would win hands down. But the Tariff is not being considered on its merits. If the Government holds up its hand in one direction, there are senators willing to slavishly and blindly follow. </para>

            <para>- I can say nothing less. Not a single case has been cited of an Australian industry which is languishing as a result of the present Tariff. When the time arrives when it is sought to put other industries on a fair level, we shall see whether there are honorable senators prepared to single out the woollen manufacturers, and give them duties for which they do not ask, while, at the same time, protection is curtailed in the case of industries which, perhaps, are entitled to more consideration. Apparently we are proceeding as though the operatives in the Old Country still received half the wages that are paid to Australian workmen. If we desire to have a well-balanced Tariff, we must see that even-handed justice is done all round, and that not only those who happen to be woollen manufacturers receive the benefits. </para>

I produce samples of the materials to which I have referred, and honorable senators can accept my assurance that these articles are not manufactured in Australia.

At. present, they are all de livered as minor articles (item 404) under Ministerial&#39; by-law, duty- free British, 10&#39; per cent, foreign. This- by-law could be- cancelled at&#39;, any moment, thus- automatically restoring the rates of duty provided for by their mention in this Item. Probably when the Tariff has been, finally disposed of, it is intended to cancel the by-law; otherwise; why have these goods been specifically included under item 106b?

        <para>That  the House of  Representatives  be requested  to  amend the item by  leaving  out the words  &#34;Ribbons  and  galoons,  having not more  than  48  ribs to  the  lineal  inch.&#34; </para>
        <para>The effect of this alteration would-be to make these articles, which are now dutiable at 35 per cent., 40 per cent., and 50. per cent., dutiable under sub-item  b  of item 106 at 15 per cent., 20 per cent., and 30 per cent. I have distributed among honorable senators samples of ribbon such as those beforeme, between which an ordinary observer could not see a difference; but one of the ribbons has less than forty-eight ribs to the lineal inch, and the other slightly more, and the one is dutiable under the general Tariff at 50 per cent. and the other at 30 per cent. These ribbons come mainly from France and Switzerland.Women know that there is twice or three times as much wear to-be got from the ribbon having leas than forty-eight ribs to the lineal inch than from the other; but the Department charges a duty of 50 per cent. on the stronger ribbon, which, of course, is the dearer, and a duty of only 30 per cent. on the other, which it is wasteful to buy. A magnifying glass is needed to discover that there are four ribs more in the better ribbon than in the other. I have other samples of ribbons of various descriptions in regard to which there is the same anomaly. They are ribbons in everydayuse by children and by women for the decoration of garments. In&#39; each instance the ribbons are practically the same, but for the fact that one contains more ribs to the lineal inch than the other. The reason for the departmental differentiation is, I am told, that in Victoria there is a workroom, called a factory, which does not manufacture ribbons or galoons, but embroiders them to make hat-bands for schools and colleges,badges, trade names, and designs for attire. From another source I learn that this concern has manufactured one class of ribbon, but one class only. The factory is also used for weaving names and descriptions into boot tags and work of that description. </para>
        <para>I know a good deal about this business, and I regard it almost as a crime that one of these ribbons should be dutiable at 50 per cent., when it does not come into competition in any way with the product of the small factory in Victoria. The Government proposal is to penalize the whole of the community because a factory is engaged in the manufacture of school hat-bands. Surely 30 per cent. in the general Tariff is ample protection for the local industry. The local factory did not find it impossible to carry on its small operations under the previously existing Tariff, and before the introduction of the Tariff now under consideration, the discrimination to which I take exception was not made. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>RUSSELL  (Victoria- VicePresident of the Executive Council &#91;4.3 a.m.&#93;. - I remember this matter coining up for consideration in connexion with the Tariff of 1908. The local industry was at that time a very small one. The honorable senator, by the use of a  magnifying glass, has been able to discover that a particular ribbon has one rib over the specified number. I am informed that the articles covered by the sub-item are being manufactured by the Australian Weaving Company, with the exception of plain one colour hat galoons, or ribbons which they can make but are not at present manufacturing in a commercial way. The galoons and ribbons when for use in a hat factory are admitted as minor articles for the manufacture of hats under item 404. The articles specified in the item are commercially known as woven small wares. Their manufacture was started by the Australian Weaving Company Proprietary Limited, Collingwood, in 1910, with one loom. In 1911 they had six looms; in 1912, 12 looms; in 1913, 27 looms; in 1914, 28 looms; and in 1919, 42 looms. The output would be about &#163;20,000 a year, and the capital invested is &#163;20,000. In addition to this company, another company, J. and J. Cash Proprietary Limited, Richmond, are manufacturers of woven labels, coat hangers, names and dress trimmings. The industry is capable of very considerable expansion, as is evident from the  fact that in 1918 hat galoons. to the value of &#163;80,000 were imported. The factories here are prepared to make those galoons. I have seen many samples of their work, and I am very glad that such an important and artistic industry is being developed&#39; in Australia. I may inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> that if the articles to which he has referred are not made in Australia and cannot be made here, they will be admitted without the duty until there is proof that they can be made in Australia. </para>

            <para>- The Minister stated that the object of the increased duty on these goods is designed to protect an industry engaged in the manufacture of hat galoons. I have been delighted to hear that this industry has greatly improved its position year after year under the previously existing duties. The Minister may propose what duties he pleases on hat galoons, but my objection is that this sub-item brings under a duty of 50 per cent a multiplicity of ribbons that can by no stretch of the imagination be described as hat galoons. The Minister&#39;s argument, therefore, falls to the ground. </para>

            <para>- I happen to know that there are various ribbons that would not be used as hat galoons, and yet, because they contain less than a certain number of ribs tothe lineal inch, they are to be taxed under this Tariff at 50 per cent. I have here a sample of a hat galoon manufactured at the factory in Collingwood, and it is described as &#34;Ribbon galoon for school badges.&#34; It isused for bands for school hats. </para>

This document states that a. workroom, called a factory, in Victoria specializes in supplying hat bands for schools and colleges, but that it does not manufacture: ribbons&#39; or galoons. It so happens thatI have been through this factory inCollingwood. It started in 19 10 with one loom and a capital of&#163;4,000. To-day, the- capital is &#163;52,000, and the factory manufactures not only galoons, but also all classes of ribbons. I think that nearly every ribbon that is worn by our returned soldiers comes out of that factory. </para>

          <para>- I would remind the honorable senator that every pair of corsets is cartoned in a cardboard boac, in order that &#39;it shall  Teach  Australia in an attractive condition. Honorable senators know that the oversea freight is not by weight, hut &#39;by measurement, and it does not take many dozen pairs of corsets to fill a large-sized packing. case when each pair is put up in a cardboard box. I had the charges worked out, but have not them at hand. Speaking from memory, inclusive of the duty, under the general Tariff, they would amount to 100 per cent. Prior to the introduction of the present Tariff the duty on corsets was - British, 10 per cent.; and general, 15 per cent. The present proposal is to make the duty - British, 40 &#39;-per cent. ; intermediate, 50 per cent.; and general, 55 per cent., although Australia is by no means providing all the corsets the women of this country need. At this hour of the morning I do not wish to *give a lecture upon the hygienic &#34; necessities of the proper - shaping of these -&#62; articles in-order to make them  comfortable to wear? hut every man knows how essential it is to a woman&#39;s, comfort &#39;that her corsets &#39;should fit well. Before- &#39;.the war any woman in Australia with moderate means could buy -&#60;a pair  foi  7s. &#39;6d. or 8s. 6d., and they would last her for twelve months. &#39;To-day the same woman is compelled -to pay 22s. 6d., <inline font-style="italic">&#171;r</inline> 25s. per pair, and there is no guarantee that they will last half as long as the others would. I &#39;have with me a pair of corsets which would have cost 6s. 4d. to land in Australia under :the old Tariff, hut which -cannot he landed to-day at under 8s. 2d. a pair. I hove also a pair of- better quality, which could have been landed -in -Australia under the old duty at 14s. 8d. a pair, but which -cannot be landed now at under &#39;24s. 7d. a pair. I have not a -word to say against the article manufactured in Australia, but the corsetmaking industry -of Europe -and America has been developed, as the result of many years of study, to a high degree of perfection. It -is an industry .that cannot he brought to that stage of perfection in -a year or two, and no matter what facilities are &#39;given in Australia, it will %e many years before -we -can -possibly hope to supply the whole of the needs of Australian users of corsets. .T have with me a pair of Australian-made corsets, -every item required in the manufacture df which b imported free of duty. In view of the enormous amount of natural Protection our corset manufacturers have, because of the high freight -which has &#39;to be -paid upon .these articles, owing, to their great bulk when packed for transport, is it. reasonable to ask for an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 55 per cent., which must -be calculated not on &#163;100, hut, as I have already oxplained, on &#163;110 f </para>

In the same way, Great Britain has gone to leeward in respect to the manufacture of corsets. At any rate, many women prefer French <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> American corsets because of their peculiar shape. We are not all built alike. Fortunately there are varieties of feature, and in the same way there are varieties of form. E very woman cannot wear the same kind of corset. It is essential for each woman to wear whatever corset suits her form, no matter where it may be made. The Australian corset-making industry has made good progress, but it was developed under a Tariff of 10 per cent. British and 15 per cent, foreign.&#34; </para>

            <para>- There has  been  a satisfactory development of the industry, and, according to my information, a new company has recently been formed in Sydney, the Paxton Corset Syndicate, with a capital of &#163;25,00.0. The wages paid at present by this company amount to &#163;3,000 per annum, and the capacity of the&#39; present plant is four dozen corsets per week. By about the end of 1921 the wages will probably be at the rate of &#163;10,000 or &#163;12,000 per year. During the year 1920, Berlei Limited, Sydney, turned out 6,778 dozen corsets valued at &#163;27,260. This company employed forty-five hands in January, 1921, and ninety-one in December 1921, and during the year paid &#163;5,150 in wages. The Australian Hygienic Corset Company, Sydney, has a capital of &#163;85,000, and the output is about 5,000 dozen per year, valued at &#163;6 5s. per dozen, or &#163;81,250. The plant is capable of doubling this output, and when the demand warrants the plant is to be increased to the capacity of 20,000  dozen per year of a nominal value of &#163;125,000. At present seventy-five hands are employed. It will be seen from the information supplied that this is quite a substantialindustry, and is growing rapidly. </para>

          <para>. - The information furnished by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> fails tosatisfy me of the need for even the modified rates just indicated. The Australian manufacturer say they can produce better corsets than those imported, at from 33 to 40 per cent, less cost. Surely, the local manufacturers do not need any further protection.The schedule rates provide an instance, not of protection gone mad, but of prohibition gone mad. There are some 2,000,000women in the Commonwealth requiring these essential articles of apparel; so that, in the light of the facts and figures provided concerning the local output, an enormous proportion must be imported. In my view, the previous rates of duty were more than sufficient for the protection of an industry which, so far as the quality and value of its products is concerned, can easily hold its own. I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne&#39;s</inline> request. </para>

          <para>. - The rather discouraging figures quoted by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> disclose the inability of the local, manufacturers to hold their own under high protective- duties; and the fact that the only competition comes from America and Canada, which are white-labour countries where wages and conditions are, if anything, better than our own, lead one to believe that if we cannot carry on under these rates a duty of 100per cent, would not be adequate. In these circumstances I am inclined to support the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne.</inline></para>

I am concerned only in the British preferential rate, as the higher duties operate only against Germany, America, and Japan.

        <para class="block">France and Canada, which? is well within the range of practical policy, a duty of 40 per cent would operate against those countries. The Minister has shown how this industry has grown, and the facts are these. About &#163;300,000 worth of corsets, are imported annually into Australia. Until these duties were imposed the corset business was practically non-existent; but since they have been in operation considerable development has begun, and. from June, 1920, to July last Australianfactories have produced &#163;100,000 worth of corsets, which is equal to one-third of the total importations. The Minister has informed us that the D. &#38; A. Co. of America intend establishing a factory here, and a drastic reduction of the proposed duties would prevent the rapid development of the industry, and probably be the means of American capital being kept out of the country. </para>

            <para>- -They have been increased, and the result has been that within twelvemonths one-third of the country&#39;s requirements in &#39;the way of corsets has been manufactured in Australia. According to the figures of the Minister., Australia used to import annually about &#163;300,000 worth of corsets., but during the last financial year three factories - now there are four, and also a number of individuals making to order - made &#163;94,000 of corsets, of which &#163;35,000 worth were made in the first six months, and &#163;59,000 worth in the second six months. As a Protectionist, I think that the duties have fully justified themselves. </para>

            <para>- I have adopted this method because I had  an  opportunity of looking through the Canadian Tariff, and I  find  that in Canada they are very careful to define the variousdutiable articles. The articles with which I am now dealing are referred to in the Canadian Tariff  as&#34;undershirts,  drawers, and knitted goods.&#34;I  am  suggesting  an  item which is a little clearer than that. My request covers  all  classes  of  woven underwear. I was speaking to a gentleman  today  who  told me  that  he  had to pay as high  as  25s. a pair for woven natural wool underpants. I do not wish to make comparisons with pre-war prices, but the ordinary quality  of  either of the articles included  in my  request worn  by  individuals of moderate means would  he  merino finished and would he imported under certain conditions at from4s. 6d. to 5s. per pair. </para>

          <para>. - This item deserves some attention from the Committee. Speaking from memory, in the 1908Tariff, cotton socks and stockings were free. In the Tariff of 1914 they were again free, but under this Tariff they are subject to duties of 30 per cent., 40 per cent., and 45 per cent.

            <para>- I propose to move a request for a slight reduction in the duties on woollen socks and stockings; and if, in the &#39;interests of a very important industry which has grown up in Australia, it is necessary to increase the duties on silk socks and stockings, I shall be prepared to support such a request. Cotton socks are worn very extensively in&#39; Australia. The foot, is perhaps the most sensitive portion of a man&#39;s . anatomy. Many men cannot wear worsted or woollen socks, while others cannot wear cotton socks. Cotton socks have been worn by many in recent years because woollen and silk socks have been beyond their reach. As cotton socks -under previous Tariffs have been admitted free, why&#34; should we impose upon them duties of 30 per cent., under the British preferential Tariff and 45 per cent, under the general Tariff? It has been suggested that cotton socks and stockings of an excellent quality are made in Australia in sufficient quantities to supply the needs of the people. &#39;I have had sent to me a pair of Australian-made cotton stockings. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> ; but for the credit of Australia I hope that we shall not turn out many more according to this sample. The colour is execrable, but having regard to the conditions which have been obtaining they are fair value. That, however, is not the point. We have been told that the cotton-hosiery industry is carried on extensively in . Australia. Being anxious to see the different classes of hosiery that are being manufactured in the Commonwealth, I took the liberty of visiting the warehouse from&#39; which this sample pair of stockings was sent to me. I was courteously received and taken round a well-stocked warehouse. I was naturally anxious to see what classes of goods were manufactured by this. firm, and was shown what in their boxes appeared to he beautiful, attractive, silk hosiery. I do not say that they would be as attractive when worn, but they were a really fine sample of that particular class of hosiery for which there has been <inline font-style="italic">a good</inline> demand. It- has become the fashion of late to wear silk hose. We have been living in an era of extravagance, and our lady friends have not been guilty of greater extravagance than that which is involved in their slavish adherence to silk hose. Heads of families recently are beginning to feel the strain. I am glad to know that the manufacture of silk hose in Australia has extended so rapidly. 1 was then shown, one or two samples of cashmere hose. They were a very fair product; but the warehouse had no assortment of them. Having inspected quite a number of samples of different grades of hosiery, I asked for samples of Australian-made cotton hose. The manager of the establishment said, &#34; We have not any. We can make them, but there is no demand for them.&#34; They had no cotton hosiery in stock, nor could they show me any cotton half-hose. We have been told that they are supplying the needs of the people in the matter of cotton hosiery ; but that is not the case. I was told a.t this warehouse that there was such a demand for cashmere and silk hose that they were not making any cotton goods. </para>

            <para>- Yes. I do not think we have reached the stage at which it pays to make cotton hosiery. For the reasons I have given, and .because I want to see the people who cannot afford to buy expensive hosiery in a position to buy at a reasonable price, I have moved to reduce these heavy duties. Under the old Tariff this hosiery was admitted free from Qre.lt Britain,&#39; and paid a duty of 10 per cent, when imported from foreign countries, and I think it reasonable to fix the duty at 15 par cent. (British and 30 per cent, general. This impost, while bringing in- revenue, will at the same time give people the opportunity of getting a serviceable article at a fairly mode-, rate price. It will not interfere with the silk, cashmere, or woollen hosiery already made in Australia with success. </para>

In view of this wonderful increase in the importations of cotton yarn, and seeing that the hosiery makers can fill their spindles just as easily with cotton as with wool, there seems to be no reason why we should not be able to manufacture cotton hosiery here. </para>

            <para>- The rate of 15 per cent, which the honorable senator proposes seems to be rather low. We ought to give a reasonable protection to the industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lincoln,</inline> of the mills at Coburg, which employ 700 people, says that he can undertake the manufacture of these socks if he is protected. He is evidently at present dealing with wool, . which is protected, and from which he probably gets a better return. He says that he only desires a certain amount of help, and that to-morrow, if necessary, he could convert the machinery so as to deal with cotton goods. All the raw material for  the manufacture of cotton goods is free of duty, and we ought, I think, to do something that has at least the appearance of giving a little protection. The Government suggests 30 per cent., and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> suggests 15 per cent. At 30 per cent., on the lowest-priced cotton stocking at ls. a pair, the duty is 4d. - or 2d. under the honorable senator&#39;s proposal - and on the highest priced, at ls. 7d., the duty is 6&#163;d., or a mean of 5d. These are prices for ordinary cotton stockings, not for the high grades, which are much dearer. On prewar prices, with the lowest at 4d. and the highest at 7d., the duties would be l|d. and 2Jd. respectively, or a mean of, say, 2d. </para>

Personally, I would not use them on any consideration, though, I dare say, some people prefer them. If there are goods of such large value coming into Australia, surely it is worth while manufacturing them here, for, evidently, there are people who use them.

We feel compelled, however, to direct attention to the change which has come over our -new-found friends since 11th November, 1918. The raw material is pure cotton, which we obtain from India and Queensland.

          <para>. - In view. of the statements made concerning the Melbourne company I shall not proceed with my proposed request. I was aware that, some years ago, Australia was dependent upon outside supplies. I am glad to know that there is now a local industry which, up to 1919, at any rate, claimed to be able to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth, and which was, at the same time, using for its raw material cotton grown in Australia. It is only fair that the company should look for support from the community to-day seeing that it supplied its wants during the war years, when foreign importations were not available. I was interviewed on Wednesday by a representative of a firm concerned in the manufacture of engine-cleaning waste. I was to be supplied with certain interesting information, and it has not yet come to hand, since I informed my interviewer that the item could not be reached before Friday. </para>

          <para>. - During the war it was almost impossible to secure supplies of waddings and cotton wool such as are used for padding in clothes and the like. And such stocks as were obtainable were of poor quality. The Queensland Government are encouraging the cultivation of cotton^ and have furnished substantial guarantees. More cotton is now being grown in Queensland than can be .consumed locally, and some of the product is being exported. Any encouragement, therefore, that can be given to an industry using Australian cotton as its raw material should be afforded. I am pleased to learn that the firm using cotton purchased the whole of the Queensland crop last year. I believe, however, that the area has been increased to such an extent that that State has been able to export 200 tons. </para>

        <para>That the House of Representatives .be requested to insert the following new sub-item: -  &#34; (d)  Kapok, per lb., ad val., British, 6d.; intermediate, 9d.; general, 9d.?&#39; </para>
        <para class="block">I have submitted this request with the object of giving encouragement to a very important undertaking, recently established in Sydney, which is closely associated with the woollen industry. Arrangements have been made whereby scoured low-grade wools are now being used for packing mattresses, and the firm which has undertaken this work has received orders from the proprietors of large new flats, and also from the Hotel Australia. In the past it has been the practice to fill mattresses with kapok, and it is believed that if sufficient protection is given to this undertaking by imposing duties on kapok, a very important industry will develop. Practically the whole of our supplies of kapok are obtained from Java and the East -Indies, and out of the 5,500,000 pounds weight imported 5,314,000 pounds came from Java. The disposal of low-grade wools is somewhat of a problem at the present juncture; but if they can be utilized in this way considerable assistance will be given to primary producers, and purchasers of mattresses will be able to obtain a more sanitary article. </para>

            <para>- No. I have seen a mattress packed with wool which after having been in constant use for thirty years has not matted in the slightest degree. Medical men have said that a woollen mattress is much healthier than one of kapok, because Eastern diseases are sometimes introduced in kapok, and the material, when powdered, is detrimental to health. A mattress made of scoured wool is springy, comfortable, and warm. The pre-war price of kapok was about 6d. &#39; per lb., but to-day I am informed it is ls. per lb. If an effort is made to encourage this industry &#39;by imposing duties on kapok it is only to&#39; be expected that the exporters in Java will reduce their prices in an endeavour to compete with the locally-manufactured mattress. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

            <para>- They would be inadequate. This matter was carefully considered and a duty of ls. per lb. was suggested by the manufacturers, but when I examined the costs I informed them that I was not prepared to ask for more than what I&#39; considered fair. A duty under the general Tariff of 9d. would give sufficient protection. It may appear somewhat heavy, but it will give the industry an opportunity to extend, and will at the same time enable primary producers to profitably dispose of their lowgrade wools. </para>

They have before to-day elsewhere dropped the price of kapok down to almost nothing to prevent competition. We ask for a chance for this new industry, which will create a demand for a class of wool which we want to get rid of. Hundreds of thousands of bales of this wool are. now available, and much of it will be left on the hands of the producers if it is not used in this way.

          <para>. - In my opinion, the request is on the steep side, even though the industry which it is sought to protect is a new one. If there can be made of wool a material superior to kapok, it will be welcomed; but we do not wish to have to pay too much for it. Wool will get back to normal values much sooner than those interested in it will like, and recently refuse pieces, such as locks and bellies, have been sold at from 3d. to Id. per lb. </para>

          <para>.- The duties proposed tin connexion with sub-item  b  of the Minister&#39;s request would involve considerable additional expense to mors of these materials. If there is only one factory in Collingwood making them, it cannot hope to supply the whole of the requirements of Australia, and duties as high as 45 per.cent are unreasonable. If we could be assured that an industry was aboa t to be established that would be capable of meeting the demand for these goods, and that it  was likely to suffer from the competition  of similar goods from industrial centres where our conditions of manufacture do not prevail, I should he prepared, to. give the protection necessary to permit of the manufacture of the goods here at a reasonable rate. I think,_ however, that a duty of 45 per cent, cil the actual value of the goods is too high. </para>

          <para>- ,1 should like to have some particulars as to what the Collingwood factory &#34;is capable of turning&#39; out, Immense quantities of these materials are required for horse collars, and for cattle and horse rugs. It would take an enormous mill to supply Australian requirements for these materials. To ask for a duty of s-5 per cent, in tha .interests of a &#39;little mill that cannot supply our requirements for these materials is imposition pure and -simple. Unless we are given particulars of what the factory is capable of turning out, I do not think we should be justified in supporting a duty of even 25 per cent. Bud requests are calculated to deter honorable senators from giving fair .protection to enterprises of .this kind. To agree &#62;to &#60;tlie request would I think, create a very unsatisfactory precedent. </para>
