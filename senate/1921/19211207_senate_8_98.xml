          <para>.- The debate on the Estimates for this Department so far has shown some considerable differences of opinion with regard to our present system. The Defence Department was created for, and charged with, the defence of this country. Being  a  small community, with a very large area to defend, we are naturally unable to bear the financialburden of providing what might be regarded as a sufficient, if not necessary, force for that purpose. That being so, it seems to me that the obvious thing to do is to direct our efforts to the consideration of matters essential to the defence of the Commonwealth. What are the essentials of our defence? One might say that the first essential is man power. We have that, equal in quality to any tobe found in any part of the world. The next essential is elementary equipment of that man power. Previous discussions have shown that we are not so well provided in that respect. The efforts of the Department and the resources at its command should be directed to furnishing, as far as possible, our man power with the means of carrying out the duties with which it is charged. The next essential is the creation of a nucleus of technical branches so necessary in the co-ordination, administration, and management of large bodies of men. Are we provided with these? A statement was made yesterday to the effect that the Defence Department is topheavy, and it was suggested that it is not desirable that we should have such high commands as have been created recently. There is  a  very informative account of the Military Forces of this country to be found in the report for this year of the Inspector-General of the Forces. He sets out in detail how we have arrived at our present state of organization. First of all, he says that at the beginning of the Commonwealth the problem was to amalgamate the six different defence schemes existing in the States. That was undertaken by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Hutton. The second phase arose in  1911,  when the universal  training system was introduced. The present stage, which the InspectorGeneral speaks of as the third stage, is that of 1920-21, when following a Conference of all the senior officers in Australia, who had taken an active and important part in the great war, it was decided to adopt the present system, which consists in organizing units on the lines of the Australian Imperial Force formation, based on experience gained in the war. Thus, we have, to-day, an organization of two divisions of cavalry and five other divisions. It is true that the organization is largely nominal, but the commands have been created; and, advisedly so, if it were only for the reason that there has been created a position which is very desirable. Centralization has always been a great disadvantage under our military organization. This decentralization will throw new responsibilities on many more capable officers. I rather think, therefore, that the move is one in the right direction. The higher units and their organized staffs can be availed of to provide an all-essential trained nucleus. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I support the principle of the universal military training of our manhood, but I have always strongly opposed the military training of youths between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. In my view, such training is of no military value. It is not an asset to the Defence Department as a factor in its military responsibilities. It is really a burden, in that it places upon the Department the task of doing a great many things which are not within its ambit; that is to say, which are not compassed in its responsibility for the defence of this country. The Department has a big enough burden, and a tremendous responsibility. It should confute its efforts to the mobilization, equipment, and training of Australia&#39;s manhood, rather than dissipate its energies, its time, and public money in the training of lads. </para>

            <para>- In that critical period of their lives they have a very serious matter to decide for themselves.&#39; I refer to the question of the business which they will adopt as a means of obtaining a livelihood. The cadet system has considerably interfered with, thousands! of lads whose interest and attention should have been turned in a more profitable direction. I remind honorable senators of the desire and intention of most of the States to encourage and expand technical education. Where the young lads of Australia who have left school cannot be reached in the day-time, the advantages of technical education are being widely offered to them at night. There should be no inducements or excuses afforded to youths to get away from these opportunities, which can be made so potent an influence upon their careers. I say that with special emphasis, having just expressed the opinion that the military training of our lads is of no military advantage or value to the Defence Department. In his report, the InspectorGeneral refers to the fact that the Department is short of sixty-seven instructors to-day. He deals with the results of his inspections, and states that he placed under the heading of &#34; Satisfactory &#34; only 31 per cent, of the trainees whom he inspected; under the heading of &#34;Fairly satisfactory,&#34; 44 per cent.; and, as &#34;Unsatisfactory,&#34; 25 per cent. There was not a greater percentage of satisfactory returns because of the shortage of instructional staff. Another factor had to do with changes of staff, and two other considerations were lack of supervision and want of knowledge - both due, really, to the initial shortage of instructors. The Inspector-General explains that, since the Armistice, a number of the best instructors have been promoted to positions which have taken them immediately out of the sphere of direct instructional work; for which reason it has been necessary to increase the Instructional Staff by the establishment of training schools, and the appointment of virtual recruits. A military instructor cannot be turned out in a few months, or a few years.  His  training involves a long process. An old Army Service man explained to me how instructors were trained in the British Army. It would take a man from three months to six months, first of all, to have his voice trained to the enunciation of words of command. He would begin at a distance of ten yards, and would have to go back gradually as far as 200 yards, merely calling words of command at ever increasing distances. Every week or fortnight his voice would be virtually torn to pieces, and he would be put in hospital until he had recovered. Then he would have to start again, until he was cured. That kind of preparation cannot be undertaken in the Australian Forces. A drill instructor in the British Army is a perfected machine. Certain schools of instruction have been established here, but more money might well be spent in that direction. There is an item of &#163;173,800 provided for the Senior and Junior Cadet training which, to my mind, might with very great advantage, both to the Defence Department and to the people generally, be devoted to a more useful pur-, pose. It is not possible to do anything in that direction on the present occasion ; but I earnestly suggest that the Government should reconsider the question in the ligiht of our great financial burden, and review the matter of Senior and Junior Cadet training with a view to, possibly, applying the money now spent upon it more advantageously. </para>

          <para>. -  It seems to me that the compulsory training for youths, especially between the ages of 14 and 18 years, is of very little value. I am not speaking with regard to the report of the InspectorGeneral of the Military Forces, but as a result of what I see myself. Very often I fear there is a considerable lack of discipline rather tihan an Miculcation of discipline among the lads? When passing the parade grounds in the various States one notices very different conduct from what was customarily observed years ago. The boys appear to be having a frolic, and making . a farce of their training. This seems a serious waste of time and money. We can only attribute it to the spirit of the age. This is a new age - the age of Democracy. It is interesting to trace the growth of this Democracy through the modern era of nationalities. This period has been marked by three great convulsions, which turned the minds of civilized men towards peace. The Thirty Years&#39; War produced the Peace of Westphalia; and the system of independent nationalities in Europe, and also Grotius and the science of international law. The next convulsion followed the Napoleonic wars, the Treaty of Vienna, and the Holy Alliance. That was a sincere, though misguided, attempt to achieve something in the regulation of the conduct of the nations of Europe, and haw peace in accordance with their conception. The third great convulsion was the last victorious attack on the stronghold of Autocracy in the Great World War just concluded. We may briefly review, during the period mentioned, tihe advance and spread of democratic government. England has moved along from the doctrine of the divine right of Kings toi the divine right of the Commons representing popular rights, through the revolution of 1688; through the civil war over the rights of British subjects known as the American Revolution; through Chartism and Catholic Emancipation, the Reform Bill of 1832, the franchise extension of 1867, the abandonment&#34; of the King&#39;s veto power, and the establishment of the people&#39;s right. France;, in her own way, with much action and reaction, has travelled towards the same goal. Through a reign of terror, her amazing defence of the first Republic, the restoration of the Bourbons, the assertion of iher right to choose her own king in 1830, and the assertion of her right to dispense with one in 1848, the plebiscite and the second Empire, she has grown in stability and capacity for democratic government. The same story may be told of the East. Japan has stepped out of a military feudalism and has entered the arena of civilized nations with a constitutional government. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Thus we have, in the East and West both, a change in the political and social conditions of national life. We have now the assured continuance of this process of development of Democracy, and on this we may forecast some of the events in the womb of the future. </para>
        <para>It must be remembered that the ethics of Democracy are opposed to militarism in any sense, and tihe Conference at Washington is only a natural outcome of the shaping of a great movement which no Power can control. The substitution of Democracy for Autocracy removes the principal force which led nations to disrupt the world&#39;s peace. The mind turns back to examples of the aggression of </para>
        <para class="block">Autocracy in history, and. rests on the war of the Spanish Succession, which drenched Europe in blood and ended in the Treaty of Utrecht, only when Louis XIV. was exhausted. it was a war that had for its only purpose the settlement of the question as to which royal house should have its glory enhanced by a marriage which would enable it to control Spanish destinies. A further example may be cited of the Austrian War of Succession. Wars such as these would be impossible under Democracy, where the whole tendency is towards the reduction of the possibilities of international wrongdoing. An essential distinction between Autocracy and Democracy is that while Autocracy is superior to law, the Government of a Democracy is subject to the law. The conception, therefore, of international law being binding on the peoples of the world is natural to the people of a Democracy. </para>
        <para>The continual training of all citizens in the qualities necessary for the carrying out of democratic government is the very attribute necessary for an understanding and respect of international rights and liberties. The day is coming when less armaments and less military preparations of all descriptions will be demanded, and when we shall have to depend more on international law. I do not say for a moment that we should dispense with armaments immediately. We should have our munitions in proper order, and we should undoubtedly have a thoroughly trained nucleus of a defence force. But we can surely dispense with a considerable proportion of the expenditure voted by the other Chamber for the purpose of carrying on universal military training, especially of persons under eighteen years of age. If we are prepared to act in our own little way upon what appears to be the findings of the Conference at Washington, we can materially reduce these Estimates. If a considerable proportion of the money proposed to be spent on defence were devoted to immigration it would help to fill our waste spaces. We should then be in a better position from a defence point of view, no matter to what extent we trained the men now in Australia. We have not got the numbers, and we must have the numbers. We must prepare the country for them, because it is no use bringing people here unless we have made some preparation. A considerable amount of money could be usefully spent in making the country ready for satisfactory immigrants who, if properly settled, would make Australia a greater Democracy than she is at present. </para>

          <para>. -  I understand that the Government has gome as far as it possibly can in the reduction of the Defence Estimates, but there are two items which recur in the different Departments upon which I would like some information. They are, &#34; Cost of Living Allowances under Arbitration Court Awards,&#34; and &#34;Basic Wage Allowances, &#39; including Child Endowment.&#34; In the Defence Department these items amount to something like &#163;65,000. I understand that some time ago, instead of increasing the wages of civil servants, the Government granted allowances to meet the higher cost of living. The cost of living is now coming down, but the items still appear throughout the Estimates. </para>

        <para class="block">I desire to ascertain is the amount&#39; which should be debited&#39; to&#39; the College that is now charged to the instructional corps. While there is an item of &#163;10,029- for salaries, &#38;c, there is also an item&#39; of &#163;47,000 for contingencies. The* G6mmittee ought to be provided with some further information&#39; as to how that &#163;47,000 is made up. I do nott like to pass an item, as large as this just because somebody says it is all right. Included in tihe item of &#163;47,000 is a sum of &#163;35,283 for &#34; general expenses and upkeep, including sanitation, stationery and books-, apparatus, ammunition; travelling expenses, fares, freight and transport, printing, examination fees, wages, upkeep of grounds&#39; and buildings, rifle- range, rations, fuel and&#39; light, forage and remounts; and all&#39; other expenditure incidental to the College.&#34; That may be all right&#34;, and .we are asked&#39; to say that&#39; it is all&#39; right, because it is sent to us in that form. It is impossible to assert that there- is- anything wrong with it, but more information ought to be given with regard to such a large item. In several places in the Estimates there are amounts for fares, freights, travelling allowances, and the&#39; like. I: notice under the heading &#34; General Contingencies and Services &#34; the items&#34; &#34; Fares, freights, and steamer- hire, &#163;30,000&#34;; &#34; other travelling expenses, &#163;16,000&#34;; and &#39;&#34;expenses of removal of <inline font-style="italic">personnel,</inline> &#163;4;830.&#34; Under the heading of &#34; Central Administration &#34; there is another &#163;10,000 for travelling allowances, fares, freights, &#38;c. Altogether these items make- a- total of about &#163;60,000: I do not think the Department should&#39; be asked to render an efficient arwmnt of itself unless we provide it with the sinews of war, but, from what I know of the Defence Depajrtment, a matter of over ,&#39;&#163;1,000&#39; a wieek for freights and fares is a little bit over the fence. Perhaps, some satisfactory explanation, can be given. These items are put to us in a general way as being necessary expenditure, but I think we are entitled to seme further information. </para>

            <para>-  I am glad the honorable senator agrees&#39; with| me, because he speaks from long experience, whereas I speak as a young man and, of course, with not the same knowledge of the Defence Department. But I do know that, at the outbreak of war, some of these men were really responsible for moulding the Australian. Army intoi that state of efficiency which made it possible to achieve such splendid results in the various theatres of war. Is it any wonder, in view of the poor salaries paid to therm, that there should be complaints of inefficiency? The Inspector-General says, I believe, that 25 per cent.&#34; of these men are unsatisfactory. Can we be surprised at this ? Men who are strong enough to take command in the absence of oommissioned officers and handle large bodies of men will, naturally, be dissatisfied. &#34;We pay our sergeants of police &#163;400 a year, and yet a non-commissioned officer, holding a. responsible position in the Commonwealth Military Forces, can only expect to get about &#163;6 a week after twenty years of service. Duntroon graduates get decent positions, and we can pay our captains, majors, and colonels very good salaries. I am not saying that our commissioned officers are getting too much, but while there is such a discrepancy between them and the noncommissioned officers on the Instructional Staff - men who are not of the socially elect, because they ha,ve the crown on the arm instead of on tha shoulder-strap - it is not likely we shall get the best service from them. I complained of this matter when the Estimates were being dealt with last year, and was told then by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that a re-arrangement had been made, and&#39; that increased pay had been given to the staff all round. I know two or three members of the Instructional Staff with over twenty years&#39; service in the Permanent Forces, and I find that this increase works out, in their case, a.t from 2d. to 5d. per week. Is it any wonder, when they see commissioned officers getting all the &#34; plums,&#34; while they, who. do all the delving and are really respon sible, are so poorly paid, that they feel they are not getting a fair deal? </para>

            <para>- I am. not suggesting that they should get the pay of a colonel, but it is ridiculous to go on paying them salaries of from &#163;3 3s. to &#163;6 per week after twenty years&#39; service. If we get the right type of men for this position we should be prepared to pay them a decent wage. </para>

        <para>Some time ago the Department, at the instigation of the soldiers themselves, decided that preference should be given to returned men for these positions. Some have proved very good, but others never did have the makings of first-class instructional officers. The InspectorGeneral, I understand, has classed them as entirely unsatisfactory. </para>

            <para>- I was under the impression that the honorable senator spoke of a certain section of the Instructional. Staff as being unsatisfactory. In any case, I think that if some of tlhe trainees have proved unsatisfactory it necessarily follows that a percentage of the instructors must be in the same category, because the best men get the best results. We shall never get first-class men to take up instructional work unless Ve are prepared to give them a fairer deal than they have- received from the Defence Department in the past. </para>

          <para>. - I recognise the reasonableness of the request made by iSenator Foster for further details in respect of the several items to which he &#39;has referred. He said, quite fairly, I think, that whilst he, does not expect, metaphorically, to make the Senate a bookkeeping department, he thinks that fuller information should be available concerning items in the Bill. He is perfectly right in saying that the  item Royal Military College does not include the salaries of the Instructional Staff. I can supply that information, but may I incidentally mention that the Estimates for the Military College show a reduction of &#163;5,700, which, in these days of rampant economy, should be welcomed. The amount paid to officers outside the amount set against the Estimates is &#163;11,500. In addition, some works and buildings, which figure under the Works Estimates, passed a few days ago, have to be included, making the total &#163;73,000. I have endeavoured to obtain some information in regard to expenditure involved in transportation; but at present I am not in a position to supply it. The item, however, broadly speaking, represents the necessary travelling expenses incurred by officers going to camps apart from the removal of permanent officers from one State to another, for which there is a special item. The main amount, however, represents the travelling incidental to camps. </para>

            <para>- No, it includes them. The Estimates show an expenditure of &#163;57,000, but in addition there is &#163;16,000 for repairs, maintenance, &#38;c, making a total of &#163;73,000. That, as far as I can ascertain, represents the annual cost of maintaining the institution. In addition to that, there is certain capital expenditure which was included in the Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Bill, and which amounted this year to &#163;21,000. The capital expenditure, of course, is not a recurring item, and we are justified in saying that the College is costing &#163;73,000 per annum for its upkeep, against which amount there is a payment from the New Zealand Government in respect of their own cadets. </para>

            <para>- If our Defence Forces are to be of any service at all, a training college is essential, and I do not believe in the economy of chopping everything off with an axe, irrespective of consequences. If this country is to maintain any sort of a Defence Force it would be absolute folly not to pay attention to the brains which have to control it. The Military College was established as part of the Kitchener scheme, and for a specific purpose, and if it is to be dispensed&#39; with we might as well do without a Defence Force at all. I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> does not favour the closing of the. College, because that would be a fatal mistake. If it is necessary to keep the College going, and I say it is, it must be kept in the highest state of efficiency. That it has been of great service, and has been conducted on an efficient basis, is proved by the records of the cadets who have passed through its portals. They have achieved results of which any college - particularly such a young institution - might be proud. The fact that the College is costing less this year than last is some guarantee that those responsible for its control have had economy in their minds. If there waa an increased vote, honorable senators might be critical* but seeing that it has been reduced, I submit that the , Committee might pass the proposed vote, knowing that everything has been done to keep the cost within a reasonable limit </para>

        <para>I have made a careful search through the schedule, and cannot find any reference to the Army Legal Department established last year to which, according to the newspapers, certain appointments have been made. I would like some information concerning those appointments, and what the Department is expected to cost this year. ^Senator  FOSTER  (Tasmania) &#91;11:57&#93;. - It was not my intention to complain concerning the cost of the Military College, but I would like the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> to explain a point which to me is not clear. There are eighty-three cadets a,t the Duntroon College, costing &#163;73,000 per year, which works out roughly at &#163;879 per head. A footnote on page 131 reads., &#34; Includes provision for New Zealand cadets, for each of whom the Dominion Government pays &#163;377 10s. per annum to the Commonwealth Defence revenue. . . .&#34; If .the New Zealand Government pay &#163;377 10s. for what costs us &#163;879, we are losing approximately &#163;500 per head for every cadet trained there. </para>

If there were eighty-five cadets instead of eighty-threei, the extra cost  would net be taken into account, because the overhead expenses would have to go oni just the same. If it really costs &#163;879 per annum for each cadet, and we receive only the amount named from the New Zealand Government, we are training their cadets at a much lower rate than we. are training our own. </para>

          <para>.- - I should like to say a -word or two upon this subject. Reference has been made to costa and efficiency in connexion with Duntroon College, and I want to say definitely that if we are not going to keep this College up to the very highest state of efficiency, we had better abolish it altogether. When we are considering the education to be given at a military college we should bear in mind that we are dealing practically with  a  university. Let honorable senators consider the qualifications of the professors in our universities, and the professors in our Military -College should certainly not be men of inferior calibre. When we consider that we have eighty-three students in Duntroon, and that there must be some 3,000 students attending the Melbourne and the Sydney Universities, it; is easy to understand that the cost per head of students in Duntroon must be comparatively high. We must have as efficient men on the training staff of the Military College as we have in our universities. We must also have the very best equipment we can possibly get. If we are to provide such equipment as will enable students of the Duntroon College to be turned out well, we must have better equipment than is to be found in many of the .universities of Australia. The science equipment of many of our universities might be greatly improved. The Duntroon Military College should have the best science equipment that the world can supply.  I  would not support the reduction of the vote for Duntroon by &#163;1 if that would in any way impair the efficiency of tjhe College. </para>

          <para>. - The expenditure upon Duntroon Military College appears to be very high, but it should be borne in mind that when the College was established Parliament approved of  a  very ambitious scheme of defence. We were full of enthusiasm! concerning the result of the cadet training system. We recognised that we were going to have a very big citizen army, and knew that  a  very considerable number of well-trained officers would be required for its command. If we are going toi change that policy, we must review the whole of our ideas in connexion with defence. &#39;This may be possible after the Washington Disarmament Conference, and perhaps some other conferences Jmve completed arrangements for national disarmament, but I cannot see &#39;How, .if our Defence&#39; system is to be  worth anything at all, we can make radical reductions at present in connexion with the Military College at Duntroon. Only a few years ago we were boasting of the magnificent Defence system of this young Democracy, and I know that in the Old. Country Australia&#34; was held up as a fine example of what was possible in a Democracy in that ccoinexioai. If we now decide on a less expensive and more simple system, it will take some time to make the change. Only a few years ago it was said that the Duntroon Military College would rival the great American College at West Point. We set out with a very grand scheme, and now, to use a colloqualism, some persons are &#34; whipping the cat &#34; because of the cost. Under a new system of defence it may be possible to do without this institution altogether, but that cannot be settled during this discussion. Our steps must be gradual, and any one watching the proceedings at Washington .must recognise the difficulties which any nation has to face in reducing its Defence .Force. These things should be borne in mind, and the Military College, cannot be criticised merely from an &#163;. s. d. point of view. </para>

          <para>.- There is something in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has said, but he should remember that when our present Defence scheme was formulated we were in a very different position. The burden of taxation on the people at that time was not a fraction of what it is to-day. We have passed through a very strenuous period, and all the nations of the world are now considering how taxation can .be reduced. Because of the heavy burden of taxation, Federal and State, unemployment is increasing in the Commonwealth and business is suffering. 1 will not say that the vote for the Duntroon Military College  should be reduced, because it must be efficient if we are to continue it. The figures quoted to-day show that it costs something like &#163;800 a year for every trainee of the College, and it is important to know &#34;what becomes of those trainees after they leave the College. I understand that a number of the lads, after completing their -course at Duntroon, resign from the Defence .Force and are never heard of by the Government.  </para>

            <para>- That is so, but there is still a considerable increase in the vote. Several honorable members have spoken of the present method of compulsory training, and in view of the opinions expressed I should like to know if it is the intention, of the Minister to make any reply to the representations that have been made. I consider that an^ opening now presents itself for reviving- the system of volunteer regiments. There is much to be said in favour of that system. In Great Britain, compulsory military training was taken up at the commencement of the war, but as soon as peace waa declared they went back to the volunteer system. </para>

In pre-war days we had a very small percentage of men who knew anything, even of the first principles of military training and the handling of a rifle.

            <para>- &#39;Very many of them have said that they would never go to a &#34; something &#34; war again as long as they lived, but directly the call comes I have no doubt that they will respond to it just as the men who took part in the South! African War responded to the last call. My point ia that while we have a vast amount of useful material already trained, very little use appears to be made of it. I referred to this matter in ques tions which I put yesterday on the subject of appointments to the Air Force. When honorable senators ask questions they receive replies which have been framed by heads of Departments. The information which, is sought cannot always be fully obtained, however, if those heads are not prepared to make the particulars available. I do net desire to introduce names, but I assure honorable senators that men have been overlooked in connexion with selections for the Air Force in Queensland who are well qualified and have had considerable experience. I desire to cast no aspersions upon the successful officers; but, among those who did not succeed - some of whom, indeed, were not even accorded the courtesy of an acknowledgment of their applications - were flying men who had undergone considerable active service experience. I may be allowed to cite the case of Lieutenant V. Rendle,- of Brisbane. I have been provided with a list of the machines flown by this officer. They are as follow : - </para>

In view of the  huge expense involved in training airmen, and remembering the need for the best flying officers possible in Australia, I hold that the services of every applicant should be most carefully studied before appointments are made. Although, in the replies -which were furnished to me, it was set out that the appointments were made by the Air Board, I happen to know that the procedure was different. The Queensland officers were selected as an outcome of one individual being sent to that State who, for some reason or ether not apparent, chose those whom he considered personally the best. </para>

          <para>. - I have endeavoured to obtain particulars from departmental officers in reply to various queries raised in the course of the debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> introduced the subject of travelling expenses. I have been informed that the item having to do with &#34;fares, freight and steamer hire,&#34; against which the sum of &#163;30,000 is debited, covers the cost of fares for all staffs, permanent and citizen, throughout the Forces travelling on duty. The fares are mainly for Area Offioers and instructors travelling around areas for the purpose of instructing trainees. The freight is in respect of the transport of stores and equipment to and from Ordnance Stores. The item of &#34; other travelling expenses, &#163;16,000,&#34; concerns travelling allowances, under regulations, for officers and others travelling on duty. With respect to the line, &#34; Expenses of removal, &#163;4,830,&#34; this &#39;has_ to do with the transfer of members of the&#34; Permanent Forces from one State to a no thter. &#34; Cartage and horse hire, &#163;1,985,&#34; is for cartage contracts for removal of stores and equipment to and from Ordnance Stores. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Another point to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> referred had to do with the difference indicated in the average cost &#39;of cadets at Duntroon, and the charge accepted by the New Zealand Government. It would appear that there is a discrepancy in the figures somewhat favouring New Zealand ; but the overhead charges at the military institution would be just the same if the ten New Zealand cadets had not been at Duntroon. That consideration, I assume, was in the minda of the Commonwealth Government in treating with the New Zealand authorities. There was a laudable desire also, no doubt, that there should not be created any feeling that the Commonwealth was seeking to make a profit out of the training of New Zealand cadets. </para>

          <para>. - I am afraid an effort is being made in the wrong place to effect economy when the Defence Estimatea are selected. If there is one direction in which a considerable expenditure is justified, it is in connexion with Defence matters, as long as the money provided is wisely used. I propose to direct attention to the importance of maintaining our Defence system on an efficient basis. The vote for military defence amounts to &#163;1,623,000, and for naval defence &#163;2,340,43 S. The total is, roughly, &#163;4,000,000, and for a population of about 5,200,000 it represents about 15s. or 16s. per head. Compared with similar expenditure in other countries, that is not an excessive sum for making Australia secure against all comers. Judging by the clamour in the newspapers, the Defence Estimates are excessive. The newspapers are becoming- too assertive in telling Parliament what it should and should not do, and it is time they were put in their propei1 place. Public men can take a very effective hand in doing that. The cry has gone forth that economy must be practised. I am prepared to economize in any direction where it can be shown that the public are not getting full value for the money expended, but if there is one country that needs defence it is Australia. In the other Chamber, apparently, it was considered that &#163;4,000,000 is an extravagant sum to devote to Defence. Prior to the war Great Britain was prepared to expend 32s. per head of its population ; Germany, 30s.; France, 28s.; and United States of America, 14s. The latter country is impregnable, and yet it was ready to spend as much, on Defence as it is proposed to appropriate this year in the Commonwealth. Canada&#39;s expenditure is only 4s. or os. per head, but that Dominion is really sheltering behind the dead hand of President Monroe. Australia, of all British Dominions, (has the most to lose from a successful enemy attack. We may be told in consequence of what is happening at Washington that the world is- approaching the millennium ; but in the meantime we slioulcl maintain such a sysHem of defence, in skeleton if not in active form, as will be sufficient in a time of peril. A large reduction appears to have been made in the amount voted for instructional work. It would be an insane policy, if we had not an adequate instructional staff for the training of troops. Our people have the fighting spirit, but, if we have not the directing genius of a Csesar, even in miniature, to mould the fighting material into an effective striking force it will be&#34; a mistaken policy. I notice that the proposed vote for rifle clubs is &#163;60,000. This i3 the same amount as was voted last year, when only &#163;33,206 was expended. I do not know whether the saving of about &#163;17,000 has gone to swell the surplus of &#163;800,000. If so, there is no credit due to the Government in that connexion. </para>

          <para>. - I agree entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> in his statement that, for every 20s. spent on defence in Australia, we should get full value; but I am afraid that on account of the supposed economy to be practised, that result will not be obtained in future. Any system which is inefficient will&#39; result in an absolute waste. The only effect which the cutting down of the Defence Estimates has had up to the present has been to make the system less efficient, and consequently the expenditure of the money provided will result in less benefit to the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> appears to think that any money spent on defence in Australia will be wasted, seeing that we have 300,000 highly trained ex-soldiers in Australia. He wishes to know why more use is not made of them, but he seems to have overlooked the fact that these men are getting older, and&#39; are becoming less efficient every day. They do. not trouble to keep up their training, despite all the efforts of those who, like myself and others in&#60; this Chamber, give their services to the country in a purely voluntary capacity. We cannot get the ex-members of the Australian Imperial Force to take an interest in this question of our future defence. But I feel satisfied, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> that if the call came during their period of usefulness all of them who are physically fitwould be available, and many who are not physically fit would offer themselves. The spirit of the Australian Imperial Force is still there, but that does not provide for the future defence of Australia, although it may provide for immediate defence. Itmight provide the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of an army if Ave were going to create divisions tomorrow, but no matter how fit, gallant, and well trained these men may be, unless we have the weapons to put in theii hands they are quite useless as fighting units. It appears to me that most of- this cut into the Defence Department&#39;s Estimates has been in the direction of restricting munitions of war. Any cut of that kind ,is a. cut against the efficiency of defence in Australia, and consequently, in my opinion, is greatly to be deplored. I can understand those men who say that they waait to wipe out expenditure on defence altogether. We know where we are with them; they are the idealists who believe they can depend on the brotherhood of man for the protection of Australia. For my part, I prefer to depend on the. good right arm, well, developed, with plenty of muscle behind it and plenty of munitions of war with which to exercise it. They are carried away by their foolish ideas. But there are other men who are not obsessed with such &#34;tommy rot,&#34; but who still cut into the Defence Estimates. They do it entirely in the wrong places, and thus impair the efficiency of the Defence scheme that we are endeavouring to establish. They are the quintessence of everything absurd and stupid. I understand that some criticism has been levelled at men in high places in the Military Forces of Australia. I am not going to say for a moment that everybody iu permanent employ in the Military Forces is all he ought to be, but I do say that it is very desirable that inefficient men, when they are discovered, should be dispensed with. Under our present system it is practically impossible to get rid of them. A man who has devoted his whole life to soldiering, but is not a proficient soldier ; who has made a mistake in youth by starting out to become a soldier; who did not realize his limitations, and did not have them pointed out to; him, cannot be thrown out on the streets. The dignity of Australia demands that some provision shall be made for him if we get rid of his services in the Defence Department. Therefore, I say.it is desirable not only to get rid of these men, but also to provide for them. The sooner we establish in Australia a system of pensions for members of the Permanent Forces the better it will be for the defence of Australia. That is a matter which the Government ought to take into consideration at the earliest possible . moment. Whether a pensions scheme is brought in for the whole of the Public Service or not, one for the military service: - where efficiency of the highest quality is essential - ought to be introduced . </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>has criticised the Government for not using the whole of the money provided for rifle clubs last year. I regret to say that from my military&#39; experience I cannot indorse <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> remarks regarding the usefulness of rifle clubs as portion of the Defence system of Australia. My experience - for what it is worth - is that rifle club training for practical military purposes has very little value. It may be a most admirable recreation for men in the rural parts of Australia, and if Parliament&#39;s object is to provide that sort of recreation for men who desire it, well and good ; but if the object is the efficient defence of Australia, money provided for rifle clubs is of little use. </para>

That claim has been made by rifle club men without properly appreciating the meaning of the word &#34; sharpshooter &#34; and the value of the sharpshooter in the war. During the stationary periods of the war there was very little use for sharpshooters, but during certain phases of the campaign on Gallipoli it is true that sharpshooters on both sides were useful. On those occasions we found some very good shots amongst&#39; rifle club men. </para>

        <para>There is one other thing that I want to mention in connexion with defence. We have already been experiencing the utmost difficulty in carrying out an efficient system of training on the amount of &#39; money provided. We cannot hold schools and camps of instruction to the extent that we would like on the expenditure allowed, and consequently we canndt train officers and non-commissioned officers in a way that those who hold responsible positions in the Defence Forces should be trained. Those conditions obtained before the cuts were made into the Defence Estimates, and now we are going to be hampered more than ever. Again I come back to my earlier statement that these cuts have very seriously impaired the efficiency of the training that can be. carried out in Australia. In this direction we are  penny wise and pound foolish.. We are spending &#163;1,600,000 on Defence, and for the sake of a few more pounds we are eliminating a great deal of efficient training. Truly, it was done with a meat-axe, without consideration to the actual effect it would ha,ve on the training of the soldiery of Australia. I agree with another honorable senator, who said that the training of junior cadets might very well be dispensed with if it were necessary to curtail expenditure,, </para>

          <para>. - I find on inquiry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll&#39;s</inline> statement is not correct that an applicant to whom he&#39; referred, Lieut. Rendle, had not been communicated with by the Department. The information supplied to me is that he was infoimed by letter on the 1st August, 1921, that his application had been rejected, and he was written to on the 5th September, 1921.  Regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;</inline> s inquiries as to rifle clubs, I understand that the saving last year was due  to  the fact that it was not known until nearly half the year had gone what amount would be available. The Estimates were late, as they are now, and it was not until they had been passed that the Government was in a position to spend the money, or the rifle clubs to know what &#34;they were to receive. There was only about seven months&#39; expenditure in last year, but the Estimates provided for twelve months. There was, in addition, a reduction in the grant to members of metropolitan rifle clubs. The efficiency grant was originally 5s., but for metropolitan clubs it was cut down to 2s. 6d., on the ground that, as they were using military ranges, they were put to no expense for the upkeep of their own ranges, as is the! case with country clubs. </para>

          <para>.- The Navy Estimates, owing to a reduction made elsewhere, are slightly less- than last year; but it is interesting  to  note that while there has been a decrease in the sea-going <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> there is an increase in the Central Administration Staff, the total last year being 191 as against 214 for this year. The sea-going <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> is only 4,689 as against 6,350, and the estimated expenditure is &#163;90,000 less than last year. I should like to know the reason for this increase in the Administrative Staff by twenty-three. As I said during the debate on the Loan Appropriation Bill, I am not out for economy at the expense of efficiency. I put safety first, whatever it costs; but we are justified in asking that the money voted, be the amount small or large, shall be expended judiciously. </para>

          <para>. - I do not know whether, at this stage, we can enter upon a full discussion of Navy administration. If so, I think it would be possible to effect a considerable saving in expenditure of this Department. Prior to the war Military and Naval administration was in the hands of one Minister and one set of civil officers. We could very well go back to that position now. The Minister for &#34;the Navy and his staff, as well as the Naval Board and Secretary, could be dispensed with. I do not pretend to have any accurate knowledge, but as we form our opinions as we go along I have been forced to the conclusion that in war time we would be in a better position if we were without the Naval Board and &#39;Secretary. I indorse what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> said as to the need for efficiency. No one will claim that this Department is efficient. No doubt this is due to the fact that it was created during the war as an expedient to relieve the Minister for Defence of a great deal of added responsibility at that time&#34;. That load of responsibility is very much lighter now ; and I think that if, prior to the war, the Minister was able to attend to the affairs of the Navy he could very well do so now without any sacrifice of efficiency in either Department. The public demand economy, and it is the duty of this Government and this Parliament to cut down expenditure wherever possible. As for the Naval College, I would suggest that the lads at present in training there be placed on board the battleship <inline font-style="italic">Australia.</inline> They would probably keep the vessel in better order than it is at present. Although it is said that the ship is obsolete, I have my doubts on tbat point. I know that naval authorities are building bigger ships, right up to date; but I think the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> is too valuable an arm of defence to be allowed to rust. </para>

            <para>- I do not know, but it is on the reserve list, and that looks as if it will soon be regarded as one of the old naval derelicts. The lads from the College, if placed on board the battleship, could be sent to sea frequently and get the proper kind of training. Altogether their life would be much more pleasant than at Jervis .Bay. As for the College itself, an expenditure of anything from &#163;30,000 to &#163;100,000 would convert it into an attractive resort for seaside visitors. I do not want it to be thought that I suggest the Government should go into the business of hotelkeeping. It certainly would not be economy to allow buildings to the value of &#163;20,000 or &#163;40,000 to go to ruin, and from what I know of the place, I think there would be very little difficulty in getting some one to take up the scheme and convert the College into a seaside hostel. Economy, is- urgently required in administrative expenditure. If I had my way the principal cut would be iri regard to Defence expenditure generally. If, within the next ten yeara, Australia is called upon to fight we shall have a large number of officers and men &#39;trained in the best school. </para>

We could not select a better time than the present for a substantial reduction of our expenditure, for the reasons I have given. A  i  few years hence, when, perhaps, many of ; our present financial troubles are behind us, we will be in a better position to begin training again. If unfortunately war : broke out to-morrow, and Australia were involved, the men who would command our .armies would not be drawn from the Permanent Forces. They would  come from, the ranks of those who were trained in actual fighting in the recent war. There may be some brilliant men  in the Permanent Forces, but if there are they were overlooked during the war, because they did not see very much active service, though this may not have been altogether their fault. Men trained on active service during the war will prove more efficient than men trained under peace conditions. </para>

          <para>. - The discrepancy in the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the sea-going services . and the administrative staff mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> is more apparent than real. The increase of &#163;.13,000 is accounted for in this way : Provision for tlhe salaries of certain officers borne for pay under other votes, 1920-21, &#163;4,700; provision for full year instead of eight months&#39; basic wage allowance, including child endowment, &#163;1,000; provision for full year for permanent clerks (returned soldiers) appointed during 1920-21, &#163;1,065 ; increments under awards and regulations, &#163;2,965; and provision for permanent clerks in lieu of temporary clerks at present employed, &#163;4,000. That vote for temporary employment appeared under contingencies for war services. In the re-organization of the Department it has been thought desirable. to appoint a number of these temporary clerks to . permanent positions. Though there appears to be an increase under this item, as a matter of fact it is a transfer from an-  other branch of the .Service. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> suggestion that the Defence and Navy Departments might be brought again under one Ministerial head is no doubt the result of his own experiences in- the Department. I have not the slightest doubt that in the reconstruction of the Cabinet and the re-allotment of Ministerial duties the suggestion will not be overlooked. I cannot say more than that. As to the suggestion of the honorable senator that the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> should take the place of the Naval Training College 1 shall not express an opinion. But in this matter we can surely look with confidence to other countries where we find, for instance, that Great Britain, which we can safely follow in naval matters, has not adopted such a policy. If she had, there would no cboubt be an excellent reason for transferring the College, but that has not yet been done. Personally I cannot see what advantage would be gained, and I hesitate to believe that Great Britain, who has held the supremacy of idle seas and has been supreme in all naval matters, would not have adopted that course, if it had been thought desirable. I do not know if itwould result in economy. We have been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that the establishment at Jervis Bay had cost from &#163;20,000 to &#163;40,000. </para>

            <para>- I am not referring to proposed expenditure. If I had the difference between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> estimate, taking the higher amount, and the actual expenditure, I believe, I would be able to show a capital account of over &#163;300,000. I believe the amount spent there actually totals over &#163;400,000. It is not a matter of allowing that capital expenditure to remain idle or turning the College into a tourist resort, but one of efficiency. </para>

            <para>- The Minister realizes that that was not a serious suggestion, but one that only occurred to me on the spur of the moment.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- E.</inline> D. MILLEN. - Exactly. There are reasons which occur to a layman why we should not transfer out training to the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> from the Jervis Bay College. Possibly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has visited the institution,, and knows the advantages it possesses. There is an indicacation on every hand of the boys being comfortably housed in a pleasing situa tion; and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has had&#39; experiences similar to mine in ocean travelling he will realize that, apart from the superior accommodation provided for senior officers, that available to others is not all that could be desired. Naturally, the construction of a vessel of war - seriously limits the accommodation, and1 I can recall an incident which occurred when I .was associated with naval matters, and when a proposition was submitted for establishing land barracks. It was thought that men could be trained ashore for the work they would have to perform at sea, and in connexion with the proposed institution it was suggested that the cubic contents should be limited to an appallingly small degree. I compared the space which was suggested with that provided under the Navigation Act, and to my horror found that that contemplated in the barracks was less than one-half of what we had stipulated in the Navigation Act. In the proposal put to me it was said that a more liberal allowance was being made in the proposed barracks than existed on the ships at sea, and all I can say is that while I admire our sailors who &#39; &#39; go down to the sea in ships,&#34; I am not at all anxious to join them under such conditions. The cubic contents of the accommodation proposed was about 400 feet to 8.00 feet, which was insisted on for merchant ships, and if we are to train boys in that way more accommodation than that suggested at that time should be provided. Further, I think it is highly -desirable that naval cadets should have the opportunity of indulging in shore sport and exercise such as is carried out on the land. There is more for a naval cadet to do than acquire the art of splicing ropes and heaving up anchors, and the best place for him to be thoroughly trained is, I believe, in a Naval College ashore. If Great Britain and other countries, with all their experiencei should call such a system into question, Australia will be quite prepared&#39; to consider the suggestion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner;</inline> but until that is done I shall be the last to- suggest that we should fly in the face of the experience of countries much older than our own. </para>

          <para>. - We have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> usual valuable contribution to the debate, and had it not been&#39; for tha honorable aiid responsible position he- occupies, it would be well for the </para>

        <para class="block">Committee not to pay too much, attention to it on its face value. But remembering that he is a representative of the party which is aspiring to political supremacy, , and we are considering that arm of defence which shields the life of this country from a foreign enemy, we must add to his remarks, the significance which properly attaches to it. If the honorable senator had been here earlier in the day he would have heard figures quoted to show that the Commonwealth, instead of paying an excessive amount for defence purposes, is proceeding in a most modest way when compared with other countries. The honorable senator will realize that there is no country in the world to-day that is more vulnerable, and has so much to lose in comparison with the freedom it enjoys as Australia We have a coastline of approximately 12,000 miles; but to that must be added the total coastline of the late German Possessions over which we have a Mandate, &#39;which stretch out to such an extent that I do not know what our length of coastline really is. It may be that we shall have to protect these Mandated Territories from aggression, and guard a greater stretch of coastline than we ever previously calculated on or imagined. Even if an attack is made on one of these islets, which have recently risen from the bosom of the ocean in that group, the responsibility of. defending it will be ours, and it will be just as necessary for Australia to preserve and defend those islands from aggression as it is tol defend any part of the coastline of the mainland. Our only means of protecting these people far afield is by naval effort, and when a protest is made by an accredited representative of Labour that we are spending extravagantly, we must attach that serious importance to the statement which is deserved. If we compare our expenditure in pre-war days with that of other countries, including Great Britain, Germany, and the United States of America, we find it is exceedingly small, and really on a most moderate scale, and I am sorry that the Government yielded to this manufactured economic &#34; stunt,&#34; which has been raised in this country, and has found final expression in a fatal reduction of this allimportant and vital vote. What is the sum to be expended ? For land defence &#163;1,600,000 is proposed, and, according to some, that amount is excessive. For naval defence we are asking for only &#163;2,600,000, thus making approximately &#163;4,200,000 out of a total expenditure of &#163;65,000,000, or &#163;1 for every &#163;15 in order to insure the safety of this country. If we deduct the expenditure for war services we get down to the net expenditure of something in the nature of &#163;30,000,000, and by striking out all the expenditure involved in connexion with the war, and the aftermath of war, as represented by the &#163;30,000,000, all this country seeks to spend to insure its freedom, for its right to live, is about &#163;1 in every &#163;7. Is that too much? Unfortunately, this insane tide of retrenchment, which originated in the newspaper offices of Melbourne, has succeeded, and I am sorry to say that in consequence of weak -kneed action of this Government there has been a heavy reduction. The result to-day is that on the figures submitted, with a population of 5,500,000, we are spending only 15s. per head. In 1913 Great Britain was spending 32s. per head, Germany was spending* more, and France 28s. America was spending 14s. per head in pre-war days, as against 15s. here. </para>

            <para>- I do not know. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton.</inline> - About 48s. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator LYNCH.-</inline> Possibly so. When we, as elected representatives of the people, examine these figures, we have to consider what* we are doing to keep this country safe. Quite apart from what is happening at Washington, we have to be careful. This economic &#34; stunt,&#34; manufactured by those goggle-eyed gentlemen in the newspaper offices in Melbourne, is largely responsible for the circulation of statements that have no justification in fact. Let us take the material value of this country. We cannot set a price on it. We cannot place liberties in the one scale and gold, silver, or precious, stones in the other. The freedom of a people cannot be adequately measured, valued, or sized up. Are all to be censured because we do not reduce the expenditure per head on defence below 15s.? The material worth of this country is somewhere in the neighbourhood of &#163;2,000,000,000. I am not merely looking at the sordid aspect of the question when I mention our material worth; but for the purposes of insuring it we propose to spend a paltry &#163;4,000,000 this year. </para>

        <para class="block">It is about time we rubbed our eyes, and asked whether, these people are not seeking to coerce Parliament &#60; against its will to betray the trust reposed in it by the electors. I have said before in this Chamber that I am not a native of this country, but I value it and its freedom so much that it is very difficult for me to express my appreciation of it in words. -Another reason why I say that is because I have sampled other lands and their form of freedom, and have returned to this as incomparably the best. </para>
        <para>There is no country on the face of the globe in which I could enjoy greater freedom than I enjoy here. But though we have that freedom in Australia, there are still, some who will cavil at defence expenditure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> referred particularly to the vote for the Navy. If this were a land-locked country like Switzerland, I could understand the honorable senator&#39;s opposition to that vote. But Australia is an island continent, and for this reason a special effort must be put forth for its naval defence. To suggest that &#163;600,000 is too much for this purpose, passes my comprehension. We may find consolation and some hope for our security in the future from the happenings at Washington. But things are in a very shadowy state there at present, and we can do little more than point to the fact that some pious aspirations have been indulged in at Washington which may pave the way to something better later. Whether or not the tentative agreement about which we have heard, aud which is in such a very embryonic stage at present will so materialize as to provide some tangible security for the safety of this country, is one of those things which may be described in the stereotyped phrase as being &#34;on the lap of the- gods.&#34; We do not know what will happen as the result of the Disarmament Conference at Washington; and without taking too much notice of what is occurring there, we must make the best effort in our own defence of which we are capable. I have previously said that this country stands to lose more than does any other country on the face of the globe, if we take into consideration the freedom we enjoy in Australia, and the opportunities that are afforded here to men to make an independence and a home, under conditions which cannot be found in any other country. In the circumstances, I say that the 15s. or 16s. per head of population which it is proposed we should expend in our defence is rather too little than too much. I support the Government in their defence proposals, and my only regret is that they did not stand up to those who have called out for retrenchment, &#39;and suggest to them that it would have been better if they had directed their attention to extravagance in connexion with any other Department of the Government. </para>
        <para>I referred at an earlier stage to an item of expenditure for the Instructional Staff, which was struck out in obedience to the insane cry for economy. &#34;What was the purpose of this expenditure? It was to preserve to the utmost of our ability the vast and rich experience gained during the war by the men in command. We are allowing that to be lost. We cannot imagine a person engaged in a private business dreaming of doing such a thing. He would seek to husband to the utmost even a fractional part of any experience gained. We have gained a lot of experience of value to the nation as a result of what was done in the great world&#39;s war, and we are asked to set that aside under the direction, not of the electors who sent us here - they never told us to do anything of the kind - but of people in musty offices in Melbourne and elsewihere, who use the euphemistic title &#34; we &#34; and pretend to direct public opinion in this country. It is about time that we rose to the occasion and said to these people, &#34; You mind your own business. Get out your newspapers, and extend your pages for further advertisements. That is your business. You are in it only for what it will pay. You should bear yourself with becoming seeming. Keep your place, and do not try to run this country by dictation.&#34; </para>

            <para>- We might carry -that to an absurdity. Economy ceases to be economy if it is practised at the expense of efficiency. I have previously said that I consider it my duty to support whatevei&#34; expenditure may be necessary for the defence of Australia. But there is, in my opinion, a great deal of room for improvement in the administration of the Navy Department. I speak of a matter about which I know something. I was privileged, a little time ago, to be in a position to make inquiries, and I say without hesitation that it is a mistake that shipbuilding should continue to be carried on at Garden Island. I discovered, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> will bear me out in this statement, that there was evidence of antagonism between Government Departments which must tend to a great deal of extravagance. I found that one of the Government Departments would persist in this work, of shipbuilding, whilst at the same time a highly equipped dockyard had been established ait Cockatoo Island at great expense to this country, which might carry out all the shipbuilding work that has to be done for the Government. I freely admit that the evidence of experts on the matter did not agree, and certain of the experts were of opinion that the workshops at Garden Island should be continued for work in connexion with the Navy. Still, in my opinion, the balance of evidence was distinctly in favour of carrying out all the shipbuilding required by the Government at Cockatoo Island dockyard, and that the workshops conducted at Garden Island should be done away with. With this idea in view, tlie Government very wisely appointed a new Board of management, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> wants an illustration of what can bo done by effective economy, keeping efficiency always in view, he will gat it in a most practical form in what has taken place in connexion with the two Departments to which I have referred. &#39; Since the new Board has put the business on a practical basis, tha result is a saving to tlie Commonwealth of &#163;373,250 per annum. </para>

            <para>- It is real economy, and it is my justification for saying that direct inquiry into all the Government Departments is necessary. I have not this in black and white, but I 3m assured that the new Board has done no work for -tihe Government. The reason is that Government Departments are not loyal to each other. One is fighting the other, and the taxpayer has to pay for both. That is a -disgraceful state of affairs. The reconstruction at Cockatoo Island has had one result, which stands to the credit of the unions and the men employed there. It is officially stated that the piece-work prices, which, have been arranged with the unions, will result in a saving of approximately &#163;40,000 on the 12,500-ton boats, and a saving of &#163;16,000 on the 600-ton boats. That result has been brought about because the new Board has been able to put things on a business basis. We should be1 able to depend on the loyalty of Government Departments to make shipbuilding in Australia practicable. Statements have been made in the press to the effect that it is not possible for Australia to build ships. Under the conditions previously existing, I agree. If a sjhip. cost &#163;30 or &#163;40 a ton to build eighteen months or two years ago, there is no evidence available to deny that under the new conditions a ship will not cost considerably less to-day. No one can say how much construction will cost ; I believe, however, that a considerable reduction will be shown in the cost of shipbuilding in Australia. I do not know if honorable senators have noticed, a list which has been furnished with respect to Cockatoo Island. It shows that soon after getting into operation the authorities were able to do away with twelve foremen. </para>

            <para>- The question of the Na.vy cannot be separated from that of shipbuilding generally. In all Public Departments a greater measure of firmness in administration is necessary. During the inquiry of the Commission of which I was a member, I became dissatisfied concerning the revelations about administration. I want to know the attitude of the Government regarding the duplication at present existing. I wish to be informed if it is to be continued, or whether the Government will be firm enough to say that work which can be done must be done at the cheapest place. We can only carry on one big shipbuilding concern at Sydney, and that one can do the whole of the naval work neces sary. I trust that this country will receive 20s. for every &#163;.1 spent upon the Na.vy. I doi not know that we are getting that to-day, however. I understood that at the administrative head-quarters in Melbourne there is considerable overstaffing. A person whose word I can take, and whom. I regard as reliable and authoritative, likens head-quarters to a lot of rabbits running about a burrow. I do not ask that this man here or that man there shall be &#34; sacked.&#34; </para>

            <para>- The idea of placing a new authority in control at the Island had been approved by the Government before &#34; the Commission was appointed. The first answer which tihe Government gave when the claim for the appointment of a Commission was urged was that they did not think it necessary; seeing that they had just created a new Board, it would be well to ascertain what came of its activities. However, pressure in the direction of appointing a Commission was maintained, and the Government acquiesced. Economy has now been effected, and the evidence that the Government have brought about economy should go for something in these days, when thoughtless people are repeating all sorts of statements tending to discredit the Government in respect of their control and administration of national finance. When persons take the responsibility of saying that certain Departments are overrun like a rabbit warren, they tend to feed a sinister impression already fanned by f outside &#34; interests. Responsibility rests with these persons. to learn whether uhere is- any substance in the allegations. / </para>

            <para>- If I could not place myself in possession of information supporting a statement of the kind I would not see fit to make it. Hewever, the remark is typical. I am accustomed to hearing public Departments referred to by outsiders as being filled with drones. No one will say that, here and there, there is not a surplus officer or an inefficient man upon a staff. But the sain&#169; holds good of any and every large commercial establishment. It is bound to be true in regard to the Public Service, since members of Parliament are so careful to insure that public servants are not worked unduly. On the whole, however, the Commonwealth Departments are doing a fair thing with only reasonable numbers of hands upon the various staffs. Many branches, indeed, are suffering from understaffing. I refer, particularly, to the Taxation Department. With a larger staff available, that Department would not have been so far in arrears as it is to-day. If honorable senators cared to devote some attention to the sheaves of representations which have been made by responsible heads they would be impressed by the repeated recommendations for additional assistance. </para>

            <para>- All scales do not weigh accurately. If the honorable senator made an honest effort to weigh such evidence as was placed before the Commission, it may be taken for granted that other persons also made equally honest&#39; efforts to do the same ; and there is no reason why each and all should not have come to different conclusions. Is there any justification for the indignation - simulated, I feel sure - with which the honorable senator denounced those who had arrived at conclusions differing from his own? </para>

          <para>- C Certainly not. I would not ask the honorable senator to believe that there is no departmental friction in any avenue of business, private or public. But experts, while recommending the continuance of docking activities at Cockatoo Island, have pointed out certain advantages arising from having certain fittings, gun-placings, and the like, done at Garden Island. Such work is undertaken there by ships&#39; artificers. These are men who will be attached to naval vessels in case of war, and who will be sent away with those craft in the event of naval activities developing. This provides employment for them meanwhile, and furnishes an opportunity for them to keep up their training. These things, the Naval authorities agree, provide justification for the maintenance of the refitting establishment at Garden Island. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">The Government also feel that this course is justified. There is no duplication in the work carried out in these establishments. At Garden Island the work is of a highly-technical nature, and commercial ship-builders, who are not trained for such work, cannot do it efficiently. </para>

            <para>- No; but we are anticipating war now by committing the country to an expenditure of &#163;4,000,000. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> suggested that if Great Britain trained its men in colleges there was no reason why Australia should depart from that policy. Half-a-dozen fast cruisers could patrol the coasts of Great Britain daily; but to provide sufficient ships to properly patrol the Australian coast would impose a financial burden that the people could not possibly bear. Although the British Navy during the recent war certainly protected Great Britain, it never proved itself to be an effective force. The British Naval authorities were never able to give the military leaders a guarantee that Germany could not land a force somewhere on the British Isles. - On that account, throughout the war, there were always in England 3,000,000 men of military age. Even in the disastrous days of 1918 that was the position, and one of the chief reasons for it was that the British Navy acted merely as a spectator of the war. My contention is that Australia should concentrate its attention on defence on land. We should continue to manufacture rifles. If we found ourselves at war we would not have a sufficient supply to carry us on for six months. The manufacture in Australia of the material required for defence should he our first consideration. </para>

            <para>- With our limited population we could never dream of establishing a naval force sufficiently strong to defend the whole of our coastline. I would scrap, not the effective parts of the Australian Navy, but the Administrative Staff. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has criticised the newspapers for the attitude they have adopted; but I would remind him that the press is reflecting the views of every man in the street. It knows that Australia is confronted . by a very serious financial problem. To obtain real economy we need efficiency. The Training College, as at present organized, was justified when called into existence. Now, however, we have many men in Australia who have had experience of actual warfare, and have had a better, training than any college could. impart. The ships of the Australian Navy are always found where the wealth is. That is, near the capital cities, and very little protection could be afforded to our island Territories. While I desire to have the most efficient naval force possible, I would reduce expenditure in connexion with the Administrative Staff. One branch writes to another, it seems to me, simply for the purpose of giving it something to do. I know a case where&#39; a man employed ab Cockatoo Island almost lost his position because he refused to leave some important work in order to furnish a report which was demanded at a moment&#39;s notice. </para>

          <para>- He is angry with the press criticism. The Government and Parliament must wake up. The time for economy is here. The cost of governing this country has exceeded by a hundredfold or more the estimate of cost made by the statesmen who brought this Parliament into existence. We pay &#163;20,000,000 interest on war loans. We were not told of that expenditure when asked to come into the Federation. In spite of all .the increased cost, I venture to say that we are acting to-day as in prewar days. I do not blame the Government any more than Parliament, or Parliament any more than the people. We are not making any effort to realize that things are not as they were prior to 1914. I am only touching the fringe of this question. Instead of going into recess, Parliament should go into session to consider how to deal with the financial position, and to bring about economy, not by a vote cast in ten minutes, but by a decision that would be for the good of Australia. The Government brings in the Estimates, and gets them through in the same old way, as they are, of course, able to do with the majority they have behind them. But they are missing their opportunity. I suppose it will.be our opportunity next, and then, perhaps, we will do the same. </para>

          <para>. - I would like to refer to one or two points mentioned by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson.</inline> I am not backing my opinion against that of experts at Cockatoo Island or in the Navy Department. I would like to draw the Minister&#39;s attention to the fact that there is machinery worth hundreds of thousands of pounds lying, idle at Cockatoo Island. It is principally there for the use of the Navy, and unless work is done at the Island the machinery stands idle. It is a waste of the people&#39;s money. I am told that the feeling between the Navy Department and those in charge at Cockatoo Island is the same as it was before the recent inquiry was held. That  is to say, the Navy officials are quite sure that they are the only people who can carry out naval repairs. Statements to that effect were made by all the Navy witnesses, from the Admiral down to the bottom of the ladder. On the other hand, we had evidence from those who had been in the shipbuilding business all their lives that Cockatoo Island is well equipped for carrying out naval repairs, and can do the work satisfactorily. The Minister made a remark about officers of the ships doing repairs. Minor repairs can be done by the officers of the ships, but there are many larger repairs which can be done at Cockatoo Island. This would avoid the keeping of two staffs. There are many things done at Garden Island which can only be done there. I give all credit to those concerned for the magnificent saving of &#163;493,790, which has been made in a few months. Those responsible deserve the thanks of the Government and the Parliament. I understand that in making that saving efficiency has not been sacrificed, and that the same amount of work is now being done with fewer hands. The Government, the Naval authorities, and the shipbuilding authorities ought to give serious consideration to this matter, with a view to coming to a definite agreement whereby the machinery can be used and effective work done. </para>

        <para>I do not want to go injo the question of the defence of Australia, but I wish to express a pious hope that the Washington Conference will be a landmark in the evolution of humanity. As far as I can gather, it will be one of the greatest blessings that has come to Australia from a defence point of view. We are everlastingly being told that our enemy is in the East. Everybody knows what that means. If the English-speaking world can come to an agreement with that Power in the East, then the immediate danger to Australia vanishes. No other Power represents any danger to. Australia. I have the sincerest faith still in the Washington Conference. I do not think the Eastern menace is what people represent it to be. I have not the &#34; Japanese fever,&#34; if I may use that term. I am not in the least degree troubled as to what the,Japanese may do in my lifetime or the lifetime of my children, and I think it would be foolish to work up any scare on the subject. </para>

          <para>. - I noticed in the press this morning some comment by the responsible head of the company that is running the air mail services in Western Australia, and a reply to his allegations by the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie).</inline> A statement was made that proper landing grounds had not been prepared. I have been given to understand that a great deal of the preliminary work in connexion with the location of sites, surveys of routes, and the preparation of landing grounds has been done by private individuals associated under the title of the Aero Club. Much of this work waa done prior to the inauguration of the Department&#39;s air services, and it&#39; is said that there has been practically no recognition by the Department of this work, but that the Department has claimed all the credit for it. I regret that the Estimates do not furnish any particulars regarding the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the air services or the details of the expenditure. I remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> when introducing a special Bill to deal with civil and military aviation, referred to the estimated cost for twelve months. Half of that time has gone, and the Estimates are submitted to the Committee in such a way that we are unable to form any idea of how the expenditure will be allocated, or of what the staff will consist. . A sum of &#163;77,000 is set down for &#34; pay,&#34; and -&#163;30,000 for &#34; general expenses,&#34; but beyond that we know nothing. Is there any possibility of the Air Service Force getting into closer contact with the associated companies or the Aero Club, so that the Department may not only avail itself of all the information which these people have collected in their private -capacity, beyond that which they have already supplied to the Department, but that it may also give them due credit for the work they have done in coordinating the efforts of those who are trying to establish the flying business in Australia. I had hoped, in common with, other honorable senators, that a Ministerial statement supplementary to that made by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> would have been made regarding the Air Force. I offered some criticism at that time regarding the value of the gift aeroplanes from the Imperial Government. I said that while not in any way wishing to decry the value oi the gifts, I wondered whether the effect of the reports to the press, and of the statements made by members of the Government, had not been to give the people an inflated idea of their value. It waa stated that we would &#39;be told when the Estimates were brought forward exactly how some of the machines were going to be used. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> who made that promise, but beyond the bald statement of the. amount of money necessary for the Force, we have received no information. </para>

            <para>- I presume that the activities of the Australian Trade Commissioner in China are linked up with the work of the Bureau, and in connexion with this matter, I should like to state that, as the result of faulty information supplied by the Bureau, considerable inconvenience and expense were caused re cently to a Tasmanian company. It appears that information was desired as to the price at which sleepers could be supplied to China. The details were duly forwarded by the Bureau, and later a reply was received from the Trade Commissioner in China to the effect that the tender was useless, because the price was f.o.b., whereas it should have been c.i.f. This information should have been supplied to the Tasmanian company at the outset. Subsequently, the amended tender was forwarded, and a reply was received from the Trade Commissioner stating that the cable was unintelligible. This was a most extraordinary state of affairs. The first cable was sent in the same code, and, apparently, it was intelligible, because the Trade Commissioner replied asking for an amended tender, and the second, cable, we must presume, was sent in the same code. Altogether the transaction was most unbusiness-like. The Bureau is supposed to foster Australian trade as much&#34; as possible, instead &#39; of which, in this instance, the people concerned were placed in an entirely false position, and were put to&#39; considerable expenditure and inconvenience. </para>

        <para>Turning now to the Institute of Science and Industry, I find that the estimated expenditure this year is &#163;16,007. Last year the vote was &#163;15,000, and the expenditure &#163;16,042. I am quite&#34; convinced that we are not getting value for our money, and I should like the Minister to give us an assurance that the Institute will be placed on a more effective basis at the earliest possible date. The anticipations as to the value of its work are not being realized. It has been suggested that one reason is that the Institute has not been furnished with all the necessary appliances. We have a Science Institute in name, but not in fact. It is reprehensible that we should continue spending such a large sum of money on a body which could be made of great service* to Australia, but which, because of the lack of certain material, is not able to fulfil its functions. </para>

          <para>. -  I am extremely disappointed with the results achieved by the Institute of Science and industry. I do not wish to enter into a serious criticism concerning its work, because I know it has been faced with grave difficulties, but I was surprised at the outset to learn that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> had been appointed Director of the Institute. . There is not the slightest doubt that he is a most estimable gentleman in his. own particular sphere, but it appears to me that for controlling an Institute of this nature we should have secured the services of a fully qualified scientific man, even if it meant going abroad. I do not think any honorable senator could say .that it was not work which called for special qualifications, both administrative and scientific, and it is to be regretted that a man such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs;</inline> who has undoubtedly rendered good service to Australia in another sphere of activity, should have been selected. I would not for a moment question his abilities in an administrative capacity, or as a statistician, but his scientific qualifications are not at all satisfactory. </para>

            <para>- Voluntary service is a totally different proposition, and no one anticipates receiving very material success from a voluntary Board. In this instance we are dealing with an Institute established under Commonwealth law, and I say definitely and clearly that it was the duty of the Government to have secured the services of the best scientist available, even if it meant sending to other countries. - The problems confronting us are of such importance that we should not refrain from spending money to secure the best men. </para>

            <para>- That is the information I have, and I have verified it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs&#39;</inline> reputation as an. administrator and his scientific qualifications should enable him to carry on the work of that Department with the greatest degree of success, and although it was supposed to be work to which he was unaccustomed, I venture to say that when his record as head of the Bureau of Census and Statistics is compared with corresponding work in other countries, it will not suffer in the slightest. In his new office, I am sure he will discharge his duties with equal distinction, provided he has the support of the Government and of the Parliament. It would appear that the Institute of Science and Industry and the Bureau of Commerce and Industry have done very little up to the present, but that is probably due to the fact that there has been some uncertainty on the part of the Government as to whether Parliament would provide the necessary funds. These proposed votes are before us some time after the Department has been brought into existence, and if there has been any feeling, on the part of the Government or heads of the Departments that Parliament would not- adequately provide for all requirements, I can understand that they have not shown very much activity or yet demonstrated their usefulness. If that is the position, I trust the Government will take an early opportunity of explaining the situation, because the Institute is a very important one to Australia, and I doubt very much if we are likely to make a success of it unless we spend a fairly large sum. </para>

            <para>- It would be appalling if we did not have sufficient means to enable the Institute to function successfully. I should like some assurance from the Minister as to whether he considers that what we have provided here, if passed by this Parliament, will enable the Institute to work up to. the limits indicated in the measures passed by this Parliament. I am inclined to believe that there has been a halt because of the uncertainty of the financial provision Parliament would cjnake. Eeference has been made to the fact that applications have been invited for positions in the Institute, and although the advertisements appeared six months ago, so far as I can understand no selection has been yet made. I trust that before this Bill is disposed of we shall have same assurance that the work of these institutions is not likely to be hampered owing to the uncertainty of financial support, and that tho.y will be able to get to work without any further delay and thus justify the existence of the establishing Statutes which Parliament has passed and the appropriations now sought. </para>

          <para>. - I quite agree with a good deal that has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator John</inline> D. Millen and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> in connexion with this matter. But the present position is not altogether the fault of the Government, because the proposal to appoint two scientists to the Board was received in a hostile manner. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> was appointed to perform the administrative work, and was to have the assistance of two scientists, &#39;but Parliament was not willing, on the grounds of economy, to support such a proposal. Although we advertised for scientists abroad, no appointments have&#39; yet been made, but it is the intention of the Government to make a selection when circumstances permit. In regard to the Bureau of Commerce and Industry I should be glad if honorable senators would visit the office, in order to gain some idea of the volume of international correspondence handled. Manufacturers from all parts of Great Britain and other countries are continually seek ing information concerning the possibility of establishing industries here. A request was received from Queensland for the Director to visit that State to organize the woollen industry, and, as  a  result of his work, which extended over two months, woollen mills valued at &#163;200,000 have been established there. </para>

            <para>- I am not suggesting that ; but the Director -has assisted in organizing manufactories in Australia. I have seen the correspondence in connexion with the work done  in  Queensland, and letters of thanks have been received for the assistance given  in  placing the industry on a sound footing. There are probably hundreds interested in the Queensland woollen mills who do not know anything concerning the manufacture of wool, and the help and advice rendered by the Director has been of great value. In Victoria the woollen mills at Warrnambool. Colac, and Bendigo have been assisted, and before very long we shall have eight or ten mills  in  Victoria, in which probably &#163;1,000,000 of capital will have been invested. The Director of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry has Ibeen largely responsible for stimulating this important work. A good deal of voluntary work is being done in connexion with the Institute. Nearly all the universities in Australia are linked up with it, and the professors give their services freely. I remember that when we were confronted with the mice plague, the best scientists were brought from the Old Country to help us to cope with the difficulty. A man like <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Lefroy</inline> was brought from Great Britain to assist us with all his Indian experience, and yet it was left to a South Australian, I am glad to say, in the person of Professor Hargreaves, to  invent  a system for the destruction of wheat weevil at a cost of less than &#163;d. per bushel, whereas it had cost us from 3d. to 4d. per bushel to deal with the weevil plague under the old system.  I  shall not be- surprised to learn that, as  a  result of that discovery by a South Australian scientist, we have saved wheat to the value of &#163;200,000 since 1915-16. </para>

            <para>- I am glad&#39; to say that both the South Australian and Victorian Governments voted &#163;200 each to this gentleman, and defrayed the cost of the publication of his book describing experiments made in the handling of wheat: We should take off our hats to a man like that. He not only saved our wheat when its destruction was threatened, but he taught us to preserve it by the cheapest system known in the world today. By following his advice, in the construction of. silos with light frames covered with malthoid, and the introduction of the gases necessary to prevent the development of the weevil, it costs only about id. per bushel per annum to preserve our wheat. As the British Government were paying us ^d. per bushel per month to watch their wheat, honorable senators will &#34;see what a valuable discovery this gentleman made. </para>

            <para>- I think &#39;that he received &#163;200 from each of the State Governments of South Australia and Victoria. I do not think that he received by any means adequate remuneration for the service he rendered, and I should personally have been glad to support a proposal that the Commonwealth Government should do something in the matter but for the fact that we do not own any wheat. I think the New South Wales Government might have contributed to the remuneration of this gentleman, as, since they possessed the largest quantity of wheat, they derived a greater advantage from his discovery than did the Governments of Victoria and South Australia. The Institute of Science .and Industry is not a greater success because we have been unable to provide sufficient money for its operations. If we were to vote &#163;20,000 or &#163;25,000 a year for the Institute, it would be given a chance to carry out valuable work. Although the &#34; expenditure would ultimately be repaid ten times over, money is not now readily obtainable, and we cannot vote as much as we should like to do for this purpose. In a modified way, the Institute is doing useful work, and is laying the foundation of what should one day become a great scientific university. We do not want to be behind the rest of the world.. The methods adopted in our farming and other industries are not up to date. Jam has been exported, from Australia which has injured our reputation. I regret to say that some of our millers have allowed, flour to go out of this country which should not have been exported. Such things injure our trade seriously, and I bitterly resent the exportation of inferior products. </para>

Its importance transcends the interests of individuals; and,, speaking generally, it may be said that the. man. who exports* a ton of bad flour, badly canned fruit, or inferior jam, is an enemy to Australia. We want scientific men who are able to show us how to carry on our- industries on up-to-date lines. Our fruit-growers are finding it difficult to dispose of their, fruit because of the prejudice created against our products during the war by the faulty packing of jams, in bulk and&#39; in the ordinary 2-lb. tins. </para>

            <para>- We may be able to do so, but there is evidence that it has not always been done. In connexion with the manufacture of jam, I have seen vegetable marrows and glucose used in the manufacture of jam instead of fruit and sugar. That kind of jam is bound to injure the reputation of the Australian industry. Honorable senators have recently seen press reports of what went on at a factory, not 3 miles away from here. Those controlling that factory did immense injury to our jam trade, and finished up by going insolvent. Honorable senators have no doubt seen the controversy that went on between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lawson,</inline> the Premier of Victoria, and the jam-making company to which I refer. It is a good job that it has gone out of the business, but itf did a lo.t of harm to our trade. I hope that the little scientific organization that we have will be kept going, and that when times become more normal the vote for the Institute will be, not twice, but ten times as&#39; much as we are now able to afford. There are many problems facing the primary producers of Australia in connexion with which we require the aid of scientists. We must have their aid in the investigation of hookworm and of nodules in beef. The British Government have placed an embargo on the importation of shoulders of beef in which there are nodules. It is said that these are not harmful, but in this way Australian producers lose many thousands&#39; of pounds every year. When our wheat was affected by mice and weevil, Americans sent experts to this country to investigate the plagues. </para>

Later on the starch was sold, but the duty which should have been collected on the rice under the Tariff was <inline font-style="italic">nob</inline> collected. The Auditor- </para>
        <para>General brought the matter under the notice of the Trade and Customs Department, and also  under the notice of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department. The Attorney-General&#39;s Department declared that the duty should have been collected, and mentioned the fact that the uncollected duty on rice of this description entering into the manufacture of starch involved a sum of &#163;3,000 up to date. He wrote to the Trade and Customs. Depart- -ment on the subject fully three months before the Auditor-General&#39;s report was published, and yet no answer was supplied. I direct .attention to the fact that there appear to be two authorities interpreting differently the regulations of the Trade and Customs Department. The Trade and Customs Department, by a liberal interpretation of its regulations, decided that no duty should be collected on this rice, whilst the Crown Law Department is of opinion that -duty should have been collected upon it. Do the Customs regulations require re-drafting to enable this duty to be collected? The sum of &#163;3,000 is a .fairly respectable sum to allow the manufacturers of starch to keep if the regulations say that it ought to be paid into the Treasury. </para>
        <para>With respect to the Institute of Science and Industry, if the Government are influenced by feeling in the Senate, they will not be very chary about submitting an adequate vote for this all-important branch of the Trade and Customs Department. If we are to hold our own we cannot afford to ignore the teaching of science in the carrying on of our industries. </para>

            <para>- These are allied forms of government activity which should be under one head. A vote of &#163;16,000 is, comparatively speaking, a paltry vote for this most valuable purpose. Wherever we look in the fields of production in Australia, whether of stock or crops, we find that our industries are attacked on every side by pests and diseases, which require close scientific research if they are to be&#39; overcome. In connexion with stock, for instance, it is found that horses cannot be used with advantage in the tropical  parts of this country. That remark indicates a valuable field of investigation. There are serious troubles which afflict horned stock and sheep. The blowfly is responsible for the destruction of, perhaps, 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 sheep annually. Then, with regard to wheat and fruit, each of these lines of produce has its own problems and troubles, minor and major, which, in the aggregate, involve a serious diminution of the wealth of Australia. I read, some years ago, an article published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> under the heading of &#34; A Romance of Science.&#34; Its purport was that the Bureau of Science in the United States of America had sent a professor to make investigations all along the eastern coast-line of Asia. He returned after two years, and introduced to the blizzard-swept western and northern States a variety of clover, the spread of which was the direct cause of increasing the value of enormous areas of land from so many cents to so many dollars per acre. The Government may be assured that tlie Senate will approve of any expenditure in directions such as those. </para>

The Minister should not have made quite such a sweeping condemnation, for it is hardly fair to the milling firms concerned. They were being besieged by customers, on the one hand, who desired their flour, and, in response, they themselves, on the other hand, were besieging the Wheat Board authorities to let them have wheat for gristing. All they could get was second-quality wheat. </para>

          <para>. - I understand that the new rates of duty in respect of sewing machines are to become operative from the 1st January next. That, at any rate, was provided for by Parliament. I have heard, however, that such will not be the case. I want to know if the new duties will come into operation from the beginning of the New Year, or whether there is to be a further postponement? If the latter course is adopted, it would be well for the Government to make an immediate announcement to that effect. Injustice will be done if&#34; certain parties are given an opportunity to secure undue advantages. </para>

          <para>. -  The money is probably being provided from revenue. The east-west railway has never paid, although an improvement has been recently shown. Most of the money spent in connexion with the railway system was borrowed from what was known as the Trust Loan. That was raised on the security of the surplus gold held in the Treasury. Work upon the line has not yet been completed. Ballasting is still proceeding, and cottages are being erected for workmen, to replace bag huts. In addition, uptodate workshops are being constructed at Port Augusta, so that all necessary repairs may be carried out on the spot. In that direction considerable savings will ultimately be made. </para>

I want to know where the interest upon that money is shown to be charged to revenue. Are we not paying interest upon the expenditure, even though the money may have been raised on the strength of Commonwealth resources? Or are we paying interest upon loan money out of loans? No matter where the money may have been borrowed from, the interest- upon it should be shown by some method of book-keeping. </para>

          <para>. - - I do not desire to be misrepresented. I rose for the purpose of having a suspicion removed, and the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> was able to remove it. When I said that the .Commonwealth had given so much&#39; to South Australia, and had obtained so little in return, I had in mind various deals between the Commonwealth and the State in which South Australia got the best of the bargain. I think it is not only the right, but the duty, of any honorable senator who sees that large sums of money are being expended, to insist upon the fullest details being supplied. This is &#39; particularly so if it is known that the State in which the money is to be spent has been getting much, for little in the past. I am referring particularly to the Northern Territory and the Oodnadatta railway deal. The amount paid in connexion with&#39; the Oodnadatta railway was preposterous. I accepted the Minister&#39;s explanation with satisfaction. I think it is better, even for South Australia, to be outspoken in these matters &#39; than to be harboring suspicions that are not justified. I am glad to know that the Commonwealth Government has control of this railway. I admit, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior,</inline> that iron and steel really do wear out. </para>

            <para>- I understand that the sum of &#163;53,115 represents actually the loss on the railway, without taking &#39;into account replacements or renewals. It seems to me incredible that such a loss as this should be incurred, considering the very limited* service given to the people who use the railway. From Maree to Oodnadatta they get a train once a fortnight, .unless there happens to be a special stock train-. On half the section between Quorn and Oodnadatta the people get only one train a fortnight. </para>

            <para>- The section of  the railway between Port Augusta and Quorn might, for all practical purposes, be cut out. I do not think there can be much loss on that particular section. In view of the great loss on the line as a whole, it is quits evident that further economies are necessary. We have to remember that since last year there has been a very considerable increase in the wages paid to the staff. It is an expensive railway to work, because gangs of men to work the trains have to be taken along with them. Attached to every train is a vehicle in which the men who are off shift sleep. Some means ought to be devised to reduce the loss, and the most effective way would be to extend the railway into the country farther north, so that additional traffic would be obtained, and better returns secured. </para>

          <para>.- It appears to me that more details might have been given by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> so as to allay the justifiable suspicions of some honorable members that the annual loss on this section; of the railway has been allowed to grow ; greater and greater without any effort having been made to stem the tide. The sum of &#163;53,115 is almost equivalent to the total amount of interest that .has to be paid on the loan-money spent in purchasing the line from the South Australian Government. It is a very alarming proposition. If &#163;40,000 of the money has been expended because some unforeseen calamity occurred, it should have been shown separately, so that. honorable members might have known what the annual loss on working the railway would normally amount to. If it was necessary to  put down heavier rails to carry the Port AugustaKalgoorlie express over a section of the railway,- surely, from the point of view of public policy, the Port AugustaKalgoorlie line should be debited- with a share of that expenditure. The Port AugustaOodnadatta line would be justified in debiting to the KalgoorlieiPort Augusta line an annual sum for wear and tear caused to that section of the line over which the Kalgoorlie express runs. A greater loss is shown on this particular section than is justified by the facts, and it will probably militate against any proposal to increase the revenue in future by extending the line. </para>

          <para>. - The Committee may be interested in the figures that are quoted in the report of the Commonwealth Railways for the&#34; year 1920-21. The Port AugustaOodnadatta railway is run by the Railway Commissioner of South Australia for the Commonwealth Government, and we have to accept his figures. On the 30th June, 1919; the excess of working expenses over revenue was &#163;55,075; on the 30th June, 1920, it was &#163;37,481; and on the 30th June, 1921, it was &#163;60,460. Apparently the Commissioner of South Australia has not succeeded in getting good results from the operation of the line, and the transfer of control to Commonwealth management is now under consideration. That may give us better results -in the future. </para>

Recently I had the privilege of travel&#34;ing over a very considerable portion of the interior, and found that the people there were more interested in getting telephone connexion than railway facilities, because they realize that railway connexion in some instances is out of the question. Those who have been living in Central Australia, as well as in the north -western . portious of Queensland and northern parts of Western Australia, deserve the very best consideration it is possible to give them. It is time the Government made some provision in the way of telephone connexions, in order that they may be able to communicate with their nearest neighbour in case of accident or distress of any kind. </para>

Unfortunately, these conveniences have been cut down in recent years. In one district iri my State the people had a better mail service seventy years ago than they have to-day. In some districts a service twice daily has been cut down to once daily, and in others a daily service has been replaced by a service only three times a week. </para>

            <para>- Yes. The district I have in mind is one of the most thriving agricultural areas in Australia. I am continually getting letters complaining of the lack of these facilities. I have just received a communication from one of our best producers in the middle north. He informs me that he went to all the expense of putting up telephone poles through his own paddocks to get connexion with the departmental line, and expected that, as the departmental men were connecting other places in the district, &#39;his property would also be connected. He states, &#34; I did not pay, because tihey did not ask me,&#34; but it appears that the Department has laid it down that only those who lodge pay ment with their application will get a connexion. This gentleman would, of course, have paid had he been asked to do so, because he is a man of substance, and a few pounds would make no difference to him. He simply says that he did not pay because he was not asked to pay, and as a result it isa likely that the departmental linesmen will 6a leaving the district without giving him a connexion. </para>

            <para>- I can assure the Minister that when I get a case like this I go right on. People in the country want more consideration than they are receiving at the hands of the Department. It is all very well for honorable senators to think that we who more directly represent, country constituencies are always harping on this matter. I can assure them thalj- the circumstances demand repeated statements as to the need for improving the telephonic and postal facilities in our country districts. Nothing can be gained by unwise economy in this Department, because it is revenue producing. If the Senate had any authority to increase the vote for this Department I would favour that course. </para>

Queensland is suffering another disadvantage in that there is no direct telephonic connexion between Brisbane and Sydney, as is the case between&#34; the other capital cities of the Commonwealth. This would pay from the outset, because it would connect up the whole of the Queeusland system with Sydney and the other States.

          <para>.- It is probable, I think, that not many honorable senators have noticed the enormous increase in the estimated expenditure this year, as compared with last year, for the conveyance of mails over the railway systems of the various States. In view of the criticism - sometimes not altogether justified - that is so frequently directed against the Federal Parliament for what is termed extravagance, it is as well that the critics should know that the State railway authorities are, to some extent, responsible for the enormous increase in expenditure in the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department this year. I understand that a demand was made on the Federal Government not long ago by the whole of the State railway authorities for a substantial increase in the sum paid for the conveyance of &#39;mails over the railway lines. </para>

          <para>. -  I desire to direct attention to a matter which is of interest to every State, and one in which more businesslike methods should be adopted. According  to  the schedule, the cost of printing telephone directories and lists this year will be, in New South Wales,  &#163;13,000;  Victoria,  &#163;8,000;  Queensland,  &#163;2,000;  South Australia,  &#163;1,200;  Western Australia,  &#163;750;  and Tasmania,  &#163;450;  or a total of  &#163;25,400.  I believe that many snterprising firms in Australia would be prepared to print these directories and lists free of charge if they were given the right to insert certain approved advertising matter. I am not finding fault with the estimated cost, but the Government should seriously consider such a proposal. I have been assured that the bulk of the telephone directories would not be increased, but possibly reduced. I understand an offer has already been made to supply telephone directories to all States in a more convenient form than they are issued  at  present. The American directories, of which ours would be equal to only a section, contain a large number of subscribers, but they are not cumbersome; and it is time an effort was made to improve the present publications. It seems unreasonable to spend  &#163;25,000  a year on a work from which we receive practically no revenue, and I trust the Minister &#39; <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> will bring my suggestion under the notice of the PostmasterGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise).</inline></para>

          <para>. -  As the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> and honorable senators are doubtless aware, frequent references have recently been made to the desirableness of establishing a better system of radio communication for Australia. It has been stated that an agreement which Parliament will be invited to consider has been tentatively arrived at between the Government  and  some outside body, and I should like to  know from the Minister, in -view of the expressed and evident determination to rise this week, whether it is intended to consider that proposal before we adjourn. T understand this matter is of great urgency because of the increasing number of high-power stations which are established throughout the world, all of which adopt what is known as a wave length, peculiar to each particular station, and partly by which a station .calling is identified by other stations. The reason largely why a particular highpower station) appropriates, so to speak, its particular wave length., is that if it happens to adopt the wave length of any other station those two stations are at a considerable disadvantage, and, because they cannot&#39; be accurately heard, are prevented from carrying on proper communication. The resrilt is&#39; that when two stations are .using the same wave length their efficiency is considerably diminished, and in order to secure the best possible result, it is necessary that every station shall have its own wave length. When that has been adopted, it is recognised by every high -power station in the world. There has been, as honorable senators have seen from the propaganda received through the post, a considerable increase in the number of high-power stations, and with each new station established, the opportunity for effective high power work becomes lessened. -If the&#39; Government seriously intend entering into long-distance wireless telegraphy, which I believe they doi, it is absolutely necessary, in the ^ight of reoent development throughout the civilized world, that prompt action should be taken. An announcement has been made concerning some competitive proposal, but it ia the company in respect of which a tentative agreement has been entered into that we are to deal with&#39;. If we are to adjourn for a few months, I can assure &#39;the Minister that the position at the end of that period may be very different than what it is to-day. The &#39; agreement mentioned is in print, and has been circulated among the members of both Chambers, and I presume honorable senators have had the opportunity *of realizing its purpose and effect. If the matter comes before Parliament, it cannot be said that it has been suddenly sprung upon us. During the last twelve months I have received through the post so much matter relating to wireless tele- graphy that it has been impossible for me to read the whole of it. I have not been able to read the whole of the literature sent to me, in common with other honorable senators, on this subject, but what I did read interested me very much, and showed me that every other civilized country in the world is .up and doing in connexion with wireless. There is no country in the world for which wireless would form such an important asset as it would for Australia. Here we are at the very antipodes, in relation to the heart of our own Empire, and we need more frequent and fuller communication with Great Britain. The best, most efficient, and ready-to-hand means for securing that more frequent and fuller communication is a system of wireless telegraphy. It is true that we have cables, but they can carry only a limited amount of traffic. Whilst the charges for cabling have been considerably reduced as the years have gone by, it is </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Btill a very costly means of communication, and if we are to reduce the cost of cabling so as to bring it within the reach of the ordinary individual,, that can only be done by the competition which wireless communication will afford. I hope that the Government will invite the consideration of both Houses to this matter before we disperse for the year. If .a contract has been entered into or the Government propose to enter into a contract, such as that a copy of which was circulated amongst honorable senators last week, I trust that both Houses of this Parliament will be invited to discuss and either, approve or disapprove . of the Government&#39;s proposals in connexion therewith. The matter is of the greatest urgency and importance not alone to Australia, but to the whole of the Empire, of which Australia is a part. </para>

          <para>. - I am sorry that I cannot be -as definite on this matter as I should like to be, particularly in view of the enthusiasm which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> as a good Australian, has displayed. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> made a full statement on the subject of wireless, recently, in another place, and he issued a report upon it. It was his intention to obtain a decision of Parliament on the matter at the earliest possible moment. We may be said to have reached normal times now, and Par- liament should be consulted before the &#176; Government enters into these contracts. So far as I understand the matter, it is proposed that the Commonwealth Government is to be a partner in the undertaking, with practically the power of veto in regard to the expenditure of capital for extensions without our consent. It is not correct to say that the Commonwealth is to be represented by a majority of directors, but it is to be endowed with powers sufficient to safeguard our interests. What is suggested is not the system which was favoured in Great Britain. As that system carried no rights or privileges outside the British Empire, it is considered that it is .not good enough for Australia. We wish to be able to communicate with any part of the world. After consideration of rival schemes and suggestions, the Government .have decided to recommend to Parliament the adoption of a particular scheme. The Prime Minister has already given publicity to the matter in the statement which he made in another place. I am confident that he intends that the proposals made shall reach finality ; and I believe that he desires that before we break up for the session Parliament shall be given an opportunity to express an opinion upon the proposals. I will consult with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> iE.  D. Millen on the .matter, and see in what way the Senate may be given an opportunity to consider the proposals as they will be submitted in another place. </para>

I should like to know what is the position of the Commonwealth and the State Governments when discoveries are made of bubonic patients or bubonic rats. Honorable senators who! come from Tasmania are naturally very much interested in this question. For some years&#39; past, and at about this time of the year, (there has been interruption of communication between Tasmania and the mainland. I should like to know whether the Health Department has in view the adoption of measures tol prevent the spread of bubonic plague that may seriously interfere with communication and transport between the one island State and the rest of the Commonwealth. There is considerable apprehension on the part of &#39; those who, because of bitter and repeated experience, know what it is to go through a maritime strike at this time of the year. I should like to have some assurance from the Minister that Tasmania&#39;s many sufferings in this connexion in the past are not likely to be added to by any  action which the Commonwealth Health Department may take in the near future. We recognise that it is necessary that the health of the whole community of Australia should be preserved, but we hope that in any arrangements to be made the Government will see to it that Tasmania shall suffer as little as possible.

            <para>- That should be <inline font-style="italic">its</inline> aim,, but we know &#39; that on previous occasions seme Health Departments in Australia have inflicted actual suffering and loss on residents of Tasmania altogether out of proportion to, and unjustified by, the objects they had in view. I hope that in this regard the Commonwealth Government will be mindful of the interests of the different States, and particularly of Tasmania, in considering the inhibitions which it may be deemed necessary to impose on Inter-State commerce and communication by sea. </para>

          <para>. -  I am informed by the head of the Health Department that quite recently an Inter-State Conference was held to consider the present position. The Commonwealth Department is offering advice and assisting the State Departments of Health as much as possible. Special consideration has been given to the importance of continuous cbmmunicatlon and transport between the States. A programme has been specially drawn up, and it  i9  &#39;hoped tha? the organization will result in increasing, rather than diminishing, the facilities for transport. The interruption of shipping and railway transport due to quarantine regulations is a very serious matter, and we hope that we shall&#39; not in this regard have a repetition of the experiences of the past. The whole of the State  Departments are now well organized, and if they stand up to their responsibilities they may confidently look for the fullest co-operation pf the Commonwealth Health Department. We cannot guarantee what the State Departments will do, But I have confidence that they will co-operate to meet the common danger. We all earnestly pray that there will be no serious extension of the. plague, and in the meantime we shall do cur best in the interests of Australia. </para>

          <para>. -  I notice that in connexion with this Department the expenditure for the Northern Territory and Queensland is under the one heading. I presume that the reason is that the Quarantine Depart- 0 ment in the Northern Territory is controlled from Queensland, but I rather regret that the expenditure in each place is not kept separately, so that we might ascertain tihe cost of health admini-  stratton in the Northern Territory. I am reminded that, in company with, several others, I had the misfortune to be detained for nine days unnecessarily and unjustifiably, I believe, at the Quarantine Station, near Port Darwin. While I do not take exception to the quarantine law, I do find fault with the arrangements. Several sites were suggested originally for0 the station, and all except one were on the mainland. It was decided to select an island in the bay, and a more unsuitable place could hardly be imagined. This island is about 12 miles from the Port Darwin jetty, and in stormy weather it is impossible to approach it. The buildings are well equipped, and no exception could be taken to the treatment which we received there from the quarantine officials. Throughout my sojourn on the island the weather was uniformly good. A sick lady who was detained at the station had to be removed to and from the motor launch in a dingy. A small one was employed to convey people from the rocky beach to the launch. An attempt has been made to construct a jetty, and it has been placed in the wrong position. The sick woman almost died of fright as she was being removed from the island. Darwin is recognised as the front door for the East, and, in the event of any epidemic being introduced from Asia, great difficulty would be experienced in transporting people to the Quarantine Station. The island itself is a barren, rocky place. One could not walk for more than 100 yards in any direction. Recreation for those detained there is out of the question. Sand flies and mosquitoes are very troublesome. I hope the Government will immediately do something to improve the conditions at the station. Instead of one or two ships a month calling at Darwin, as at present, I hope that in a few years there will be thirty or forty. At present it is quite impossible to go to or from the Quarantine Station quickly and comfortably. The station should be removed to . the mainland, where it would be more convenient, and where ample precautions  could be taken to isolate the people under detention. The station at Thursday Island is far more conveniently situated. </para>

          <para>. - I do not rise for the purpose of. delaying the Senate in accepting, as I trust and believe it will, the motion proposed by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen).</inline> As the honorable gentleman has pointed out,, a similar set of circumstances arose previously in con- nexion with, the Tariff. &#34;The first- occasion was in  1902,  when a message * was received from the House of Representatives, somewhat similar to .that which the  President  has read. Upon the receipt of that message a resolution was -passed by the Senate, couched in terms similar to those now proposed by the Minister. &#39;The procedure was repeated in  1908,  in connexion with the  1907-1908  Tariff. What we are now asked to do is to re-affirm what the Senate said in similar circumstances in  1902.  No one realizes more than I do how important it  i3  that this &#39; Tariff shall be disposed of as early as possible. The House of Representatives, in its message, expresses its realization of the urgency of the master. It would ill -become me or the Senate to delay the Tariff by any unnecessary constitutional discussion, but it is desirable that we should assert our position again, as it was asserted before. I believe, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> that the Constitution is behind us in the attitude we take up. As the  President  has stated, on at least two other occasions in the past the Senate reiterated its requests to another place to insert amendments in a Bill which the Senate could not constitutionally amend, and the other place acceded to these reiterated requests, without even a protest or a suggestion of difficulty such as is embodied in the message now under consideration. Therefore, I think that, apart from the Constitution, the practice between the two Houses is established in relation to Bilk which stand constitutionally in the sapie position as a Tariff Bill. Any one who reads the debates at the  1891  and  1897-8  Conventions upon this particular provision of the Constitution, clause  53,  or the corresponding provision in the original draft, will see that the position of the Senate was sought to be secured, and was believed to be secured. I think the position of the Senate was actually in law and in fact secured by the framers of the Constitution. </para>

            <para>- The debates in the Conventions, and the notes which were supplied upon the financial clauses by the late Chief Justice of the Common wealth, who was a member of the  1891  Convention,-.but not of the  1897-1898  Convention, clearly show that the object which the majority of the Conventionists sought to achieve in regard&#39; to financial clauses, was that this Chamber should not stand in the position of any second Chamber in Australia as the Parliaments, were &#39;then constituted; that in regard to money matters the Senate should have powers far beyond those enjoyed by Legislative Councils in the State Parliaments, the fundamental reason being that it was to be a Chamber popularly elected. It was to be a Chamber in which the States, especially the smaller States, would have unbounded confidence, because of its power to prevent their finances from being seriously interfered with by any legislative action- of this Parliament. I agree with the motion submitted by the- Minister, and congratulate him upon the course he has taken. I sincerely hope that the Senate, without a dissentient voice, will adopt the motion.  </para>

          <para>- And I do not blame honorable members there for not mentioning it. It is because of their failure to do so that I refer to it now. The proposal that the Senate should have the  Tight  &#34;once&#34; to request an amendment of a money Bill was specifically struck out. It is clear, therefore, that the framers of the Constitution had in mind just such a set of. circumstances as has larisen. The defeat of the proposal  in the Convention was eloquent testimony to the &#39;truth of this statement. May I make one other observation? The adoption of my motion will not dispose of the matter, lt seems to me&#39; that, if we delay consideration of this difficulty until some important matter is actually in dispute,  there will be very little hope of any final settlement. It would be infinitely better, in my judgment, if, at a time when there is no important principle &#39; aj issue, the two Houses should confer in an endeavour to arrive at some definite solution of what is an important difference of opinion. 1 shall endeavour, so far as it lies with me, to see that, when the Houses re-assemlble, early in the new session some steps are taken by which an arrangement such as I indicate may be arrived at, clearly setting out the respective rights of the toyo Houses. </para>

Neither, I presume, is another place; hut I suibmit that it would be better, by means of some such conference, to have a definite acknowledgment of the rights of the Senate. . The method provided in the Constitution is extremely faulty and cumbersome; it is like using a steam hammer to crack a nut. I shrink from the final possibilities of a continued dispute .between the two Houses. A deadlock must lead to a dual dissolution. </para>

          <para>. - I trust honorable senators will pay some attention at least to one portion of the resolution passed by the House of Representatives, namely, &#39; &#39; having regard to the fact that the public welfare demands the early enactment of the Tariff.&#34; The other House <inline font-style="italic">recognises fully</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">ir&#38;nlcly</inline> the need for an early finalization of the Tariff, and the Senate, its constitutional rights not now being involved, should adopt the same attitude. We sent down eleven requests. To three of them the House of Representatives agreed absolutely, to others it agreed with certain modifications, and to six it disagreed. There has been substantial gain for the views of this Chamber by the interchange of communications&#39;, and I think those honorable senators who supported the requests may congratulate themselves upon the result of their efforts. I propose now to ask the Committee, in view of the fact that several of its requests have &#39;been agreed to, to no longer press the remain-  ing points in dispute. It will be necessary, in order to conform with the procedure of this Chamber, to deal with the items seriatim; but I think it would simplify matters if I informed the Committee of the general terms of my motion, and that is that we should no longer press the points outstanding between the two Chambers. In this item the Senate requested a reduction in the British preferential Tariff from 22-^ per cent, to 15 per cent., the intermediate Tariff from 30 per cent, to 25 per cent., and the general Tariff from 35 per cent, to 30 per cent. The House of Representatives has now made the British preferential Tariff 20 per cent., and has agreed to the Senate&#39;s request in the intermediate and general Tariffs. I move, therefore - That the modification be agreed to. </para>

          <para>. -  I am reluctant to be in opposition to another place, especially on the first item. These duties relate to agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural machinery, and the British preferential Tariff now is only 2&#163; per cent, lower than as originally fixed by the House of Representatives, whereas this. Committee requested a reduction of <inline font-style="italic">1\</inline> per cent. If the British preferential rate of 15 per cent, remain?, that is ample protection for local industries. We ha.ve to remember that it is protection against our own kith and kin, against our own race, and protection against the articles which Britain produces. We ha.ve to consider Australia first; but when it becomes a question of protecting Australian interests, we shall have to look after the whole of Australia, and not only one portion. The primary producers do not get any protection from the Tariff, and should be allowed to trade where they like within the Empire at a reasonable rate. If I were advocating my Free Trade principles on this occasion, I would not expect much support; but I am not going to that extent this time. Surely 15 per cent, for Great Britain is ample, seeing that it is more than the Protectionists asked for in the first, second, and third Tariffs, and it is only now, when Britain is getting back to normal, that we are going to make trade more difficult. If ever there was a time in history when conditions of trade between Great Britain and Australia should be made easier it is now. I shall &#171;all for a division, if I stand alone, so that the limelight may again be thrown upon me. The difference between 20 per cent, and <inline font-style="italic">12\</inline> per cent, is not great, and that between 22&#163; per cent, and 15 per cent., is of little account when we view the distance that goods have to be brought. This is the first shot, and I shall be interested to &#39; see how some act under fire. </para>

          <para>. - I do not think the schedule circulated to honorable senators makes the position very clear. The original, duties passed by the House of Representatives were 22&#163; per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per cent, respectively, upon which we requested a reduction to 15 per cent., 25 per cent., and 30 per cent. The House of Representatives did not accede to that request when first made, and this modification ia now submitted, &#34; Duty made 20 per cent. British preferential Tariff.&#34; We asked for a reduction to 15 per cent. </para>

          <para>. -  I do not intend to &#34; back and fill &#34; on this matter. The question has already been fully debated. Sinoe the Tariff was last before us, I have discussed this item with a large manufacturer in the Commonwealth, who is satisfied that the rates suggested by the Senate are fair. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said that the difference is not great, but a difference of 5 per cent, is too much, particularly when one realizes that much of the plant mentioned in this item is imported from Great Britain. Many imported machines must be used by agriculturists; because better results ere achieved, particularly those used for destroying insect life. The pests in some districts are causing such destruction that machines to eradicate them should be admitted free of duty, not only to benefit those directly concerned, but in the interests of the whole community. I am not adhering to my previous attitude with the idea of creating difficulties between the two Chambers, but in an endeavour to do what I consider right. </para>

          <para>.  -  I am sure a thrill of pride passed through every honorable senator when the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> made his hold declaration, which was a credit to the Chamber and also to himself, that we should, like the rock of ages, stand firm to our constitutional rights and privileges; but in the next breath he asked us to stand on that rock in a limp and helpless fashion. If the Minister had given us a couple of days, we might have forgotten his first utterance; but his latest attitude now robs his first declaration of its chivalry and boldness. This is an important item, and I direct attention to the fact that what we are asked to agree to is a preference of 5 per cent, between the duties to be imposed on goods coming from the Old Country and those which may be imported from other countries by means of reciprocal relations under the intermediate Tariff. There is a difference of only 5 per cent., which is certainly a striking departure from the policy previously laid down when a wider differentiation was agreed to. Honorable senators realize with regret that the outlook for primary producers is anything but favorable, and the position is even worse than it was when we first discussed this item, because the value of farm products has fallen considerably. In view of the unsatisfactory conditions prevailing, and the hard times generally being experienced by primary producers, there is no occasion to further burden them by unnecessary Tariff imposts. I believe, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> that we should stand firm and support the Minister on the constitutional aspect in connexion with this item. Surely this gives us an opportunity to do what the Minister invited us to do. In relation to certain other items to follow, we may not have the same justification for^ standing behind the Minister. This is where we should make our stand, and support the Minister in his bold and statesman-like declaration. </para>

          <para>. -  The merits and demerits of this question have been well discussed, and on its merits the Committee has already arrived at the decision. The position is exactly as it was when the item was last before us; and as our previous decision was a well-considered one, we should adhere to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> said that the outlook for the man on the land is even worse than it was when we first considered the imposition of high duties on implements required by those engaged in our rural areas. I wish to -direct attention to one sentence used by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> when asking us to give way on this item. He said that the early adoption of the Tariff was desired. The other House has pointed out that the early adoption of the Tariff is desired, and it incorporated those words in the message sent here for our consideration. I^too, believe that; and if honorable members in another place held that opinion the way was perfectly clear. They had merely to give way and the Tariff would have been adopted; but instead of doing that they are standing fast, and are not even prepared to compromise. </para>

            <para>- Most of our requests have been agreed to by another place, and others have been sent back with modifications, which, if we are men of ordinary intelligence and sagacity, we shall agree to. The other House has met the Senate in a compromising spirit, and it is our duty to meet another place in a similar spirit. It is our duty as sensible members of a Legislature not to provoke a quarrel with the other House, but to accept its modifications of our requests with which it has not agreed. I support the attitude of the Minister, not only in regard to the item now under consideration, but in regard to the other requests of the Senate with which the House of Representatives has- disagreed. </para>

          <para>. - I appeal to honorable senators to consider that another place having, as we have contended, recognised the powers of the Senate, and having decided hot to assert its own from a mere wilful desire to do . so, we should not further press our requests with which the House of Representatives has disagreed. Whatever powers the Senate or any other parliamentary Chamber possesses, they will be continued to it by the people only if they are well and wisely exercised. If the Senate exercises its powers in the spirit by which the nigger pilot was animated when he told the crew of a vessel to let down the anchor merely in order to have the pleasure of ordering them to pull it up again, the common sense of the community will soon deprive it of those powers. There is no question that the other House has recognised the right of the Senate to make requests, and having exercised that right there is no reason why we should now refuse to consider the views expressed in another place. The bi-cameral system can only be operated on the assumption that both Houses will endeavour to exercise their powers in a reasonable spirit of compromise. I say that another place has gone a good way to meet us, and honorable senators should now display a similar spirit. I wish now only to mention some additional .reasons why honorable senators should, accept the motion I have submitted. I direct their attention to the fact that the proposal which another place now asks us to accept does not represent an increase of duty on the articles included in the item under consideration, because 20; per cent, is the duty &#34;which has prevailed in connexion with this item since 1914, and I am not certain that it was no.t in operation prior to that date. All that another place asks in this matter is that we should not reduce the measure of protection previously enjoyed by the manufacturers of these implements in Australia. I think that I may, with some prospect of success, appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> in this matter, because the honorable senator was one of fhe Ministers who introduced the Tariff of 1914 under which these implements were made dutiable at 20 per cent. </para>

            <para>- If I were the honorable senator I would not offer an explanation in reply to a mere statement of fact that he was a very distinguished  and energetic member of the Government that introduced the Tariff of 1914. I am aware that that Tariff -was not discussed by either House of this Parliament, but that does not relieve the members of the Government of that time of the responsibility of introducing it. It must be quite clear to honorable senators that every item in that Tariff was placed under a powerful magnifying glass by the industrious <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> as well as by other members of the Cabinet, and that, as submitted to Parliament, it embodied <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> firm conviction that 20 per cent, on these implements was a reasonable duty to impose. The House of Representatives in this instance is not, 1 think, asking too much when it invites this Committee to continue the rate of duty on this item which was adopted in 1914. </para>

            <para>- It must be remembered that when the Tariff of 1914 was introduced there&#39; was a war on, and as it was more important that I should remain a .member of the Government for war purposes  than for anything else, I remained in the Government. The Tariff was, at the time, a matter of comparatively little importance, and neither House of this Parliament discussed it.

But the question which we have to consider is whether we should compromise -with another place on this item. The original proposal of the House of Representatives was to give Great Britain a preference of <inline font-style="italic">1%</inline> per cent, against, possibly, Canada and New Zealand, under the intermediate Tariff, and of 12&#163; per cent, against Germany and outside nations under the general Tariff. If we accept the amend ment now proposed by another place, Great Britain will be given a preference of only 5 per cent, against the Dominions taking advantage of the intermediate Tariff and of 10 per cent, against Germany. There are still a few persons who believe in giving consideration to Great Britain, but if the Committee accepts the amendment now proposed, Great Britain will be worse off in connexion with this item than honorable senators desire according to their original request. </para>

            <para>- I believe it would be better to withdraw the original request of the Senate so far as Great Britain is concerned. The Minister wants sweet  reasonableness to prevail between the two Houses, and I should like to know what his idea of sweet reasonableness is. On the hundreds of items included in the Tariff we sent ninety requests to another place. I venture to say that a majority of those requests covered amendments which were desired by the Government. I will not say that they were moved by the Government, but we know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> who, unfortunately, is not now a member of the Senate, submitted requests which the Government gave him to submit. When our requests were sent back a second time how were they treated by another place? Any reasonable body of men would say that as the Constitution gives the Senate certain rights it is surely entitled, particularly in dealing with a Tariff of so much importance, to suggest amendments in twenty items, especially in view of the fact that those items concern the primary producers. We are dealing now with a primary producers&#39; item. It is the implements the primary producer uses that are to be taxed, and I ask the Committee to stand to its twice expressed opinion. I hope that honorable senators will view this matter from the primary producers&#39; point of view, and will not give way upon it. </para>

          <para>. - When the Senate agreed to 460 or 470 items of the Tariff passed by another place, it must be admitted that we treated its proposals respectfully. A difference on ninety items constituted the measure of difference between the two Houses, and of that number, in the case of a majority of a most insignificant character the requests of the Senate were accepted by another place. The Minister has mentioned that we must determine this matter to set the mind of the business community at rest. We must consider it in a reasonable frame of mind. We have done that on several occasions, or we should otherwise have stood firmly by our original requests. I hope that we shall be given credit for that. That conciliatory spirit in connexion with many items brought this Chamber much closer to the other. I say that we should stand firm on an item like this, though, as I have said, I shall be prepared in connexion with some items yet to be considered to again adopt the conciliatory course and alter my mind. </para>

          <para>. - I wish to say how much I appreciate the consistency of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen).</inline> I have not forgotten that when I asked the honorable senator whether he proposed to support all the proposals sent from another place, he said that he did. Honorable senators will recollect that the Minister asked the Committee to agree to the course adopted by the House of Representatives in connexion with every one of our original requests. But I find that many of the proposals upon which honorable senators in their wisdom insisted were subsequently accepted by another place, which goes to show that the Minister was wrong in the attitude which he took up. Honorable senators must have been very much surprised at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benny&#39;s</inline> appeal to &#34; sensible &#34; members of the Committee. That is my reply as to who are the &#34; sensible &#34; members of this Committee. Many honorable senators have given a great deal of consideration to the Tariff, and have been able to bring to bear their practical knowledge of the agricultural industry, so it is too late in the day to say that we have not dealt with the question in a business-like way. lt has been a fight against great odds, and the Minister has been our greatest stumbling block. I appreciate his advocacy, and, had it not been for that, the other Chamber would not have achieved as much as it has. I shall not follow the Minister on this occasion, but shall adhere to the decision which the Committee has twice previously arrived at after thorough consideration. </para>

We  are  first told to hoist the flag of constitutional independence, and then in the next breath we are asked to haul  down that flag. The reduction of duty requested by the Senate was carried in opposition to the Minister in this Chamber <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E.</inline> D. Millen). I can recall instances where the Minister in the other Chamber <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> said he proposed to accept the requests of the Senate. We have to go to the other House to get a champion of the Senate. We have not a champion in the Minister in this Chamber.

            <para>- The Minister may qualify it as he likes. I intend to call for a division again. Honorable senators should stand to their guns. I hope the day will come when the present Government will be hurled from the Treasury benches for this iniquitous Tariff, and I say that despite the fact that I have supported the Government. I hope the Government . will be tried on this issue, because they are absolutely ruining  4he  industries of Australia. The Tariff as brought down, and the declared intention of the Government as pronounced by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> at Bendigo, are as like one another as the darkest night resembles the noonday sun. There were reams of references in the speech at Bendigo to the necessity for rural production, and there was only a brief reference to the necessity&#39; for a Protective Tariff ; but here we have a Tariff which, in its incidence, gives au average protective duty which is heavier than the economic and industrial conditions of the Commonwealth warrant. Population is constantly drifting from the countries to the cities. Protective duties have been passed in the interests of industries which have never asked for such protection. I say again that I hope this Government - Nationalist Ministry though it is - will have to stand its trial, and will be removed from the Treasury benches for what it has done in connexion with this Tariff, and I am prepared to assist in the Government&#39;s undoing. &#39;Western Australia,  which I represent, and which has sacrificed so much in the past, is -given no advantages whatever - completely  ignored. I recognise the necessity to make a reasonable adjustment; hut when privilege after privilege is given, unasked and unsolicited, to certain industries, the&#39; Government ought to pay the full penalty. Although on some minor items I am prepared to give way, there are several vital matters in connexion with which the Senate should stand resolute. I shall not be a party to swallowing the whole of the Government&#39;s proposals. </para>

          <para>.- No one can have appreciated <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> attitude mort than I have. As I voted in opposition to him on the last division, I desire to explain, in justice to myself, that I am not one to hoist the flag to-day and haul it down to-morrow. I profess to have a reasonable amount of common sense. When this item first came before us for consideration, the aggregate  duties were 87&#163; per cent. We sent- the schedule back to the House of- Representatives, with the aggregate reduced to 70 per cent., and the modification now made by the other Chamber is . that the duties should total 75 per cent. What more can we hope to gain if we press the requests and obtain a conference? Even at a conference neither side can maintain its ground, and it is only possible to get an agreement by a compromise. I consider that we have received an offer of a very satisfactory compromise, and that is the reason why I reversed my vote on the last division. I stood with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> on this item in the early stages of the Tariff discussion, but when a compromise is offered which gives us more than we can possibly get at a conference, we ought to accept it. I felt that, in justice to myself, I ought to explain why I have supported the Government to-night. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> must recognise that the Minister cannot carry his motion unless he . has a majority of the Committee behind him. </para>

          <para>. - The Senate requested, with regard to wire of No. 16 or finer gauge, that the duties should be British preferential, 20 per cent., instead of 25 per cent. The other House has accepted that. The other proposition was that the coarser wire should be 44s. per ton, as against 52s. As the other House has accepted one of our requests, and has declined the other, and as the one it has declined would have placed the same duty upon the manufactured article as upon the raw material, I think the Senate made a mistake in connexion with that item.

          <para>.  - This Stem deals with the postponed duty on vessels built outside Australia. The date on which the duty was to be imposed was set down in the measure as it first reached .the Senate as the 1st January, 1923. The. Senate requested that tlie date should be two years later. Tihe other House met us by making the date 1st July, 1923, which was an extension of six months on their original proposal. In dealing with this item in another place, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> stressed the fact that it was merely a postponed duty, and that if circumstances justified a further postponement the machinery was in existence by which the postponement could be effected.

            <para>- It was mentioned when this item was first before the Committee, and I pointed out on that occasion that there was some misconception as to how the Tariff Board would function in regard to these deferred duties. The original decision was that the duty should become operative on the 1st January, 1923. The Senate unanimously, with the concurrence of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> requested that the duties should become operative on the 1st January, 1925. It may be said that the House of Representatives met us by deferring the operation of the duties, not for two years, but for six months. The history of the original proposal, and the &#39; requests with regard to it is, I think, sufficient justification for the Senate now insisting upon its request. </para>

          <para>. -  Although not a representative of one of the smaller States, I appeal to other honorable senators, and especially those representing States that are not well served by coastal railway systems, to realize what these prohibitive duties mean to the primary producers whom they represent. It will be almost impossible, once these duties become operative, to get vessels at a reasonable cost for the carriage of our primary products. Of course, it may be said that we oan build the ships in Australia, but I remind honorable senators of the significant statement made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> only a few days ago, that the cost of building ships in Australia is about &#163;24 per ton, speaking from memory, as against &#163;12 in other parts of the world. </para>

            <para>- I wish other countries would dump our harbors full of ships. Our primary producers would then be able to get their primary products marketed at a reasonable cost. New South Wales is well served by a coastal railway system, linking up the producing areas with the great centre of. Sydney; but South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania are not in such a favorable position. Tasmania is especially at a serious disadvantage. It is about time the Government of that State took steps to become independent of the Commonwealth Government so far as shipping facilities are concerned. I hope honorable senators will support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> We want cheap vessels for the conveyance of our primary products to the best markets. The policy of this Government, as indicated in this Tariff, appears to be to protect the secondary industries at all costs, even at the expense of crushing the primary producers. Unheard-of duties have been imposed; but on no occasion has any concession been given to those engaged in primary production. </para>

            <para>- That is the cause of the trouble. The time charters are an important feature in our_coastal trade. I understand that vessels are bringing down .sugar from Queensland on time charters, and that, if these exceed three months, -the vessels will be dutiable as if they were imported. The same conditions prevail in the Western Australian coastal trade, and as the cattle trade in the north-west runs into a period of six months, at least, the difficulty there is very pronounced. Until we have an absolute assurance that vessels can be built in Australia on a profitable basis, this Parliament is not warranted, by means of these Tariff duties, in compelling shipowners to get their vessels built here. </para>

Members of this Chamber hold representative positions, and I am satisfied that if anything will appeal to their constituents it is consistency on such matters as this. I regret very much that there is- a disposition to give way, but- 1 am not going to lecture the Senate, on that issue, though I think they would, preserve the dignity of this Chamber if they stood by their former decision. We know that the duties imposed by another place have already lost to us the trade of Eiji at a time when trade is very badly needed. I cannot understand honorable senators supporting a proposal which involves sacrificing our trade with the islands, and that is what we are doing by refusing to take their products in return for ours. While we continue to do that, we cannot expect to progress ; but, as I suppose the present action is in accord with the policy of the Government to destroy trade, it is all we can expect. </para>

We are being asked to agree to a duty which is considerably higher, than the cost of producing other fruits.

Having been in the trade for twenty years, I can speak with some confidence of the quantities imported into Australia, and they could all be carted away in a handcart. </para>

This duty represents the way in which some persons are prepared to manifest that desire. It represents absolute prohibition of the importation of bananas from Fiji or Java. I have explained that Western Australia does not obtain bananas from Queensland, but from Java.

          <para>- BROCKMAN. - I say that Queensland has been given more consideration in every respect than has been given to the State that I have the honour to represent, although per head of population Western Australia contributes more to the revenue of the Commonwealth than does any other State. When I ask for a little consideration for the people of that State, who desire to obtain bananas, I am told that they must be denied that consideration in order to bolster up an industry which was already well established and flourishing under a duty less than one-fourth of the duty now proposed. That is what representatives of Queensland desire, and it is being connived at by the Government of Australia. The Government is prepared to tax the people of the State I represent in order to placate the banana-growers of Queensland. Queensland senators, the Government, and the House of Representatives do not care what becomes of the trade between Western Australia and Java,, or between Australia and Fiji, although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has assured the people of America that it is our determination to foster and develop trade, with the Pacific Islands. I shall vote on this item as I have done throughout the consideration of the Tariff, as I have not heard one argument to justify the Committee in altering the decision it previously expressed. </para>

            <para>- I throw that back in the teeth of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll.</inline> I am not an advocate of black labour. I a,m opposed to levying unnecessary burdens on. the people of Australia. That this particular burden is unnecessary&#34; is proved by the fact that, as originally introduced by the Government, the Tariff proposed a duty of 2s. 6d. per cental on bananas as against the duty of ls. 6d. per cental under the previous Tariff. When the increased duty proposed was jumped up in the House of Representatives to 8s. 4d. per cental, honorable senators were perfectly justified in asking for further consideration of this item. This Committee submitted a reasonable compromise, and suggested that the duty should be fixed at 4s. 2d. per cental. Our request was returned without any modification. I am prepared at any time to meet another place if it offers a fair compromise. We could expect no more if a Conference was held between the two Houses. But honorable members in another place have decided not to compromise on this item and to insist on a duty of 8s. 4d. per cental, which will impose an iniquitous burden on the people of Australia for the benefit of the banana-growers of Queensland. I am satisfied that they never anticipated that such a high duty would be imposed. </para>

            <para>- That is so. I will not be a party tq imposing on the people of Australia such unnecessarily high duties, at a time when it is as much as they can do to make ends meet. I am able from experience to indorse what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> concerning the quality of bananas which are to be obtained to-day. I have bought some which looked well, but were not fit for consumption. I point out that the cultivation of bananas does not demand the persistent care and attention that is demanded for the cultivation of apples and pears. I shall again support the duty of 4s. 2d. per cental to which the Committee agreed, especially in view of the fact that on a very much lower duty the banana industry was established and carried on successfully for many years in New South Wales and Queensland. </para>

          <para>.- I am firmly of the opinion that this item ought to be further considered. The Ministry desire explosives from Great Britain to be admitted free. If there is any industry that deserves some consideration it is this one. I listened with admiration to the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> regarding the action of the other Chamber in reducing the Defence Esti mates, but the wiping out of th&#171; duty on explosives, which are the very materials required for defence, leaves this industry to the mercy of foreign competition. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> has put forward the plea that the mining industry of Australia must be considered. </para>

            <para>- T - The Government t are afraid that, by giving protection to this industry, the miners would to some extent be penalized.. Where, I ask, are the- -advocates of the primary producers of Australia? Surely they will not remain silent oar this one item! I agree with those honorable senators who declare that the mining industrv must be protected as far as the safety of the miners is concerned, but- there is ample evidence that the explosives produced in Australia are oxf a quality which makes them perfectly satisfactory. If the only objection to granting a duty on this industry is that it would penalize miners, it is a lame argument, indeed. The Tariff offers encouragement to practically every other industry, and why should protection be refused in this instance? If Australia had to defend itself, it might be shut off from supplies of explosives, apart from those manufactured in this country. </para>

          <para>. - I agree with the view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain</inline> that we should make every possible effort to secure the stability of this industry in Australia. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> do not wish to run the risk of an absolute deadlock between the two branches of the Legislature. It may, of course, ultimately lead to a double dissolution, and an expenditure of, probably, &#163;100,000 on an election. I do not desire to go to that extreme. I realize that it is most important to have explosive factories in Australia, not only in connexion with the defence of the country, but al!so in the interests of the miners, on- whose behalf some- honorable senators are advocating the abolition of the duty. In discussing these questions, orie cannot know what duty is- really necessary to- keep the industry going. We are assured - by those rotho are interested in &#39;the industry, I .admit - that a duty is absolutely imperative if the industry is to continue to exist. The only satisfaction I have is that an inquiry will be held by the Tariff Board to ascertain whether it is imperative- that those duties shall be continued. I do not quite understand the position of the other branch of the Legislature if the statements nhat have been made are correct, that one of the most important industries to any nation will be abolished by their action. I do not want to be too emphatic in my protest against the decision of the other branch of the Legis ts&#93;- 2 * lature, and I desire the Chairman&#39;s direction as to- whether I can move to amend our previous request. We ihave given way to all the demands made by the other &#39;brandh of the Legislature except this, and <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> is reasonable to suppose, I think, that if we show a spirit of sweet compromise by reducing the requested duties by 5 per cent. , which is certainly material, the other branch of the Legislature will acquiesce. The proposal will not embarrass the Government or Parliament very much. I recognise that it is the wish of Parliament to rise at the end of this week, and that members are reluctant to continue the cross-fire between the two Houses. It should be remembered that if this industry is discontinued the miners will have to depend upon the imported article. They will have to take what they can get, and pay the prices demanded. We have no control over the manufacturers of South Africa or of any other country where explosives may be made, but we can exercise control over a manufacturer at Deer Park. Seeing &#39;the importance of the industry to Australia, I believe the other branch of the Legislature will agree to- an amended request. I desire to move that our request be amended by making the duties in the first sub-item, British preferential, 10 per cent., intermediate, 15 per cent.; and general, 25 per cent., and that explosives not elsewhere included, shall be subject to duties of British <inline font-style="italic">1\</inline> per cent., and intermediate and general 12^ per cent. The House of .Representatives, by recognising our right to repeat our request, have .acknowledged that we have that^ right. </para>

There is no doubt in my mind that the  Speaker  was wrong. At any rate, the other place decided by resolution that they would receive our repeated requests, and would deal with them forthwith. I can see no reason why they should not again receive our further request and deal with it in the same spirit. </para>

          <para>. - As far as I can recall the debates that took place on this subject on a previous occasion, there were two main questions. The first was whether we could manufacture the article in Australia, and the second was whether the duties would place an undue burden on the mining industry. . As to the first point, I am assured that we actually manufacture, sell, and supply from 58 to 60 per cent, of the explosives used in the mining industry in Australia. </para>

            <para>- I am assured that they are in a position to supply the whole of the explosives used in Australia. Prior to the war, when the consumption of explosives was very much greater than it is to-day, there was a proposal to remove the Factory from Footscray to Sydney, in order to conduct operations on a much greater scale,- but owing to a decline in the mining industry that project has fallen through. I am assured, however, that the Factory at Footscray is able to cope with the whole of Australia&#39;s demands. By dividing the item, we have fairly met &#39; the criticism that the gold-mining industry would be unduly oppressed. As the item came to us originally, it was &#34; Explosives, n.e.i.,&#34; free in the British preferential Tariff, and 5 per cent, in the intermediate and general Tariffs. We requested that it be split up by placing coal-getting explosives in the permitted list with duties <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> 15 per cent. British, 20 per cent, intermediate, and 25 per cent, general; and explosives, n.e.i., free British, 10 per cent, intermediate, and 15 per cent, general. I cannot understand why the Senate&#39;s request was refused by another place, because the requested duty is a very moderate one, and would have no possible adverse effect upon the coal-mining industry. In fact, I think there would . be no increase at all in the cost of explosives of any kind. When this item was last before this Committee, a great point was made of the fact that the Australian explosives had never been properly tested. </para>

          <para>.- At the risk of delaying the Committee, I intend to put the case from the other point of view. Were the matter not so serious - it is a question of life or death to our Australian miners - I would vote with those who want to have a &#34; cut &#34; at the other House on this issue. I object to the proposal to compel Australian miners to use the product of a German companyp In order that the facts may be known, I shall quote from the report of the Inter-State Commission which inquired into this subject, and presented a report in May, 19i6.

          <para>Appllication was received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. K.</inline> O&#39;Brien, of Melbourne, agent for the Cape Explosives Works Limited, &#34; that the 5 per cent, duty &#176;n mining explosives, the product of the Cape Province, South African Union, be removed.&#34; </para>
          <para>This application was supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> Karri-Davies, engineer, of Perth, Western Australia, and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> C. Howard, of Adelaide, managing director of . the Broken Hill South Silver Mining Company No Liability. </para>
          <para>This application was opposed by the manager of the Australian Explosives and Chemical Company Limited, Deer Park, Melbourne. </para>
          <para>The explosives referred to in the application are those of the n&#39;itro-glycerine class (dynamite, gelatine dynamite, gelignite, and blasting gelatine ) . </para>
          <para>The value of importations of these for the five years 1909-13 were: - </para>
          <para> Thu principal countries of origin of importations for the year 1013 were: - United Kingdom, ?LS4,500; Germany, ?84,850; South Africa, ?30,430. </para>
          <para>There is only one company making this class of explosives in Australia. This is called the Australian Explosives and Chemical Company Limited, of Deer Park, Melbourne. This company, which has a very small output- in 1913, only 200.000 lbs. out of a total consumption of 6,000,000 or 7,000,000 lbs. - is dominated by the Nobel&#39;s Dynamite Trust Company Ltd., which is an offshoot of, or is in close association with, the Dynamite Aktiengesellschaft, of Hamburg. Mr.G. A. Evans, manager of the Australian Explosives and Chemical Company Ltd., stated: - </para>
          <para>Our company is .purely Australian, hut we are financed by the Nobel&#39;s Explosives Company. We would not be in existence if we were not financed by them. . . . It evidently pays the Nobel&#39;s Explosives Company to keep us going. They hav? carried it on in the hope it may turn <inline font-style="italic">om</inline> to be profitable. At the present time it is a <inline font-style="italic">bonti, fide</inline> industry. We do not show much profit. There are several very interesting features in connexion with this investigation which are deserving of special consideration. </para>
          <para>In the year 1908, the trade in Australia in high explosives was dominated and practically entirely controlled by a combination of British and German manufacturers. The circumstances, under which the Capo Explosives Works Limited entered into competition against this combination was explained by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> C. Howard, managing director of the Broken Hill South Silver Mining Company No Liability. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Howard</inline> said: - </para>
          <para>In 1908 we were paying to the Nobel Company, Glasgow, gelignite 35s. 6d. pcT case, gelatine dynamite 41s. 6d. per case, blasting gelatine 49s. 6d. per case. ^ Wo then called for tenders, and theo two Nobel Companies, Glasgow and Hamburg, both quoted 50s., 61s. fid., and 67s. 8d&#39;. for those three items. The increase was so excessive that it caused a revolt in the mining concerns throughout, the whole of Australia. </para>
          <para>The result of that was that a circular was issued by the whole of the large mining companies of Australia and New Zealand, which resulted in a meeting being held in Melbourne, at which every State was represented. A committee was formed, which resulted in an. invitation being sent to the South African company to come into this field. After long negotiations they sent their managers here, and a contract was the result. The contract was for five  years, with the  right of renewal for a further five years. . . . These companies were not so much out for profit, as they wanted a larger output to reduce their working costs. . . . </para>
          <para>At the presenti time, mainly owing to the reduction of freights, we are paying 44s. 7d. and 57s. 9d. (for gelignite and blasting gelatine). .&#39; . . The consumption of our company is in the neighibour- hood of 5,000 cases a year of these two explosives combined. </para>
          <para class="block">Our action in purchasing from South Africa broke up Nobel&#39;s combination. We consider the mining industry is under a great debt to the Cape- Explosives Works Company. ... It would be a calamity to us from a mining point of view if South African explosives were kept out. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> Karri-Davies, engineer, of Perth, who supported the application for preference to South Africa, said: - </para>
          <para>I have no personal interests in the matter at all. My main object is to foster good relations and trade between here and South Africa. ... I know there is a combine of manufacturers in Europe. The terms on which the De Beers people supply their dynamite to South Africa and Australia is that they charge a small interest on the capital expended in the factory. Whenever there is a saving the consumers get the benefit. De Beer? are not in the combine. ... I lived in South Africa for about twenty years, and so know the conditions of things there. . . . </para>
          <para>If this preference were given, it would mean a reduction in freights, as the vessel that would bring explosives here could take back a cargo to South Africa. The trend of the present trade is very much in favour of Australia as against South Africa, and we should do all we can to foster return freights, especially in goods we do not produce. The competition by the South African Explosives Companies has been an indirect benefit to Western Australia, as it has forced the combine to brins; down its prices of explosives. In this way Western Australia has benefited very largely. </para>

        <para>We are in. competition with the Cape Explosives Works Limited on lines that we cannot compete with. By &#34; we &#34; I speak only of the Australian Explosives Company. 1 can only speak for costs in so far as the cost of my own company is concerned. &#39;We are all on one price with the British companies, but the Cape company competes with us. </para>

        <para>I believe that the other members of the Combine are making little profit, judging from my costs. . . We arc at present making a slight profit in competition with Nobel&#39;s and the other companies without any protection at all. The members of the combined companies arc strongly in competition with sach other, after fixing the prices, on equal terms. I admit the competition as to the price is eliminated. . . . </para>
        <para>I cannot say who is the  chairman  in each of the other States of my association. I have no communication with them whatever. 1 have no idea of the instructions that they have received from the Combine as to the prices they must charge in each of the other States. I never correspond with the .representatives of the association in the other States as such, I may correspond with them without knowing they are the representatives of the association. . . Each company has its agent in this State, and they meet me, and we decide as to what .prices shall be charged.

        <para>I nm constantly corresponding with headquarters in London, but do not get - instructions regularly.

        <para>I would point out that I represent a company which could quite well split off from the Nobel Dynamite Trust. It is true that the Trust owns our company, as they bought it. They nin our company. I get my instructions from the Australian Explosives Company in London. . . </para>
        <para>I now wish to bring forward the question of the employment of black labour in the Cape Explosives Works Limited. I cannot give the rates of wages paid in Glasgow to men, women, and boys. The wage paid to bb.ck labour in the mines on the gold-fields in South Africa ivaa 51s. 9d. per month. I do not know if they were fed and lodged in addition. . . </para>
        <para>Briefly, my objection, is that the price at which the Cape Explosives Works Limited has taken a contract in A^ictoria was below our Australian cost at that time. I cannot say how much it. is, if any, below the Glasgow cost though. The contract I refer to was with the Birthday Tunnel, Berringa. </para>
        <para>Unless the Cape Explosives Works Limited improve their manufacture, I shall raise another objection to preference being extended to them on that ground.. </para>
        <para>They are using a material in the manufacture of gelignite at the present time which is a material that is not put into explosives by any other company trading in this market.&#34; </para>
        <para>In reply to comment on the qualitv of the rival product, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kirk</inline> O&#39;Brien stated - &#34; The explosives supplied by the Cape Explosives Works &#39;Limited are passed by the Government inspectors before lea.ving Africa, and before delivery in Australia they pass the standard tests, and are officially approved.

        <para>It is apparent from the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> A. Evans, manager of the Australian Explosives and Chemical Company Limited, of Melbourne, an&#39;d  chairman  of the High Explosives Trade Association in Victoria, that the Australian Explosives and Chemical Company Limited is kept in existence by the Nobel Dynamite Trust Company Ltd., and in the opinion of the Commission it is so kept in existence for the sole purpose of giving colour to the idea that there is an independent Australian industry. Its output is trifling. It is contended that its products enter into competition with the products of the great explosives manufacturing firms who constitute the High Explosives Trade Association. Its prices a.re regulated by that association, and thfcy must not exceed or be less than those charged by the world&#39;s greatest manufacturers. The relative ens-tsi of production at Deer Park, </para>
        <para>Melbourne, at Glasgow, and at Hamburg were not permitted to enter into consideration of the question. </para>
        <para>In the opinion of the Commission, the local factory is not a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> effort to establish an Australian industry. It would appear to be kept on foot merely for the purpose of imposing on the minds of the authorities the presumption that competition from South Africa might vitally affect an Australian industry. There is at present no Australian industry of high explosives in existence which answers to the ordinary acceptation of the term. This question of the supply of explosives is of supreme importance to one of our chief primary industries. </para>

        <para>Notwithstanding the immense mineral resources of Australia, and the great possibilities in the development of our mining industry, the above figures disclose a regrettable decrease - which has been persistent for several years - in the number of persons employed. </para>
        <para>In the cost of mining, particularly in respect of miners who have but little capital, tlie question of the price of explosives is a most serious consideration. Whilst the Explosives Combine, known as the High Explosives Trade Association, controlled the Australian market, the prices compared with those since the inception of competition by the Cape Explosives Works Limited were excessive, and there can be no doubt of the truth of the statement that the local &#34; mining industry is under a great debt to the Cape Explosives Works Company,&#34; and &#34; that it would bo a calamity to us from a mining point of view if South African explosives were kept out.&#34; </para>
        <para>The present discriminating rates of duties are to the advantage of the European Combine, and to the disadvantage of the miner. The Cape Explosives Company Limited is. hampered to the extent of 5 per cent., which is a serious handicap in the face of fierce compe-  tition. As a co-.operative effort in supplying explosives a,t a fair cost, the company should not be under any disadvantage. </para>
        <para>At present it can only do business in Australia when large contracts are obtainable, and it may be anticipated with certaint.y that, if this independent competition is destroyed, the prices for explosives will be immediately restored to their former high level. </para>

        <para>ISenator ELLIOTT (Victoria) &#91;11.10&#93;. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> said he would be prepared to give his support but for the document from which he has just read. The honorable senator omitted to inform the- Committee that the report isoat least six or seven years old. Immediately the war broke out the German capital invested in the industry was withdrawn, and it has since been replaced by good Australian money. The people employed iti the industry are all Australians, and there is not the slightest possibility of a German Combine ever deriving any profit from the industry or of dictating prices in any form. It is an Australian company, standing on its own bottom, and we are endeavouring to protect it from the products of black labour in South Africa, as has been done in other instances. We are asking for a duty of only 15 per cent., although, in some instances, 50 per cent, has- been imposed. Under the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> the rate will be reduced to 10 per cent., and considering all the circumstances, that cannot be regarded as excessive. </para>

            <para>- At any rate, it was at a time when the demand for explosives justified them in increasing their plant, but the present- demand would not do so. The plant at Deer Park is capable, I am instructed, of supplying the whole demand of Australia to-day, and it is, in fact, coping with from 58 to 60 per cent. oE that demand. </para>

          <para>The Nobel Dynamite Trust Company, with the sanction of the British Government, has arranged to sell the company&#39;s German assets to the Norddentsche Bank, in consideration of the bank surrendering 1,800,000 of the company&#39;s ordinary shares, or paying compensation for any shortage. Nobel&#39;s German assets consist mainly of a large holding of shares in Nobel&#39;s Explosive Company, Glasgow, and investments in the Alliance Explosives Company, and the Australian Explosives and Chemicals Company. The directors, therefore,!: recommend that the Trust be wound up, ann the British assets transferred to Nobel&#39;s Explosives. </para>
          <para>Whilst the interests of enemy ownership may now have disappeared, the combination known as the High Explosives Trade Association remains, and it must be obvious from the evidence taken in this investigation, that any Tariff encouragement which will tend to benefit and strengthen their monopoly must be accompanied by corresponding loss and injury to the Australian mining industry. </para>
          <para>The lever which has been used up to the present time in opposing the extension of British preference df 5 per cent, to South Africa is the &#34; black labour &#34; question. It would appear that only a proportion of the labour employed is coloured labour. But, even so, the question is one in which the decision should be guided by the best interests of Australian industry. We want cheap explosives for the purpose of developing our mineral resources, and we also desire to extend a preference to every <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> industry conducted in the United Kingdom. If, however, such preference, as it appears to have been in the present case, has been utilized by means of a Combine for the purpose of unduly inflating prices to the disadvantage of an Australian industry, then there appears to be no justification for its continuance in its present form. </para>

        <para>In the opinion of the Commission, the Tariff disadvantage (5 per cent.) to high explosives from South Africa is detrimental to the interests of the mining industry of Australia, and lessens the chances of return freights for our export trade with South Africa, and it is therefore recommended that the preference now extended to the United Kingdom on high explosives may also be extended to South Africa. </para>

If they are not manufactured here the primary producers will have to depend on the importers for the explosives they require. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> made a pathetic appeal which must have touched honorable senators.

          <para>.- I could not follow the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> in the statement he made on this item. I should like to know why the Government singled out this particular firm and submitted conditions to them which were not submitted to any other manufacturers. Before the Tariff was introduced they asked the members of this firm if they were, prepared to duplicate their plant, at a cost of &#163;200,000 or &#163;300,000, if the Government promised them a 15 per cent, duty. The firm said that they were prepared to do that, and I must say now that if I were a member of the firm, judging by the action since taken, I should feel that I had been deceived by the Government. The Government are not giving this firm the support that they have extended to other primary industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> attempted to camouflage matters by creating an impression that we are dealing, in this case, with a German monopoly. - </para>

            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator that if the manufacture of explosives were carried out in Australia by a German monopoly it would bo a danger to the community, but we know that German capital and control in this company is at an end. We have at present a small population in Australia, and it is possible that in a few years&#39; time, if we develop it on right lines by affording necessary protection to the primary industries, the population will be so increased that the demand for this article will have increased threefold. There will then be room for other companies to start in this industry with British or Australian capital. If it was their desire to support a, Free Trade policy, and to challenge the right of the manufacturer to live, I could understand the attitude which the Government have taken up in this matter. In this one instance, for no reason that I can imagine, the Government say that they are determined that this industry shall not live another day. Apart from the use of explosives in mining, it is necessary that they should be manufactured here to provide ammunition, which is essential to the defence of the country. Do honorable senators propose to say to the South African people who manufacture explosives by the !emplo|yment of black labour, that they may send us ammunition or not as they please at a time when it is necessary for us to defend the country? The argument put forward by the Government throughout the consideration of the Tariff has been that Australia must be self-contained, and must manufacture every essential article that it requires. I quite agree with that policy; and I say that it cannot be denied that we should manufacture our own ammunition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> in an able speech which we all admired, extolled the efficiency of our Australian soldiers, and regretted extremely the demands made in another place to cut down defence expenditure in. such a way as to lessen the efficiency of our Army. I hope that the honorable senator will confirm the view he so eloquently expressed by asking the Government to give protection to this industry in order that our soldiers  in time of need may be able to secure the ammunition they will require for the defence of the country. Of what use is it to train a man as a good soldier, and give him a rifle, if we refuse to provide him with ammunition? The honorable senator cannot in one breath insist upon expenditure to make our Army efficient, and in the next deny to our Forces an article essential to effective defence. Therefore, it is our duty to see that we manufacture our own ammunition, so that, when the time comes, if it should come, which is quite possible when danger threatens us, we, or our sous, will be in a position to protect this country. </para>

            <para>- I know that quite well ; but surely the honorable senator is not so simple as not to know that if explosives are manufactured in this way by chemists the services of those chemists can be applied, if necessary, to the manufacture of every kind of ammunition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is a defender of labour, but not the labour which is &#34;employed in Australia at an average wage of <inline font-style="italic">SA</inline> 5s. 6d. for adults. He would rather champion the cause of labour which is earning- an average wage of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per week in South Africa. The honorable senator claims that the Australian manufacturers of explosives have not extended their business as they promised to do, but it is well known that since the war mining for metals has been greatly reduced owing to the fact that production was so extensive during the war, and there was a large quantity in hand at the Armistice when the demand fell away. Yet, evidently, this company is expected to double its capital in order to be prepared to meet a demand from mines that are at the present time not working. </para>

            <para>- But that suggestion was made when the mines were doing their utmost to produce metals. It is unfair to expect this company, which has not been in a position to pay income tax since 1916, to double its capital at a time when the demand for its output has considerably decreased. </para>
