                    <quote>
                        <para>The accompanying statement -relating to the rejection of ballot-papers at the scrutiny in the West Sydney bye-election, held on the 3rd September, 1921, is submitted for the Minister&#39;s information in connexion with the inquiry of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> dated 9th September, 1921. The data from which the statement has been prepared was obtained from the officers who actually conducted- the scrutiny, and for all practical purposes may be taken to be correct. It will, of course, be understood that the law does not permit of scaled and indorsed parcels containing ballot-papers rejected in an election being opened unless the election is disputed, and then only by an order of the Court. The election was contested by four candidates, and it, therefore, became necessary for the voters to indicate the order of their preference &#39;for the whole of the candidates, by the use of consecutive numbers. Large posters, setting forth the requirements of the law, were exhibited in the polling booths for the information of voters, whose attention was also specially drawn to the printed directions on the ballot-papers. </para>

                    <para>- By way -of personal explanation, I desire to make a slight correction in connexion with remarks I made in connexion with the War Appropriations Pensions Bill as they appear at page 11934 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I had not an opportunity of correcting the proof of my speech. I was reported . to have said that of my own knowledge the administration of the Repatriation Department by its officials was as fair as the latter could make it. Obviously I was referring to the Pensions Department, as the Bill under consideration dealt with pensions. I should like to make it quite clear that the remarks I made were directed to the Pensions Department. </para>

                            <para>- It is possible that my formal motion conveys a somewhat vague impression to honorable senators. In common with others who, during, the past few months, have been considering the question of ocean freights as they affect our primary producers, I am wondering if <inline font-style="italic">-the</inline> Commonwealth Shipping Line, which is owned by the people of Australia, is being conducted in the best interests of the shareholders; but I should like to  preface my remarks by stating that any criticism I may indulge in should not be regarded as criticism of the Government or those who are responsible for the running of our steamships. I understand that the latter have been - considering the question of motor ships and oil engines for some time. The file of correspondence between the High Commissioner&#39;s Office in London and one of the largest firms in England, eighteen months or so ago, indicate  that certain suggestions were made to the company, and quotations were asked for in regard to the equipment of a certain class of ship. I believe there  is amongst our experts a consensus of opinion,  perhaps  npt expressed openly for obvious reasons, that the time is more than ripe for the Government to reconsider their policy in regard to the equipment of their vessels. They say, I understand, some of them at least, that the motor ship is the only satisfactory and efficient vessel for present day freightage, but they are unable to say more because the Government have not yet decided what their policy is to be. I believe the Government made a statement about twelve months ago, though I am unable to fmd any trace of it, and indicated then that they were going to consider the whole question. I admit that the position is fraught with many difficulties due, in part, to the very great depression in the industry. At present, I believe that, despite the heavy losses sustained during the war, the world&#39;s shipping is about 11,000,000 tons in excess of the figures for 1914, and that about 8,000,000 tons of shipping is lying idle in the various ports of the world. Of this idle tonnage no less than 5,000,000 tons is idle at present within the British Empire. </para>

                            <para>- There is, as I have said, very great depression in the shipping industry altogether, and in view of this fact the question which is the best class of ship to run in order to show profits is an important one. Some of the largest shipping companies on the other side of the world, notably the Johnson Line, of Sweden, are displacing coal-fired steamships with motor ships, because the latter are able to show a profit which is not possible with steam-driven vessels. We have to consider, also, the great difference in freight to our primary producers to-day as compared with pre-war rates. The honorable senators who represent Tasmania are particularly interested in the carriage of fruit. Prior to the war the freight to England was from 2s. 5d. to 3s. per case, whereas to-day the companies are asking 8s. per case, and they say that it is not worth their while to go to Tasmania for the fruit unless they have certain other privileges.

                        a journal dealing with the shipping position throughout the world, and I have been particularly impressed at the interest displayed in Germany in the shipbuilding industry. We have to admit that prior to the war they built up a fine ocean service, and in common with others seem to be well seized of the benefits to be derived from motor ships. One firm had ordered eight vessels of a standard size of 6,000 horse-power, and another twenty-five ships of a total dead-weight capacity of 175,000 tons. The advantages to be derived had been brought before the controllers of the Johnson Line, of Sweden, who are going in wholly for motor ships, and other prominent shipping firms in other countries, including America, whilst we in Australia do not appear to have commenced to grapple with the question.

I have had handed to me a copy of some correspondence which passed between the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> and a representative of one of the firms in Australia, and whilst I am indebted to the representative of this firm for the information with which I have been supplied, I wish it to be distinctly understood that I am not in any way associated with this gentleman or the firm he represents. Much of the information I have received has been obtained from journals published from time to time, and some of the figures which are in my possession have already been placed before the Department. These figures are, I think, unchallengeable, and cannot be disproved. In March last a representative of this firm communicated with the Minister for Home and Territories, when it was suggested by the Department that the possibilities of internal combustion engines were limited to about 5,000 horsepower, and that for the larger type of vessel - those of 12,500 tons which we are now constructing - it was doubtful whether engines of the necessary size and horse-power could be constructed. The representative who communicated with the Minister said - </para>

                    <para class="block">I refer to that matter for this reason : I understand that ships we are building at present are being supplied with their engine equipment by Thompson Brothers, of Victoria, and I believe the Department said at the time that as they had spent approximately . &#163;100,000 on engine equipment it was not considered wise to cancel the order and install Diesel engines. It seems to me, and I am to some extent governed by the figures supplied, that it would be good business, even at the present juncture, to remove the present coal-fire reciprocating engines and install Diesel engines. If the figures supplied to me are unchallengeable, such a policy should be adopted. I have asked that the estimates be made on a conservative basis, and, if they are unchallengeable, it is the duty of the Government and the Parliament to see that the people of Australia obtain the very best for the Commonwealth steamers if the line is to continue in operation. I know there are persons, probably some honorable senators, who think that the operations of the line should be discontinued, and the whole of the Commonwealth shipping business handled by private enterprise; but I do not agree with that view, as I believe we are, to some extent, in the hands of a shipping combine. If the Government control the whole business there is a possibility of the primary producers of Australia deriving some advantage, either by means of rebates or reduced freights. I desire to place on record a table which has been compiled, showing a comparison between the vessels of 12,500 tons deadweight capacity operating between London, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Suez, Fremantle, Adelaide Melbourne, Brisbane, and <inline font-style="italic">vice vers&#226; -</inline> the total distance is 24,420 nautical miles - with various types of propelling equipment.

                    <para>It is claimed that an immense saving is effected in the cost of operating motor - ships in consequence of the space required for fuel - the fuel bill is also smaller - because the bunker space for coal can be dispensed -with. In a great many instances motor-driven vessels have double bottoms in which the oil is carried either as cargo or as fuel. The stokehold crew, which often causes a good deal of trouble, can also be dispensed with, and the accommodation which they occupy can be utilized for cargo carrying. The average speed of a 6,000-ton tramp steamer is thirteen knots per hour, and it was suggested that it would be necessary to increase the speed of a vessel in a passenger service; but the ships which are being built will be used as cargo carriers, and so the question of speed does not enter into consideration. The above table shows that the total gain in revenue and savings by the motor-ship over other types is &#163;38,251 per trip in the case of the geared steam turbine (oil fired), and &#163;87,543 in the case of the steam reciprocating engine (coal fired). </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The majority of the ships in the Navy are oil fired. If we are to wait here in Australia . upon any developments along these lines, if we mark time until we get oil in this country, or if we do nothing until another war has developed and embroiled us, we will be left in the rear. I could cite, for example, the countries of South America. They are, to some extent, comparable with ourselves on account of their distance from the European market; but their shipping companies, trading from that continent to the East, are now all going in for motor propulsion. </para>

                            <para>- I can only repeat that if the position is such that development along the lines I advocate must wait upon the discovery of payable petroleum in Australia, we shall probably wait a very long while. I believe that in Tasmania, very shortly, we shall be drawing on plentiful supplies of oil from shale. I do not know whether we shall get very much motor spirit, but I understand that from the shale any amount of crude oil can be obtained ; and that is the sort used by the Diesel engine. I recently placed myself in touch with the manager of the Western Australian Government Shipping Service, which has a motor ship named the <inline font-style="italic">Kangaroo.</inline> The gentleman in question is evidently very favorable to the project of motor-driven vessels. He has given me figures with respect to the running of the <inline font-style="italic">Kangaroo,</inline> which leads me to hope, at any. rate, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> will not advise the Commonwealth authorities to be behind those of his own State in equipping their ships in the same way. </para>

                        <para>.-The thanks of the Senate are due to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> for having initiated a most interesting discussion. But the kernel of the whole matter is contained in the cost of. fuel. It is this which governs freight rates. Cheap freight is such an absolute necessity in relation to the conveyance of our primary products to markets on the other side of the world that Australia naturally takes the deepest interest in the subject. So far this country has not been favoured by the discovery of petroleum oil deposits. All our requirements of the kind must be imported ; and, to Australia, at any rate, oil is the most expensive fuel. The internal combustion engine is one of the greatest discoveries of the age. It has come to stay. But for that type of engine those two great arms of warfare - the flying machine and the submarine - would not have been practicable. I question whether there would even have been motor cars but for the internal combustion engine. There might have been some improvement on the steam engine adapted for road traffic purposes, but the outcome would only have been an approximation to slow motor service. Altogether, the subject is a very big and important one to Australia, and it must be approached and considered from the Australian stand-point. I repeat that Australia is unfortunate in its lack of oil wells; but there are fields in the Kimberley area of north-west Australia which may yet provide us with our own sources of supply. I believe that there is no better field for discovery than in our far northern and north-western areas. I have come to the conclusion that neither in the&#39; south nor in the centre of Australia can there be said to be good chances of such discoveries. I was born and reared in an oil district, so that the subject has always interested and, indeed, fascinated me. We have an unlimited supply of shale oil in Australia. The question is, can we produce shale oil at a commercial figure and of such a nature as will make the running Of oil-driven engines a practical business proposition? I am very doubtful. Even in the United States of America, which is the great centre of oil production - between 70 and 80 per cent, of the world&#39;s output comes from America - there are not very &#39; many units in its mercantile marine which are equipped for burning oil fuel. Everywhere oil is so scarce, compared with the demand, and is so dear, while coal is so plentiful and so cheap, that those comparisons between the two fuels entirely govern the situation. I am not in a position,, on the spur of the moment, to question any of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster&#39;s</inline> figures. If they are correct, he has made out an excellent case in favour of the use of fuel-oil engines. But we cannot shut our eyes to what has been happening in other parts of the world. We cannot ignore the fact that in those countries where oil is cheap there are very few vessels equipped with internal combustion engines. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator can furnish proof that oil as a fuel for ships can compete commercially with coal, then he will have solved the whole problem. That is the kernel of the whole thing. I admit that I find it a difficult subject to discuss. The solution of it rests with scientific, engineering, and commercial men rather than with politicians. I think we, in this Senate, cannot advance the solution of it to any great extent. I am just as anxious as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> to see our shale deposits developed. In the past they have been neglected, although they are superior to the shale deposits of most other countries. Their utilization has been dependent upon commercial considerations. The oil produced from shale has had to compete with cheap oil from the oil wells of America, but the industry, nevertheless, has been established for many years,  notably in New South &#34;Wales. It has not been able to compete successfully with the mineral ell produced in America. To what extent can we look for success in the development of the shale oil industry in the future? It has been pointed out by competent authorities in America that the oil wells of that country are gradually becoming exhausted. The head of the Biological Department of the United States of America, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Smith,</inline> has fixed a period of time for the exhaustion of the supply. In a report&#34; presented to his Government,, he said&#39; that in- from seventeen to twenty years the oil supplies of America would be exhausted. 3i that be so, then we in Australia must look elsewhere than to America for oil fuel in the future. Incidentally, this country maj come into its own by die utilization of its rich- shale deposits, and we may be able to congratulate ourselves that such a dangerous competitor as the United States of America has been removed. Apart from that fact, we have to remember that the shale deposits of Australia are practically in their virgin condition. We must work them to reap the benefit that Ave  might reasonably expect from them. At the same time, we must not forget that this country is also rich in coal deposits. We have been able to supply coal in the past as cheaply as most countries of the world. Some of our steam-ship companies, notably the mail-carrying companies, have taken&#39; the lion&#39;s share of their coal requirements from Australia. They have done so because Australian coal was cheaper than British .coal. The coal supplies of Australia are good and cheap, and therefore it may be a mistake to attempt to supplant coal by oil. AH these facts must be taken into consideration if we are going to deal with this subject in a proper manner. They are all important. Australia has enormous coal deposits, cheap and of high quality ; and for us to attempt to lead the world in installing internal combustion engines, in lieu of steam engines, would be very drastic and very courageous. Personally, I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> for having brought the subject forward. It is one that is worthy of our consideration.

                        <para>&#39;. -The subject* raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> is interesting. That goes without saying, 6ut I submit that it is so highly technical that few members of this Chamber would care to dogmatize regarding it. I take it that the honorable senator&#39;s purpose was to direct attention to  the steady development of internal combustion engines with a view to suggesting that they should be employed by the Commonwealth Government in substitution&#39; for the steam-driven engines in use at the present time. If that be so, I can only say that I will see that the statement made by him this afternoon&#39; is placed before the technical advisers of the Government. I have no doubt that the advisers of the Government are keeping themselves well posted on the subject, but I think the statement made by the honorable senator is of such an important character that I am entitled to ask them to consider it in all its detail&#39;s. It is impossible, certainly for me, to venture ail opinion on the subject. There are innumerable factors which we have to balance one against another - original cost, space occupied to the detriment of cargo, cost of fuel supplies, and the matter of efficiency. Whatever may be the prices of fuel oil to-day, the indications seem to be that they are going to harden. That appears <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be the tendency. A cablegram received the other day from the American oil people, who are not without influence in determining the price of oil in Australia, stated that it had been decided to raise the selling price of oil. This was an announcement of a further increase in price when we were reasonably entitled&#39; to expect a decrease I admit that it is not competent for me to- approach, the subject with any profit to myself or to this Chamber. All that I can do with any advantage is to furnish a copy of the honorable senator&#39;s statement to those whose responsibility it is to advise the Government. </para>

                        <para class="block">I offer my congratulations to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> upon the introduction of this subject and the lucid manner in which he placed the information at his disposal before the Senate. I regret that he had not time in which to complete the speech which he had prepared, but I think that he has accomplished his purpose, inasmuch as he has received from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen, representing the Government, a recognition of the importance of the question he has raised, and a promise that his remarks will be brought before the attention of the experts responsible for advising the Government on this question. That is about all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> could have hoped to achieve by a discussion of  the question at the present time, since there is  not  member of the Senate in possession of the necessary knowledge to pronounce a definite decision on the matter. </para>
                        <para>I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> in impressing upon the Government the great importance to Australia, of the cheap transit of goods overseas. As a representative of the island State of Tasmania, I feel very keenly the need for satisfactory means of communication between that State and the mainland, and the importance to the people of the Commonwealth generally of efficient and satisfactory communication between Australia and the rest of the world. Some &#39; of the interjections during <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster&#39;s</inline> speech were made in a hopeless sort of tone. If we are to refuse to do anything in this matter because the supply of oil might be interfered with by a future war, we shall have <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> stay our hand in regard to many things. We must take some risk. We firmly hope: that we are not going to have any more wars such as that which only lately interfered with the development of Australia and, indeed, of the world a&#39;t large. But it is of no use for us to- refuse to advance merely because we may receive a set-back by the occurrence of war. During a period in which I had some responsibility for the gO&#39;vernment of Tasmania an attempt was. made to develop the shale deposits of the State for the distillation of oil fuel. I witnessed a trial of the oil at  Hornsby&#39;s  machinery warehouse, in Bourke-street, Melbourne, and I had the assurance of the manager that the oil distilled from the Tasmanian shale was equal to any fuel oil in the world. I believe that there are deposits of shale on the mainland that may be as good as the Tasmanian deposit, but I was assured by experts that an enormous percentage of oil might be distilled from the Tasmanian deposits. I was looking forward to the time&#39; when we would distil our own oil from the shale deposits at Latrobe for use on our own motor-driven steamers between Tasmania and the mainland. I am sorry that that policy was not persisted in and carried into effect. I believe that if it had been we should to-day  be  in possession of a permanent supply of fuel- oil - so far as such things can be said to be permanent, because all these deposits have, of course, only a certain life - with which to carry on our own &#93; shipping. </para>
                        <para>Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> does not accept personal responsibility for the1 correctness of the figures he has given, he has told us that those responsible for them pronounce them unchallengeable. If they are correct, the extra cost of installing oil machinery in our boats would be paid for in a couple of trips. </para>

                    <para>No one can question the importance of  efficient sea-carriage for goods. A.11 the States own their own railways, which bring the produce of the primary producers to the different ports. When they reach the ports they are at the mercy of the Shipping Combine. That is a ridiculous position, and those who advocate the withdrawal of the Commonwealth from the shipping enterprise are, in my opinion, very short-sighted indeed. We must supply the missing link between the railway termini and the markets of the world for our produce, otherwise we cannot expect to be a successful exporting nation. Assuming that the information supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> is reliable, the honorable senator has indicated one way in which the Government may do something to make their name memorable in the history of Australia. </para>

The fact is that the world is leading Australia, and we are very much behind. The people who are leading the world in this matter at the present time are the Germans and Scandinavians. It is not a question of proving whether what I have suggested can be done, because it has been, and is being, proved in almost every shipbuilding yard in other parts of the world. </para>

                        <para>The saving in fuel cost is more or less according to the cost of oil or coal.

                        <para>Whereas a coal-fired vessel requires 800 tons of fuel for a 5,000-mile run, a similar vessel with internal-combustion engines would require about 150 tons of fuel, thus giving the latter an increased cargo capacity of 650 tons. This, put into money, say, with a cargo of wheat to England at ?3 per ton freight, would mean, assuming the vessels each bunkered at South Africa on the way, that the internal combustion driven vessel would be able to pay for fuel for the whole run out of the extra freight that it could carry. </para>

                        Largie dealt with the matter of shale oil, which should be given far more attention by the Commonwealth Government. The present bounty of 2d. per gallon is trifling for the development of the shale oil industry. A company was endeavouring to carry on the industry for some years in Tasmania, and suffered many reverses. Recently it sold out to another company that is hoping to do big things. They are putting in a 7-mile pipe to the wharf at Devonport, where they propose to erect a large container.

I cannot attempt to dogmatize on this subject as if I were a mechanical expert. I can only repeat that I was so astounded at the figures in favour of motor-driven vessels that I felt it my duty to bring the matter before the Senate.

                    <para>.- The Public Service Bill and the Superannuation Bill deal with entirely different subjects. Before we can consider the superannuation scheme, we must know the conditions of employment and salaries paid in the Public Service. Therefore consideration of this Bill necessarily precedes consideration of the superannuation scheme, though it may be possible at a later stage to make an announcement as to the attitude of the Government in regard to superannuation. This Bill deals with wages, classification, and conditions of employment in the Public Service. It does not touch superannuation in any shape or form. </para>

                        <para>- They aro entirely different. Another reason why honorable senators cannot have the Superannuation Bill is that its details have not yet been finalized by the Government, but I will suggest to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> that he might make a statement at the earliest possible date dealing with superannuation. This, no doubt, would be helpful to honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>. -  In my judgment, the two subjects are correlated. As the Minister himself explains, this Bill sets up certain conditions of employment in the Public Service throughout the Commonwealth. It is obvious, I think, that if there is to be no superannuation scheme, the conditions in the Public Service should be better than if there is to be a scheme. The conditions of employment must be governed, to some extent, . by what is contained in the Superannuation Bill. </para>

It has nothing whatever to do with a superannuation scheme. It is a machinery measure pure and simple. I have understood for some time that the Government have promised to establish a Superannuation Fund, and that a measure for that purpose will be submitted for our consideration later in the session. I cannot see that any good will accrue from the postponement of consideration of this . Bill, because we have a. promise that a Superannuation Fund is to be created. </para>

When an engagement was annulled after a certain, period, as provided in sub-clause 2, there would be no opportunity for a youth to again enter&#39; the Service as a probationer for twelve months, and many things over which he had no control might occur to prevent him from obtaining an appointment in twelve months. We should not  lay down a. hard and fast rule, an&#38; the object of the amendment moved by the Minister is to give the. Board the opportunity of reviewing the matter when circumstances arise over which a probationer has no control. </para>

                    <para>. - In this case the persons eligible are limited to the fourth class, because, as a rule, it is not intended to cover officers. Some officers continue in the Service to fairly old age, if they are good men, but the ordinary working men in the Navy have one stretch of service, and some of them do not renew it. It is difficult to get men for the Naval Service in Australia. They can join up to the age of fifty years, but the average working man cannot be persuaded to begin re-educating himself at that age, and it is not necessary to have an education test, because there are many occupations for which ex-naval men are suitable, particularly at quarantine stations. I intend to ask the Committee to insert &#34; Health Department.&#34; A man who can manage a boat is useful. There is a good deal of this work in connexion with lights and harbors, and we ought to give preference to men who have worked in the Navy. We are not contemplating making special provision for officers discharged from the Navy to be given positions in the Public Service, but we have in mind other men who are turned adrift at a comparatively early age. </para>

                        <para>- It was largely sentimental. The Acting Public Service Commissioner pointed out that quite a lot of men terminated their service in the Navy, and, although they had no special trade or occupation, they had a general experience which made their services invaluable, say, at quarantine work, where there is  a  good deal of boating and shipping, and at work connected with harbors and lights. All this work is embraced under the Customs Department, and we naturally said that these men ought to be given preference in the class of work for which they are most suitable. We might say the same thing with regard to the engineers in the Army. </para>

                        <para>- We are now discussing clause 38, and I wish to confine my attention to that particular clause. The whole issue seems to be as to whether ex-naval men shall be eligible for appointment under certain conditions, if considered suitable by the Board, throughout the whole gamut of the Public Service, or whether their eligibility shall be confined to one Department,. I would point out that in the whole of the Departments of the Public Service there are positions which could probably be very suitably filled by service-expired naval men. If the clause remains as it stands, the Board will not be able to appoint an ex-naval man to any position in the Public Service except in the Department of Trade and Customs. We wish these men to be put into positions for which they are suitable, and for which they are recommended by the Board. The Minister has intimated that he intends to extend the ambit of the clause to the Quarantine and Harbor services, which include the work of attending to lightships and other similar nautical duties. May I suggest that these ex-naval men are equally suitable for the position of watchmen on Government steamers? </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to get that admission. I hope the Shipping Line will always be treated as a commercial proposition, and stand or fall on its profits or losses. The amendment is simple, and I support it because such a clause should not be limited to one particular Department. </para>

Its purpose is in the direction of amplification, which the clause requires. I would favour an even wider amplification. I would like to see inserted in this measure the provisions of the South Australian Act. The application of the preference contained here should be not only with respect to all members of the Naval Forces, but also to the Australian Imperial Force. Clauses 38 to 42 are in a category by themselves, and if the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> is willing that the Committee should give later consideration &#39;to the clause immediately under discussion I suggest that those associated with it should1 also be postponed.

                        <para>- This clause, which specifically provides preference for sailors, does not mention soldiers. Rather than that there should be any looseness or vagueness upon this question the Government should be careful to specify the nature and scope of the preference. Unfortunately, the ; policy , of preference to returned soldiers has proved a farce in many directions. So far as Commonwealth parliamentary officers are concerned, for example, preference  has been afforded only in respect of the General Division. Are not the better educated men who were members of the Australian Imperial Force just as much entitled to enter the Public Service as those who -can qualify only for the General Division? </para>

                        <para>- To that end the throwing open to ex-Navy men of positions in the fourth division of the Public Service would be desirable. I hope the Minister will re-arrange the clause so as to incorporate that idea. All the Bill proposes is that the ex-Navy man shall be eligible for appointment without  a  qualifying examination, and that is all the preference he will receive. It will rest with the Board to decide whether he is fit for the position. </para>

                    <para>. -  I want to say quite candidly that prior to this debate I did not under-, stand exactly how far-reaching this clause might be. We are in a generous spirit to those who served in the Navy, but I do not think we can carry <inline font-style="italic">out</inline> the proposal. It does not include returned members of the Australian Imperial Force. and the Government is pledged to give preference to these, as well as to those who were on active service in the Navy. I did not know that I was fathering a proposal which might have the  effect of giving to Navy men a preference which is denied to ex-members of the Australian Imperial Force. Now I find that it puts the returned sailor in a different position from the returned soldier. When any question is before this Senate I am not in the habit of asserting that I know all about it when in reality I do not. If the Senate is not going to be generous, and grant my request for a postponement of the clause, when honorable senators want time to consider something, I will stand against it. The proposal goes further than I thought. There is a contradiction in it unless it is limited to those who have had active service either, in, the Army or in&#39; the Navy, and it will also be a contradiction to give preference to naval men who have not had active service. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no objection to the Minister being allowed <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> postpone the clause for a day or two, but I would remind him that honorable senators from the other States have to come a long way every week to attend the sittings of Parliament, and when we do come here we ought to be allowed to get through some work. If the clause gives preference in the way in which the Minister says it does, I am opposed to it, but it does not give that preference. I will explain what I mean by preference. A few days ago a case came under my notice in Sydney, where a married man had been employed as a temporary hand in the post-office for fourteen months.  His  position is now being advertised as a permanent position, and he is afraid that he will lose it. The present Act says that if there is a capable returned soldier available he must be given preference over a person who is not a returned soldier. Consequently, the man I have referred to, although he is eligible for the position and can pass the examination, cannot receive it because there is a returned soldier available who is capable of&#39; doing the work. The clause now under discussion does not give any such preference. It says that if a person has been in the Navy for the full period for which he enlisted he shall not be debarred from applying for certain positions in the Public Service. The temporary hand I have referred to knows that if there is a returned soldier capable of doing the work that man will get the appointment. That is what I mean by preference. The clause does not say that the Government will find a job for any man after he has left the Navy. </para>

                        <para>- If the Minister says that this clause has not been properly drafted, and that he does not intend it to be what it is, but something else, then he is entitled, to take it back to get it properly drafted. Perhaps the Minister wants to give preference, but he only speaks of eligibility. If the clause gives preference to a man over everybody else because he has been in the Navy I will not support it; but I maintain that it does not do that. As it stands it does not give preference to any one. It simply says that a man who has served in the Navy shall be eligible to apply for a position without examination. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but not preference in appointment. There is a great deal of difference&#39; between that kind of preference and saying that because a man has served a certain, time in the Navy he shall have preference in appointment over a civilian. In this particular case preference and eligibility are two quite distinct things. The Public Service inspector told me that there was no chance for the permanent appointment of the temporary man I have referred to, because a returned soldier &#39;who was eligible and fit for the appointment was available. He told, me, in fact, that the returned soldier&#39;s name had already been gazetted. The present proposal says that if a man has been in the Navy for a certain length of time he can apply on equal terms with another man who has not been in the Navy. </para>

In the case I have mentioned both the returned soldier and the temporary employee can pass the examination, but the returned soldier will get the appointment. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no objection to the postponement of the clause, in order that the Minister- <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> may give consideration to the suggestions that have been made. The gist of the clause is that certain men who have served in the Navy for a specified time shall be eligible, without examination, for appointment to certain positions. The Minister has promised to reconsider the clause, and I have risen to ask him, when doing so, to look into the provisions of the South Australian Public Service Act of 1919, which deals with the matter of examinations. When that measure was under consideration in the South Australian Parliament representations were made to the State Government that certain returned soldiers, who had seen active service, were eligible for positions in the Public Service, but, owing to disabilities, due to their war service, could not concentrate their minds upon the subjects of an examination paper, and were, therefore, placed at a disadvantage in seeking admission to the Service. In order that consideration should be given to the case of these men, the State Government inserted certain provisions in the State Act which the Minister might look into in giving further consideration to this clause. </para>

I believe that in Melbourne and suburbs there are some  200  odd who work as telegraph messengers. They cannot all be admitted into the Public Service of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Even if they do, vacancies cannot be found for all of them. Legislation throughout Australia for some years past has made the position very difficult for boys who must cease the occupation in which they are engaged when they reach eighteen years of age. The limitations now placed on juvenile labour, and especially the awards made requiring wages to be paid according to agc, and not according to ability, annually prevent hundreds of boys in every State following occupations in which they would be useful to the community and might make a success of life to themselves. I raise the question whether it would not be -wise to consider the reduction of the age to seventeen years. If a lad in the service of the Post and Telegraph Department as a telegraph messenger reaches the age of eighteen years, and has not been able to pass an examination, or there is no position in the Service open to him, he is thrown on the world, and even in the big city of Melbourne I make bold to say that the chances are  100  to  1  that he will not then be able to find an occupation in which he can <inline font-style="italic">learn a</inline> trade which will be useful to him and to the country. The reason is that no employer will take the lad on because of the restrictions placed upon his employment, and especially those fixing wages according to age. </para>

                        <para>- This question is well worthy of consideration. The avenues of outside employment for skilled workmen are being closed more and more each year owing to the attitude, of the trade unions towards apprenticeship, and to the wage now being fixed according: to age and not to the ability of workmen. Consequently, employers always prefer to start a lad at fourteen or fifteen years of age rather than at eighteen years. </para>

                    <para>, - I have had a very wide experience in the administration of the Public Service Act, and I know that any failure on the part of boys employed as telegraph messengers to pass the examination at the age of eighteen years, mav be traced to their neglect of their opportunities. In some cases the boys did not know that to pass an examination was a  condition precedent to their further employment in the Service. Therefore, I suggested to the Public Service Commissioner that the lads should be directly informed on the point. When parents have approached me on the subject, I have always advised them to send their lads to some night school in order that they might qualify for permanent positions. </para>

In the case of those lads who, at the age of seventeen or eighteen years, enlisted, and went to the war, we have been able to dispense with the examinations. They have all been placed in permanent positions. Honorable senators will agree, of course, that it is not desirable to fill the Public Service with non-triers. The examination is so simple that any lad of average intelligence can pass it. I do not know of any lad who has been put out of the Department after having passed the examination. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with my honorable friend. It would be better to let these lads know at sixteen years of  age rather than, eighteen! years, that there is nothing further in the Service for them. This is the issue that has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne.</inline> I am sympathetic with, his view-point, because, unfortunately, owing, in my opinion, to the misguided - policy of some trade unions, the Commonwealth is lamentably short of apprentices and good artisans and tradesmen. Therefore, the less the Government do to force unskilled labour upon the market the better it will be for the Commonwealth. If the Public Service cannot absorb the telegraph messengers, irrespective of their qualifications, the age should be seventeen, and not eighteen, because at the younger age they would be more likely to take up a trade, or some employment in which they might be successful. </para>

                    <para>. -  I was very surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> suggest a reduction in. the age, because I expected him to submit an amendment in the other direction. I was also surprised to hear the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> say that every youth who had passed the necessary examination had been admitted to the Service. It would be very interesting to learn the number of boys who had passed the examination, and who have not been absorbed in the Post and Telegraph Department. In times of prosperity, when the work of the Department is increasing, doubtless the services of a large number of youths could be utilized, but when, the reverse is the case, it is more than probable that employment cannot be found for those who have- qualified. I have always been under the impression that it has been difficult to find employment for a number of telegraph messengers when they reach the age of eighteen years. We have also to consider the suggested amendment from the stand-point of the interests of the community. There are at present in Sydney a number of telegraph messengers who are too young to do the work efficiently, and, in consequence, a large number of messages do not reach their destination. Only to-day I have received a communication from a friend who has been endeavouring to ascertain why a telegram he despatched has not been delivered, and the only information he has received from the Department was a notification expressing regret because the messenger had failed to deliver it. Quite recently two telegrams despatched by members of my own family were not delivered, and the reply from the Department, in one case, was that the messenger had been reprimanded, and in the other that he had been dismissed. If one individual can submit several instances of non-delivery, we are right in assuming that the total number must be very large. Telegraphic messages do not reach their destination in many instances because those employed in delivering them are too young, and if an amendment similar to that suggested were adopted the position would be worse. When the age limit was sixteen, the late Public Service Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> endeavoured to have it increased, because, in his opinion, it was undesirable to dismiss messengers at an early age. </para>

                    <para>. - Recently honorable senators, and I believe members of another place, received a circular from returned soldiers employed as temporary assistants in the Post and Telegraph Department, complaining that their services have been dispensed with in order to provide employment for telegraph messengers who have reached the age of eighteen. These men appear to have a just grievance, and have said that the policy of the Post and Telegraph Department in this direction is seriously interfering with the principle of preference to returned soldiers. As we have a large number of returned men who have lost an arm, but who are quite capable of delivering telegrams, work of this .character should be available to them. I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> that many telegrams are delivered later than they should be, and in some cases are not delivered at all. If this work cannot be efficiently performed by youths of eighteen, it is surely suitable employment for returned soldiers who have lost an arm, and who are consequently prevented from performing other duties. , . ., </para>

                        <para>- An amendment such as that suggested might be carried, and a subsequent sub-clause might not, with the result that some youths would be unfairly treated. If there is one section of the community more than another that we should seek to protect it is that which comprises those who cannot help themselves. These lads are not electors, and it is our duty to give them some special consideration, particularly as we have agreed in past legislation that they shall be retained until they reach the age of eighteen. By reducing the period by one year it may make a great difference to a number of youths, and we should not do anything that would inflict a hardship on any boy in the community. I can quite understand that it is not wise to turn a number of young men on to the labour market without any trade or any commercial training. </para>

                        <para>- Girls who have gone up for the examination and have their names on the list are kept out of positions because message boys have been given appointments. I would like the Minister to inquire as to the number of boys who have been used in the telephone&#39; office, and the number of girls who have; been, kept waiting for the. positions held by boys. There is a great deal to be said in favour of the suggested amendment to reduce the age from eighteen to seventeen years. We all desire to see capable telegraph messengers, but we must realize that, owing to the position the unions take up to-day, and also because of the wages fixed by the Arbitration Courts, it is difficult to get really good men. That is the universal complaint to-day from those who employ mechanics. If lads are kept on as telegraph messengers until they are eighteen years of age, they are then too old to pick up a trade, because of the wage their age demands, and so they are thrown on the unskilled labour market, which is already quite big enough in Australia. </para>
