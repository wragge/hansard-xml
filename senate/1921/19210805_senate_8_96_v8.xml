                    <para>.- In my opinion, it is necessary to increase this duty to insure the security of the hop industry. The duty on imported beer has been increased, and that in itself is some justification for increasing the duty  on  hops, although, while hops are essential to the manufacture of beer, only a pound of hops is used in 29 or 30 gallons  of  beer, so that the cost of hops is not a very large item in a brewer's expenses. </para>

                        <para>- Hops have been imported at a cost of 6s.1¼d. per lb. No other rural industry gives employment to so much labour as hop growing. None but the best valley loam is suitable for the growing of hops, and much labour has to be employed in clearing such land. Then come the planting of the hops, the training and tending of the vines, and finally the picking of the crop. The hop vines have to be  trained on poles,' to which they are fastened with strings or runners, and the industry thus employs a larger number of men, women, and children to the acre than any other rural industry. Tasmania could supply Australia's demand for hops, and most of our hops are grown there, though some hops are grown in Victoria. In the old clays, the labour employed in the hop industry was paid very little, and in those times growers made a fair profit by selling hops for1s. per lb. Now, however, everything is changed. The cost of materials - such as wire, poles, fertilizers, and farm implements is very much greater than it was, and wages have more than doubled. </para>

                        <para>- When a small number of people are interested it is very easy for them to determine that, rather than pay what they consider to be an inflated price - and 4s. 6d. per lb. was not an inflated price under the circumstances - they would pay 50 per cent. more for imported hops in order to beat down the price asked by the local producers. </para>

                    <para>We understand that the Minister for Customs has been informed: that the Tasmanian Hop-growers' Pool fixed their price much higher than the. market warranted. We enclose figures obtained from the Customs Department, which we shall be glad if you will submit to the Minister,' as they will prove that on the date we fixed the price, viz., 8th April last, at 4s.6d., this was not so.. We also have a cable from England quoting Kent hops, on 8th April, at 3s.11d. c.i.f. Australian ports, which means, with duty and other charges, at least 4s. 7d., while the figures enclosed show that importers had paid on average price of 6s. lid. for 3,800 bales from America before out price was fixed, a very large proportion of which are still in bond, banked up against our 1021 crop. The total importation from all countries reached the large figure of 5,500 bales since 1st June,  1920. Through these large stocks being here, we have now had to sell the proportion of our crop which we handle at 3s.6d. per lb. We also wish to point out that nineteen breweries signed contracts last March to pay Pool price on condition that their quantities were guaranteed, which was done, and yet they, backed up by the middlemen, have now refused to pay more than 3s. 6d., despite the fact that imported hops have cost much more, viz., an average of 5s. 7¾d., duty paid, from all countries. </para>

                    <para>We will also be glad if you will point out to the Minister that during the three years he put an embargo on foreign hops we did not take advantage of it to exploit the brewers, as. far 1919, when we fixed our price at la. 6d., they wore really worth 2s: 6d.; and, in 1920, when we fixed the. price at 3s. 9d., the balance, of the Tasmanian crop was immediately sold at from 6s. to 7s. We would also stress the point that the enclosed figures show £202,774 was sent out of the Commonwealth to pay for foreign hops, when we could easily grow all the Commonwealth requirements if we were assured of adequate Protection, but hop growing is such a costly business that the hop- growers, from the bitter experience of. the past, are afraid to launch out in extending, their grounds without it. The great thing at the present time that is threatening our industry, is the fact that, owing to America being a prohibition country and the hops there being largely grown by Japanese and Chinese labour, they are offering 1921 season's hops, to be harvested next September,, at 20 cents f.o.b. San Francisco. </para>

                        <para>- It might pay to grow them by Japanese and Chinese labour. I am not familiar with the labour conditions, in America, but hops grown by cheap labour, such as we had in the early days when they could be sold at 9d. or1s. per lb., can be sold at a. profit at a very low price. In any case I can understand American hop growers selling abroad at a low price a crop which, owing to the prohibition against the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquors, would otherwise; be useless to them. </para>

                    <para>And we understand some importers are talking of making three-years' contracts at this figure. It is impossible for hop-growers to compete with such a price as this, as we can easily prove from several growers who keep accurate books that it is costing them 2s. 6d. to grow them; and we feel sure that if this fact is pointed out to the Minister he will agree that America, being a prohibition country, and unable to use its hops, ought not to be allowed to dump them down in Australia at ls. 6d. plus duty, .unless the duty is much higher than that now in force, viz., ls. </para>

An acre of hops may support a whole family and also afford employment to persons ' outside the family. Unless one can see the work attached to preparing a hop field, he can have no conception of the amount of labour it involves. There is no comparison .between the amount of  work entailed in working a vineyard and that employed in working a hop field. </para>

If, however, importers, at their own sweet will, are allowed to import large quantities of hops, and the hop-growers are always in danger of having their crops left on their hands, it will be very difficult, of course, to induce people to carry on the industry. Under such circumstances, the local production may be less than the requirements of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Taking into consideration the increased cost of production, I suggest, while leaving the British column as at present, that the intermediate duty be increased to1s. and the general duty, to1s. 6d. per lb. I feel that I am really too modest in making such a suggestion - that I really ought to be asking for a duty of 2s. under the general Tariff. If the brewers make up their minds that they will not use local hops, I know that the duty of 2s. will not prevent them from importing, but should they do so in their obstinacy, the result will be to bring in a few extra thousands of pounds to the Treasury. We shall accomplish that, if nothing else, by the acceptance of my suggestion. The imposition of the higher duties will, in my own State anyhow, stabilize the industry, and more land wit be put under cultivation, with the result that the full requirements of Australia will be met.

                    <para>. - The speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> was certainly interesting, but there are one or two facts, which ought to have been obvious to him, but which, apparently, he has forgotten. I happened to be connected with a Hop Pool during the worst times that the Tasmanian growers have ever experienced. We have been told that the hop-growers made a great sacrifice in regard to the fixing of the price at1s. 6d. during the establishment of the Pool. The fact is, however, that the growers and the brewers met in conference, and came to a mutual arrangement, without intervention by any arbitrator, and that arrangement was accepted by the Government. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; the whole of the hops were pooled as in the case of wheat and wool. On the same figures as supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> this morning, there was a return of £120 per acre at the then price of1s. 6d. There is one fact that we ought to remember, and that is that all the hops grown in the world are not of one common flavour, and the embargo was subject to permission being granted by the Minister of the day for the importation of hops for the making of special ales; that is to say, permission could be given for the importation of hops of different flavours. </para>

                        <para>- Just so, but the growers at that time agreed that there might be these special importations. Personally,  I was sympathetic with the growers at the time, because I recognised the great difficulties which they were then experiencing. According to the figures of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> the price was 3s. 6d. last year, and, as 1,600 lbs. is a very good crop, it means a return of £280, as against £120. The importations from the United Kingdom between 1913 and 1918 dropped from 168,150 lbs. to 59,000 lbs.; New Zealand from 246,000 lbs. to 104,000 lbs.; and from Austria-Hungary, or Bohemia, from 49,920 lbs. to 31,000 lbs. The importation from the United States of America was- 801,000 lbs. Germany, of course, was out of the business altogether, though she had previously sent us 195,000 lbs. These figures show an immense growth of the local industry. The Australian production had increased in 1917-18. to 2,103,136 lbs., and in 1918-19 it was 1,858,080 lbs. I regret that the figures for last year are not available, but I believe there was a considerable increase. </para>

                <para>The duties in the previous Tariff were  6d.  and 6d., and in the present Tariff, while not increasing the British duty, we have increased the intermediate duty by 50 per cent., and the general duty by 100 per cent. There are limits to such increases; and I wish to say that all the hops produced have been readily sold within Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that sufficient hops are not yet locally grown to meet the requirements of Australia, but I offer my congratulations on the very rapid development of the industry, which is, indeed, very promising for the future. If the progress of the last six years be maintained, I believe that in a very short time sufficient hops will be produced to meet all the demands of the Commonwealth. The importations, I believe, represent just about what the Australian production is short;' so that if our production be increased by one-third there will be a complete market for the grower. It would be difficult for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> to point to a single Australian industry which has so steadily grown; it is- still growing, and is now within reasonable reach of a complete monopoly. I may say that there have been no applications from the hop growers for any increase in the duties except, of course, indirectly through <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle;</inline> and the Government therefore assumed they were doing something wonderful in offering the increases I have mentioned. On the whole, I think the Government are doing very well for the hop industry. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> certainly made out a convincing case, but it was not for an increase of duty. Indeed, it was for a reduction. The figures which ho quoted were utterly astonishing. I had had no notion of the  profitable nature of hop-growing. In my ignorance of Tasmania, I had considered that its most profitable industry was the promotion of Tattersalls sweeps, but the particulars provided by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> place hop growing on the same plane at any rate as the other. Tasmania is one of the most favoured parts of the Commonwealth. It does not suffer from droughts.. Its soil is rich, and its climate is beautiful. One of the most superb sights on the island is the hop crop at picking time, although I understand that there are only about 1,200 acres under hop  cultivation. Seeing that the produce from one acre, at the rate of 4s. per pound, equals more than £400, tow much more profitable does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> wish the industry to become? The honorable senator remarked that there was a lot of work attached to hop-growing. I can quite believe .that there is. All those who work on the land, one way or another, must get up  early and work pretty hard. But, if a grower can make £400 per acre, and if his toil upon one acre does not extend for  more 'than three months in the year, is he not to be envied ? </para>

At any rate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has provided such attractive information as may encourage considerable competition from the fertile valleys of New South Wales. The old price per pound was1s. Conditions have changed, and the hop-growers must now pay more for their labour; but the increase has not been great. It cannot be claimed that there has been any considerable advance in the rate3 of wages paid to hop-pickers. According to present selling prices, the return per acre has increased by about £300. </para>

                        <para>-I am not prepared to believe that the pay of the women and children, who chiefly do the picking, has been increased by so much. And, after all, the process of picking is only a small part of the general operation of cultivating and placing the product on the market. Seeing that the industry is being particularly well treated, and that it has reached a stage of prosperity which could not have been imagined a few years ago, the request now under consideration by the Committee is merely a greedy claim to heap up further prosperity. There is no chance, if the rate of duty be increased, of the wage earners making a little more, for the cry among employers throughout Australia' to-day is that wages must be reduced in order to bring down the cost of living. If the hop-growers were not  getting a fair deal I would readily agree that - the policy of this country being Protection - they should be given that degree of protection to which they are entitled. I do not believe that the people engaged in the brewing business, who are the chief buyers of hops, are deliberately refraining from encouraging local production by buying at a cheaper rate than the price at which hops can be imported. Such a policy would be foreign to common sense; and the brewers are not fools. If 4s. 6d. per lb. is four and a half times as much as the price at which hops were quoted some months ago, how can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> reasonably advance his request'? I am. glad, at least, that the honorable senator is sufficiently liberal not to propose to tax further British-grown hops. </para>

The value of the imports in those normal years was in the neighbourhood of l0d. per lb. maximum; yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> is asking that a rate of duty shall be imposed which, in itself, would be actually far above the price of the product brought into the United States of America. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that in dealing with the Tariff the Government and the Parliament have started from . the wrong point. They have set out on the false assumption that the industries 'of this country require protection to make them succeed. It is necessary that safeguards should be provided, of course, to enable producers and manufacturers to fairly hold their own. But the degree of protection should not be such as to amount, practically, to a premium upon  laziness. We should not coddle our industries and manufactures to the extent of permitting them to grow flabby and lazy for lack of competition. Every penny imposed beyond what is absolutely necessary is, I repeat, nothing but a premium upon laziness. And that has been the effect of the rates upon many items in the Tariff. I blame the Government more than, anybody else. It is their duty to propound a leading policy. Otherwise what hope has Australia.' of becoming a self-reliant and self-contained nation'? I am proud to think that there are some manufacturers who are so keenly alive to <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> public interest that they refuse- to ask the Government for excessive protection. There are others, however, who greedily take the opportunity to " thrust their hands in to the elbow." This Committee should not tolerate such a state of affairs. I shall, certainly vote against the request. </para>

I have adopted in connexion with the discussion of the Tariff that I am anxious to assist primary producers ; but when I find that those who are pleading on behalf of the primary producers are asking for  more  than a fair thing - as is the case in this instance - and are endeavouring' to fleece the consuming public to an exorbitant extent, I am not likely to' render any assistance. The proposal of the Government, giving as it does an additional duty of 100' per cent, on the old Tariff, is quite sufficient. The hop-growing industry in Tasmania was established under the old Tariff, and the hop-growers in that State have done exceedingly well; but  notwithstanding that the duty is to he increased by 100 per cent., <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> now submits an additional impost of 50 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator's knowledge must be very superficial, or he is- misinterpreting the position. There is no work in connexion with production from the land which requires more careful and continuous attention than that of hop growing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> have endeavoured to prove that substantial returns are derived from hop growing. Some years ago, in the Mount Gambier district, in South Australia, where the land is of the richest quality, large quantities of hops were grown, but, although the yield was uncommonly good, hop growing was found to be altogether unremunerative. At present, there is not a single hop plant grown for commercial purposes in that district, and the land is now used for the production of wheat, barley, and oats. If there is so much to be made out of hop growing as some honorable senators suggest, it is not likely that the growers in the Mount Gambier district would be such idiots as to discontinue producing a remunerative crop. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. They are more effective and more expensive. When the hops are ready for picking, sufficient labour has to be secured to enable the work to be carried out quickly, because if there is a frost the crop is lost. The work is precarious, difficult, and continuous, and it cannot be . regarded as remunerative. Land could be purchased in the district to which I refer at £40 per acre when hop growing was the rage in that locality. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, after the first crop. Land suitable for hop growing, which was sold at £40 per acre, is now worth £60 per acre, and is being used for the production of wheat, barley, oat, and onion crops. If hop growing was as remunerative as some suggest, the land would not have been utilized for other purposes. At the time of which I speak, the opportunities for employment amongst young people were not so numerous as they are -to-day, and consequently labour could be obtained at lower rates. </para>

Bread is the staff of life of the 5,500,000 people in the Commonwealth, and it seems to me extraordinary that the Government should have proposed a duty on wheat which is at the present time inoperative, and should also propose an increase of 100 per cent, in the duty on hops which are used to make the yeast which is necessary in the making of bread. </para>

He desires to spoon-feed a little coterie of hop-growers in one State at the expense of the rest of the people of the Commonwealth. I cannot understand such a request coming from any practical man. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has pointed out that the duty submitted by the Government is greater than the price at which hops can be grown in America. Surely high wages have to be paid for labour, there. </para>

                            asks us to believe that the brewers of the Commonwealth are willing to pay 6s. l£d. per lb. for imported hops when they might get them here for 4s. 6d. per lb. It should be remembered that hops at 4s. 6d. per lb. represents an enormous revenue per acre. According to the description of hop-growing by '.: Senator Senior it should be rather a nice occupation. The labour employed in. the  industry is largely child labour, and, in all the  circumstances,  I find it difficult to believe that

                            can be serious in his request. . If hop-growing on land worth £40 per acre was all the rage when hops were selling at ls. per lb., I cannot believe that the growing of hops on land worth £60 per acre, when hops are at 4s. 6d. per lb., indicates that the industry is in such a parlous condition that we should increase the duty, not by 100, but by 150, per cent., as proposed by

                <para>Which  we are now, engaged is the. fact that before an honorable, senator rises, to support a proposal he, very carefully considers whether any of his own electors are. interested- in i% There are about half-a-dozen- hop-growers in Victoria,, and' consequently they can have, but very- little influence upon. an. election for- the. Senate; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Duncan,</inline> is- a very- good' example of' the. kind of senator to" whom. I have just- referred. Only/ yesterday, he de.nounced the Legislature,  "with. a. fine show  ofl  indignation, for- proposing to. place, a special duty, of-' <inline font-style="italic">4z$A:</inline> per. lb* on.  prunes  but, when- the.  Vice-President  qf the&gt; Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> said that the. increase, in. the- duty had been asked" for. by- the pr,une-growers. of Yanco, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan's</inline> opposition to. the- proposal collapsed- like a. pricked balloon. He veered right round and: supported" a duty of  4½d.  per lb.. To-day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
                <para class="block">Duncan has transferred his splendid opposition to the duty on prunes to a proposal to impose a duty upon' an article which is not grown in the State which he represents. He feels quite safe, because there is not a single hop-grower in New South Wales. As the industry is carried on practically only in Tasmania, he can let himself go to the fullest extent in opposition to a duty on hops. The honorable senator has said that I proved that there ought to be, not an increase, but a reduction, in the duty imposed on hops, inasmuch as I said that hops are offered in Tasmania for 4s. 6d. per lb. and that brewers have imported hops at 6s. lid. per lb. I made it plain that, in my opinion, the brewers imported hops at 6s. lid. per' lb. out of sheer obstinacy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> refused to believe that brewers would import hops at a price representing 50 per cent, more than that at which  locally-grown hops might be obtained, but the brewers secured a portion of their requirements in the shape of locally-grown hops at 3s. 6d. per lb. Some honorable senators appear to be unable to realize the difference' between the cultivation of hops and of other agricultural and horticultural products. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> referred to the fact that an acre of hops may give a profit of £200. That is very- likely; but the re turn from- an acre of hops may represent the whole- income of a family, from- which payment for outside labour, at certain periods, must also be provided. </para>

He said that American statistics showed that hops were produced there for 2.0 cents per lb. That is the cost of production. This shows that they are produced in America at at least one- fifth of. the cost of: their produce tion in Australia. The honorable senator further mentioned that at the time the duty on hops in America was 8d. per- lb. </para>

                        <para>-It is not. The honorable senator cannot know the cost of producing hops. I can quite understand that men who have been engaged in the cultivation of an orchard, a vineyard, or a wheat farm are unable to realize the difference between the cultivation of hops and the cultivation of other produce from the land. I do know the difference, because I have frequently gone over the hop gardens of Tasmania. One honorable senator referred to the cost of hops in the making of yeast for the manufacture of bread. I might be somewhat sympathetic with that argument, but the honorable senator did not give the Committee any idea of the extent to which the cost  of making bread is increased by the duty on hops. A great quantity of hops is used in the making of beer, but 29 gallons of beer are made with 1 lb. of hops; What is, the contribution, to the hop grower from the beer-drinker? </para>

                        <para>- The local grower does not get that price. If the consumers paid only a fair price in proportion, to the amount which the grower receives for his hops, the addition to. the cost of keeping a family would be very small indeed.. Do' honorable senators wish  to  block out this industry or do they desire Australia to be self-contained? Is Australia" to produce everything it can produce with white labour, or are our people to consume the products of coloured labour in. other countries? If honorable senators will not do a fair thing by this industry, as they have done by other industries in their own States, I must accept the inevitable; but they readily increased considerably the duties on dried fruits.

                        <para>- I considered that dried fruit's had sufficient Protection  already.  I cannot be charged with parochialism in my attitude upon the Tariff.. It is necessary that the important hop-growing industry should he protected against the. importation of cheaply-grown hops from America. The statistics quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> prove that if the duty is not fairly high our growers will not be able to produce hops in competition with the American product. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> said that he could not believe that brewers would be so foolish as to pay 6s.1¼d for imported hops when they could have bought' the locally-grown commodity for 4s. 6d. per lb. I admit that the transaction  does  seem strange, but 7 am confident that the figure I  quoted is  correct. What' motive ' the brewers have I do not  know.  It  may be. mere  obstinacy or a determination to beat the local grower, or an idea of getting the future crop at a very much lower price. I am  assured by those who watch the trade very closely that there are at present in store from 4,000 to 5,000 bales of hops, which will come into competition with the  1921-22  crop; so it may be- that the cost of importing a large quantity of hops at a very high price may be more than compensated for by the purchase of the next season's Australian crop at a low price. I hope that, notwithstanding the unreasonable opposition shown by some senators to my proposal, the majority of senators will vote to maintain the hop-growing industry. </para>

He would have, done better to have allowed sleeping dogs to lie, because by his attitude in proposing  a  further increase of duty he has raised considerable opposition to the very generous duty which the Government have proposed.  His  request is most unreasonable. Years ago, hops could be purchased at a moderate price, but to-day the price is extortionate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has made no attempt to reply to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> that some time ago the hop growers were willing to accept ls. 6d. per lb.; and he is now asking for  a  duty equal to the price for which hops could be purchased a few - years ago. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle'</inline> has suggested that the brewers are paying 6s. l£d. for imported hops either out of pique or with  a  desire to defeat the local grower. .The suggestion is too far-fetched; it would take  a  lot to convince me that business men would act so stupidly. A more reasonable explanation is that hops grown in different countries vary in flavour, and that it is necessary to import hops for brewing certain kinds of ale.

                        that there were some hop plantations of 25 acres each in Tasmania. According to the statistics there were only 1,260 acres under hops in that State in 1918; and rather than increase the duty as he proposes it would pay the Commonwealth better to allow each family engaged in the hop-growing industry in Tasmania an income of £500  a  year. If
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline>
                        would make such  a  proposal he would be doing a generous act to the Commonwealth as a whole. The attitude I am adopting in regard to this Tasmanian industry will apply equally to industries in my own State. If the cultivators of 1,260 acres of hops are to be allowed, by means of the Tariff, to handicap the rest of the Commonwealth to the extent of £100,000 or £300,000 per annum, would it not be better to give those people £100,000 to go out of the industry and allow hops to be imported free of duty? In taxing an article which is used in the production of bread and beer we are making a levy upon every pocket in the community. I am as willing to give advantages to people in Tasmania as to anybody else, but I would not confer them at such enormous cost to the rest of the community. To-day when the hop-growers are receiving; 4 s. 6d. per lb. for their product they are asking for more duty than they received when they were getting a return of only ls. 6d. per lb.

                        told' us how a once flourishing industry in South Australia has almost ceased to exist. It is true that the time of which he spoke was thirty years ago, and that workmen were then receiving about 5s. per day. Cannot the honorable senator see that until labour entrenched itself in Parliament , and its unions, the purchasing power of the people was so ground down that the things produced by the men on the laud could not be sold. Now that wages have increased to such an extent that there is a reasonable purchasing power well distributed throughout

                        community this product in Tasmania, Victoria, and South Australia is realizing 4s. 6d. per lb. I know that women and children pick the hops, and receive comparatively good wages for that work. According to the figures as to the average production, an enormous return, amounting to something like £400 per acre per annum,' is secured. Allowing for the cost of cultivating, weeding, and chipping, which is by no means continuous - one chipping every two or three months is sufficient - a very big profit must be secured.

                        <para>- If justice were meted out to some of these industries, no one would be advocating more protection for them. It is not justice, but generosity that is demanded of the people who are asked to pay this duty, in order to maintain an industry that can give employment to so few, seeing that the total area under hops in Australia is only1,333 acres. We are asked -to believe that brewers are paying 6s.1¼d. per lb. for foreign-grown hops rather than purchase - the splendid Tasmanian product at 4s. 6d. per lb. I cannot accept that statement. It would mean that the brewers,  because of sheer stupidity, or perverseness, so far as Tasmanian hops are concerned, are expending, quite unnecessarily, from £100,000 to £200,000 a year in the purchase of foreign-grown hops. </para>

Intelligence is the only basis of faith. I wish it to be distinctly understood that I am not taking up this attitude because of any spirit of hostility "towards the Tasmanian hop-growing industry. I shall vote on this item just as I voted against the proposal to increase the duty on dried fruits, although dried fruits are produced in large quantities in New South Wales. My desire is to protect the consumer. We must endeavour to do the greatest good to the greatest number, and, in a case of this kind, I must vote to protect the consumer. If I thought it would be possible to carry a request to remove the whole duty, I should submit such a proposition ; since' I do not think that in the circumstances a duty is required. </para>

I realize that the basis of all duties is stupidity, but there is no- reason why we should display special stupidity by imposing <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties on" commodities of this kind. Under such a duty, the higher the quality of the article imported1 the higher is the amount collected in respect of it. <inline font-style="italic">Is</inline> that just? I ask the Minister to give consideration to that aspect of the question of <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties. I assume that i-8 will not be the higher-classed imports that will come into competition, with the liquorice we are producing, so that by imposing these <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties, we shall collect more duty on the article of superior quality than will be obtained in respect of the- inferior article which is likely to* come into competition with our own manufactures. </para>

                    <para>. - The duties on imported wooden matches  have; been increased on the British preferential Tariff from 8d. to ls. Id. per gross, an increase. of over 50 per cent., and on the general Tariff- from ls. 2d", to 2s. per gross, an increase of about 70 per cent. The protection thus given to the local industry should enable <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Commonwealth to supply its- own requirements in these- matches. But, as has been said before, both here and in the other Chamber, if our manufacturers are to keep the Australian trade, they must see that their goods are true to name, and answer to description in both quality and quantity. Imported matches bear on each box a la'bel announcing that the contents of the box average sixty matches, and Australian manufacturers ' should similarly state the contents of their boxes. During the luncheon adjournment  I counted the contents of two boxes taken from a sealed' packet of matches manufactured by the Bryant and May, Bell and Company Proprietary  Limited, of Richmond, Victoria, and found that one box contained only fifty-two and the other fifty-three matches, so that the package, accepting the standard of contents as that fixed for imported matches, sixty in a box, was a box and a half short. That is not fair to those who purchase the Australian matches, and we should see that local manufacturers whose business is protected give a fair deal to the public. As to quality, I' prefer the Australian to the Japanese matches* though they may not be so- good or have as attractive- an appearance as the best Swedish matches. </para>

                    <para>.- It may be that the Australian manufacturers are really giving  good measure, and that their boxes are not intended1 to hold! more than fifty matches ; but' if there 5s- an unhealthy and disagreeabl'e. business it is the making of matches, and I cannot understand why Protectionists should not be willing to leave it to the people of other countries. Australia possesses untold wealth which is yet untouched, and openings for all sorts of healthy and profitable industries, and it would be much better to encourage these. No one would like his children to become match operatives. </para>

                <para>SenatorGARDINER.- My idea is to bring luxuries within the reach of the people I represent. There is 'no sense in demanding the payment of 80 percent. duty on an article of inferior quality and the same percentage on a more valuable article. Apparently the principle followed in framing this portion of the Tariff has been to apply fixed rates of duty, except where some firm has, perhaps, got the ear of the authorities and secured the imposition of a special <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> irate to protect its product from competition it fears from outside. For potted or concentrated meats we have the raw material in Australia, and in respect of these commodities no other country could fairly compete with us, yet, strangely, these particular lines are singled out for a specially heavy rate of duty. It is quite . opposed to what intelligence dictates as the principle that ought to be followed, namely, to make the inferior article pay the higher duty. </para>

Those who prepare Tariffs take care that there is not enough money left to the consumer to buy a gosling for Christmas,let alone luxuries. 'If I had my way, the luxuries would go to the people who earned ; them by doing the world's work; I would not allow  any particular kinds  of food or dress to be reserved for one class, simply because others are not in a position to purchase them. I was rather struck by the argument we heard in regard to the quality of matches. In that case, we found that under these Protective duties good qualities and had all -pay the same rate; and I should 'like to know &gt;why, in the case of the present item, a duty of 2d. per lb. should not be enough . for ; all. Why not have a fixed rate, so 'that the people may know at once what has to fee paid ? Personally, I would insist on every grocer setting out, not 'only the price of the article he sells, but also the Customs duty paid upon it. If that were done, Protection would live just about as long as the income tax would if it were submitted to the people. </para>

The workers know that in the last resort they have to pay the tax, and when we come to articles that can be easily obtained from every storekeeper, I do not see why they should be made 30 per cent. or "40 per cent. dearer, simply because some rich company happens to get the ear of those who prepare the Tariff. The raw materials for these commodities are more easily obtained here than in any other part of the world. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> asks why we impose <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties. I may tell him that the departmental officers prefer at all times , to have a flat rate; but we have to remember that there are items under one common heading which embrace great varieties of quality and price, and to impose a flat rate in such cases would be wrong. It is much more justifiable to tax luxuries than to tax the necessaries of life. Take, for instance, calves' feet jelly or bovril, which form the poor man's luxuries during illness; surely no one would propose to put those on the same list as caviare? The <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> principle is not adopted because it affords any specially advantageous means of collecting revenue, but merely because of the varying values, and so forth, of articles which are brought in under a common name. </para>

                        <para>- Take the case of an old British firm, which, for a hundred years, has been manufacturing such foodstuffs by means of some secret process. When people, who know the virtue of such a food, endeavour to buy it, they are offered a substitute by a local company, a substitute which has not those properties which give value to the old British recipe. However, Protection is so blind and stupid as not to take into. consideration the real value of such articles. If a commodity is produced here that looks like something else, then for Tariff purposes it is something else, and the real article is shut out. Surely the Government ought to relent when it is  a  matter of children's foods. Only one or two Australian companies are affected by this duty, and they ought to be able to compete, in view of the sea carriage and other charges. We all know from the letters we receive how good Protection is for the individual, and how bad for the community - that is the whole history of Protection. Apparently, whenever a company that is interested presents a case, that case is accepted by the Government. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not acquainted with the position of affairs in other States, but in Victoria this industry has proved particularly beneficial. Nestle's have a magnificent establishment at Warrnambool, and it is a fact that, in some cases, the firm offer better prices for milk than are given by the butter factories; and, of course, the higher the price for milk the better it is for the dairymen. Protection in this connexion has proved a success. Glaxo is a sort of dried milk, not- a pure child's food. Duty has now been imposed upon similar importations, and, as an outcome of this protection,, a magnificent factory has been established at Port Fairy, so that the product is now being made in Australia, from Australian milk, and it is no longer necessary to import from New Zealand. Indeed, Australia has become a big exporting country in respect of these lines. If a dried milk can be prepared which will retain the whole of the qualities of ordinary milk, there will be a fortune in the discovery. Briefly, the policy of the Government has been, in respect of every line of infants' and invalids' food which is not manufactured in Australia, to admit it duty free; but upon imported products, which are similar to foods now manufactured here, duty is imposed. </para>

The previous Tariff imposed a preferential duty upon sweetened milk of1½d. per lb., and a general duty of 2d. The duties upon unsweetened milk were, respectively,1d. and lid. What has influenced the Government in making the duties upon each variety the same, namely, 2d. preferential and 3d. general? </para>

Many of the imported infants' foods contain unaltered starch, and are, therefore, more difficult for invalids and infants to digest. It seems strange that a food which has been proved by careful analysis to be one of the purest manufactured 'should be penalized to the extent of 20 per cent., which makes it more expensive for those who have to purchase it when other similar foods are admitted free. </para>

Even if we deduct the duty of 20 per  cent.,  there  is  still a difference of75 per cent.  in the price,  . and when we add to the prices already . quoted the margin between the wholesale and retail rates, honorable senators will see that 'the cost is practically prohibitive. The analysis shows Shalt Horlick's cannot be . regarded as other than a good food. It has been in use all over the world for forty years, and is largely used  in  public and. private hospitals.

                    <para>. - The Government propose an in-  crease in the duty on sweetened milk from 2d. to3d. per lb., or a jump up of 50 per : cent. In the case of unsweetened milk the proposal is for an increase in the duty from1¾d. to 3d., or more than 100 per cent.The . stereotyped argument used in support of a Protective 'duty in this Chamber 'and elsewhere is that it is necessary in order to 'create or foster an industry It is, contended further that when an industry has been fairly established, Parliament 'may step in and reduce or abolish, the duty. In this case, all these arguments are flung contemptuously on one side; or are ignored. During the last- five years  under  the previously existing duties the imports of these commodities declined almost to the vanishing point, and I am happy to say, the exports have been on the increase. The only effect, in the circumstances, of increasing the previously existing duties by 50 per cent. and 100 per cent. must be that those consuming these commodities which are now receiving a wholly unnecessary degree of protection, will have to pay more for them.. There is one factory for the production of these articles at Bacchus Marsh; there are, I believe, one or two in Queensland, and. there may be one or two in New South Wales. Because of the circumstances surrounding their manufacture, there are probably less than half-a-dozen factories in Australia engaged in producing . these articles*. Under the duties levied by the old Tariff the- imports of these articles in 1915-16 were valued at £99,000. They dropped to the value of £708 in 1917-18, and to £17,000 in 1920'. The value, of the exports of milk preserved and concentrated in 1915-16 was £23,000,, and the value of the exports of this commodity in 1920 reached £1,285,000. These figures supply the clearest evidence that the duties on these articles previously existing were more than sufficient.. We are now asked to impose duties for which there can be no justification. Under the old. duties the manufacture of preserved milk in this country flourished to the point of extinguishing imports, and I am happy to say that our products have held their own in outside markets. Yet the Government propose an increase of 50 per cent. in one case and of 100 per cent. in another on these articles. I ask the reason. If it is desired that an increased duty should be imposed merely in order to increase the cost of these articles to our own consumers, let that be admitted. Thenecessary consequence of the increase of these duties must be an increase in the cost to local consumers without any corresponding advantage to the industry, which the import and export figures I have given show, does not require a higher duty. I am against the Government proposal. </para>

                    <para>- Then I may be able to support. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior's</inline> request. The duties on condensed milk and unsweetened milk are entirely inoperative because, as shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> our exports of these articles during the- last five or six years have-, enormously  increased  owing to the activities of Nestle's firm. Australia is now making condensed and preserved milk and supplying nearly the whole of the markets of the East that were previously supplied from Switzerland. So far, so good; and it  is  all for the benefit of Australia that  we  should increase our exports.. I therefore do not disagree with the action of the Government even in proposing, an. increase in these duties, because I regard them only as a cover, for the very extreme contingency of Australia, being short of milk. So far as. local prices are. concerned,. I do not think that the duties make any difference whatsoever in the.' cost to the local consumer. I. think that if the duties were- double those proposed the price would not be increased. </para>

This commodity has been imported into Australia for a great number of years,, and has obtained a good reputation on the market. Its consumption' as children's and invalids' food has been- considerable. Until recent years it was admitted free.

                        <para>- That is so. Two or three years a01) the point was very properly raised by administrative officials of the Trade and Customs Department that as this food is not used exclusively by infants and invalids, but is very largely used in connexion with the soda-fountain trade, it should be subject to the same duty as preserved or condensed milk, which is used for the same purpose. That duty was less than the duty imposed under the schedule now under consideration. I have the greatest admiration for the very fine development that has taken place in Australia of the preserved and condensed milk industry. But I fail to see, under the circumstances I have related, why a special set should he made against Horlick's malted milk by the introduction of a new item for malted milk, upon which is imposed a duty twice as great as that imposed upon condensed or unsweetened milk. It seems to me to be an indication that, in spite of the imported commodity being very much higher in price than the locally made article, influences have been at work to, through the Tariff, practically debar Horlicks malted milk from coming into Australia. I cannot stand for that; and I see no reason why the special sub-item for malted milk should not be struck out, and that commodity allowed to be imported under the item for infants' food, as under all previous Tariffs. </para>

                        <para>- Is not enough protection provided under the item " Condensed and unsweetened milk" without the addition of a new item? When there has been a violent controversy between the agents of this imported -article and the Customs Department as to whether it is an infants' and invalids' food, and therefore entitled to be admitted free, and when a special sub-item has been inserted in the Tariff for malted milk - this being the only malted milk that  is  imported in any considerable quantity - I must assume that the Customs Department has its own method of settling  the  question. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> will move  a  request that this new item which  has  been introduced into this Tariff, and  was  never included iri any other, be struck out, I shall support him for the reasons I have stated. Then the importers of Hor.lick's malted milk can fight out with the Customs Department or the Tariff Board the question as to whether or not their commodity is an infants' and invalids' food, and entitled to come in free,  or  whether it should pay duty as  a  condensed or unsweetened milk. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so ; but the preference for Horlick's malted milk- is largely due to bias against the Australian article. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Percy</inline> Wilkinson, Analytical Chemist to the Customs Department, than whom there is no more capable analyst in Australia, has made the following comparative analyses: - </para>

                <para class="block">It must be remembered, also, that the imported article is several months old  be-  f ore it gets into the hands of the public, whereas the Australian-made article goes into the stores from day to day as it is freshly made. That is a consideration of very great importance, because the fresher the food, the better it is for the child. Imported malted milks are toeing sold at higher prices than the Australian article; but they are subject to a duty. If tUc duty is removed, they will be able to compete on a parity with the local industry, and it would be very easy for large foreign manufacturers to crush out ibo small and unprotected Australian maker. When the manufacture of malted milk in Australia was first suggested, the price of Horlick's malted milk was increased, and the extra money thus obtained was used in propaganda to orevent the establishment of the Australian industry. The Government Analyst's report shows that the local article is just as pure as the imported. Where we can make an article equal in quality to that which is imported, surely we should be prepared to give a preference to it. Glaxo used to be classified under the hea'ding df infants' or invalids' food, but its use is not confined to children, and when we proceeded to collect a duty upon it as "dried milk," the manufacturers determined to set up a factory in Australia. They have to-day, at Port Fairy, a magnificent establishment, which must have cost some hundreds of theusands of pounds. That is the sort of thing we want to encourage. </para>

                        <para>- I will obtain that information for the honorable senator. Oi. the pre-war prices a duty of 6d. per lb. would be equal to from 20 per cent to ' 30 per cent, according to whether the article was packed in large or small tins. Malted milk is largely used as a beverage in  soda  fountains, and that fact, combined with the local manufacture of the article, is the reason for the imposition of a duty. Malted milk consists of about one-third dried milk and two-thirds malt extract </para>
