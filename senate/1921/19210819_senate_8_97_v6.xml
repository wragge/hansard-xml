I have only to say that I heard but very imperfectlywhat <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> was saying, and, therefore, thought it better not to make any reply to him until I was able to obtain a report of what he had said. Having obtained that report, I wish to make the following personal explanation with regard to his statement of yesterday. Lot me deal, first of all, with the question as to the origin of this controversy. It arose out of a lecture entitled, " The' Defence of Australia," delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> in St. Paul's. Chapter House, in the course of which he made a number of allegations as to my being dominated by the officers; of the. </para>

                        <para>I know, of course, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> was expecting one of these divisional commands, and that when, he was not appointed he applied for .transfer to the Unattached List. Up to that period, he had not discovered any objection to the divisional organization. </para>

                    <para class="block">I made that statement to the press in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott's</inline> original observations. The Senate will naturally conclude that I must have had some grounds on which to base the assertion that I knew <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> was expecting a divisional command, and that his attitude regarding the divisional commands was determined by the fact that he had not received one. When I made that statement I had already received from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> a letter which I shall read, and which I may say is on the file that has been laid on the table of the Library. It was addressed to the Commandant of the 3rd Military District, and concluded with a request that it be placed before the Minister. This letter, which is dated 10th February last, contained the following : - </para>

                        <para>From the outline which you gave of the scheme, it now rests upon the Divisional Commanders in this State to select their Brigade Commanders. In each case in this State, the Divisional Commanders appointed are officers who were junior to me in the Commonwealth Military Forces before the war, and junior to me in the field until the last promotions that were made to higher rank in the Australian Imperial Force. </para>
                        <para>Under existing circumstances, I am thus required to submit my name for selection as a Brigade Commander to men who are my juniors in substantive rank (their rank of Major.General being merely honorary in the Australian Military Forces).

                    <para class="block">At that time, and up to the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> made his statement, I had no suspicion, nor any reason for suspecting, that any oiler, or, indeed, any suggestion of any kind whatsoever had been made to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> by the Commandant of the 3rd Military District. On the contrary, I could not suspect that anything of the sort had been done since I was in possession of the knowledge that no District Commandant had anything whatsover  to do with the divisional commands, and that a District Commandant would not, in any circumstances, be asked to make a recommendation. I- was familiar with these facts, because, as I stated here the other day, I had issued the instructions under which the Promotion and Selection Committee were to select these officers, and recommend them to the Military Board. In these circumstances, I did not look for a suggestion on the subject coming from any District Commandant. Moreover, I point out that, although General Brand was then a District Commandant, the district commands were to be abolished, and General </para>
                    <para class="block">Brand would be one of those whose claim for appointment would be considered, because he was one of the senior officers of our Force. The position comes down to this: That General Brand, as a District Commandant, apparently without authority, or even without a suggestion from any one, wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> on the subject, and there is a difference in the statements made by them as to the contents of his letter. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> and General Brand apparently have made those statements from memory, because General Brand says that, regarding the letter as a personal one, he destroyed it, while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> says he did not retain it; but having written his reply on it, returned it to General Brand. We have, therefore, to rely on the memories of these two officers as to the contents of General Brand's letter, and we find that their memories clash. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> is reported to have said here yesterday that - </para>

Will you please inform me whether, in the event of your being recommended to the Minister, you would bo prepared to carry out the duties?

                    <para>If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> received such a letter he would certainly be entitled to regard it as having been prompted by some one in high authority, as an inquiry in regard to whether he would be willing to act if appointed, and I would not blame him for assuming that it was an official feeler ; but if such letter was sent to him it was sent without authority from the Military Board, the only body that could authorize it through the Minister, or from me, and was entirely an assumption of authority which General Brand had no right to take upon himself. This is General Brand's recollection - </para>

                    <para>It would be quite a natural letter for a District Commandant to write to any officer in command of a brigade who happened to be a senior officer in the Australian Imperial Force. Every such officer in the Australian Imperial Force would be a potential divisional commander, and the District Commandant would like to be in a position to know whether in the event of the senior officer in the brigade accepting a divisional command he would be obliged to come down to the next in seniority in the brigade. It was perfectly reasonable for the District Commandant to say to himself, "As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> is one of the senior officers of the Australian Imperial Force, he may be asked to take a divisional command, and if he does so I shall probably be asked who is to succeed him in command of his brigade. Therefore, I shall get the opinion of General Elliott upon the officers of his brigade, and be in a position to make a recommendation." </para>

                            <para>- I presume so. Having been in the Australian Imperial Force, he would know that divisional commands are made only by the highest authority. As a matter of fact, General Brand was aware at this time that the district commands were to disappear, and that as the officers holding those commands were to be placed somewhere, each District Commandant was a potential candidate for a divisional command. It would be ridiculous to assume that the Military Board would ask a District Commandant to make recommendations for divisional commands which might include, and in the case of General Brand would have included, . the District Commandant himself, who, as a senior officer of the Australian Imperial Force, was eligible for appointment. There is a considerable discrepancy between the statements of General Elliott and General </para>

General Brand takes up the attitude that he was merely making an inquiry in order to be in a position to appoint some one in the place of General Elliott if that officer should be chosen for a divisional command. General Elliott takes the view that General Brand's letter was an official feeler as to whether he would be a candidate for appointment to a divisional command. </para>

                            <para>- It is , somewhat significant that in the first letter which General Elliott asked should be brought under my notice, and even in his subsequent letter, he makes absolutely no mention of having received any communication from the District Commandant, and as he was complaining of having been superseded is it not natural to assume that if he received such a communication he would have referred to it and asked why the offer had been made? However, he makes no mention of this offer in either of his letters which he asked should be brought under my notice, and I can assure honorable senators that up to the time he made his statement about it I had no knowledge of any such letter having gone from the District Commandant to him. </para>

However, in order to finalize the matter and clear up the difference between General Elliott's statement and General Brand's recollection of what he wrote, I am asking General Brand to state definitely whether he did use any words in his communication to General Elliott which would bear the construction that the latter now says he put upon them, and to state, if he made, them, under what authority he did so; also to say definitely whether, if he did write as General Elliott says he did, his action in that respect was suggested to Lim, or whether he was requested, or instructed by any member of the Military Board or by the Minister at any time to sound General Elliott on this matter." When I get a reply from General Brand I shall make it known to the Senate. </para>

                <para class="block">This request means a reduction of 5 per cent, in the general and intermediate columns, and of 7i per cent, in the British preference column. It cannot be said that I am taking what has been described as a "geographical stand," because the destructive effects of these high duties are felt all over Australia. It is, indeed, difficult to understand why duties, any duties at all, should be placed on items of this character. If I had my way, or thought it possible to get my way, I should move for much larger reductions. ' I realize, however, the stand that the Government are taking in regard to the Tariff, and also the stand taken by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell).</inline> I further realize that, in view of the great information and assistance that honorable gentleman receives from the officials behind him in the corner, it would be difficult to persuade the Senate, as at present constituted, to reduce the duties on such commodities as are now under discussion. I desire to use this item as a means of testing the attitude of the Committee with regard to duties on articles which are of the utmost importance to agriculturists, horticulturists, and primary producers generally. The Commonwealth has spent some millions of money in protecting aud assisting the sugar industry in Queensland, but, at the same time, heavy duties are imposed on machines and appliances which are designed to cheapen the handling of "the cane. </para>

                        <para>- A stone cutter. Implements and machinery used in primary production, and all other purposes, must be the very best, irrespective of where it may be manufactured. It is a question of results. It may be that some of these machines which I have in my mind are made in Australia; but if, for Instance, a great improvement is made on a machine in America, it ought to be procurable here at a reasonable price. Even if the machines are made here, -we know as commercial men - or, at any rate, some of us know - that when an opportunity is given by the Government to put prices up, prices go up, and remain there. To speak with perfect candour, I can say that, personally, I never saw an opportunity to- make a fair and legitimate profit without taking advantage of it. However, the primary producers, for whom I am. speaking more particularly now, must have the very best implements and machines. Amongst the articles under this item is the channel-making grader, largely used on river flats in the preliminary work of intense culture. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator will have his opportunity to express his views, and I undertake to meet any objections he may raise to my attitude on this question. These graders are not made in Australia, and thus the man who desires to turn waste lands to profit able use is faced with heavy duties. I am speaking of these items individually, because the Minister seems to have an opinion that they are merely small side issues hardly worthy of consideration, and I desire to impress on the Committee how important they are to the man on the land. Garden and field spraying machines are amongst the implements that are made dutiable. Does it 'not seem ridiculous that those whose interest and duty it is to fight and abolish diseases and pests, should not have at their disposal, on  reaonable  terms, the very best appliances available? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rowell,</inline> who is a greater authority than myself on this subject, will doubtless have something to say, and he will tell the Committee that this is no mere local or ' ' geographical ' ' question. These machines are required in the apple districts of Tasmania, and in every other State of the Commonwealth, and duties on machines that can accomplish so much good are a direct menace to production generally. Garden and field rollers and garden hose and reels are made here in Australia, but the next item that strikes my eye is that of syringes, a great variety of which is necessary to all engaged in primary production. The man who scientifically and energetically fights diseases and pests in his garden is doing a great national work. In South Australia, some few years ago, an Act was passed under which the Government sent around men who disinfected the fruit trees throughout the State. In my own case, these Government officials put a tent over the top of the trees, and made a good job of it - so good a job that never since has there been any fruit on the trees worth picking. The work of fighting these pests  and diseases is, I repeat, a national one, but the growers ought to be allowed to do it themselves. </para>

                        <para>- The case I have cited, whatever the honorable senator may think, was one of absolute destruction. Under this item the Commonwealth Parliament is asked' to indorse a duty of 22^ » per cent, upon, perhaps, the best make of stump extractors the man on the land can secure. There are millions of waste acres in Australia, much of which country should be cleared and put under cultivation ; but the clearing is laborious work. The Government have stepped in and precluded freedom of choice in the selection  of the farmer's tools of trade. A severe handicap - probably something in the nature of an embargo -has been placed upon British machines. The South Australian Government are offering £10,000, I understand, to the inventor of an implement which will effectively deal with shoots. That bonus presents one side of the picture. The other side is revealed in the rates of duty imposed upon item 161. Is there any industry in Australia more clearly entitled to practical assistance than that of dairy farming? Dairy farmers work seven days a week. The cows do not " let up " on them, even on Christmas Day. Some varieties of milking machines do not dry  off  adequately. The man who uses them, knows exactly what he wants, and what different machines will do. Good machines are made in Australia ; but if the dairy farmer considers an imported line better, why should the Government restrict his choice? </para>

                <para class="block">I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> will move subsequently, as he has indicated, in respect of a reduction of duty upon any machine remaining in the item such as, for example, milking machines. I am speaking at this moment under the strain of a severe shock. I realize that my splendid isolation in this Chamber, as a Free Trader, has departed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> has uttered one of the finest Free Trade arguments ever hear.d in the Senate. He has urged that Protection retards civilization. He holds that the man who uses the machine should be the best judge as to which make, and whether local or imported, is the better for his purposes. I hand over the leadership of the Free Trade section of the Senate to the honorable senator, and shall be well satisfied to range myself under the banner which for the future he will carry. I cannot help feeling that if the Tariff debate is prolonged for many more days there may be no Protectionists left in the Committee except the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> and possibly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle.</inline> In fact, it is not impossible that, out of sheer sympathy for the loneliness of the Minister, I myself may be persuaded to switch over and support him. Item 161 deals with implements which very closely concern the man on the land. They are, indeed, his tools of trade. Protection goes altogether too far when it makes the already severe struggle of the rural worker more intensely difficult than ever. Why should the Government, by means of a handicap placed upon British and foreign inventions, restrict the choice of tools of trade for the farmer and orchardist? The man actually engaged in producing from the soil knows better than any one else what he wants. He has probably tried a variety of implements, and knows what each will do, and which will give him the best value. Would local manufacturers be injured if any implement mentioned in the item were admitted free of duty? I mention, by way of example, cane loaders, cane unloaders, and cane harvesters. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so. But even a simple machine cannot be made until a plant has been established for the purpose. What will be the position of the cane-growers in Queensland and northern New South Wales, where the production of cane is steadily increasing? Is the Sunshine Harvester Company likely to erect a plant for manufacturing the machines required by the cane-growers? I do not think it will. * I objected to a heavy duty to protect the sugar industry, and I object to the imposition of a heavy tax on the implements required for harvesting the cane. We have protected the cane-growing industry, and the Minister is proposing a duty of  22½  per cent. on the machinery the growers require. Channel makers and graders, which are largely used by municipal and shire councils, are also included. These bodies are working on very little capital, and have to undertake extensive works on the money they obtain from land-owners, and they require these machines for roadmaking and other purposes. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> says, superior machines are manufactured in America or Great Britain, surely it would be more economical for public bodies to use the most up-to-date machines, which would not only enable them to perform their work more satisfactorily, and at a cheaper cost, but would also be an incentive to local manufacturers to produce a more up-to-date article. I have submitted a request, the effect of which is to make half of the articles mentioned in the item free; and if honorable senators are not prepared to accept that proposition, they will either have to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson's</inline> request for a reduction to 15 per cent., or the Minister's proposal of 22£ per cent. I do not see why the primary producers should in this, as well as in other instances, be so heavily taxed. </para>

                        <para>- -Frequent reference has been made to the superiority of implements manufactured abroad; but that has been a common impression in Australia for many years. Some honorable senators believe that an article  is  useless unless it is imported. The item includes a great many machines and implements which are being made in Australia, the manufacture of which cannot be successfully continued without sufficient protection. Those who are opposed to the proposed duty speak of the superior quality of imported machines ; but they do not give names. Milking machines are made by at least three firms in Australia, and I understand their manufacture would not be continued unless they were proving a success to the users. Garden and field rollers are made by ,the Clyde Engineering Works, Sydney; Hugh Lennon, Plow Machine Company, Melbourne; Mitchell and Company, Melbourne; T. Robinson and Company, Melbourne; and the Gawler Implement Manufacturing Company, South Australia. Milking machines are manufactured by T. Robinson and Company, Spotswood; Blackham and Company, Melbourne; and Bar tram and Company, Melbourne. Potato raisers or diggers are made by Lee, Woodend, and Daniels, Queensland. Sub-surface packers are made by Furphy, Shepparton; and Nicholson and Morrow, Melbourne. Garden and field spraying machines are manufactured by Langwill Brothers and Davies, Melbourne; and D. and W. Chandler, Melbourne. Scoops are made by the following firms : - Clyde Engineering Company, Sydney; Meadowbank Manufacturing Company, Sydney; Beard and Sisson, Melbourne; Johns and Waygood, Melbourne; II. V. McKay, Melbourne ; T. Robinson and Company, Spotswood; H. Dennis, South Australia; and <inline font-style="italic">0.</inline> H. Smith, South Australia. Stump extractors are manufactured by the Clyde Engineering Company, Sydney; Trewhella Brothers, Trentham, Victoria; and Cooper and' Sons, Victoria. Horse road rollers, road scoops, graders and plows are made by Kirchner and Shadwick, South Melbourne. The rates of duty under item 161 are influenced by the rates imposed on pig iron, bar iron, &amp;c. </para>

                    <para>I do not want a woollen industry, or any other industry, to get any greater protection than makes it pay to stay in Canada. But I do not want a line of Canadian industries to be. closed up in obedience to an arbitrary differential, merely because its chief competition is in England. We cannot succeed, and we cannot grow as a one-sided field-products country. No nation in the world ever grew that way. The best service we can render to agriculture is to bring the biggest share we can of its market near to its place of production. We are gaining in that way in Canada. If we turn in the other direction agriculture will have harder times. The history of agriculture in the United States should be a lesson in Canada. </para>

                        <para>- Then let me say that the honorable senator justified his action on the ground, that it would tend to enable agriculturists to obtain cheaper and more effective machines, in many instances, than can be obtained in Australia. That is surely a fair interpretation of what he said. I do not suppose that any of us can claim to be experts in respect of all these machines. I should like to compare prices in New Zealand, where there is Free Trade in respect of all these machines, with those in Australia, where duties are imposed upon them. I have here a list of the prices quoted for eighty different machines used in agriculture, and, in the case of every one of them, the price in New Zealand, where there is no duty on the machine, is higher than the price in Australia, where duties are imposed. </para>

I find that for  a  reaper and binder, 5 feet, the cash price in New Zealand, where the machine is free of duty, was £76. In Australia, with  a  5 per cent, duty, the price was £75 10s. </para>

                    <para>. -  I desire immediately to correct the comparison made by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> because of its probable effect upon some honorable senators. I do not propose to question the accuracy of the figures, but I point out that while they may be accurate in one sense, they may be very inaccurate in another. I am informed, and I believe correctly informed, that the prices quoted by the Minister, so far as New Zealand is concerned, are prices delivered to the producers, whereas Australian prices are at store or the source of manufacture. </para>

                        <para>- Nevertheless, I am informed that that is the position in New Zealand, and I want to put the Australian position clearly before honorable senators. Machinery of the kind referred to in this item is not manufactured to any extent in Western Australia or Queensland, so that by the time the farmer in Western Australia gets a harvester delivered from a Victorian manufacturer, he has to add another £10 or £15 by way of freight to the price quoted by the Minister. Therefore, the Minister's comparison was not a fair one. Australia is a big continent, whereas New Zealand consists of a couple of small islands, and the cost of transport in Australia is a factor that should not be overlooked. I am sure honorable senators have some regard for the farmers of Western Australia and of Queensland, and I am satisfied that the facts I have disclosed need only to be mentioned to insure that the interests of Western Australia and the other distant States will receive consideration. Very few of these implements are made in Western Australia, and that State, as honorable senators are aware, is principally dependent  for its existence upon primary production. </para>

I remind honorable senators that when they talk about the Australian price for these farming implements, to the price must be added Australian coastal freights, which are probably heavier than in any other part of the world, and, of course, they add materially to the cost of implements to producers in the distant States. This is a factor that must not be' lost' sight of in any comparison between Australian and New Zealand prices. If the figures supplied by the Minister had had relation to the cost of implements -at the various centres of distribution in both Australia and New Zealand, the comparison would have been fair. </para>

                        <para>- I am not submitting that there is. I am merely pointing out that the Minister made what I regard as an unfair comparison between Australian and New Zealand prices for these farm implements. The Minister, like many other . Victorians, apparently thinks that Victoria is Australia; but honorable .senators from other States do not subscribe to that view. In this matter we are concerned, not with the Australian price prevailing in Victoria, but the Australian price for farm implements delivered to the producers in Queensland, Western Australia, or elsewhere in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to make a few remarks, dealing both with the suggested request by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and that outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson.</inline> The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> in his reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> made an- accurate comparison between the prices charged for agricultural implements in Free Trade New Zealand and Protectionist Australia, the figures, as honorable senators will remember, being very much to the advantage of the Commonwealth. Some doubt has been expressed, however, as to the accuracy of the Minister's figures so far as they affect the delivery cost to the farmer. I have in my hand the official price-list of the Massey-Harris British-built Farm Machinery Company, issued in- May, 1920, in which it is clearly shown that the quotation made by the Minister relates, only to the delivery price in Auckland, Wellington, Lyttleton, and Dunedin. 'Therefore, the suggestion that the New Zealand price is the price delivered to the farmer is quite inaccurate. Just as the local manufacturer of a reaper and binder will quote the Australian farmer a price, c.i.f. Melbourne or Sydney, so the International Machinery Company will quote to the New Zealand farmer prices c.i.f.' Auckland, Wellington, Lyttleton, or Dunedin. </para>

                        <para>- The conditions prevailing in England and Australia are absolutely different. Let us look for a moment at the experience of other countries which, like Australia, have abundant supplies of raw material. Take what has been done by the United States of America and Germany. Germany, under a rigid system of protection, prior to the war was the most successful nation in the world's history. Had she been able to suppress the military element she would have completely conquered the world by commerce. She was rapidly doing so under a strict Protectionist Tariff - under a policy which declared that Germany should manufacture everything, and that Germans should use only German manufactures. That was her policy, and under it she was able, not. only to supply the requirements of the great German Empire, but was rapidly capturing the trade of the whole world. I do not ask of Australia the same degree of fiscal isolation, but it is absolutely essential that Australia, if she wants to be great, shall adopt a Protective policy. The United States, under a highly Protective policy, has been similarly successful. New Zealand, at one time, had a duty on the agricultural implements to which this item relates, but certain members of the New Zealand Legislature who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> thought they would benefit the agriculturists by securing the abolition of the duties on agricultural machinery, succeeded in doing so with the result as shown by the figures quoted by the Minister, that the prices of agricultural machinery in New Zealand to-day are higher than those charged for the same machines in Australia, where a heavy duty is still in force. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> more in jest than earnest, made several interjections concerning an anti dumping Bill, while the Minister was speaking. He has frequently made such interjections, quite oblivious of the fact that a country which has no industries to be destroyed cannot be injured by dumping. If we had no industries, and no prospect of establishing any in Australia, then the  greater the dumping that took place here the better, since we should thus have placed at our disposal, enormous quantities of goods at perhaps less than half their value. Dumping is resorted to in order to injure competing industries. The object is; to destroy the local industries, so that the people who indulge in. dumping will be able later on to exploit the market, and ultimately gain far more than they have lost by the process. For an honorable senator to say that the prices charged in New Zealand for machinery and implements that are not protected do away with the fear of dumping is to show that he is unable to grasp the situation. I strongly hold the view that it is in the best interests of those who use agricultural implements that we should do everything to secure the stability of the industry in Australia. I deny that by placing a duty on machinery of this class we are compelling the users of such machinery for all time to pay increased costs. That is contrary to all experience - contrary to fact and common sense; Like their kindred in New Zealand, those honorable senators who lay themselves out specially to guard the interests of the land worker are, whether they recognise it or not, taking a wrong step by proposing the reduction or abolition of these duties. By reducing or abolishing the duties under this item, they would, of necessity, prevent the development of the manufactories engaged in the production of agricultural machines and implements in Australia, and would probably wipe them out of existence. When that happened, those whom they are now seeking to serve would be absolutely at the mercy of foreign manufacturers, and as in New Zealand, and every other country where the same conditions exist, would have to pay the penalty of having been so represented in. this Parliament. It is useless for me to quote further figures showing the difference between Australia and New Zealand in this regard. It is obvious to every honorable senator who knows anything of trade and commerce that the people of any country who are left to the mercy of the importers are exploited to the fullest extent. </para>

                        <para>- It is human nature. In the interests of Australia, these industries should be fostered, even at the cost of some sacrifice, in order that we may be able to supply our own requirements. If our local manufacturers do not play the game, we can control them, and compel them to do so, but such control is impossible where a country has to depend upon the importers for its supplies. </para>

                    <para>. - I am going to support the request of which notice has been given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> in so far as the reduction of the duties under the British preferential and intermediate Tariffs is concerned, but I hope that he will agree to allow the duty of 35 per' cent, under the general Tariff to remain as proposed by the Government. We have heard much this morning from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> with regard to the prices of agricultural machinery in Australia and .New Zealand, but the information I have obtained from representative New Zealand primary producers in both Sydney and Melbourne is quite contrary to that which those honorable senators have given us. I mentioned the other day to a representative New Zealand primary producer that during the debate on this item in another place, it had been suggested that the prices charged in New Zealand for agricultural implements were far higher than those ruling in Australia for the same class of imported machines. He had taken the trouble to interview certain agricultural implement supplying firms and had no hesitation in denying the assertion that their machines were dearer in New Zealand than in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Even if our manufacturers can get in New Zealand the high prices which the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> says are ruling there in competition with, the world, surely they will have no difficulty in getting fair prices in Australia against similar competition. Our makers of .agricultural implements are not merely manufacturing for the Australian market; they are exporting largely to the markets of the world, and it is surprising to learn just how far afield many of our implements go. New Zealand is one of our best customers for them, and in spite of the fact that the Dominion has no Tariff against agricultural  implements,  and America and all other countries of the world compete there on even terms, our manufacturers are able to sell as many implements in New Zealand as they can manufacture and send there. We also export to Fiji, South Africa, and the Straits Settlements, and one of our very best customers is Spain, where we sell them against the competition of the cheap labour of other countries. We also export to the Argentine, Java, Sumatra, Siam, the Philippine Islands, and even to Russia. </para>

                        <para>- In some instances, the price for export is lower than the price for home consumption. We give the benefit of our Protective duty to the consumers in other countries. In a great many other instances; however, the price for export is just about the same as it is for local consumption. The point I am most particularly anxious to make is that, under Australian conditions, paying Australian rates of wages, and whatever price is demanded for the Australian material that enters into the manufacture of these implements and machines, we can produce them, export them, and sell them against similar implements made in countries where wages and the cost of production may not be as high as they are here, either because we can undersell them, or because our article is superior. At any rate, we are able to find a ready market for just as much as we can export; therefore, I cannot see the tremendous necessity for the imposition of a very high duty on agricultural machinery. I am prepared to meet the Government in regard to the general Tariff, which will apply more particularly to foreign countries, where we may in the future have to meet unfair competition; but we know that we need not fear it from Great Britain. In respect to countries to which we may apply the intermediate Tariff, unfair conditions would not be permitted to exist under the reciprocal arrangement made. In these circumstances, the rates under the British and intermediate headings are too high, and I am prepared to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson's</inline> request to reduce them, but I am not agreeable to a reduction of the general rate. This is another of the items upon which the Senate was petitioned by the primary producers, who implored us, because of the serious position of the agricultural and primary producing interests of Australia, to ease their load as much as possible. This is one direction in which we can do so. I hope that the majority of honorable senators will support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson's</inline> request for a reduction in respect to the duties under the British and intermediate headings. </para>

                    <para>. - This item affords us an opportunity of analyzing the real relationship the extra duties imposed by this Tariff bear to the primary producers of Australia. I quite realize that to the producers of this country, who have no means for the sale of their goods other than an overseas market, every pound of extra expense imposed on them by this Tariff, is to that extent a handicap upon their industries. According to the latest figures, issued' by the Federal Taxation Commissioner, the number of taxpayers, classed as farmers, assessed last year, was 42,867, who paid on the average £12 per head in. income tax. According to the same figures the number of pastoralists assessed for income derived from all sources other than casual was 11,403, who paid on the average £170 per head in income tax. I think that we can conclude from this official statement that the pastoralists of Australia as a class have done very well. As far as I have been able to analyze the Taxation Commissioner's figures they are doing better, as a class, than any other class in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, they were paying more Federal income tax on the average than is paid by any other class in Australia, manufacturers included. Seeing that 42,867 farmers are assessed for Federal income tax purposes, and pay on an average only £12 per head, we may reasonably assume that the number given includes all who are engaged in primary production in Australia outside the pastoralists. It is clear that the incidence of the protective duties on all the machines and goods required for carrying on production does not fall upon pastoralists comparatively as heavily as it falls upon the farmers. Consequently I propose to apply my argument to the farmers alone. I have made some inquiries from reputable and knowledgeable persons as to the average amount of money a farmer pays for his special goods affected by this Tariff, and my information is to the effect that the average farmer in the class I have indicated, which only pays. £12 per head in Federal income tax, buys each year not more, and possibly less, than £200 worth of special material affected by this Tariff. If a man- buys an expensive machine it lasts more than a year, but the average amount paid for machinery, wire-netting, galvanized iron, iron wire, and articles of that sort directly affected by this Tariff, and directly used in production is not more than £200 per farmer per annum. We can thus assume that the average farmer pays £200 a year for the commodities which are taxed by this Tariff, and which some honorable senators urge are thereby unduly inflated in price. Let us assume that the average increase of price to the farmer made by the Tariff on these articles1 is 20 per cent, ; then we arrive at the figure of £40 per year as the handicap, or so-called handicap, imposed on the farmer. There is a contra account, and that contra account must be taken off; we must all admit that the Tariff gives something to a number of the primary producers, fruit-growers, and men on the land. There is a duty of £6 on sugar, and £d. a lb. on bananas, and the Tariff helps' the arrowroot grower, the maize grower, the onion grower, and many others. At all events, there is a fairly substantial contra account so far as my analysis of the Tariff goes. Taking the whole of the farmers, fruit-growers, sugar-growers, and others who benefit, the contra account will amount possibly to almost £20. I am pointing out these figures, as throwing a new light in an endeavour to analyze what the exact position is. If those figures are in any way nearly correct, the average net impost on the farmer and small producer under this Tariff is from £20 to £25 per year. </para>

                        <para>- I am talking about the things which directly affect the farmer more than any other member  of  the community. I think that on these figures, if they be correct - and I am informed on the most substantial authority that the £200 I have given is fairly accurate - we must admit that there is an impost on the average farmer, and fruit-grower, omitting the pastoralist,  of  £25 a year. I for one, in admitting that, say that it is not quite fair to the farmer, who has to compete in the world's market. Rather than jeopardize the key industries in Australia, and rather than smash up our secondary industries that provide for the farmer's wants, and the wants of other men on the land, it would be far better to admit freely that this handicap is imposed, and endeavour, in some way, to compensate him in the shape of a bonus on exports abroad. That position is. I think, a fair arid reasonable one to take up; that would prevent controversy, bitterness and unfairness in connexion with the treatment of many very reputable secondary industries. </para>

                <para>On the item itself, I remind honorable senators that we are now dealing with an industry in Australia of which we may reasonably be proud. So far as my information goes, there have been  no  inventions so numerous in connexion with the improvement of machines for use on the land as those made in Australia. The harvester, and, I understand, the stump-jump plough', and others, were invented here, and I can cite another example. During the last wheat season in New South Wales the Minister for Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dunn,</inline> estimated the loss  of  wheat that would take place owing to its being rain beaten when about to be harvested, at 5,000,000 bushels for the year.  How- ever, some of the agricultural implement factories got busy with an invention of a gentleman at Henty, in New South Wales, and within six weeks there were turned out machines that eventually garnered this rain-beaten wheat, with the result that, instead of 5,000,000 bushels, the State lost only 1,000,000. There is, I think, some credit due to the factories of Australia for a thing like that. Had we no factories, that wheat would not have been saved. It is to the credit of Australia and Australian industries that we have not only led the world in harvesting inventions, but that, owing to those industries being established here, 4,000,000 bushels of rain-beaten wheat were saved in New South Wales last year. I put this aspect of the case to honorable senators, and ask them to consider it in connexion with their votes on this item. I should like to point out that there is an anomaly in the item as it stands; and it should be considered in the interests of more than one small firm which manufactures special sprinklers for fruit growing and irrigation purposes. Necessary parts which have to be imported should be included in the item; otherwise, complete sprinklers will be imported under this item, while parts will be charged, under another item, at least 20 per cent. more. That is not a position, I am sure, that the Senate wishes to continue. Whatever is done, it should be remembered that the Americans have copied every one of our inventions and used them, and that Australian invention has led the world in connexion with agricultural machinery. It is absolutely necessary, and only just, to protect Australian industries against the huge Combines in the United States which desire to grip the- world in their own interests in regard to harvesting machinery. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall be brief, because, though much has been said which might bear repetition, to indulge in that repetition would be out of place on the present occasion. The item covers a wide range of articles used by every class of primary producer, great and small, stretching out from the small orchardist to the large wheat grower in the interior. When we have an item of this description we should weigh well the effect our action will have on a great class of producers. We quite appreciate the congestion of population in suburban areas and the effect of the rates of wages obtaining there; and we must ask ourselves seriously whether it is right to stimulate that tendency,, with its result in upsetting or altering the balance that has hitherto prevailed between the standards of wages in the country and city areas. When I landed in Australia, thirty years ago, upon the Queensland coastal regions a piece of good advice was given me. I was told that if I desired to make headway in this new country I had better push inland, that if a man preferred to hug the coast and spend his life in the coastal cities where competition is fiercest he could not hope to carve out an independent career. The tendency in recent years, however, has been to discourage men from going inland. Everything favours their remaining upon the coastal fringe. Without question, the dwellers outback are under greater disadvantages than city people ; and, more and  more, the population of the interior is striking back to the coast. This Tariff will considerably augment that tendency. The Leader of the Labour party in Western Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Collier)</inline> recently said that the men working on the Golden Mile today were getting lower wages than the workers along the Western Australian coast. The same comment would apply to conditions in every State. Should the Government encourage such a state of affairs ? Must the man outback, in addition to fighting various pests and battling with nature in all its moods, be further penalized by the payment of higher prices than ever for the implements of his occupation? I know what I am talking about, for I am trying to make a very unwilling patch of the Western State productive. </para>

                        <para>- That is just what I am trying to hammer home. In Canada the duties upon agricultural implements generally range from 12 to 15 per cent, while in the United States of America the Tariff is probably rather less. What is the reason for these enormous rates in the Commonwealth? My ideal for this country is that the farm labourer of today shall become the farmer of to-morrow. The farm labourer is satisfied to improve his status by sheer virtue of his physical powers and mental ambitions. But the effect of the Tariff will be, instead of promoting the farm labourer of to-day to the farmer of to-morrow, to make the farmer of to-day either the farm labourer or the city dweller of to-morrow. Has anyone ever heard of a millionaire farmer ? I know of millionaire landlords, manufacturers, traders, wheat-buyers, and land and estate agents. There are millionaires among the suppliers of every variety of farming requisite ; but the poor, overburdened primary producer never gets anywhere. Yet, in face , of these unchallengeable facts the Government would heap still higher burdens upon his tottering frame. The National Parliament is too closely involved in city interests. One can scarcely step outside the door of this Chamber without being lobbied by representatives of some coastal fringe concern. </para>

                        <para>- The sooner the Federal Parliament establishes itself on independent territory the better for the whole of Australia. But, proceeding with my point, have any honorable senators been lobbied by representatives of rural interests? The primary producer is too busily engaged in making a bare living to waste his time or spend his money in pleading his interests at the doors of the National Legislature. Nevertheless, the primary producer is not a negligible factor. There are 240,000 adult males trying to scratch a livelihood from the Australian soil. </para>

                    <para>. - I was rather surprised at some of the figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> and since the luncheon adjournment I have had an opportunity of looking more closely into them. I do not mean to suggest that the figures he quoted were incorrect; but, although they were the latest available, they were only up to the 30th June, 1919. The honorable senator said there were 42,867 taxable farmers, that the annual income tax paid by each averaged £12, and that there were 11,493 taxable pastoralists who paid on an average £170 each. These figures convey the impression that the pastoralists to-day are doing much better than the farmers. In 1919 the price of wool, of course, was at its highest, whilst that of wheat was only about 4s. per bushel, as against, approximately, 9s. at present. The farmer, therefore, was in a much worse position then than he is in today, but, on the figures for the year ended 30th June, 1921, the pastoralist was not even so favorably situated. I speak with a good deal of authority, because I have approached many experts and business men who visit the pastoralists, when I say that to-day probably not 5 per cent. of the pastoralists are making sufficient to . pay wages and land and income tax. I do not like to contemplate what is likely to happen in the coming year. The cost of producing wool has been estimated at about 9d. per lb., but the average price of wool at present is about 8d. per lb. Very many people are misled by the prices quoted in the press, and by statements to the effect that wool has risen and is still rising in price. Many are guided by the maximum prices, and do not consider the lower rates which, at some times, are as low as1d. per lb. I absolve <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> from any intention to distort the figures; but we have to remember that the position has completely changed since 1919. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; I believe the honorable senator did his best to ascertain the true position, but that, as I have said, has completely changed. I believe that the pastoralists require as much consideration as the farmers - or, perhaps, more - because their product has fallen in price to such an extent that it does not provide sufficient for the payment of wages and land and income tax. I am one of those who agree entirely with the opinion expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barwell,</inline> the Premier of South Australia, that the only thing that is going to save the country from a tremendous amount of unemployment is a reduction of wages. Instances have been brought under my notice where men employed on pastoral properties have approached their employers and requested them to reduce wages in preference to discharging some of them. </para>

                <para>SenatorFAIRBAIRN.- Certainly not, because pastoralists and graziers could well afford to pay the wages they have been paying in the past. In almost every industry we are faced with a similar position, and I am afraid that by increasing the duties on agricultural implements the conditions of the industry will be so favorable that the employees when they see that the manufacturers are getting higher prices for their products will ask for higher wages. Then wages in the country will have to be still further reduced, while the city workers will receive an additional reward. </para>

                        <para>- It has been pointed out that a Judge is unfitted to assess the wages of workers, because he is not fully conversant with the conditions . and the responsibilities of employers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins laid it down that if any industry could not pay the wage that he thought it should pay, that industry should be closed down. What would be the condition of affairs if that principle were carried to its logical conclusion? The mining and pastoral industries would be in a most unsatisfactory position, as would also three-fourths of the industries in the Commonwealth. Wages are now fixed entirely irrespective of what they produce. I believe that a great many of the working men are reasonable enough to admit that such is the case, although I am sorry many of the leaders take a distorted view of the situation. I have been interviewed by a great many manufacturers in connexion with the industrial situation, and I always ask them what wages they pay. The reply always is, " They are very high. We are working under a log, and there is another one coming along which will make wages still higher." A new log served on the boxmakers provides that the saw "doctor" shall receive £12 12s. per week - apparently he is to be paid in guineas, because of his professional appelation - the head bench man, £10 per week, and the person who throws off the timber - work that can be done by a boy - £8 per week. It would be impossible for such an industry to prosper, whatever protection we might afford, under those conditions. It is impossible for the primary producers to carry such heavy burdens, and many do not realize the position in which some Australian industries are at present. I am delighted to learn that our implement manufacturers, who are producing implements second to none in the world, are doing well. But if we keep on demanding higher and higher Protection the wages of the city workers will be increased to the detriment of those who are employed in rural areas, and the result will be that more people will be compelled to live in the larger centres of population. I have never known the pastoral industry to be in such a parlous condition as now ; there is a possibility of many of the smaller men being ruined because it is impossible for them to pay the wages demanded. Many of the smaller men have discharged their employees and are endeavouring to carry on with their own labour. In these circumstances, I am in favour of reducing the protection afforded to implement manufacturers-. Even if 1 thought that reduced protection might be the means of these magnificent works being closed I would take  the risk, but I do not think that would happen, because they have become well established on lower duties. They have enormous protection in the matter of freights alone. I do not think people realize the position in which our primary producers, who have to market most of their products overseas, are placed. Before the war the freight on wool was five eighths of a penny per lb. and now itis1d. per lb., or a rise of 116 per cent. In 1914 the freight on tallow was £2 7s. 6d., and now it is £8 10s. per ton, a rise of 258 per cent. In pre-war days the freight on wheat was 20s.. per ton, and it is now £2 6s. 8d. or a rise of 133 per cent. </para>

                        <para>-I quite agree with the honorable senator ; but the shipping companies do not feel inclined to tackle the question of wages, which' comprise a large proportion of their expenditure. The shipboard workers are so well organized' that the shipping companies are paying high wages, which results in high freights, and no advantage will be gained until the producers establish voluntary pools, and undertake collective bargaining. The shipping companies will not endeavour to reduce freights until they find that those who own the produce they carry are taking a determined stand. So long as the shipping companies can pass on their costs to the primary producers, the present rates will be maintained. Although I am anxious to see our implement manufacturers succeed in the huge undertakings they have launched, I am not prepared to support a tremendous increase in duties. When the industries were established the duties were almost nominal, and we are now asked to support impositions, the lowest of which is a rate of 22½ per cent. That is more than the primary producer can bear, and for these reasons I shall support the request. </para>

                    <para>.- Any one who has had experience of the difficulties of the primary producer must welcome a discussion of this kind, which gives an opportunity to refresh one's memory of the difficulties of the man on the land, and to contribute something to the debate which may influence the Government to afford him a certain amount of relief. Whilst we give consideration to the needs of the manufacturing industries, we must hold the scales as evenly as possible, and see that the manufacturer is not benefited unduly at the expense of the primary producer. Included in this item is a number of articles that are absolutely essential, especially in the more closely settled portions of Australia. I have no knowledge of large pastoral areas, because Tasmania is an example amongst the States of close settlement, and there are few holdings of great extent there. The land in that State is difficult to bring under cultivation, because in its virgin state it is so heavily timbered. The expenditure incurred by men taking up original selections in Tasmania is enormous. I have known men who have worked the whole of their lives in the effort to convert the virgin forest into well-improved farms. They have reaped for themselves no advantage except that they have seen their land grow more valuable year by year, have helped in the development of the State, and have made it possible to relieve their sons of the hardships of pioneering which they have had to undergo themselves. 'Recently these men have had a very hard time indeed. It may be said that the northwestern portion of Tasmania is famed throughout the Commonwealth for the production of potatoes, but I venture to say that there is not' one potato-grower in that district who will show a profit on his operations for this year. There are very few whose returns will cover their expenses, because they have no control over the market price of potatoes. The same may be said of those who have been growing chaff. Every one knows that the price the article is bringing this year leaves no margin of profit for the producer. This is not an exceptional year. There have, indeed, been many worse years, whilst, of course, there have been some good years for those engaged in agriculture. </para>

                        <para>- It may do so, to some extent, but the suggestion applies with equal force to manufacturing industries. Many manufacturing industries have made very large profits during the last few years, and. they will not have much cause for complaint if by the imposition of duties which would give relief to men engaged in land development their profits were slightly decreased for a time. Garden and' field spraying machines are covered by the item under consideration, and they are absolutely necessary for the orchard industry. Year  after year the orchardist is faced with new pests, and with increased difficulty in dealing with old pests, and we should hesitate before we impose increased duties on a machine which is absolutely essential for the success of his industry. </para>

                        <para>- I say that if the log which has been submitted by the workers were put into force, every primary producer would have, to disappear from the face of Australia. They could not possibly hope to carry on. Thousands of men who have small holdings find it almost impossible to develop them as they should be developed, because of the difficulty in obtaining labour at prices which1 will enable them to secure a return for the money spent in their industry. Every one knows the difficulties with which dairymen have to contend. The invention of the cream separator and the milking machine has been a great boon to them. But for their aid, life in the dairying industry would be intolerable at the present time. Whilst under this item milking machines are dutiable at 22^ per cent. British and 35 per cent, foreign, they were under the last Tariff dutiable at 5 per cent. British and 10 per cent, foreign. The milking machine is perhaps a more valuable accessory of the dairying industry than is the cream separator, because of the difficulty of obtaining labour in the industry. I believe that milking machines are being very successfully manufactured in Australia. I do not know how many varieties of the machine are in use, but I know that some imported machines have given excellent results. From a conversation which I had over the telephone with a gentleman interested in milking machines, I have learned that Australian manufacturers turn out a very good article. The question is whether they can supply sufficient machines to meet Australian requirements, and whether those they manufacture meet all the needs of the "dairying industry. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some information on those points. </para>

                        <para>- I think that, taking everything into consideration, the Government might agree on this item to accept a reduction in the duty proposed on the British-made articles. Great Britain has for many years supplied us with a fair proportion of the commodities we have required; and I am prepared, in considering these duties, to give Britain a preference. I am not inclined to support the proposal to reduce the duty in the general Tariff on this item. Though I would not oppose a slight reduction of the duty in the intermediate Tariff, I think we should concentrate our attention upon a reduction of the duty proposed on British importations. </para>

                <para class="block">If my request is agreed to, I propose to ask for a duty of 15 per cent. under the British preferential Tariff. Earlier in the debate I stated that I was pledged to secure, if possible, a reduction in the duties on tools of trade; but I realize that, in the present constitution of the Senate, there is no possibility of getting all I want in this respect. In order to meet honorable senators fairly, I have submitted this modified request, and I trust I shall have their support. This is a very important matter to every one connected with those industries that are producing the wealth of this country. It is not sufficient for us to stand up in  this  Senate and talk about what the farmers should or should not do. This is a time when we might fairly be judged by our actions rather than our words. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to know if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> thinks that 15 per cent. British preferential Tariff is sufficient to protect the local industries covered by this item. If he thinks it is, well and good; but if it is not sufficient, then it is merely a revenue duty, and, as honorable senators know, I never was a Revenue Tariffist. '  I  want to know where we stand; and  I  shall be glad if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> will help us by an explanation, because I look upon him as a Protectionist desirous of protecting the manufacturers of the Commonwealth. Do the Protectionists take the stand that 15 per cent. British Tariff is sufficient? If it is not, and if they regard this item as a revenue Tariff, then I am opposed to it. </para>

                        <para>- From direct taxation, because it would be obtained more cheaply. If, instead of collecting revenue indirectly through the Customs, our Protectionist friends would allow each individual citizen to pay the Protective duties direct, I would be prepared to support the imposition of as many duties as they desired, because the people would then know exactly what they had to pay, and Protection would not last a fortnight. A friend of mine, a staunch Protectionist, nurtured in this doctrine at Bendigo, in Victoria, obtained a position as a mining manager at Broken Hill, and in the discharge of his duties he was required to draw cheques for the payment of duty upon imported machinery. He told me subsequently that, having had that experience of the working of the policy, he was not such a keen Protectionist- as he had been prior to taking up his position at Broken Hill. If the British duty suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "Wilson</inline> is to be a revenue duty, I shall object to it; but if it can be demonstrated that 15 per cent. is a Protective duty, and is intended as fair protection for Australian industries, there may be some inducement for me to vote for it. </para>

                    <para>. -  The speech we have just listened to from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> is a most extraordinary one. He knows as well as any other honorable senator that the Protective Tariff against foreign manufacturers in this item is 35 per cent., as proposed by the Government. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> proposes to do is to reduce the preferential duty against British manufacturers to 15 per cent. Eight through the schedule it is laid down that the general Tariff should be sufficient to give protection to Australian industries as against the outside world; but so far as British manufacturers are concerned we are not attempting to lay down a Protective Tariff. </para>

Other honorable senators do not conform to that doctrine. We certainly want to give Britain preference in the Tariff. That is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson's</inline> object in connexion with this item; but we want the preference to be worth something, and so we propose a Protective Tariff against the foreign manufacturer of 35 per cent. Therefore, we are giving Britain a preference of 20 per cent. against the foreign competitors, which is more than Britain proposes to give Australia. </para>

But the honorable senator deliberately said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> and I, through our attitude towards these Tariff items, desired the employment of British workmen over Australian workmen. Nothing could be further from my thoughts. I want to see the workmen of both countries fully employed. I want trade with Great Britain to be unhampered by heavy Customs duties. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> is prepared to give a preference to Britain over Germany, Japan, and America, but he is not willing to give any preference in trade  as  between Great Britain and Australia. I want to cultivate that trade for our mutual advantage, and to insure employment in both countries. Just as the eyes of puppies open after a time, so his eyes some day may also be opened. </para>

I have listened to many speeches made by him during the Tariff debates, and, however much I might have differed from him, have not given expression to my disagreement.  His  statement that I would sooner give employment to 1,000 people in Great Britain than provide employment for 10,000 in Australia was both ungenerous and uncalled for. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> says -that Protectionists are anxious to give a preference to Great Britain, but, as I understand their attitude, they" are not prepared to give Britain a preference that would be detrimental to Australian manufacturers. </para>

                            is a Protectionist, and admits that I have correctly stated the attitude of those' who share his views. Shortly put, they are prepared to give Great Britain a preference where it will be of no service/ but are not prepared to grant it such a preference as might lead to importations to the detriment of Australian production. In the case of this item, it is said that a duty of 20 per cent, is necessary to enable local manufacturers to cope with competition from overseas. Do Protectionists think that a British preferential duty of 15 per cent, will be sufficient to enable British manufacturers to compete with our own?

                        <para>- The honorable senator is perfectly frank. The reason why I am not very  enthusiastic  about Protective duties is not that I desire to see our people unemployed, but that I believe such duties are calculated to cause unemployment. I may be wrong in that view ; but even if I am it is ungenerous for an honorable senator and a colleague to say that I think more of finding employment for 1,000 people ' in Great Britain than of providing work for 10,000 here. I am quite as sincere as he is in the desire that our people shall be profitably employed, and when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> expresses surprise at some of my remarks, I think I am well entitled to express surprise at some of his actions and votes. He moved to- increase the duty on pig iron, and so to increase the cost of the raw material of the agricultural machinery makers. Having imposed that handicap upon them, he now supports increased duties on the finished article so that he may say to the machinery makers, " I did my best to make up for the handicap that I put upon you in respect of your raw material." </para>

                    <para>. - I invite honorable senators to view their handiwork in so far as this division is concerned. At the outset they imposed on iron and steel ingots and blooms, which had previously been free, a duty of 32s. per ton under the British preferential Tariff. To that extent we have loaded the local manufacturers of agricultural implements. In the Tariff of 1914 this item was dutiable at 20 per cent. British. Either that duty was too high, seeing that the manufacturers of agricultural machinery there got their iron free of. duty, or the present duty is too low, having regard to the fact that blooms are now dutiable under the British preferential Tariff at 32s. per ton. In the 1908-11 Tariff the British preferential duty on this item was 12J per cent., and under that Tariff also blooms came in free. We are now proposing to raise the duty to the extent of 2£ per cent., but, on the other hand, we have loaded up the raw material  of the agricultural machinery makers to the extent of a duty of 32s. per ton. We decided that it would 'be wise to encourage the local production of iron, and that being so, how can we expect the agricultural implement makers here, with a duty on their raw material, to continue their industry with less protection than they had before? It is undoubtedly desirable tl\ at agriculturists should be able to obtain the machinery they require at reduced prices, but if we load the raw material of the machinery maker with a duty of 32s. per ton, we cannot expect him to supply at lower rates. To disturb this duty would be to bring down the whole structure of the division. I am anxious to give fair consideration equally to the user of agricultural implements, to the man who makes them, and to the man who produces the iron from which these implements are made. Honorable senators must bear in mind the claims of all three without being carried away by any impulse to favour one against the others. </para>

                    <para>.- I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> on the diplomacy he has displayed, diplomacy worthy of an older politician. It is a good idea in a deliberative assembly like this to demand a great deal at firs't. feel your way, and then compromise. All those honorable senators who are not pronounced in their views on this question will, of course, recognise the apparent sweet reasonableness of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> and say, "Now that he has toned down his demand, we shall support him"; but I want those honorable senators who believe in the Protective policy to stick to their guns on this issue. If we are making a mistake in fixing the rates of duty as they appear in the schedule, later on there will be an opportunity of rectifying it. The Tariff Board, for the appointment of which provision is being made, will make a full investigation into the working of this Tariff, and if it can be shown to them that too high prices are being charged for these agricultural implements an alteration can be made. </para>

As a division has already taken place upon the duties attached to this item, it would clearly be a reversal of procedure, which would lead to confusion, if honorable senators now commenced the consideration of the language of the item. The Committee cannot retrace its steps. However, as the Minister has indicated that the Bill will be recommitted-, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> in due time will have the opportunity of carrying out his intention in proper form. For the moment, his request for the insertion of a new sub-item would have the effect of seeking to amend what the Committee has already decided upon. </para>

                        <para>- The point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is, in my opinion, a most important one. We have committed ourselves to this item as it stands, so far as the machines are concerned, but we have not dealt with the parts of those machines, particularly the brass work appertaining to them, which, under another item of the Tariff, are dutiable at 40 per cent. I had in mind a request in the direction of adding a sub-item clearly defining that parts of the machines - on which the Committee has to some extent decided so far as the duties are concerned- shall be admitted at some specified rate of duty. </para>

Over and over again, I have intimated that honorable senators must watch the language of the items, because any request dealing with the language must be given precedence to any request dealing with the duties. We have had discussion and divisions on the duties, and now it . is desired to revert to the language of the item in a way which, as it appears to me - though I may be wrong - would conflict with a decision the Committee has already arrived at. </para>

The honorable senator could then move a new sub-item 161a, providing that parts' shall be admitted at any duty he likes to specify; and for this we have precedent in the way shafting is treated in item 156. This would only be following our usual procedure on Bills. </para>

                    <para>. - That question need not be discussed until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has an opportunity to propose his request in regard to parts. I should now like to say a word or two in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior,</inline> who is regarded as one of our deepest and clearest thinkers, and most concise  speaker.  He has argued that a duty of 32s. per ton on iron blooms and bars has an appreciable effect on the price of the implements made from the iron. We have a duty of 22½ per cent. proposed on an article worth £20, in which there may not be 5s. worth of iron; and I do not see why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> should risk his reputation as a thinker by arguing that a duty of 32s. per ton has the effect he suggests. I cannot complain because the Senate has not accepted ray proposition to make all these implements free of duty; but I am doubtful whether I should, by my vote, alter the Government proposals when I realize that any little amendment in the duties, like any little defect in the wheel of a machine, may throw the whole out of gear, and destroy that which makes this.

                        <para>- I take it, then, that but for the British strike still more cargoes would have been discharged in this country, both during June and July, so that the Customs figures would have been even higher. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> related an instance of the marvellous fertility of Australian manufacturing enterprises. He described how an expected loss of 5,000,000 bushels of wheat, due to torrential rainfalls just on the eve of harvest, had been reduced by four-fifths. Virtual ruin stared thousands of farmers in the face, but our protected factories put on an enormous burst of energy by taking up the invention of a farmer at Henty, and turned out innumerable machines for salving the ruined crops. Within six weeks the new invention was at work practically all over the wheat fields of Australia, and the estimated loss of 5,000,000 bushels was reduced to 1,000,000 bushels. It is years since I have heard so wondrous a fairy tale. I do not doubt the word of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> He is in earnest, I am sure, and is confident that his information is correct. But only the wonderful imagination of a Protectionist could have turned an estimated loss of 5,000,000 bushels into the comparatively small loss of 1,000,000 bushels by the rapid-fire distribution of a superb invention all over the stricken wheat- fields of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Oh, no!' It was absolutely true so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> is concerned. He must make allowances, however, for my obtuse mind and my stolid imagination. I confess my inability to believe that within the period indicated the protected factories of Australia could have collected the necessary material, concentrated the essential labour, and have produced the number of machines necessary to make that extraordinary four-fifths ".save." The days of miracles are past. One or two machines may have been put into one or two wheat fields. One or two farmers may have been sufficiently wealthy to buy the new invention from one or two Australian manufacturers, but the average farmer would have had neither money nor inclination to buy one, faced as he was said to have been with ruin in his paddocks, and an adamant financier in his bank. </para>

If the figures, quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> were those originally of the Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales, it would seem that that gentleman has not outlived the delightful period in which one believes fairy tales. Possibly the explanation is that the farmers merely imagined the completeness of the disaster, and discovered that they could salvage considerably more of their crop than had been expected. </para>

I must take the earliest opportunity to investigate one of these marvellous inventions, and to inspect the factory from which it  ha3  been turned out.  I do not say that the result of my investigations may not induce me to request the imposition of duties amounting to 2,000 or 3,000 per cent. For it would appear that the new device will prove to be the long looked for means of turning the poor, struggling, hard-pressed, downtrodden farmers, men such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> into men of affluence. </para>

I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> who favoured reducing the duty, has abandoned the position he had taken up by suggesting that he is willing to allow the general rate to remain at 35 per cent. It is most regrettable that the honorable senator should be forced into that position, particularly if such a high duty is to be supported by a majority of the Committee. As honorable senators are aware, the imposition of that duty affects the importation of implements manufactured in Canada and America, which have been the means of making vast areas on this continent highly productive. Importations from those countries will be dutiable at 35 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- There is no comfort to be derived from the intermediate Tariff, as far as an easement of the situation is concerned. What position are these manufacturers in to-day? Hundreds of thousands of machines manufactured in Canada and America, if exported to Australia, will be dutiable at 35 per cent.; and if this rate is agreed to the manufacturers in those countries will be unable to send here. The high- impost, coupled with the incidental expenses, would make it impossible. I desire to know what has warranted the Government imposing  a  duty of 35 per cent. Have the Australian manufacturers asked for it? I shall prove that they have not. Notwithstanding this, honorable senators are supporting the proposed duty merely because it has the Government label on it. Why has the Government brought down this proposal for a 35 per cent, duty? We cannot get the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">('Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> or the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">('Senator Pearce)</inline> to speak for love or money, even on the question of milking machines. This is the work of the Government we are supporting, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> will have to take the responsibility if he favours the proposal. </para>

The  Chairman  of Committees said that he did not know of any suspension which would prevent him from putting the question - " That the  Chairman  do now leave the chair, and report to the Senate." Unless I speak now I shall not have an opportunity of clearing up the point whether the Standing and Sessional Orders have been suspended to that extent. I contend that they have. </para>

                    <para>- The motion moved by the  Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen),</inline> as Leader of the House, and adopted by the Senate, when this measure was first introduced, suspended so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders as would prevent the Bill which has been under consideration 'by the Committee, passing through all stages without delay. Under a sessional order, at  4  o'clock on Friday, the question must automatically be put, but if that were done now it would necessarily delay the passage of the Bill. I do not think it could be held otherwise. Undoubtedly that sessional order was suspended, because if it were not, the passage of the Bill might be delayed. Supposing it were the closing day for considering the measure, and the Minister in charge of it desired it to be considered for another hour or two, this sessional order, unless suspended, might prevent this further consideration, and thus delay the passage of the Bill. I therefore sustain the point of order taken by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen).</inline></para>

I hope that the necessity will not arise; but I make the announcement  in  order that honorable senators, in packing their suit-cases for their return to Melbourne next week, will make the necessary preparations for a possible later sitting on Friday next. </para>
