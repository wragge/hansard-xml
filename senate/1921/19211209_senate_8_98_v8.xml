                            <para>- Certain air routes' necessary for defence purposes have already been surveyed, and landing grounds selected where considered necessary, having regard to the joint needs of defence and civil aviation; but, with the exception of the Perth-Derby route, funds have not been made available for the preparation of the necessary landing grounds on these strategic routes. It is the policy of the Government to establish landing grounds along all approved commercial air-routes, so that an aeroplane flying at a reasonable height over the route could at all times effect a safe landing in the event of engine failure. This policy has been given effect to as rapidly as possible within the limits of the funds available for this purpose. Routes, other than that between Geraldton-Derby, over which it is intended to inaugurate regular aerial services in the near future, and on which the provision of the necessary landing grounds is well in hand, are as follow: - Sydney-Adelaide, 780 miles; Sydney, Brisbane, 550 miles;CharlevilleCloncurry, 575 miles. On the completion by the Government of the ground organization of an approved air route, all necessary landing grounds would have been established, but any request from a contractor for an aerial service for further landing grounds to be provided over the route would receive careful consideration. </para>

                        <para>. -This Bill, which we received only just before we rose this morning, comes to us in a very formidable guise. It is a terrifying Bill, if I might say so, not merely because of what it may contain, but also because of its form. This is another instance of what I have frequently complained of in the Senate concerning the introduction of measures introduced of late years, and especially during the closing hours . of the session, when it is impossible that they can receive proper consideration. The Bill consists of seventeen clauses, several of which are lengthy, and I make bold to say that the average layman and business man will be best considering his own interests if he does not read this Bill and attempt to do business under it without having the advantage of some one able to comprehend it at his elbow. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill is a combination of two principles - the principle of legislation against what is popularly known as " dumping " - ordinary dumping or the sending of goods into a country at prices lower than the cost of production, plus appropriate: charges. It is also an attempt to legislate against the importation into this country of goods which are manufactured in countries whose currency has temporarily depreciated. If I remember rightly, when such a measure was projected, the idea was that these two principles .should be dealt with separately and on their merits. With regard to the importation of goods from countries whose currency is temporarily depreciated, I understand that certain resolutions dealing with the subject were introduced in another place and discussed, but the criticism they evoked was so hostile that .the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> saw fit to postpone their consideration. </para>

Houses of the Parliament. I am now assured that the provisions in this Bill relating to dumping exchange duty are in terms similar to those used in the resolutions referred to. At any rate, the reception accorded to the resolutions in another place was such as to warrant the Minister for Trade and Customs in deciding not- to proceed with the measure immediately. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that is so, because, if anything, this Bill will have the effect of increasing the high duties imposed in our Tariff. I listened with a great deal of attention to what the Minister had to say in moving the second reading of this measure. He, very properly, delivered to the Senate a carefully prepared exposition of its principles. I say very properly, because, having been a member of the Senate during the period <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen has been here, I remember hearing the honorable the Minister giving voice to principles in relation to fiscalism and political economy generally that would make me wonder almost at finding him supporting, not merely protective duties, but a measure of this kind, which, if it is to be effective, can only still further increase these high protective duties. I can only come to the conclusion that he and I, having been at the opposite poles as far as fiscal faith is concerned, have, by dint of voicing our views on various occasions, made something of an impression upon each other. I feel that the Minister has come along the way towards a policy of Protection, and very high Protection indeed, and though I will not admit that my faith in the principle of Protection has weakened, nevertheless I am disposed to criticise action taken by those persons who, while primarily benefiting under our Protectionist policy, are not altogether satisfied with the very high protective duties granted, but desire unwarrantably to increase them. The Minister spoke of the legislation introduced in other countries upon this matter. He referred to the New Zealand Act, which I have not seen. He also referred to enactments passed by the British Parliament. In Great Britain, I think, legislation on this subject was introduced in two separate enactments. One provided, in certain cases, for the imposition of an extra duty of 331/3 per cent. on duties already fixed, and a separate piece of legislation purported to give effect to the principle embodied in what is known as the dumping exchange duty portion of this particular Bill. We have the fact that legislation was introduced in Great Britain. I propose to say something with regard to it, and show how it is viewed in certain quarters in the Mother Country. I also propose to follow the excellent example set by the Minister, and compress my remarks by quoting a short statement taken from an article from one of the British periodicals which I am in the habit of reading. I could quote from other periodicals comments and criticism upon this legislation as it is viewed in Great Britain, but, realizing that there is very little time available to the Senate before the close of the session, I content myself with one extract only. This I take from <inline font-style="italic">The Nation and The Athenceum</inline> of 9th April, 1921. It is from one article of a series that appeared even in that periodical, to say nothing of similar articles published in other British publications. Portion of it says - </para>

He does not take into consideration what this country's policy does that is in the interests of those engaged in the production of certain articles. I dismiss that portion of the article without further comment, and come to a later portion of the article which deals with this matter of dumping exchange duties. We are going to give to the Tariff Board power to advise the Minister  with regard to the effect of the exchange! value currency of the country of origin on the goods coming into the Commonwealth, and I have no doubt, judging from the attitude taken up by the Minister in another place, and from declarations made from time to time, that this question is going to be worked for all it is worth in the interests of secondary producers in the Commonwealth.  We have a notable instance in what was taking place until the High Court, by its decision, declared that the way in which' the value for duty of goods coming from Continental countries was calculated under the present la.w was illegal and invalid. That, in itself, shows the disposition of the Minister and the Department of Trade and Customs towards this  question  of exchange value. This is what is said in the article - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That applies to Australia as it does to Great Britain. We passed a measure last night in regard to our war indebtedness to Great Britain, and that indebtedness indirectly brings us into the position of being debtors with Great Britain to the United States of America, and creditors with Great Britain of France, Italy, and other European countries whose exchange for the time being is depreciated. The effect of this policy will be to discourage us from dealing with our debtors and to encourage us to deal with our creditors, whereby our indebtedness will be increased.

                    <quote>
                        <para>Now the supreme folly of this procedure is that it makes for a general worsening of the bad and fluctuating exchange. For it stops the only really practical method by which countries with depreciated exchange can improve that exchange, namely, by selling abroad as much as possible to countries with better exchange. If we really wanted to help the financially broken countries of Europe, including our Allies, on to their legs again, we should receive on the easiest terms all the goods they were able to sell us. For the favorable balance of trade they would thus effect would react at once in an improvement of their exchange. The policy our Government proposes to adopt will aggravate the trouble for the continental countries, and will prevent any further recovery of our own dollar exchange. But the other defect is even more fatal to the policy. A Tariff applied equally to all foreign countries might at least be effective in achieving its object of keeping out the goods our consumers wished to buy, and of substituting English products for foreign ones. But this Tariff will not do this. It will make us buy Dutch, Swedish, Swiss, and American goods instead of German, French. Belgian, and Italian. For these former countries will only send us not only their usual quota of export goods, but a greatly enlarged amount, recouping themselves for their own national consumption by goods imported from those countries whose produce we exclude by our taxation. Sweden . will send us, not only the paper she has been previously, sending, but the paper which Norway (taxed for bad exchange) will cease to send us, or, what comes to the same thing, will consume Norwegian paper herself, and send us all her own supply. No scrutiny into origins can deal effectively with such evident advantages of substitution, though it can create an expensive and irritating official machinery for trying to, do so. </para>

It involves a very serious principle, and I am afraid that we shall not be able to give it the attention that its importance warrants. I sincerely hope that the Minister will see his way clear, at any rate, not to proceed under the authority which may be derived from the passage of this Bill, with those portions which deal with the question of dumping and the variations of exchange. As far as general dumping is concerned, if it can  be proved - and there is no reason why it should not be - that goods are sold in the countries of 'their origin for export here at less than their manufactured cost, plus appropriate transport charges, let that dumping be stopped; but, as far as utilizing the depreciation of exchange is concerned, I am not disposed to rely on the Customs Department administering the Act other than in the spirit in which it administered the old Customs Act until it was prevented from doing so by the decision of the High Court. For that reason I am opposed to the provision called _ ' ' dumping exchange duties." I hope that at a later date Parliament will 'be able to give adequate consideration to the matter of exchange, and debate it from every aspect. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, if there were real dumping. Clause 8 is not aimed at real or actual dumping, but at what may be called constructive dumping, and that 'is determined by the construction of the relative rates of exchange. The High Court has, by its decision, directed the way in which the cost of goods imported from countries with varying exchanges is to be calculated. Let us adhere to that. Our, varied anti-dumping provisions in the past have been based on a recognition of that provision in the original Customs Act for calculating the cost of goods imported into the country. The calculation is based upon the cost of manufacture in the country of origin, plus 10 per cent. The cost of manufacture will be calculated according to the ordinary methods of determining the value of foreign currency in exchange from day to day and week to week. </para>

                        <para>.  - I would like to venture an observation in opposition to the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> This is not a clause under which the Minister acts blindly. It states, ' ' If the Minister is satisfied, after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board ..." It will be noticed that he cannot act without inquiry and report. The clause is still further "subject to restriction, and will be operated according to the circumstances of individual cases. If the Minister is satisfied ' ' that goods produced or manufactured outside Australia have been and are being sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than a reasonable price, <inline font-style="italic">wad</inline> that detriment may thereby result to an Australian industry, " then action follows.  I want to know what possible objection there can be to this clause by those who recognise that temporary or permanent, injury may be inflicted upon an Australian industry by dumping. Dumping may be either intentional and systematic, with a view to crushing an industry in order to obliterate a rival, or it may be the outcome of a firm or company, finding itself overstocked with goods at a given time, being prepared to realize on a surplus stock for what it is worth. Everybody I have heard in public has, with or without qualification, agreed that it is a fair thing to protect our industries' against the operation known as " dumping." This clause does that, and does it with safeguards. The Minister cannot act of his own volition. He must obtain a report from the Tariff Board, and must further hold it up until he is satisfied that the goods are being sold in Australia at less than their cost of production, and, further, that so selling them will be detrimental to Australian industries. </para>

                            <para>- It means more than that. The clause does not become effective until the Minister lias received a report from the Board, and is satisfied not only that dumping is taking place, but also that injury to Australian industries would follow. Dumping could take place without injury to an Australian industry. If motor-car chassis were dumped here no Australian industry would be injured ; but, on the other hand, if motorcar bodies were dumped, injury would be caused to an Australian industry. The mere selling of goods at a low cost in Australia is not sufficient to make this clause operative. With the safeguards which are provided, I submit that in the interests of our industries the Committee will be acting wisely if it adopts the clause. </para>

                        <para>. - It is not often that I disagree with the conclusions reached by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> but in this case his advice would, in effect, be like trying to shut the frost out of a house while leaving one door open. Part of the reason why goods depreciated in price can be landed in Australia is owing to the rates of exchange. Consider, for example, a country where the currency is depreciated for purposes of foreign exchange, but passes at a nominally higher value locally for the manufacture  of goods. The goods may be produced at one-fourth or one-fifth of what they can be produced for in Australia, after allowing for rates of exchange. For a given sum of Australian money a comparatively large amount of labour can be purchased in Germany and put into goods, which, if sent here, would compete with our own industries. There is a necessity for some such provision as that contained in the clause, although I am not saying at the moment whether it is or is not too restrictive. </para>

                        (Western ' Australia) |'8.12]. - This clause is the kernel of the Bill, as it authorizes the Minister for Trade and Customs to establish a standard for his calculations. If he is satisfied as to the effect which the depreciation of the currency has upon the value of the goods he can, on the advice of the Tariff Board, take action. Perhaps it is better to acknowledge at the outset that the Senate, and even this Parliament, . although it has a certain amount of wisdom, has not sufficient to master the intricacies of currency and exchange. Honorable senators will remember that at a meeting of experts in the Old Country, convened by the British Government, a
                        <inline font-style="italic">via media</inline>
                        was sought in connexion with this, difficult problem, but it was found that even those possessing the most intimate knowledge of the subject in all its ramifications were unable to make any recommendations. Broadly speaking, I understand that the Bill is to provide increased protection to those engaged in manufacturing industries in Australia, and we have now reached the stage when protection is equal to prohibition. The intention is to allow a margin on the par rate of exchange of 4 per cent., but immediately the exchange rate differs from 3 per cent, the provisions of this measure become operative. In a certain sense this country, the currency of which has appreciated in certain other countries, has a great advantage in purchasing. If we send 20s. to Germany we can purchase more than 20s. worth of goods, and the object in view is to equalize the difference between the rate of commercial currency and the par value of exchange. It is very difficult to say whether we are on the right or the wrong track. If the German mark depreciates still further, what will be the effect?  The logical result will be that we will get goods in from Germany for nothing, which is absurd. In fact, I have been told by a French wool-buyer that the value of the  Austrian kronen has so depreciated that a Swiss brewer actually secured  sack-loads  and pasted them on his beer» bottles. In view of that fact, we might ask what possible remedies we could apply to safeguard the interests of this country against importations from other countries with such a depreciated currency. Is there any necessity?

But it is harder for us to go to America and purchase, as the converse is the case. Countries are buying and selling all the time. We sell to America whenever we get the opportunity, but if we buy from America, where our currency has depreciated, it is to our disadvantage. .European countries, where the currency has depreciated, can purchase in Britain and America, but where their currency has appreciated they are handicapped. </para>

                            <para>- Germany, for instance, has iron and coal. The countries we are afraid of have to go to other countries where their currency is a handicap to them. I consider the provision is too severe, and favour reducing the rates by one-half. I am assuming that the rates set out in the schedule are in some cases almost prohibitive, and I would like to be informed by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> what is the increase in value. Par value of exchange rises from 100 to 105, and the increase is equal to about 50 per cent., which, added to our present rate of duty, is sufficient to prohibit the import of foreign goods altogether. It means an exceedingly heavy impost on many articles we import from other countries, including those which were our former Allies, and which are in the same position, with the exception of Germany, which is in the worst position of all, with the solitary exception of Austria, whose currency to-day is used to paste on beer bottles, as I was told. I. am given to understand that this measure is introduced for the protection of one particular Australian firm, and I hold that until we can estimate accurately the loss which that firm would suffer from dumping we should not penalize other industries and the consumers generally of Australia for its special benefit. If the firm could, by its books and certified balance-sheets, show that it suffered loss from dumping, the Government might come to its rescue with a special proposal, and without penalizing the rest of' the ©immunity. This is not the first occasion on which an attempt has been made to bludgeon this Parliament into imposing rates of duty that the circumstances do not warrant. We were told when the first Commonwealth Tariff was under consideration that there were fleets of steamers coming across the seas filled with harvesters for the purpose of wiping out the local industry. Did they came? They are coming to-day, and a good job, too, for they are keeping the people in the business here on their mettle. They require to be kept up to the mark, notwithstanding the fact that they are receiving more protection than is given to the man who has to buy the harvester. We are now informed that unless we take the action proposed by this Bill one important Australian industrial enterprise will be wiped cut. I should deplore that, but I am afraid that this is another harvester bogy, or something very close to it. We cannot overlook the interests of other industries and of the consumers generally. It seems to me that the rates proposed will be equivalent to absolutely prohibitive duties. Under this measure, the Minister for Trade and Customs will be able to put his pen through waybills of goods exported from the Continent, and decide that they shall not be admitted to Australia. If the particular firm concerned in this measure is in a bad way, the Government can authorize reputable accountants to go into its affairs, and, if it is shown to be necessary, then introduce a measure to pay this firm a bounty equal to the properly ascertained difference between the exchange rate of other countries and the par value of money in this country and in those with which we trade. If I can see my way to diminish the proposed rates, I shall do so. </para>

                            <para>- That is the very point I propose to make. He would be a very bold man who would dogmatize regarding the exchange difficulty and its causes and possible cure. I waa very much struck when I was in Europe, and was privileged to meet some members of the Financial and Economic Conference of Brussels. In the course of discussion this problem presented itself: Switzerland, a country which had not been engaged in the' war, which had not army of men withdrawn from industrial undertakings, which never had its factories disturbed or its business dislocated, which was free to carry on a profitable trade all round it, which had incurred no war debt, and which had an appreciated currency, yet revealed all the phenomena of unemployment and dislocation of trade evident in the countries in which all the worst conditions of war prevailed. This shows that it is incorrect to say that these consequences are directly attributable to war, and that it is very dangerous indeed for any one to dogmatize and claim to have discovered a remedy for these difficulties. </para>

                            <para>- It is doing something more than that. If we feel that we are in danger of an attack we are justified in adopting measures to provide immediate relief, although they may not be sufficient to provide a cure for all the ills of the world. There is imminent danger threatening some of our important industries, and if we wait until wider knowledge and experience enable us to solve all these problems, those industries may in the meantime be destroyed. This measure, it is hoped, will have the effect of protecting these industries until, perhaps, a wiser world supplies us with a more effective remedy. </para>

Under this clause, duties imposed in respect of dumping as a result of depreciated currency, those imposed to prevent ordinary dumping, and also duties imposed because of subsidies to vessels in which the goods are imported, may be collectively imposed on the same goods. </para>

In schedule A, the lire, Italian currency, is printed in the plural, whereas, to conform  with  the franc, French and Belgian currencies, it should appear in the singular, lira. This schedule will be read extensively, and widely circulated in foreign countries, and it is possible that unless the correction be made, the people of those countries will be under the impression that we do not know what we are talking about. </para>

The schedule provides for certain special duties when the mark depreciates to 240 to the British £1. Is it proposed to go beyond that point of depreciation ? I understand that to-day the mark is in the neighbourhood of 800 or 900 to the £1. </para>

There is always a liability to slight fluctuations in exchange, and it was thought that when the depreciation is so slight as to be less than 5 per cent., the effect of a margin of five points upon Australian industries would be so slight as not to need bothering about. As the depreciation becomes greater, the percentage increases in the special duty will be of material assistance in safeguarding our industries. </para>

                        <para>.- It is generally understood that when the currency of a country depreciates beyond a certain point, goods in that country are more readily purchasable. In view of the extraordinary depreciation of the German mark recently, the fear has been expressed that there will be great danger in allowing German goods to enter Australia without some adequate safeguard. A few days ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donald</inline> Mackinnon was reported to have stated that he was staying at. good hotels in Germany for 7s. per day English money, as compared with pre-war charges of £2 and £3 per day. One would naturally think from this that goods must be very cheap in Germany; but I want to point out that if the purchasing power of the mark in Germany for internal purposes were the same as it was before the war, it would have cost <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackinnon</inline> ever so much less. With the exchange rate at 205 marks to the £1, the mark would be one- tenth the par rate of exchange. If that condition affected only the export trade, it would mean that we would be able to get ten times the amount of goods in Germany, and a 75 per cent. special duty would not be of much value from the point of view of Protection. Suppose goods which cost £1 at the par rate were imported under a 15 per cent. duty, that would be 3s. But suppose the German internal currency had not depreciated; that it had depreciated only so far as the exchange rate was concerned, goods which otherwise' would have cost £1 could be purchased for 2s., and the special duty of 75 per cent. would make the landed cost only 2s. 9d. When we consider the depreciated value of currency, we have to think of its effect upon the domestic condition of the country concerned. It is because I think that the Department has gone into the matter thoroughly that I propose to agree to the schedule. </para>

                <para>Apart from the Act, which sets out the conditions of the income tax, there is a separate measure which determines the rate of that tax, and that rate is fixed for the financial year. It is, therefore, necessary to renew the Act, either as it stands, or in a varied form, each year, otherwise there would be no authority to collect the income tax. The Bill now brought down proposes to continue the rates which at present exist, the only difference being the omission of a provision requiring a single person without dependants to pay £1, if his income reaches £100, and, in the case of a married person, if it reaches £150. Otherwise the Bill provides for a continuation of the rates which are operative to-day. </para>

If so, a course is being taken which cannot be very well justified. On whatever scale their incomes may be, all are entitled to support the Departments that minister to the public welfare. </para>

                        <para>- The second or intermediate column of the Tariff enables us to enter into reciprocal arrangements with other Dominions. Correspondence on the subject has taken place between New Zealand and Australia, and the Government is hopeful that  satisfactory trading arrangements between the two Dominions will be the outcome. The imports of New Zealand produce into Australia during the past five years were- in 1915-16, £2,701,000; 1916-17, £1,900,000 ; 1917-18, £1,616,000 ; 1918-19, £2,136,000; 1919-20, £1,930,000. These figures do not include goods received by New Zealand for re-export to Australia. The exports of Australian produce to New Zealand in the same years were- 1915-16, £2,750,000; 1916- 17, £2,017,000; 1917-18, £2,904,000; 1918-19, £3,156,000; 1919-20, £5,777,000. These figures disclose  a  wonderful increase, amounting to about 100 per cent., since 1915-16 in the value of Australian exports to New Zealand. Australia has very big trading interests in New Zealand, as New Zealand has also in Australia. I think it is the desire of every member of the Senate that Australia should enter into reciprocal trading arrangements with New Zealand. </para>

                <para class="block">It is suggested that the three members to represent the Senate on the Committee should be Senators John D. Millen, Wilson, and Drake-Brockman. As copies of the agreement have been in the hands of honorable senators for some time, and they have had it explained', I do not propose to read it. I am sure that honorable senators are seized of the importance of the proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no wish to hang up this proposal. We are asked to agree to the motion, and the names of three honorable senators are suggested for appointment to the proposed Committee. It would appear that it is the intention that the Government should select representatives of this Chamber on the Committee. I do not think that that is right, and, further, I suggest that it would be wise to review the proposed selection of honorable senators. With all' due respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> I think the Committee would be better balanced if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> were selected instead of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> to represent the Senate. Two members of the Country party are to be included in the representation of another place, and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> is a member of that party, I think that if he were selected, there would be an undue proportion of the members of the Country party on the Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - I welcome this motion for the reasons I stated when speaking on the general Estimates. I then asked the Minister in charge of the Estimates to urge upon  his colleagues the desirableness of having this question of long-distance wireless determined by this- Parliament before we disperse this year. I am thankful that the Government, even at the eleventh hour of the session, have realized the importance of taking some definite step in this matter. The agreement has been in the hands of honorable senators for some time, but I have not had the opportunity to look through it very carefully, because we have been overwhelmed with documents lately, which have fallen upon us " as thick as leaves in  Vallombrosa."  It has been impossible for us to familiarize ourselves with the "contents even of those that are of great interest to us, and of importance to the community. I noticed that the motion provides for the approval of the execution of the agreement by the Prime .Minister, subject to investigation and approval  by  a Committee consisting of six members of another place and three members of the Senate. I should like to know whether we are to understand that the proposed Committee is to have the right of investigating the agreement as to its details, and approving of it, or is to be confined to investigating the policy of entering into such an agreement. </para>

                        <para>- Then we are to understand that the Committee will have the power to determine whether or not it is politic for the Government to enter into such, an agreement, and, if it decides that it is, it will also have the power to investigate and approve the draft agreement as it stands, or with modifications. I have referred to this phase of the subject because I have had some experience in dealing with agreements that have to be signed on behalf of the Commonwealth. It is very often found that the other party to an agreement, after it is drawn up and in a tentative form, asks that the Commonwealth should sign it provisionally subject to the approval of Parliament. When Parliament is asked to approve1, it is told that however much it would like to alter details, and although the Government indorse the adverse criticism of it, it is too late to modify the terms of the agreement be? cause the other party to it has committed itself to its exact terms, and could not vary them without reference to people abroad. That is why I desired to know if this  Committe  would have a fairly free hand in the consideration of details of the agreement. </para>

                <para>I ' conclude by again congratulating the Government on realizing even at this eleventh hour the urgency of the establishment of long-distance wireless between. Australia and the rest of the world. I said the other evening that there was no community in the world to whom long-distance wireless is more essential, or for whom it will be proportionately of greater benefit, if successfully established, than it will be for this community of the Commonwealth of Australia. I sincerely hope that the result of the investigations of the Committee will be such as to lead to a satisfactory agreement that the Prime Minister will sign it, and that as a consequence there will be an early installation of as good a system of long  distance wireless telegraphy for Australia as exists in any other part of the earth. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to emphasize that certain clauses of the agreement should ; be scrutinized very carefully by the Committee. One clause provides that, so long as the Commonwealth Government or its nominees hold a majority in number and value of the shares in the company, it will be entitled to nominate three-sevenths in number of the directorate, while the remaining shareholders will nominate four-sevenths. Under the companies law the Commonwealth should have an absolutely controlling interest in' the affairs of the company. It would appear that under these provisions outsiders could really overrule the Commonwealth Government, notwithstanding that the Commonwealth held the greater number of the shares, thus avoiding the provisions of the Companies Act. Paragraph vi. of clause 3 to some extent safeguards the Commonwealth. But for this provision it might be possible for the company, after it had got going, to sell the whole of its undertaking to a new company for a song, and defraud the Common wealth. In view of the revelations made yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen as to how the confidence of this Parliament had been betrayed by its representatives appointed to the War Service Homes Commission - theCommissioner disregarding the Minister's instructions, and committing the Government to huge purchases - even a provision of this sort in the agreement should, I think, be closely watched. After the warning we have received we cannot, as a party, afford to leave ourselves open to anything of that kind occurring again. </para>

                <para>The object of the War Precautions Act Repeal Act 1920 was to repeal the great bulk of the War Precautions Regulations, but the regulations relating to trading with our late enemies, the formation of foreign companies in Australia, and several other matters, were retained. It is desired to keep these regulations in force until the 31st December, 1922. The object of the present Bill is to exercise effective control over foreign companies in Australia. The Government do not wish to be hard on certain people, but we desire to be careful about others. The coal position is very unsatisfactory at present, and it will be advisable to keep effective control of that trade for the next twelve months, although we hope to be able to relinquish control as soon as conditions improve. This Bill will give effective control over foreign companies and corporations that wish to register in Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> to explain why it is necessary at present to maintain control of the coal trade in particular ? We are at -peace with all the world, and surely the law of supply and demand should operate in this as well as other industries. It appears to me that the only effect such control would have would be to keep up the price of the article. </para>

                <para>The aims of this Bill are to make permanent the provisions of the amending Act of 1915. It will make the method of summoning juries in cases before the High Court uniform with that employed in the States, and will provide for the payment of interest on judgment debts. The High Court Procedure Act 1915 was consequential on the Judiciary Act 1915, and provided that the trial by the High Court of indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth should be by a Justice with a jury. It also made similar provision for the summoning of the jury as was already in force as regards the summoning of the jury in a civil action. In the event, therefore, of the Judiciary Act 1915 being made perma  nent,  it will also be necessary to continue  in force the High Court Procedure Act 1915. As regards the summoning of jurors, it is provided, at present, that the panel of jurors shall be made out by officers of the Commonwealth. The practice in the States is for a precept or order to be issued to the Sheriff by the Court or an officer thereof, requiring the Sheriff to empanel a jury. Under the Bill the Registrar or Deputy Registrar will issue the precept to an officer of the Commonwealth, and that officer will summon the jury. At the present time, judgment debts in the High Court do not carry interest. The Bill proposes to provide for payment of interest at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum on judgment debts from the time of trial or inquiry, or, if there is no trial or inquiry, from the date of entering up judgment. The rates charged in the States vary from 4 per cent. to 10 per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - This is another Bill which has been "shoved" into our hands the moment that we are asked to pass it. Fortunately, it does not go beyond providing necessary machinery. Some hitch occurred under the present legislation in connexion with a case in South Australia. I think it was a case in which it was necessary for a jury to be summoned under one of our more recent amending Judiciary Acts, and a difficulty arose as to the issue of the praecipe. It seemed that we had provided for trial by jury, but had not provided the necessary machinery for summoning the jury. A doubt was raised as to whether the procedure appropriate to summoning a jury for a Supreme Court of a State was applicable, and, if so, how far, for summoning a jury under the Federal Judiciary Act. It was thought for the time that our legislation would prove abortive. If this Bill is intended to overcome that difficulty, and to provide the necessary machinery, so that the precept for the jury can be made in the State by the appropriate Commonwealth or State officers, and the summoning of the jury can be carried tout by the Federal officers, it is legislation that is required. </para>

                <para>Honorable senators will remember the great fight that took place as to whether the Repatriation Department should support soldiers who have established Australian co-operative companies. The purpose of the Bill is to permit the Department to advance to the Returned Soldiers' Woollen Company of Geelong sums of money not exceeding £50,000. I believe all the machinery necessary is available to help them to establish this great industry in that city. After a long fight on this question, the soldiers won in this case by getting the preference. The Government is prepared to stand at the back of them, and I think Parliament unanimously desires it to do so. I am sure that the citizens of Australia- are quite prepared to offer their wealth as a security to help the soldiers on their feet in this undertaking. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know whether the title set out in this' clause is the correct one or not. It may be a misnomer. It may be misleading concerning the exact nature of this limited company. I am sorry that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> should have said that he was not here to give such details as honorable senators might seek on the second reading. There have been numbers of concerns of a cooperative character established by returned soldiers in the various States; but they have found it impossible to secure any measure of assistance from the Government either under the Repatriation Act or any other Statute. Honorable senators naturally want to know why one business venture in Victoria can actually secure a loan of £50,000, entailing the passage of a special Act, while other soldiers' co-operative companies cannot even persuade the Government to cash their gratuity 'bonds. Returned soldiers in Tasmania started a co-operative business at Hobart. Among the- capital subscribed is £7,000 worth of war ^ gratuity bonds. The company may borrow from the Commonwealth Bank up to about 40 per cent, of the face value of the bonds; but that is the inadequate extent of the assistance which the Government will offer. Soldiers all over Australia have every right to ask what influence is at work in Victoria which can secure such favours for a local scheme, which is not purely a soldier's concern. Here is a proposition for the Government to make an advance of £50,000. The necessary Bill is being pushed through amidst the congestion and rush of the last hours of the session, while other schemes, in which soldiers solely are interested, are ignored. I do not oppose the Bill; but I demand an explanation on behalf of soldier organizations which would 'be glad to receive help not to the extent of £50,000, but in the humble direction of having £5,000 worth of bonds cashed. </para>

                    <para>.- This company has not .been in any better position than those to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> has referred. It was floated with a capital of £100,000, and was strictly limited to returned soldiers or their dependents. The usual method of obtaining shares was to exchange gratuity bonds for them. A few thousand pounds was subscribed in cash by shareholders who preferred to retain their bonds or had cashed them in other directions. Shares to the value of more than £70,000 have been taken up. With the capital thus made available, a piece of land was purchased on the Barwon. A factory building was commenced, and the manager was sent to England to purchase machinery. Difficulties arose in respect  of securing Government assistance. First, the benefits which may be conferred by the Act are strictly limited tq soldiers alone. As there are soldiers' dependants among the shareholders, a serious difficulty arose. Then there was another disability. The Act is applicable only to concerns in which none but former soldiers are employed, and all the shareholders must be employees. It is impossible to start a woollen factory with any prospect of success unless the amount of capital available is at least £100,000. I hold five shares of £20 each - the maximum number which may be held by any one shareholder. Thus, in order to employ ali the shareholders, some 5,000 men would have to be employed which., of course, would be absurd, and impossible at the outset of such a concern, and  outsiders like myself would have to be got rid of, which again would be impossible if the necessary capital was to be obtained. The next trouble which developed was that, among all the returned soldiers in the land, none .could be found who possessed the necessary qualifications to undertake the management. It is essential that such a person shall he a highly technical and skilled man. Indeed, to have gained sufficient experience, it is almost certain that such a person must be beyond the age limit of a soldier. </para>

                        <para>- Even then, we would have been no nearer to securing assistance under the Act; we would be employing one person at least who was not a returned man. The whole business has been held up for a long time. When the proposition was first brought under this attention of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> - prior to the passage of the Repatriation Act - the right honorable gentleman heartily approved. Returned men and their dependants subscribed their gratuity bonds on the understanding that the company would come' within the purview of legislation then about to be introduced. Ultimately, however, when the Act was passed in its present form, the company was cut out from all possibility of benefiting. Widows and children of deceased soldiers had been allowed to take up shares by subscribing their bonds as capital. Thus there were shareholders in the company not returned soldiers, and a manager a non-soldier, as I have already pointed out, beside returned men. The facts prevented the Minister from making an advance. It became necessary to request the Government to pass a special Act. That is the measure before the Committee. </para>

                <para>With respect to the question of security, the Government will have first call upon the whole of the capital subscribed. They can take their security by way of mortgage on the land, factory, and machinery. Seeing that the capital subscribed, as well as the capital which the Government are advancing, will be invested, there should be a margin of 50 per cent, security for the Government in respect of their advance. Further, the Government will have the power to watch the trading account and see how the business develops. If it is perceived that the concern is being badly managed, it can be closed down and the liability got rid of. The new building is adjacent to the Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong, and, if the soldiers' efforts should prove a failure, the Government will be able to take over the concern and run it as part of the Government mills, under their own management. Altogether, the Government are amply safeguarded, and honorable senators need have no hesitation in giving the project their support. </para>

                    <para>. - I indorse and emphasize the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster.</inline> The Returned Soldiers' Association at Hobart has opened co-operative stores, and, for some time those in control have been endeavouring unsuccessfully to persuade the Government to cash the bonds which they hold as part of their subscribed capital. I do not cavil at the proposition before the Committee, provided that the circumstances of the case warrant the advance. But I hope that the procedure in connexion with the Geelong venture may be taken as an earnest of better things to come for soldier concerns such as that in Hobart. </para>

With respect to the Hobart company, its directors have given their assistance honorarily. They are doing their best to give the soldiers the benefit of their experience with a view to make available the necessaries of life at the cheapest possible rates. In Victoria, because the returned men have here the finest and most authoritative advocate of all, the friends of the various soldier movements - although some soldiers do not recognise that fact - special preference is easily secured. </para>

                    <para>. - I can quite understand the attitude adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster;but</inline> he should remember that the circumstances are not identical. Senator Elliott put the position very clearly, and explained that the shareholders in that undertaking found sufficient of their own capital to provide the land, some of the buildings and a portion of the machinery. When the industry was first established, the men were under the impression that they would be able to secure an advance under the Repatriation Act. They appealed to the Minister for* Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen),</inline> and explained the position; but after making inquiries he discovered that there were certain shareholders who were not returned soldiers. The Minister then informed the representatives of the men that the Government could not advance the company a single penny, because the Repatriation Act provides that money may be advanced to co-operative concerns in which the whole of the shares are held by returned soldiers or their dependants. The industry at Geelong was therefore placed in a most precarious position, because between £30,000 and £40,000 had already been expended in land, buildings, and machinery. An appeal was then made to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who realized that the Government could not allow the money that had been invested to be sacrificed, particularly as much of it had been earned on the battlefields. </para>

                        <para>- I shall show that it is before I have finished. I have, in common with other honorable senators, endeavoured to obtain, not £50,000, but a few hundred pounds for returned soldiers engaged in a co-operative undertaking in Western Australia. The case to which I refer is a new industry engaged in the manufacture of tool handles, and, after a good deal of pressure, we were successful in. getting a few hundred pounds. There are a number of woollen mills in this State, and, in this instance, there is a Government mill in the same locality. There are other industries that could be established, and there should be a diversifying of industries as much as possible, especially when Government money is coming to the rescue. The industry in Western Australia is holding its own, and has been assisted to the extent of only a few hundred pounds, which was forthcoming after a good deal of pressure, beseeching, and imploring on its behalf. </para>

When one peruses the records it will  be found that Victoria has fared very well when compared with other States, and in this connexion, I may refer to the Auditor-General's report of last year, on page 41 of which will be. found the amounts advanced by the Commonwealth to the States. </para>

The Bill deals with loaning money for a specific purpose, and, although I do not wish to unduly restrict discussion, I can permit only a passing allusion to the matter which the honorable senator was about to discuss. </para>

The point on which I desire to centre attention is this: That while 'the Government of the Commonwealth undertook only to advance Victoria £10,300,000 a sum of £10,700,000 was actually obtained by that State. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the Government should have a fixed policy in regard to the making of advances to co-operative companies of returned soldiers. It should not be possible for a party of returned soldiers merely because they happen to reside close to the administrative centre, and to be under the eye of the responsible Minister, to secure a preference. We have found it hard te obtain even a modicum of justice for returned soldiers further afield. If I came from Victoria, I should have nothing of which to complain, but this granting of assistance in an indiscriminate way is on a wholly wrong basis. The Minister should have an Advisory Board to inform him as to the merits of applications for advances of this kind on the part of returned soldiers in all the States, and to advise him as to the order in which they should' be dealt with. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am totally opposed to the suggestion just made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that an Advisory- Board should be appointed  to assist the Minister in these matters. I am about tired of such Boards. Ministers should be prepared to take the responsibility for their own actions. We should probably have been better off today if we had had more confidence in ourselves and less confidence in other people. I regret the tone of the debate, which has certainly not been calculated to give dignity to the proceedings of the Committee. If the Australian soldiers in fighting overseas had had regard only to the States from which they came instead of fighting as a united body, they might not have been so successful. As it was, they fought as soldiers of the Commonwealth without regard to State boundaries, </para>

                        <para>- This Bill represents a new departure. For a long time I, in common with many others, believed that we had power under the Repatriation. Act to assist -co-operative companies of returned soldiers. We ultimately discovered that we had no such power under that Act, and after a big fight on the floor of the House it was decided that a sum of £250,000 should be appropriated to enable the Government to assist such cooperative efforts, In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster,</inline> I would say that I fully appreciate the difficulties that have arisen in regard to some co-operative societies. I know of some which are presumed to consist solely of returned soldiers, but which, in fact, do not. In their own interests the soldiers in such enterprises should clean them up, and see that only returned men are shareholders. Many people trade on the names of returned soldiers and do good business, although they do not wholly employ returned men. The company with which this Bill deals, however, is confined, to returned soldiers. The Government would not make advances of this kind to an ordinary public company. It is true, as has been said, that we are making a start with this scheme in Victoria. The returned soldiers in this State have a very progressive organization, and it has been urging the Government for some time to take action in this direction. A stranger might gather from the observations of some honorable senators that the re turned soldiers of other States are fools - that; although in this case we are advancing £50,000 to a co-operative company of returned men in Victoria, soldiers in Tasmania, New South Wales, and elsewhere would not think it possible to obtain the same assistance. The position is that returned men in all the States can demand this help. How could we refuse applications for assistance of this kind on the part of bodies of returned soldiers in any State? As long as the money lasts we must assist the men to set up these industrial enterprises. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain,</inline> in the course of a long explanation, has suggested that soldiers, when carrying on business, sometimes get into difficulties. That, however, is .not a very good argument for making advances to them. A good deal of sneering has been indulged in, I regret to say, in regard to the different States, and special mention has been made of the fact thaw Victoria has received by way of advances for soldier settlement over £10,000,000. I wish she had received £15,000,000, since it would mean that still more returned men had been placed on the land. As it is, in proportion to her population, Victoria has settled 50 per cent, more soldiers on the land than has any other State. During the last two years we have not been able to make advances for soldier settlement as freely as before, because of. the difficulties of the money market; but Victoria has put up a wonderful performance in soldier settlement, and I am glad to say that the men, particularly those engaged in wheat forming, are doing very well. </para>

I believe that Australia has done as well as any other country so far as the treatment of her returned men is concerned. I remind honorable senators that the  returned soldiers in this co-operative company axe risking their own money, as they have to provide 50 per cent, of the capital. I shall bring under the notice of the Cabinet the view unanimously expressed by honorable senators that something should be done on these lines for the returned soldiers in all the States. We, want to help genuine co-operative companies consisting of returned soldiers, and not individuals who try to make use of the returned soldiers for their own profit. There are smart men who do not hesitate to do so. </para>

                    FOSTER  (Tasmania) [9.8 J. -  I  desire to thank the Minister
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline>
                    for the promise he has made. It is well from the point of view of the Administration, as well as the soldiers themselves, that it should be widely known that the Government are prepared to consider favorably applications by groups of returned soldiers in all the States for advances to assist them in genuine cooperative enterprises. The information just given by the Minister will do the Government good and the soldiers good. I only regret that so much time has been spent in obtaining it from him.

Is it ^ to rest entirely in his own discretion? Under the preceding clause, the Treasurer is authorized to obtain from the company such security as he thinks necessary. Suppose he takes security in the form of a mortgage in which there is a condition such as that referred to in this clause, and he considers, at a certain stage, that the condition is not being complied with, will he be entitled, under sub-clause 2, to be judge in his own case, enter into possession, and dispose of the assets of the company -as he thinks fit; or will it be necessary for him, as in an ordinary case of foreclosure under a mortgage, to take the ordinary proceedings in Court.

It is wonderful how soon the shareholders of a company become panic-stricken if it is not doing well; and if such a thing were to arise in connexion with this company, I have no doubt that the Government would help it in every way, and would certainly administer the Act sympathetically. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> considers the clause objectionable, he might make a suggestion for ito amendment. The Government have never entertained the idea that the Treasurer would do anything unfair to the company to whom it is proposed to advance this money. </para>

                    <para>.- The clause is all right as it stands. It is necessary that the Government should have ample security. This clause will not give the Treasurer any greater power than is frequently given in connexion with a trading company that issues debentures. In the case of such a company, there is always provision made for the appointment of a receiver, if at any time the debenture-holders become suspicious of the financial position of the company, to enter into possession and wind up the company. </para>

In a great many cases it has been a matter of doubt whether men who suffered from certain complaints and diseases prior to enlistment had their sufferings accentuated as a result of their war service, and in consequence they have been denied pensions. This Bill is introduced to give effect to a desire to review the attitude hitherto adopted towards these cases. A very careful medical examination will, of course, be made, but wherever it is shown that war service has impaired the health of the returned soldier he will be included in the pension list. I hope that the Bill will result in providing relief for many hard cases that exist in Australia to-day. </para>

                        <para>. - This is a very important measure. The Bill we have just disposed of is the annually recurring Bill for fixing the rate of the income tax, whereas this Bill seeks to amend a very complicated, intricate, and involved measure, namely, the Income Tax Assessment Act. It is a Statute which very few people in the Commonwealth can read understandingly, but yet, in the closing hours of this session, we are asked to amend it in several important respects. How important they are I am not in a position to say, but if one reads the Bill, even without comparing it with the original Act, which it is really necessary to do in order to enable one to properly understand it, the very far-reaching nature of the amendments will be seen. I am certain that if we pass the measure as it stands the result on existing legislation will be surprising to each and every one of us, and that for some time to come every honorable senator will be bombarded with inquiries from all quarters as to why Parliament, in the closing hours of this session, legislated in this or that direction in relation to this particular Bill. I do not pretend to be able to understand the significance of all these amendments. We have the same difficulty to-night that we always experience when dealing hurriedly with legislation in the last few days of the session; we have not the benefit of a memorandum, indicating in ordinary type, black type, and erased type, the nature and purpose of the proposed amendments. I venture to say that we have not dealt with any measure for a considerable time past which has more justified the adoption of that procedure than this does. I do not think that what the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> has had to say in moving the second reading has given us any insight into the effect or purpose of. the Bill. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The  Income Tax Department stands in a very peculiar position; it comes into direct relationship with a great number of residents of the Commonwealth. Constituents of honorable members in every State are deeply affected by the association they occasionally or regularly have, perhaps more often than once a year, with this Department. By our legislation we have conferred on the Commissioner of Taxation and his officers certain authority over the taxpayer. If the latter makes a mistake or omission, it is always at his peril. The Income Tax Office can make errors, and does make errors, but not at its peril, and never at its cost. Last night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> referred to another Bill as a "double-headed penny." The designation might very appropriately be applied in respect to the errors that occur in transactions between the taxpayer and the Income Tax Offi6e. I cannot say what additional powers are given to the Department under this Bill, but a very cursory glance at some of the provisions it contains assures me that some very revolutionary alterations are proposed. For instance, clause 2 alters the definition of the word "Income," and proposes to include what has never been included before, namely, "  the  amount for which trading assets have been sold, whether they are sold with the business as a going concern, or in any other manner Avhatsoever." I presume that hitherto, if a man sold out and received £5,000 for the assets of his business, it has been treated as capital. </para>

A man who has an income of £800, and has £10,000 invested in assets, pays income tax each year on £800, according to the rate of the curve of the tax, but if he sells his assets for £10,000, his income for the year is to be regarded as £800, plus £10,000, and he will not get the full £10,000 because the Income Tax Department will regard it as a very heavy income, and by the application of the curve of the tax, which makes the rate exceedingly high on large incomes, scoop a few thousand pounds out of it. </para>

                            <para>- It is really a levy on capital. Income, according to clause 2, will not, in future, include " any rebate received by a member of a co-operative company based on his purchases from that company, where the company is one which usually sells goods only to its own members." That is probably a very desirable provision. If the Department has been regarding as portion of a man's income the rebates which he has received from a co-operative concern of which he is a member, and which only sells to its own members, it is only fair, if the Government seriously wish, to encourage cooperation, not to include such rebates in a man's income. </para>

I am not in a position to say what effect this provision is likely to have; but honorable members who are more experienced in grazing matters will probably know better than I do its relation to the provisions of the original Act. </para>
                    <para>These amendments are only portion of one page of a Bill running into ten pages, and if they are a sample of what the measure contains, all I can say is that it is not fair to the Senate, to any honorable senator, or to the public, that this Chamber should be asked to take it into consideration when there are not even sufficient copies of the Bill available to circulate among honorable senators. I protest against our being asked to enact legislation blindfold in this way. Within the last day or so, we have been asked to do so with regard to other measures. I sat here for the whole of last night endeavouring to familiarize myself with ' the several measures that were being brought forward in quick succession. Certainly they were short, and many of them were machinery Bills, and to some extent I was able to keep in touch with their contents. But ' I frankly confess that I am unable, in the time at my disposal, to understand what this Bill is aiming at, and I would, not be doing right by those who sent me here if I did not protest against this method of legislation. </para>

                            <para>- I do. Last night I was able to keep pace with the measures that . were coming forward, thanks to some extent to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> who occupied the attention of the Senate in his criticism of the several measures, and the breathing space thus afforded me, gave me an opportunity to delve into the several Bills, and in a superficial way familiarize myself with their contents. But if my honorable friend stood up now and spoke for an hour, thus giving me an opportunity to study this measure, I do not think it would help me very much. I hope the Minister will not persevere with it. It is true that a Royal Commission has been making inquiries into taxation matters generally. I do not know that it has finalized its labours, but I have not the slightest doubt that when it does the report submitted to Parliament will have some relevancy to our income tax assessment legislation. If legislation on the lines of this Bill is necessary, has this necessity become apparent only within the last few days or the last week or two? Parliament has been sitting for quite a considerable time. On several occasions the Senate was adjourned because there was no business for it. If there was a necessity for this legislation, that necessity must have been apparent to the Commissioner and the Treasury officials long since. The Senate should insist upon its rights. Before being asked to enact far-reaching legislation of this character it should demand a proper and adequate opportunity for understanding what it is doing. The fact that the Taxation Commission has not furnished its final report is an added reason why the Minister should not proceed with the Bill. The Government ought to realize that it is not fair to this Chamber or to the public to expect legislation of this kind to be enacted in this way. If we do proceed with the Bill we shall be legislating blindly. </para>

                        <para>. - I must confess that I find myself in m.uch the same mental condition as Senator Keating does. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> observed, by way of interjection just now, that both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> and I, being members of the legal profession, perhaps had qualifications for the interpretation of Statutes a little more highly developed than in the case of the majority of honorable senators. Despite the possession of that qualification, I confess that ' I do not understand this Bill. I have not had enough time to discover what is in it, and, added to my difficulties, I had no sleep last night - I believe other honorable senators' are in the same position - and therefore my mental condition is not so; alert as it might be. We have been in session for nearly twelve months. There has been a demand from time to time, in Parliament and out of it. for certain amendments of the Income Tax Assessment Act, and yet at the very last hour in the life of this session we are asked to deal with, and try to understand, this very complex Bill embodying the amendments referred to. </para>

                            <para>- I do not understand it, but I understand that it is going to affect very materially the method of assessment of taxation on incomes right throughout Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has drawn attention to the objectionable features of clause 2. The Taxation Commission, which has been inquiring into the incidence of taxation, has issued an interim report advising the Government that some measure of relief should be given to those taxpayers engaged in primary industries and to those who have to pay double taxation. If honorable senators will look at the Bill, they will find that out of twelve clauses there are only two giving effect, as I understand the position, to the recommendations  of the Commission. The other ten Clauses refer to a variety of matters, and evidently have been put in at the instigation of the Taxation Commissioner. We know nothing about them. I am not going to stand for this system of legislation. I demand an opportunity of understanding a Bill of this nature, and certainly I want to know the effect of the other ten clauses. I am certainly not going to accept them. I shall vote against the measure. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear the Minister say that, because the clause is most objectionable. Let me give honorable senators a concrete illustration of what I mean. The case was, I believe, mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowden</inline> in another place. There was an old lady who had £2,000 worth of shares in a company returning 10 per cent. The company reconstructed and issued to this lady 4,000 shares bearing 5 per cent, interest, instead pf the 2,000 shares returning 10 per cent.  Her  income was unaltered. She was getting 5 per cent, on 4,000 shares instead of 10 per cent, on 2,000 shares, so her income was £200 per annum. When the reconstruction took place, she was taxed on income for that year of £2,200 ! That is in this Bill. There are, before the Courts at the present time, a large number of cases contesting the construction put on this phase of taxation by the Commissioner. </para>

                            <para>- BROCKMAN. - Yes; it is a case of "heads I win, tails you lose." This Bill was rushed through another place, but fortunately we are able in some degree to analyze it and discover its iniquity. I think, further, that if the Government did not understand the meaning of the measure before, they have now discovered it. This Bill is the outcome of the Taxation Commission, who, in a double-headed penny " sort of way, got the Government to accept their recommendation; and if we had time we might be able to discover further iniquities. I am not suggesting for a moment that my interpretation is complete, or is to be accepted as final, for it is the result of a very cursory examination, owing to insufficient time. Clause 2, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> drew attention, alters the very meaning of the word "income." It provides that the amount for which trading assets have been sold, whether with the business asa going concern or in any other way, shall be deemed to be income. If a man buys a couple of thousand sheep out of capital, and after keeping them for twelve months as an asset of his property then sells them, the money he receives is " income." </para>

Under the sub-clause there is not included live stock which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is used as working animals or for breeding purposes, but there is included all other live stock. If a man has ewes which he is using for breeding purposes, they are not included; but if he has ewes or wethers for fattening, and he sells them, the money he receives is treated as income. In order that I may not be misunderstood, I confess once more that I do not profess to completely understand the Bill. I think I can say without egotism, however, that if I cannot understand it, I doubt very much whether there are more than one or two here who are better qualified in that regard than I am. </para>

                            <para>- It all depends on the amount of revenue. If the Bill is necessary to tighten up the existing Statute for other purposes, I hesitate to take a hand in throwing it out. But if the revenue is only slightly affected, or it merely means a variation of the terms of assessment, or a general overhaul of the Act as it stands, we might very well postpone it until Parliament re-assembles. If the revenue is going to lose seriously by reason of this measure, I should like to take a hand in rejecting it. </para>

                        <para>.- The main argument urged in favour of the Bill is the relief it will afford to pastoralists. Unfortunately, however, that particular provision of the Bill does not  come into operation for a couple of years, so that the urgency, from the point of view of the pastoralists, does not seem to be very great. 'There were members of another place who would have made that clause operative straight away, and I cannot see why it has been postponed. I have nothing to add to the able arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> who have pointed out the difficulties and dangers of going on with the Bill. I remind the Senate, however, that yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen emphatically laid it down that he is not responsible for what has happened under the Repatriation Act, holding that Parliament, who passed that Act, must take full responsibility for all the- evils that arose. It would seem that when a Bill has been introduced and explained, or not explained, and whether we have had an opportunity of studying it for ourselves, then, judging from what, happened yesterday, if anything goes wrong, the Ministry may wash their hands of all responsibility, and place it on us. That is not a fair proposition when legislation is rushed through like this. I have much regret in turning down a measure designed to relieve the pastoralists, who may have a bad time in the near future ; but the opinion which I have formed of the Bill from the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> compel me to vote against it. </para>

                        <para>. - I have listened with a great deal of interest to the remarks of honorable senators, from which one would conclude that they were the only persons who had had no sleep last night. I have a good deal of sympathy for them, and realize that their sufferings in that regard may account for one or two of the rambling statements we have heard. Honorable senators say they have not found time to read the Bill, and that is to be. regretted ; but I also suffer from a great disadvantage at the present time in dealing with the measure. However, I have the best of advice, and I can say that some of the statements made here to-night distinctly prove that some honorable senators are truly suffering from lack of sleep. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> begged of me to accept his advice, and then went on to say that the Bill altered the definition of "income." In that, however, the honorable senator is quite wrong, for the [Bill makes no alteration in the definition. It has also been said that this Bill will result in an increase of taxation; but  I'  can show that, over a number of years, loss will result in most cases from the adoption of the recommendations of the Royal Commission.

                            <para>- It is not possible to make an exact estimate of its effect on the revenue. It will not affect this year's revenue. In succeeding years the revenue may benefit, as some persons may be required to pay at a rate higher than that applicable to their actual income for the preceding year; but, on the other hand, reductions of rate will reduce revenue. I am informed that the net effect will be probably a reduction in the revenue from the taxation of primary producers. An additional staff will be needed for the administration of the averaging system. In the first year, the increase of staff may not be large; but the staff will grow until the fifth year, when the scheme comes into full operation, when it is thought that the additional expenditure will amount to about £15,000. The Royal Commission reported that, on the evidence submitted to it, the amount involved in the rebates to eliminate double taxation would be about £45,000, and the additional work likely to be thrown on the Department in dealing with rebates is estimated to cost about £1,000. The loss of tax is estimated, under present conditions, at £11,000. Yet we are told that this is a Bill to increase taxation.

                            <para>- I have put before the Senate the statements of the Taxation Commission, which travelled round Australia collecting evidence on the subject of its inquiry, and I have given honorable senators the opinion of the  officers  who are successfully administering our Taxation Department. There are many things which may seem strange until the reasons for them are known. That has been my experience. I have at times wandered why certain regulations were framed, until a departmental head has enlightened me as to the need for them in the conduct of the affairs of the Department. </para>
