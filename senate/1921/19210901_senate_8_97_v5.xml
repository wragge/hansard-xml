                    <para>.- The InterState Commission recommended duties of 35 and 45 per cent., but since that recommendation was made the position has entirely changed. The Commission stated that the necessary raw material, in the shape of pig iron, must continue to be imported for some time, and that the tyres for the wheels must still be made&#39; abroad, but the Broken Hill Proprietary Company and Hoskins Limited are now producing all the pig iron required, and the manufacture of wheels and tyres has been undertaken by a number of Australian firms. For instance, Thompson and Company, of Castlemaine, have established a plant in which they specialize in steel tyres, and they have met with conspicuous success; the Commonwealth Steel Products Company, Sydney, has invested nearly &#163;190,000 in works for the production of wheels, tyres and axles; Hadfields Limited, of Sheffield, England, have arranged with the Australian Electric Steel Company to manufacture tyres with steel centres as well as other railway material. The capital involved will run into something between &#163;300,000 and &#163;500,000. In view of the establishment of these industries, and the prospect that Australia will soon be able to produce all local requirements in these lines, the protective duties have been imposed. Prior to the war, we were entirely dependent on oversea supplies. </para>

                    <para>. - If the duties have been imposed for the purpose of protecting an established industry, they are altogether too high, but if it is intended to give local&#39; manufacturers a complete monopoly, then the object will be attained. These articles, steel or iron wheels and steel tyred wheels for use on railways and tramways, are required almost entirely by the various States of the Commonwealth, and the imposition of these duties will unnecessarily retard the development of the country, which is very regrettable indeed. We all hope to see Australia become a great white nation, and, in order to preserve this country for the white races, it is necessary that we should people it. The duties in this item are virtually prohibitive, and . must necessarily be a serious handicap. Therefore, I move - </para>

                <para class="block">This will bring the duty in the general Tariff into line with the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission, and, if the Committee accepts it, I shall then request a reduction in the British and intermediate Tariffs by a like amount. Although the conditions have undoubtedly changed in recent years, the change has not been to the detriment of the Australian manufacturers, because  we have been told over and over again that in these particular industries wages and the cost of production in Great Britain and Europe generally, with the exception of Germany, are considerably higher than before the war. Consequently, I can see no reason for these extraordinarily high duties. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a good deal in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman&#39;s</inline> contention. Referring to the division Metals and&#39; Machinery, I find that quite a number of industries are burning out commodities essential for the development of Australia under duties that are slightly lower than in the request submitted by the honorable senator. In the majority of cases the maximum duty in the general Tariff is 40 per cent., as in the case of fishbolts, piping, &#38;c. In the last Tariff this sub-item was free British and 10 per cent, general. It is a far cry to 35 per cent. British and 55 per cent, general. The requested amendment is a reasonable one, and it ought to give adequate protection to the Australian industry. </para>

                    <para>. -  The request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> is one which the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> might very well accept, because a duty of 55 per cent, in the general Tariff is prohibitive. I notice from trade journals that in the matter of transport facilities, we are side by side with China, which is the most backward nation in the world in this respect. Of course, I am not at all surprised, because this is what one might expect from a Protectionist policy, but I fail to understand why we should desire to continue in that position. Earlier in the debate on the Tariff schedule, I strongly advocated the advantages to be derived from admitting free all vehicles likely to be of use for war purposes, in order to insure cheap transport. From a defence point of view that would have been the proper thing to do, but the Government declined the suggestion, and, so far as I am Concerned, no defence items will now go through this Senate without my strong protest. </para>

                        <para>- The policy in this Tariff with regard to the deferred duties is to allow it to remain inoperative until the industry is sufficiently established to supply all reasonable requirements. Why not in this case? This trade journal also states that 72 per cent. of the motor vehicles in Australia are used in country districts, so that the tax upon this class of vehicles falls most heavily on those who are least able to bear it - the primary producers. I notice that whenever there is any conflict between the interests of the primary producers and those of the manufacturers the balance always goes down in favour of the latter. Why should not we have reasonable rates of duty? I would ask for a 50 per cent, reduction, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> has suggested a rate which is surely sufficient for even the most enthusiastic of Protectionists. It must be borne in mind that with the increase in the cost of material all over the world this is a growing duty. A rate of 45 per cent, to-day represents twice the actual amount of duty paid twenty years ago. I protest against the imposition of exorbitant duties. A rate of 55 per cent, is altogether too high, and is not calculated to be of any benefit to the community. </para>

                    <para>.- I freely admit that I made a mistake in dealing with motor vehicles on this sub-item, but the arguments I used are equally applicable to material required for facilitating railway communication, because the trouble with all the State railways at the present time is that owing to the high cost of material the lines cannot be run at a profit. Those States with the largest number of primary producers are most likely to be hit by this duty. To give Canada and other Dominions real preference, and to concede to Great Britain a greater measure of preference, would be only a fair thing. </para>

                    <para>. -  I appeal to honorable senators to have some consideration for the British manufacturer as well as for the Australian user. I can understand why some honorable senators may have voted for the imposition of a high duty against the foreign manufacturer. I can appreciate that they considered a margin of 10 per cent, sufficient discretion to permit the Government to exercise. The Government have not displayed much discretion in dealing with this extraordinary schedule; so honorable senators who have just voted against my request were possibly in the right in refraining from permitting the Government to exercise a 20 per cent, margin for negotiation. I appeal now particularly on behalf of the great western State. Western Australia comprises nearly one-third of the continent. It is the least developed portion of the whole; and unless the empty spaces are opened up and developed, we cannot hope to hold the continent for the white people. This Parliament is piling high duty upon duty, and making it more and more difficult to throw open Western Australia&#39;s closed areas. The argument does not apply only to Western Australia; it is equally applicable to vast portions of Queensland and South Australia, and to practically the whole of the Northern Territory. I am a Protectionist, and I believe that proper Protection should be given to Australian industries; but we should not build a prohibitive wall, and so prevent competition, and breed monopolies. </para>

                    <para>. -  In this instance we are giving Great Britain a 20 per cent, preference, which is very substantial, and as great as has been given in any other instance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> entirely shuts his eyes to what happened in Australia during the war period, when he speaks of war purposes and defence. If it had not been for the establishment of certain Australian industries on a firm basis the trans-Australian Railway would not be completed to-day. </para>

                        <para>- It would. As Minister for Defence I had to control the priority of contracts and negotiate with British Ministers concerning the order in which they were to be handled. It was pitiable during the earlier stages of the war, when Britain was so hard pressed in the manufacture of munitions, to realize that, in sending Home orders for articles of this character, which should have been manufactured here, we were impeding her war efforts. But to-day we can supply ourselves with these articles. During 1920 only &#163;138,000 worth were imported. The protection of this industry is essential for war purposes, and on the very grounds the honorable senator mentioned; When he speaks of development he should remember that, in the interests of the Commonwealth, it is better to have local supplies of these articles at our disposal. I cannot accept the request. </para>

                        <para>- How can it be when we compare the articles mentioned in this item with those of a similar character which were dealt with somewhat exhaustively some time ago ? The wheels for locomotives and rolling-stock generally are of no use whatever unless we have an adequate supply of other accessories. We have been dealing with the other items in an earlier portion of the Tariff, on which a British preferential duty of 27&#189; per cent, was fixed. We have fixed that rate on fishplates, switches, crossovers, and intersections which are just as essential as wheels, and that duty was considered ample in order to protect local industries. </para>

                    <para>. -  I would not have spoken again but for the insinuation by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that I was desirous of destroying this very essential Australian industry. I do not desire anything of the kind. I recognise with the Minister that, in the interests of defence, it is necessary to protect this industry; but I am not satisfied that it is advantageous to Australia to provide conditions which will&#39; assist in the creation of monopolies. I believe that sufficient protection should be given to maintain the industry; but I have not heard one word from the Minister to justify this very high impost against Great Britain. All the objects which the Minister has mentioned - and with which I thoroughly agree - would be satisfactorily achieved by the imposition of a lower duty. In moving that the British preferential rate be reduced to 27&#189; per cent., I am allowing a very large margin of safety. I resent the insinuation of the Minister, that I have no regard - that is what he meant - for the defence requirements of Australia; because I am prepared to make sacrifices to assist in adequately protecting Australia. The Minister, however, should remember that the first line of defence for Australia is people, and not iron. If we have not sufficient population, how can we defend Australia? That is the position, and we cannot get away from it. I am strongly in favour of railway material being made available at reasonable prices, so that we may develop our vacant spaces. Unless we do that we cannot hope to defend this country. Therefore, in the interests of the defence of Australia, I appeal for a reasonable and not a prohibitive duty. </para>

                    <para>. - In dealing with paragraph 4 of sub-item d an alteration in the measure of British preference originally proposed was made in another place. As originally introduced the Tariff gave a clear preference of 10 per cent, to Great Britain, but, in accordance with an amendment carried in another place, on. and after the 1st July last that preference was reduced to 5 per cent. I desire to have the preference to Great Britain on unassembled chassis restored to 10 per cent., and for that purpose I am prepared to move that unassembled chassis should be admitted free from Great Britain and be dutiable in the intermediate Tariff at 5 per cent. , whilst I would leave the general Tariff as proposed in the schedule. On assembled chassis I am prepared to move that the duty in the British preferential column be reduced from7&#189; per cent, to  2&#189;  per cent., that in the intermediate column from 10 per cent, to7&#189; per cent., and I would leave the duty in the general column as it stands. If all these proposals do not meet with the approval of the Minister I shall be satisfied if such alterations are made as will give imports from Great Britain a clear preference of 10 per cent, over imports under the general Tariff. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the British preference should be 10 per cent., but I would prefer to retain the proposed duty of 5 per cent, on unassembled chassis in the British preferential column, and increase the duty in the general Tariff to 15 per cent. I think that these chassis should bear some taxation. It should be remembered that, as a general rule, the British car is a higher priced car than the American, and it would, therefore, be wiser to increase the rate of duty on the American car. If the duty on the British and American cars were the same the revenue collected on the American car would be only about one-half of the revenue collected on the British car. In the circumstances, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> will submit a request for an increase in the duty in the general Tariff from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent. I will accept that. </para>

                        <para>- By the people generally. I am not suggesting that it would be resented by the man who has three or four motor cars for his own pleasure. We know that the use of motor vehicles has assisted in the development of the back country to a greater extent than any other means of locomotion we have had. Men settled at a distance from centres of population are satisfied to remain where they are, merely be cause they have been able to secure a motor vehicle at a reasonable price, in which they can come to the nearest centre to transact their business. I had no idea that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> would fall in o completely with the Minister&#39;s suggestion. I should have been prepared to support a request for a reduction of the duties in the British preferential and intermediate columns, but I hope that the request new before the Committee will not be agreed to. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to protest against any increase in the duty in the intermediate column on chassis unassembled. I do so for the reason that we are not making chassis here, and that if we bring in the parts unassembled a lot of employment is provided in putting them together. Another reason why I oppose the request is that, in this vast, almost empty, country of magnificent distances, it should be our object to make means of transport as cheap as possible. How are we to induce people to live in the back-blocks unless we give them reasonable means of transport? In America, practically every farmer has a car ; but here we pile duties on almost everything the farmer uses, and so increase the cost of his requirements. No good purpose will be served by increasing these duties. On the contrary, by doing so, we shall penalize those who are helping to develop our empty spaces. No one is anxious to cheapen the price of motor cars to the rieh, who can afford to keep several for use on our good city roads. My plea is for those who have to use this means of transport in order to earn a living. Doctors, for instance, must have motor cars, and practically every agent in a country town needs one in order that he may make sales and assist in developing the country. To say that people out-back should be thus penalized is utterly wrong. </para>

                        <para>- They help to build up the increased cost. Why should we continually harass the people out-back who must have motor transport, not only for their produce, but to enable the sick and the injured to receive prompt medical assistance? I agree that luxurious  motor bodies should be highly taxed. We are building motor bodies in Australia, and it is our duty to protect that industry,. But this sub-item relates to unassembled chassis, which we do not make here. I should be inclined to view more favorably a proposition of this kind if it related to assembled parts; but I am strongly opposed to this request for additional taxation in respect of unassembled parts that are not made here, but the introduction of which provides more employment for our own people. </para>

                    <para>. - I was delighted with the original suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten;</inline> but I do not approve of the way in which he has amended it at the suggestion of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> I was also interested to note that, after we had had three divisions on requests relating to sub-item b, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> suddenly woke up, and inquired what item we were discussing. That probably is the only explanation for the extraordinary votes he gave on the divisions in question. I listened, also, with interest to the protests made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> against this attempt to make more difficult the lot of the man in the back country. Here we have once more a proposal to impose still heavier burdens on those who are developing our country. Such a proposal was, naturally, hailed with delight by Ministers. One has only to suggest an increased duty and they rush at it like a puppy at a lot of rats.. They have no consideration for the men most deserving of it. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> that motor cars used for pleasure only should be well taxed. I should not object to almost prohibitive duties on such cars, but it is wrong to pile up taxation in this way on men who have to use motor cars for business purposes. The cheaper we can make motor transport for developmental and business purposes the better. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has fallen a victim to the wiles of the Minister, and has agreed to alter the form of his request. I hope that he will not persist with it in its amended form. If he does I shall vote against it. </para>

                    <para>. - The remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> were not in the direction of conciliation, and his personal observations were quite uncalled for. I was fully alive to what was going on in connexion with the request moved by him, and but for my desire to avoid unnecessary debate I should have reminded him at the time that Thompson and Company, of Castlemaine, and Goninan, of Newcastle, deserve some consideration for the work they did during the war. Apart from, that fact I would point out that we have heard nothing about the Rolls-Royce motor cars or the very expensive cars from America that are used almost entirely for pleasure. </para>

I stand for the taxing of luxuries and also for the obtaining of a reasonable amount of revenue through the Customs in order to avoid other taxation, and it* seems to me that the suggestion made by the Minister, and accepted by me, offers a reasonable way out for all parties. After these two sub-items have been dealt with I shall submit a proposal relating to chassis haVing a carrying capacity of 25 cwt. and over, to be used solely for the purpose of lorries,- vans, and char-a-bancs which will, if carried, cheapen that class of vehicle which does so much to meet the requirements of country people. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am rather surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> should have accepted the suggestion made on behalf of the Government. He began very well, but finished miserably. I cannot understand this proposal to increase the duty under the general Tariff. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> that it will mean an additional burden on those who are trying to develop the large empty spaces of the Commonwealth. We are asked to increase the duty under the general Tariff from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent. Such an increase will fall heavily on American parts. These motor parts are not. made here, as is shown by the fact that the - Government provided only &#34;for a revenue duty of 10 per cent. If the Government want to raise revenue they should not seek to do so at the expense of our pioneers. The burden should be placed fairly on the shoulders of every one. We have been told that these duties will be effective against the owners of the Rolls-Royce, and other expensive makes of motor cars. If the Government want to get at them, the income tax mesh can be made fine enough to do that. The ordinary man, the pioneer, the mail contractors, and the farmers, should not be burdened by these duties, because they are the people who use the commoner type of car, and if their spare parts are taxed in this way they will be very severely handicapped. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has suggested that the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty will equalize the burden. It will do nothing of the kind. A duty of 10 per cent, falls more heavily upon a man of moderate means than upon a man in easy circumstances, and this duty will hit hardest the class of men who require the most encouragement. If we had some compensation in the way of an established manufacturing industry for spare parts in Australia I could understand the reason for this duty, but we have not, and the Tariff is a revenue duty, pure and simple. It is like beating the air to try and get reasonable duties in this Tariff. Therefore, I must content myself with a formal protest against this iniquitous tax. Even the most purblind Protectionist cannot pretend that this duty, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has now moved shall be increased to 15 per cent., will be protective in its effect. What have the pioneers done that they should deserve this punishment from the Protectionists of this country? The proposal to give the Mother Country preference is quite right, but I object to the consumers being called upon to pay more than their fair share. Let the burden be borne equally by all classes. What has the pioneer farmer, or the mail contractor, clone that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> should desire to saddle him with this iniquitous impost? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> comes from a highly-developed State. It has done very well under Protection, and he should have some consideration for other States that are not so highly developed.  His  State benefited very considerably from my vote in this Chamber. There were representatives of New South Wales, six of them,  who practically wore a track across the chamber resisting duties that were being imposed in the first Tariff, which made New South Wales as prosperous as she is  to-day.  On every occasion my vote was cast for protective duties; and how is he treating Western Australia . in return ? In this case, however, the duty is not protective at all. It is for revenue purposes, pure and simple, and will be a very serious handicap upon men engaged in opening up our back country. Unfortunately, many honorable senators forget their hard lot. Even the <inline font-weight="bold">President (Senator Givens)</inline> feels the Government halter, and every time he gets a chance he comes in to vote for the most iniquitous duties. </para>

Let there be no mistake about this. In spite of all this nonsense we have heard about the development of the back-blocks with motor cars, I have never seen motor cars developing the backblocks of this country, but I have seen the bullock dray. This request will have the effect of allowing luxuries to escape free of duty. The item can very well stand the rate of duty fixed in the schedule. </para>

                    <para>.- I just want to say a word or two in the interests of those who are developing the back country. It is quite true, as the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has said, that development in the past has been by means of the bullock dray. That is one reason why we find it so difficult to get men to go on to our back country. Is it right that we should say to the young soldiers who are being sent into the back country in thousands, in some cases 15 and 16 miles away from a railway station, that they are to have none of these conveniences? Our most urgent need is population. We have plenty of fine manhood and womanhood available, and it should be our purpose to give our pioneers whatever facility is available, in order to insure their comfort and convenience. We should not suggest that the bullock dray is quite good enough for the back-country man. </para>

                        <para>- No; but that was the import of the Minister&#39;s suggestion.  His  argument is that, in order to impose a duty on the owners of Rolls-Royce cars, there should be a Tariff on unassembled parts of motor cars, which are so essential for the development of our back country. If there were hundreds of thousands more motor cars in our country districts, our primary industries would give employment to thousands of additional men and women, thus adding wealth to the country, while at the same time affording a greater measure of comfort to our outback settlers. I have spent years and years in the back country. On one occasion I was driving a ten-horse team on a road where there was a gap of 80 miles&#39; from water to water. I have seen bullock teams drawing lonely settlers into townships to witness football or cricket matches. Many of these men are not on the land to-day.  There was too much drudgery for the women, and the children never knew what comfort was. Are we to ask our returned soldiers to adopt the bullock waggon as a means of transit? </para>

                <para class="block">The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> talks of letting Rolls-Royce machines in free; but these men want cheap cars which will enable them to enjoy the ordinary comforts of life, to reach the nearest towns, churches or schools, and particularly the nearest medical men. In Victoria there are 4,000 returned soldiers endeavouring to establish homes for themselves on the land, and most of them are 12 or 14 miles from the nearest doctor. Those who have gone over these rugged roads, as I have done, under adverse circumstances, know that they are very often nothing but sandhills and stumps. </para>

Years ago I visited every closer settlement in Victoria, and what the big cars could not negotiate the Ford car would. There was never an instance of an obstacle which we could not surmount with the cheaper type of car. </para>

I would support a reduction in the British and intermediate columns, but I do not see why we should throw open our markets to German or American trade. Very soon the German trade will become a serious menace to our manufacturers here, and undo the good work our soldiers went abroad to  do. </para>

                    <para>.- The rates upon pianos, as originally proposed by the Government, were, respectively, 30 per cent., 40 per cent., and 45 per cent. An amendment was inserted elsewhere, however, reducing the rates to 20 per cent.,  30 per cent., and 35 per cent. I intend to request the re-insertion of the rates as they first appeared in the schedule. I now move - </para>

                        <para>- Its imposition will not effectively protect the&#39; Australian piano manufacturing industry, but will open it up to competition with cheap Continental instruments. Numbers of honorable senators have visited factories in which Australian pianos are made. They will agree that these places would be a credit to any country. The works employ a very fine type of artisan, and utilize Australian materials almost entirely. I refer especially to the employment of Australian timbers. The Australian makers turn out a piano of which this country has no reason to be ashamed. </para>

                        <para>- Only such a price as enables the makers to carry on with reasonable profit. What country would be our principal competitor if protection were not afforded? Germany, without doubt. The industry was pre-eminently a German one prior to the war. It was the war, and the effect of the Australian Tariff, which gave the local industry an opportunity to become established. Germany, to-day, is preparing to attack and regain the Australian market. Any reduction of the rates of duty, therefore, would be tantamount to an invitation to the foreign makers to recover the Australian trade. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; and it is due to the revival of the Continental trade. Australia is giving substantial preference to Great Britain; but our first duty is to our own interests. Very few industries employ such a large proportion of adult skilled labour. In most of our factories there are to be found a few skilled hands, and a great proportion of unskilled and, often, juvenile labour. In our piano factories, however, practically every employee - young or old - must possess some degree of special skill and knowledge. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to support the increase of the duties adopted in another place so that the rates originally proposed by the Government after, I understand, the very fullest inquiry by the Customs officials and with the full knowledge of the facts as revealed to them from all sources, may be restored. The lower duties are not sufficient to achieve the purpose for which they are imposed, that is, the giving of effective protection to an important local industry and the shutting out of German pianos, which come into competition with the locally-manufactured instruments, and which prior to the war were largely sold in every State in the Commonwealth. Before proceeding to examine the position from that stand-point, I desire to direct attention to the importance of the piano-making industry to Australia. We have two important factories in Australia, one in Melbourne and one in Sydney, and I shall confine my remarks more particularly to the Sydney factory conducted by Beale and Company, and show the extent of its operations, the number of hands employed, and the amount of wages paid. I also desire to discuss very briefly the profits made by that concern, and to prove that they are not excessive, whatever are the prices charged for the finished instruments, in view of the high cost of raw material. This factory is to-day employing 560 operatives, practically every one of whom is receiving the highest wage that it is possible to pay in this industry. The operatives are highly skilled, and are working amicably with their employers. It is well known throughout New South Wales that the employees of Beale and Company&#39;s factory have been treated so well that there has never been a strike. The firm employs a large number of returned soldiers; and, when visiting the factory a few weeks ago, 1 was astounded, to see the extent of their operations and the high standard of the work they are performing. I believe it is one of the most Up-to-date factories in Australia. Much of the up-to-date machinery employed was made on the premises, and, generally, the work is of the highest quality. In fact, the factory is a good example to other industrial undertakings throughout the Commonwealth. A great deal has been said concerning the profits that other manufacturers are making in Australia, and they have been quoted as a reason for inducing honorable senators to favour lower duties. I have here a certificate from one of the best known Sydney accountants - Messrs. Brierly and Brierly, of Pitt-street, Sydney - showing that the dividends paid by Beale and Company, over a period of years, averages 3.S3 per cent, on the capital invested in the company. </para>

                        <para>- To say that that is an exorbitant profit, and that the purchasers are paying more than ought to be exacted from them is not dealing justly with the firm. Beale and Company have been successful in establishing a very big industry, and most of the profits made from time to time have gone back into the business for extending the plant and building up a trade that will be sufficient, not. only to supply the Australian market, but also to enable them to export. I have been shown an advertisement which has appeared in American trade journals which has been put forward as affording proof that Beale and Company are exporting pianos to America for sale in that country. If the Customs records are examined it will , be found that this firm has not exported one piano to America. Certain trade arrangements have been made with American houses using Beale and Company&#39;s patents, which enable American manufacturers to use these patents in exchange for which Beale and Company utilize certain American right?. In these circumstances it is necessary for Beale and Company to advertise in America to show the American people that theirs is a reputable concern in an active way of business, and to prove to them that the patents used in the instruments are satisfactory. When we hear of the profits the Australian manufacturers are making we should examine the position of the piano importers. </para>

                        <para>- I have quoted from the certificate of a reputable firm of accountants, the accuracy of which cannot be challenged, which proves that Beale and Company are not making huge profits. I shall, however, show that the importers have been making the profits. The Sydney firm of Paling and Company claim that for the first five months of this year their sales were at the rate of &#163;600,000 per annum, and that their output is increasing every year. For some years past this firm has been able to distribute, in cash, profits averaging 10 per cent, per annum. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I have quoted the figures concerning the business of Paling and Company, as against those of a local firm which has had to build up a big factory and utilize its energy and ability in organizing the industry. What employment does the importer give to our Australian people? The local manufacturers engage Australian operatives, and those operatives rear families who will be of assistance in developing and defending Australia. On the other hand, the piano importers - I do not wish to say anything against men who are conducting reputable businesses - do not give one fiftieth of the employment that the Australian manufacturer provides. The future position is a serious one, and I desire to show that the duties proposed by the Government are necessary if we are to keep this industry on a proper basis. It is not a question of whether we should assist in reducing the profits of the local manufacturer by imposing lower duties, but whether our factories are to be closed. The condition of affairs on the other side of the world is such that, unless we impose an effective duty, there will be such heavy importations of cheap pianos that it will be impossible for the local factories to continue. I shall give one instance - my information has been received from a reliable source - to show what is happening. I have in my possession a letter signed by the secretary of Paling and Company, who points out in response to certain inquiries, that the firm rents premises in George-street, Sydney, for which they pay &#163;2,500 per annum. They pay regular dividends, and maintain material reserves. Their turnover has improved year by year, and for the first five months of 1921 it exceeded &#163;250,000. The secretary declined to furnish anything in the nature of a balance-sheet; but when we realize that the turnover of one company was &#163;250,000 in five months, it will be admitted that it is time we gave adequate protection to the local manufacturers. </para>

I have seen only to-day an authoritative statement - I have not seen the original - from a firm in Germany offering 1,000 pianos, slightly used - I wish honorable senators to note that - at exceedingly low rates, for export to Australia. Where did these pianos come from? The exporters offered to place certain names upon them which were not German. Purchasers would have the right of selecting good old British names. What is the object in endeavouring to delude the people of Australia into believing that they would be purchasing British pianos ? They may have been acquired in circumstances which need not be mentioned; but I think we know what those circumstances were. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise to oppose any increase of the duty of 35 per cent, on pianos agreed to by the House of Representatives. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> in a very good speech argued that a duty of 35 per cent, is not a protective duty. I have the highest regard for Beale and Company and Wertheim and Company. I know that they employ a great number of persons, and treat their employees well. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> told us that Beale and Company employ 560 persons, but I know of two firms importing pianos who employ 600 employees, so that the honorable senator&#39;s argument, based on the amount of employment given in this industry, can be set on one side. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> informed us that the profits made by Beale and Company represent only about 4 per cent. That may be the profit on their factories; but it has to be remembered that whilst on, their balance-sheets the factories might show no profit at all, the firm might still be making huge profits because the factories send the pianos into their shops, where they are sold to the public of Australia at&#34; an exorbitant price. Everything that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has said about the low profits made by piano manufacturers is entirely disproved by a prospectus issued by Beale and Company, on the 30th July, 1920, when they were floating still another piano company to operate in Queensland. Although the excellent firms to which I have referred built up their huge establishments for the manufacture of pianos in Australia under Free Trade, I am still prepared to support the duty of 35 per cent, adopted in another place, which, taken in conjunction with the cost of freight on pianos, which amounts to &#163;18 each, represents an enormous protection. In the prospectus issued by Beale and Company they say - </para>

I have no objection to local makers of pianos making a good thing out of the business, but I do not desire that they should be allowed to build up a, monopoly. If we impose an exorbitant rate of duty the effect will be to build up two monopolies in this country to the detriment of every householder who desires to obtain even a cottage piano. I have every desire to encourage the manufacture of pianos, although personally I look upon them as instruments of torture. </para>

                <para>I find that in 1914 a piano costing at the factory &#163;20 paid a duty of 40 per cent., amounting to &#163;8 16s. To-day the same piano costs at the factory &#163;50, and a duty of 35 per cent, would amount to &#163;19 5s. In addition to that, we have to remember that the freight amounts to &#163;18 per piano, which is a great natural protection to the local manufacturers. Pianos to-day are sold at extraordinarily high prices. In 1903 the cheapest piano was sold at 45 guineas. I am referring to pianos manufactured by the splendid company to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> would like to give a monopoly. In 1911 the price was 55 guineas, in 1914 65 guineas, and to-day it is 120 guineas. </para>

                        <para>- Costs of production have not increased in anything like the ratio indicated by the figures I have quoted. I want to give honorable senators some idea of the protection now afforded to local manufacturers of pianos. In the case of a piano of the value of &#163;32 18s. 4d., allowing for exchange, freight and other charges, plus the duty of 35 per cent, proposed by the Government, the actual protection afforded the local manufacturers is 130 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Against manufacturers of pianos in any other part of the world. In the case of piano players, which come under the same item, the duty, plus freight and charge, amounts to 99 per cent. I am not against theAustralian manufacturers, but I do not desire monopolies, which I regard as dangerous, to be created. The cost of a piano before the war was about one quarter of what it is to-day. The exorbitant price of 100 guineas for a comparatively inferior piano is not a fair thing. I have shown that importing firms actually employ more labour than is employed by the two factories manufacturing pianos in Australia. Allan and Company and Paling and Company employ over 600 hands. </para>

                        <para>- The local manufacturers do not sell only their pianos. The factory balance-sheets do not show the profits on their pianos. It may be that they do not want to show a profit. The factories supply the shops carried on by the manufacturers, and in those shops the people are charged more than double what it costs to make the pianos. I have said that the industry was built up under Free Trade, and yet some honorable senators propose that the duty of 35 per cent, should be increased to 45 per cent. I have shown that Beale and Company, in their own prospectus, admit that they are making double the profit necessary to pay a good dividend of per cent.  In the circumstances, I cannot see why we should be asked to increase this duty and give them a monopoly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has said that we are going to be swamped with pianos from Germany. None of the importing firms want those pianos. As a matter of fact, most of the imported pianos are coming from America, and have been for some time. </para>

                        <para>- I want honorable senators to remember that the industry here has a natural protection in freight alone of &#163;18 per piano. Surely a duty of 35 per cent, in addition should give sufficient protection. These people are not philanthropists, and I draw attention to the fact that, not only are they making splendid profits here, but they are advertising their pianos for sale in America. I have a copy of a New York publication <inline font-style="italic">The Music Trader,</inline> dated 21st July, 1920, in which is a big advertisement offering Beale and Company&#39;s pianos for sale in that country. </para>

                        <para>- Then we are invited to believe that they are throwing away money upon advertisements in American newspapers. They are also advertising in Canada. Either they expect to sell their pianos in America and Canada or they are making such a lot of money here that they are in a position to throw some of it away and charge it to legitimate expenses for advertising. Why is the company advertising in New York and in Canada&#93; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has never been in America, but I have, and I know that standing advertisements in American newspapers cost a small fortune. When Peale and Company advertise their pianos there either they can undersell American pianos in the American market, after paying &#163;18 each in the way of freight, or their profits here are so good that they can afford to spend a lot of money in advertising their pianos in foreign countries. Many people might consider a piano a luxury, and apparently one cannot be bought in Australia under 100 guineas. </para>

                    <para>. - The request moved by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> in so far as it relates to the duty under the general Tariff will have my support. I have received from both sides a great number of communications in regard to this matter, and each side adduces the most convincing arguments : in the one case that increased duties are necessary, and in the other that they are unnecessary. I gained before the war, however, a little personal knowledge with regard to the importation of pianos, and I pay more attention to that experience of my own than to the communications I have received from the importers and manufacturers. In Western Australia, before the war, there was a German importer of pianos who was subsequently interned by direction of the Minister for Defence. This gentleman used to indulge in a considerable amount of litigation, and it was because of that tendency on his part that I discovered something about his business and everything relating to his importations. I learned that he was able to land German pianos in Western Au stralia at prices varying from &#163;10 to &#163;22, and that he sold them to the Western Australian public at prices varying from &#163;60 to &#163;86. I believe that, at that time, Beale&#39; s pianos were selling up to about &#163;60 and as low as &#163;48, but I am not quite sure of those figures. With a protective duty of 40 per cent, in operation at that time, German pianos could be landed in Western Australia at &#163;22 and sold to the public at &#163;86. Let us examine the situation to-day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> says &#34;that the local industry has a natural plus an artificial protection amounting to 130 per cent. It will be remembered, as against that statement, that the value of the German mark to-day per &#163;1 sterling is far below what it was before the war. Before the war, 20 marks went to the &#163;1 sterling, whereas to-day 312 marks go to the &#163;1 sterling. </para>

                        <para>- I am trying to show the honorable senator that his assertion with regard to a natural and artificial protection of 130 per cent, is not correct. It might be if conditions were normal ; but they are not, and are not likely to be for a number of years. We cannot get away from the fact that there has been this decrease in the value of the German mark, and that, although wages in Germany may have increased, they have increased in marks, and not in pounds sterling. When we compare the cost of pianos produced in Germany with the cost of those manufactured in Australia or elsewhere, we have to remember the relative values of the mark and the &#163;1 sterling, so that the natural protection of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has spoken does not really exist. The exchange position is very much in favour of the importer of German pianos ; he is in a much better position than he was before the war. </para>

                        <para>-I admit that the question of freight is very material - that it costs far more to-day than it did before the war to bring a piano to Australia from abroad. But here, again, we have a big set-off. While wages in Australia have increased most materially, wages in Germany, having regard to our relative currencies, have not, in fact, increased. </para>

                        <para>- I do not doubt that. Among the many communications I have received from various sources with regard to this item, there is one that appeals to me. It comes from the  president  of the Limbless Men&#39;s Association, Sydney. I know this gentleman; I know that he is not one of the extreme Bolsheviks who sometimes find their way into the association, and that his point of view has not been perverted in the way that I regret to say the views of some have been. He points out that quite a large number of men in his association are employed by Beale and Company, of Sydney, and that he is informed by that firm that, provided the duties are maintained, more of these men will be employed by it. I need hardly mention that work of this kind is most suitable for men suffering from such disabilities, and this statement by the  president  of the association makes a very strong appeal to  me. </para>

                        <para>- My correspondent points out to me that in this matter Beale and Company have behaved very well, and are promising to do still better for these men. That, to me, is a stronger reason than any given by the manufacturers in support of an increased duty under the general Tariff. It comes from a source which in itself carries a strong appeal, and from a man whom I know to be both capable and honorable. Coining to the intermediate and British preferential Tariffs, I am not so sure that it is necessary that the duties in respect of them should be increased. I think our purpose will be served by increasing the general Tariff, which deals with our principal competitors, Germany and America. </para>

                    <para>.- This item relates to one of the industries of Australia, which, I think, every honorable senator, with perhaps one or two exceptions, is prepared to encourage. I should not have taken part in the debate but for a few remarks made by Senator Guthrie, which convinced me that it was my duty to raise my voice in support of the local industry. The honorable senator informed the Committee that the importers of pianos employ something like  600  hands in selling and repairing them. </para>

                        <para>- Absolutely. Instead of having  600  employees engaged in the work of repairing and selling imported pianos, is it not better that we should have  1,000  or more of our returned soldiers and others engaged in the highly skilled trade of manufacturing pianos here? If we do not adequately protect this industry, which gives employment to a number of limbless men, the Germans who maimed those men will be able to bring in their pianos and undersell the local manufacturers. I do not think any honorable senator is prepared to support that sort of thing. If we could not manufacture pianos, I should not be in favour of the request; but here we have an industry whose productions are equal to those of any other part of the world. That statement cannot be denied, yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is such an ardent Free Trader - </para>

                        <para>- At all events, the honorable senator&#39;s argument in opposition to the request, that the importers are employing  600  men in selling and repair ing imported instruments, should be sufficient to convince the Committee that higher duties ought to be imposed in order to give increased employment in our own industry. It has been said that certain firms are buying up secondhand pianos. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will not deny that for five or six years after the outbreak of war the industrial classes of not only Great Britain, but various allied as well as enemy countries, were better off than at any other period of their lives. Many of them, not having had at their command so much money as they were able to earn during the war, did not know what to do with it, and in many cases their first action was to buy one of the highest-priced pianos oBtainable. With the close of the war- came industrial crises, with the result that many of these people, being deprived of the wherewithal to purchase food, had to part with their high class pianos. Thus to-day pianos that cost probably &#163;200  each during the war period are being sold by many of these poor people for  &#163;10,  or even less. Those people who, six years ago, were foolish enough to spend their money in this way are to-day, many of them, starving. Of what value to them to-day is. a piano which may have cost  &#163;200?  It is, I think, our duty to see that a similar state of affairs is not again brought about in this country. We should see to it that, instead of  600  men being employed in repairing pianos, large numbers should be engaged in the actual manufacture of these instruments in Australia. I hope the Senate will agree to the Minister&#39;s requested amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I am disappointed at this information, because, as I have said, I was delighted to think that the industry, established under Free Trade conditions, had flourished to such an extent. Indeed, I was expecting to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Prat-:</inline> ten tell the Committee that it had grown to enormous proportions, and by using Australian woods - there was room, surely, to say something about our woods - the manufacturers were able to turn out the most attractive instruments in the world. But evidently this is not the position at all, for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> now tells us that the competition with American manufacturers is bogus. Now, what is likely to happen in Australia if these duties are imposed? If prices for Australian pianos are raised to such an extent as to restrict their sale to those whose incomes are above a certain amount, the industry must languish. The more reasonable the price, the better it will be foi the industry. I may regard myself as a shocking example of one whose musical education has been neglected. Whenever a band strikes up &#34; God Save the King,&#34; because of lack of musical education I am in fear and trembling lest I should not get my hat off before some one gives me an unpleasant reminder. If we could get pianos into every home in this country, we would insure for the rising generation a home life that certainly was not mine, and cultivate in the young the love of music that may be in them. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> would reserve pianos for the classes. The masses, according to their reasoning, have no .right to music. Did God reserve musical talent for the classes ? Certainly not, and I have no time for those who would restrict the opportunities of the people in regard to the enjoyment of music of any kind. I want the best of musical instruments to be made available to the people at the cheapest possible price. I should like pianos to be free of duty. I should like to see the Australian firms competing with the rest of the world. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid that the more I hear of the methods of this firm, the less I shall respect them. I should like to buttress the argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> as to the natural protection which the Australian manufac- &#60;turers enjoy by reason of our geographical position. I find, from a trade circular, that the price of an American piano . at the factory is $160, representing a normal value of &#163;32 18s. 4d., and that the present cost, owing to exchange, is &#163;40 10s. 2d. The increased cost, owing to the rate of exchange, is &#163;7 lis. 10d., and freight charges, at $30 per ton of 40 cubic feet, &#163;14 16s. 2d.; import charges, insurance, wharfage, cartage, &#38;c, are &#163;4 18s. 5d. ; so that the natural protection, that is, without any duty,, afforded by import charges alone, is &#163;27 6s. 5d., or 83 per cent. The duty, at 35 per cent., amounts to &#163;15 lis. 10d., and therefore the total landed cost is &#163;75 16s. 7d., making the total protection, including duty  under the Tariff of 35 per cent., equal to 130 per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - It may be a coincidence, but it is a fact, that in every Tariff the discussion on pianos has been a discussion around the name of 0. C. Beale, who is only one of the manufacturers engaged in the industry in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O.</inline> C. Beale is a good Australian who came from Ireland. I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will note that fact. Let us, apart from personalities, examine the position with regard to the Government proposal. In answer to a question which I put on .the business-paper a week or two; ago, in anticipation of this debate, I was supplied with the following official information concerning the importation of pianos from abroad. For the five years ending 30th June, 1910, we imported from within the Empire 6,799 pianos, and from, foreign countries 52.908 instruments, in spite of duties of 30 per cent, and 35 per cent., which had been in existence since 1908. For the five years ending 30th June, 1915, our importations from within the Empire totalled 9,554 pianos, and from foreign countries 60,856, in spite of duties of 30 per cent, and 40 per cent., the increase of foreign importations being 20 per cent., notwithstanding an additional 5 per cent, to the duty. For the five years ending 30th June, 1920, our importations from within the Empire were 8,154 pianos, and from foreign countries, 29,614, Germany during that time having been eliminated as a competitor owing to the war. Again there was a duty of 30 per cent, and 40 per cent, operative. For the year ending the 30th June. 1921, when the duties operating were 30 per cent., 40 per cent., and 45 per cent., there were 6,918 pianos imported from foreign countries, and only 371 from Great Britain. On the basis of the foreign importations last year, we are having an average importation of 35,000 pianos &#34;for a five years period, in spite of the operation of duties which the Government now wish to see replaced. I am prepared to stand by the investigations made into this industry by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> when he originally imposed the duties which we are now asked to restore, and by the investigations made by the Inter-State Commission, whose recommendation was that the rates be just what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is moving to-day. Surely, if we are to pay attention to reports of this Commission, we should do so in this case, especially when their recommendation coincides with what is proposed by the Minister. They recommended on grand pianos a duty of &#163;12 British and &#163;15 general, or 35 per cent, and 45 per cent, respectively, whichever rate would return the higher duty; and on upright pianos, &#163;7 British and &#163;10 10s. general, or 35 per cent, and 45 per cent, respectively, whichever rate would return the higher duty. That is practically what the Government propose to-day. There are six piano factories in Australia, employing 820 persons, and representing a capital expenditure of &#163;750,000. Reference has been made to an advertisement in an American trade journal ; but what a trivial matter to bring into the proceedings of an assembly like this! Surely my friends understand that many progressive business firms advertise in foreign trade journals for the purpose of getting into touch with others, and getting circulars and pamphlets concerning their industry. T have done it myself in respect to businesses with which I have been connected. I&#34; am in a position to say that not one piano has been exported to the United States of America by the firm in question. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> says that an advertisement in a foreign trade publication, that will probably cost 5 dollars or perhaps 10 dollars an issue, costs a fortune, and that some of the firm&#39;s reserve profits have gone in this direction. Another statement which has been made is that the certified profits of the Sydney firm do not include shop profits. They include absolutely all profits made by the firm. I know that the firm has been in existence for over twenty years, and that it not only did not make any profits under Free Trade, but even lost capital. The figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> withregard to its average profits for the whole period are absolutely correct. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain</inline> has replied to the statement about the two firms in Melbourne, which are employing 600 people. &#34;We all know enough to recognise that these employees are not wholly engaged in dealing with imported pianos. They are engaged in selling music, tuning and repairing pianos, and in all the different ramifications of the piano trade. But the Sydney firm does nothing but make pianos. Another statement has been made in regard to the capital of a Queensland company. In this connexion I can point out that, in reference to a </para>

                <para class="block">Tecent  issue of shares by Beale and Company, Sydney, and the auditors&#39; certificate, published on the 3rd July, 1920, saying that the firm&#39;s annual earnings during the nine and three-quarter years ending the preceding 3rd April averaged considerably more than the amount necessary to cover a yearly dividend on the 100,000 preference shares that were to be issued. If 100,000 debenture shares were to be issued at 8 per cent., the earnings on the ordinary capital of &#163;200,000 would be under 5 per cent., and the statement would be correct. In such circumstances the statement in the Queensland prospectus referred to would be similarly correct. I hope that the Committee will agree to these duties; they are fair and reasonable. I believe in making Australian goods by Australian workers, and I protest against the very loose statements which sometimes go about with reference to Australian manufactures. </para>

                        <para>- If the prospectus put forward in Queensland is correct, the statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has quoted from the auditors&#39; report concerning the operations of the Sydney company seems to me to contradict it, notwithstanding the attempted camouflaging by the honorable senator. The importer of a piano has not only to pay 35 per cent, on the factory cost if it comes from America; he has also to pay a considerable amount for exchange and freight. The local manufacturer of pianos has not to meet any such charges.We must not lose sight of the fact that there are nearly 20,000 persons in Australia engaged in teaching music. If a young man or woman wishes to teach music, and has not &#163;100 cash with which to buy a piano, it is a question of contracting a debt extending over five or six years. We all know that the teaching of music is a precarious means of living, and there is no guarantee that the purchaser of a piano on terms will be able to maintain the payments for the full period. The consequence is that any failure means the loss, not only of the instrument, but also of the money already paid. The music teachers thus lose their tools of trade. The duties are, in fact, a tax on tools of trade. In addition to giving consideration to teachers of music, for whom not a word has previously been said, we must also bear in mind what a great factor music in the home is in the building up of a nation. These high duties may be the means of depriving many a home of the opportunity of enjoying music. I reside in a suburb of Adelaide. Most of the residents of that city earn their living by toil; but there is not one home in ten which does not possess a piano or an organ. </para>

                        <para>- The same remark may be applied to Great Britain. The point of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> argument was that the greater totals of importations were due to the fact that the degree of local protection was not sufficiently high. I quote figures which refute <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> statement, and then I am informed that the reduction in importations was due to the war. I am prepared to accept the latter reason, but I must reject the former. Much has been said concerning the total number of employees in Australian piano factories. In the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Tear-Book</inline> for 1917-18 statistics show that only sixtyone&#39; more hands were employed in all the varied forms of musical-instrument manufacture than in 1913, during which year  - and previously - the. rates of duty were not calculated to encourage the local industry. There are six factories in Australia, but, for all practical purposes, only two need be considered. The proposed increase of duties will create a monopoly, for the reason that those two factories are not only makers, but the sole distributors of their instruments; they determine the price at which their pianos shall be sold. In 1903 the cheapest piano cost about &#163;45. In 1911 the lowest price was 55 guineas; and, in 1914, 65 guineas. A piano of the same class costs to-day from 100 to 125 guineas. The rates sought to be reimposed by the Government are equivalent to a protection of 95 per cent., without regard to other protective costs and charges. I have before me a list, dated 27th August/ 1921, which quotes the cash price for a model VI. piano&#39; at &#163;165. The price of another line is &#163;140, while the lowest quotation is &#163;120. </para>

                    <para>. - While I do not favour the imposition of duties beyond a fair and reasonable degree in order to establish Australian industries flourishingly, I hold that in this instance there is warrant for the Government providing ample protection, particularly against Continental makers. The German mark is worth less than one-twelfth of its former value. Based upon a recent decision of the High Court to the effect that the par value of exchange cannot be levied upon, but that the commercial value must be the medium of business relationship, an enormous advantage is conceded to Continental producers. It is scarcely possible that, even with an anti-dumping measure, anything like reasonable protection can be given to Australian makers of. musical instruments against German competition. On the other hand, owing to the appreciated value of the American dollar, the local protection against importations from the United States of America is exceedingly favorable to the Australian manufacturer. It is hard to say what degree of protection may b&#38; adequate against European competitors. Germany is just as virile as ever. Her factories did not suffer during the war period. She was able to get the wheels of industry moving again from the moment of the cessation of hostilities. If the German mark were to recover its former value, either this year or next, the Commonwealth Parliament might be able to arrive at an approximately correct estimate of a fair degree of protection. But, owing to the chaotic financial condition of Germany, a considerable period is likely to elapse before the old financial footing will have been re-established with the debtor nation. Until Germany reverts to the gold basis of currency she will be such&#39; a furious competitor in the world&#39;s markets that this Parliament should be particularly cautious. </para>

                    <para>.- Unless honorable senators are prepared to considerably reduce this duty it will appear that they are just as keen to shut out instruments of British manufacture as they are to exclude imports from Germany. If the Minister&#39;s request is adopted a duty of 30 per cent, will be imposed on all importations from Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- It is an exorbitant duty to impose on British importations, and the arguments adduced against the importation of German pianos cannot be used in this instance. There does not appear to be any justification for such a heavy rate, because there is a natural protection of &#163;18 in freight and &#163;4 for handling charges on each instrument. In another place the rate was reduced to 20 per cent., and in order to test the feeling of the Committee, and to see who are really in favour of giving preference to Great Britain, I intend to move that the rate be made 25 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Then I do not see why the Governor-General or his guests should escape the payment of duties which have to be paid by other folk. Our laws should apply alike to every one in Australia, from the Governor-General down to the humblest citizen. I am given to understand that some very fine wines are made in this country, though I am no judge of them myself, and I think that an Australian Governor-General might restrict his guests to the use of Australian wines, or that, if they desire French importations or wines from other countries, duty should be paid upon them. I have no ill-will to Government House. I realize that while we are living under our present Constitution it is necessary that Great Britain should have a representative here. All that I desire is that, so far as the laws of this Parliament are concerned, we shall make no exception in their application. They should apply even to the highest representative of the Crown in this country, as fully as to the humblest citizen. I take it that all the expenses of these official functions are paid for by the Commonwealth, and if duty were imposed upon these articles it would be like taking money out of one pocket and putting it into the other, but, to my mind, that does not affect the principle I desire to assert. </para>

I am rather glad to learn that the expenses of the functions are paid by the King&#39;s representative out of his own allowance. That does not alter my desire that in laws we pass here we should recognise no distinction between the King&#39;s representative and other persons in the community. As a very loyal subject, I recognise the high position of the Governor-General.

He professes to desire that our laws shall apply equally to the Governor-General and every other member of the community, but the honorable senator does not propose that. He leaves, out of his request articles required by the Governor-General, apart from wines and spirituous liquors. The honorable senator is&#187; permitting the inequality of which he complains to remain. The Governor-General, under his request, could obtain other things, apart from wines and spirituous liquors, under conditions which cannot be taken &#39;advantage of by the average citizen. Is it worth while to say that the Governor-General may obtain some things free of duty but must pay duty on other things? </para>

If the honorable senator wishes to be logical, and I am not accusing him of that desire, his proper course will be to vote against the item altogether. I hope the Committee will not delete the item, which has appeared in every Tariff passed since Federation. Articles required for official purposes by the Governor-General have always been admitted free. I dislike referring to what one learns at Government House, but I can appeal to honorable senators generally to bear me out in the statement that the gentlemen who have occupied the position of Governor-General of Australia have always shown appreciation of Australian products, which are invariably to be found on the table at Government House. It does appear to be rather small to dissect things required by the Governor-General in the way proposed, and to say that some shall be admitted free of duty whilst duty must be paid on others. </para>

                        <para>- If articles required by the Governor-General in his official capacity are to be admitted free of duty, how much more necessary is it that articles required by honor able senators should be admitted free of duty. Consider what an advantage that would be at election time. I adhere to my request, illogical though it may be, and to make ray position right, if I fail to carry it, I will call for a division on the item. I submit the request purely with a desire to assert the principle that there should be equality in the application of our laws. Why should we set the example of singling out the King&#39;s representative as the only person who shall not pay taxes? There is no question of protecting local manufactures involved in this matter, but the Government must get revenue in these hard times, when income tax and other taxes are complained of so severely, and there is no reason why taxable goods consumed by the Governor-General and his guests should not contribute to the revenue in the same way as similar goods consumed&#39; by other persons in the Commonwealth. I think that it would be rather a good example to set if we decided that the highest in the land must pay taxation in the same way as the most  humble, particularly on things that are not necessities. We all know that wines and spirits have largely gone out of use. At one time they were considered essential, but with the advance of science, knowledge, and intellectual development, they have been shown to be unessential. </para>

My  proposal is to divide sub-item  a  into two new sub-items  a  and  b -  sub-item  b  will then become sub-item c  - for  the purpose  of  providing  for  specific as well as <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties in respect  of  dry plates, and also films, sensitized papers, and cards.  The  specific duties that  I  intend to suggest will involve no increase as compared with  the  present <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties, but are necessary to prevent the possibility  of  a very important local industry now engaged in making these things being swept away at &#34;some future time by  a  resort to dumping.

                    <para>. - This item covers steel ropes used for mining purposes as well as for lifts, and also, in this city, for tramway purposes. I understand that the greatly increased duties which are to come into operation on and after 1st January next are proposed in contemplation of the establishment of a local industry to manufacture wire ropes. I need not point out that wire ropes are used in mines and lifts, and that where they are so employed the lives of men depend upon their strength and durability. I am informed that much skill and experience is required to produce a reliable article. The proposal is that we should depart from our habit of obtaining the most reliable ropes procurable, and which, with one exception, I understand, come from Great Britain, in order to substitute an experiment that is to be carried out in Australia. We all know that where men&#39;s lives are at stake the imported ropes will be used, and consequently the mining industry in Australia - and my chief concern is in regard to that industry - will be called upon to pay these largely increased duties. I have had worked out the difference in the amount that would be collected under the present duties of 5 per cent, and 10 per cent., as compared with the duties to come into operation on 1st January next. I do not propose to go into all the figures as to our imports and the countries from which they are obtained; it is sufficient to say that the amount collected annually under the duties now operating would be only &#163;791 per annum, whereas if the new duties to come into force after 1st January next are agreed to, the revenue collected should amount to &#163;40,564 per annum. That is a very big increase. It is a tremendous burden to impose on the mining industry of Australia, the chief user of these ropes, merely for the possibility of establishing the industry here. </para>

                    I am hopeful that, in any event, we shall not experiment with this item, dealing, as it does, with material upon which the lives of the men working in our mines depend. We know that the mining companies and owners of lifts will insist upon having the best ropes procurable in the world. The best are manufactured . by three or four firms in Great Britain and one firm in America, which produces a special class of rope.

                        <para>- I am informed by those who are able to advise me, and particularly by the  President  of the Kalgoorlie Chamber of Mines, who certainly knows something of the subject, as well as the  Chairman  of the Melbourne Tramways Board, which is probably the largest buyer of this particular class of rope in Australia, that the manufacture of steel wire ropes is a very difficult operation., requiring a great deal of skill and the employment of people who have spent practically the whole of their lives in acquiring the necessary knowledge. The process of drawing wire rope, to the right size and strength is both technical and difficult. I am told that it is so difficult that, despite the experience of the firms I have mentioned, they are not always successful. The experience of the Melbourne Tramways Board is that a rope produced by, say, firm A,&#34; will last only a few weeks; whereas another rope, apparently identical in every particular, will last five or six times as long. The Melbourne Tramways Board imports all its wire ropes. </para>

The Government have an assurance that arrangements are being made by Rylands, the great English company, to manufacture this metal cordage- at Newcastle, in New South Wales. Unfortunately the work has been- delayed, and consequently the deferred duties will not become operative until 1st January, 1922. Messrs. T. C. Smith and Co., another British manufacturing firm, is also making arrangements to engage in the industry at Newcastle. As these are both British firms of the highest reputation, the only objection which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> can have to the scheme is the fear that the Australian workmen will be unable to learn the business. </para>

                        <para>- But why should they think that? The ropes will be made by the same firms and by the same process, the only difference being that Australian workmen will be employed instead of British. The probability is that these firms will bring a number of skilled workmen from England, as many other manufacturing companies do, and, until they  demonstrate their ability to manufacture  a  satisfactory article, the duties will not be operative. Of course, there is no reason to assume that wire rope manufactured in Australia will be in any way inferior to the article at present being used. </para>

                        <para>- Sometimes I have seen all these devices tried, and very few have ever been successful. A good rope is the only recognised safeguard. If what the Minister says is correct, and I have no doubt it is true, that it is proposed to manufacture the ropes in this country, there will be time enough for Parliament to impose these duties when the companies concerned demonstrate the quality of the rope which they produce. If the English manufacturing firms that at present supply our requirements are going to become established in Australia, there appears to be no necessity for the duty at all, because they will not have competition from the outside world. I think, therefore, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman&#39;s</inline> request might be accepted, and the item made free so far as the British Tariff is concerned. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand the misgiving that characterizes <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson&#39;s</inline> attitude, and also that of the mover of the request <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Drake-Brockman)</inline> . This is a very important commodity so far as Australia is concerned. We get so accustomed to trusting our lives to the wire rope that we do it several times a day without adverting to the fact. Only when accidents occur do people realize how often they take this risk. There is hardly an honorable senator who does not, more than once or&#39; twice a day, trust his life to the wire rope, even in the elevators about this building. Our miners go up and down many hundreds of feet at the beginning and end of their shifts, and depend for their safety on the wire rope. Although mining companies as a rule forbid individuals to travel on haulage trams., reserving them entirely for the transport of the material, some one must accompany the material, and, in spite of the prohibition, many people travel that way. In fact, they become so accustomed to it that often they jump on haulage trams to relieve themselves of the necessity of walking or climbing. Rylands, an English company, produce the wire rope or metal cordage in general use by our mining companies. Their output is regarded as quite satisfactory in every respect. It is, from the point of view of the Australian user, the highest standard of value, and we are informed by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that this firm, as well as another English firm, contemplate establishing works in Australia on the assurance, I take it, that they will get Tariff protection against the United States of America or Europe. </para>

In following this procedure I sincerely hope that the Minister and the Tariff Board will be fully seized with the importance of the giving or withholding of a certificate. This item is one which, I think, is probably more vital in this connexion than any other in the Tariff, and needs most careful consideration both by the Minister and the Tariff Board. To say merely that the local industry is outputting the requirements of Australia in considerable quantities, or in sufficient quantities to supply largely the Australian market, should not be enough. I presume that in Great Britain some tests are applied, both within the factory and, . possibly, outside, as to the reliability of the product. I sincerely hope, therefore, that before the Tariff Board issues its certificate, and before the Minister allows these deferred duties to become operative, the most complete and exhaustive tests will be &#39;applied to the commodities produced. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has sounded a very encouraging note concerning the establishment of this industry in the Commonwealth, but it is necessary to take into account the other industry that will be so vitally affected by the imposition of these stiff duties. I am&#39; sure &#39;it is no pleasure for honorable senators to recall to mind the present unsatisfactory position of the mining industry. The records are there. As far as the metalliferous side of the industry is concerned, it is many years since it was at such a low ebb as to-day, and yet here is a proposal to increase the cost &#39; of ari essential requirement. These wire ropes do not last a very great length of time. Immediately a rope shows the least sign of wear it is condemned by a mining inspector, and it is necessary for the company to replace it. I realize how important it is to start an industry of this description in Australia, but it is not- a good, sound policy to call upon another industry struggling to keep itself alive to bear the whole of the cost necessary to bring about its establishment. The mining industry, particularly metalliferous mining, is in quite a different category from other industries; it cannot pass on the increased cost of production. I think that the Government could well adopt a device quite ready to its hands for encouraging the industry of wire-rope making, namely, the giving of a bonus to it until it reaches a stage when it can be relied upon to provide an ample output at a reasonable price. At any rate, the imposition of a duty upon wire ropes will place the mining industry, which already has a gloomy outlook, in a still more unsatisfactory position. If the condition of the mining industry were buoyant, I would be pleased to support the Minister&#39;s proposal for a deferred duty, but I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman&#39;</inline> s request, because it is at the present time unable to bear the whole weight of establishing the wire-rope making industry in Australia, and because I consider that the responsibility for affording encouragement to this new industry is one that properly belongs to the whole community. </para>

                    <para>. - A great deal depends upon the quality of wire ropes. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman&#39;s</inline> reference to the prejudices of miners. My memory takes me back to the time when these wire ropes began to replace the old flat hempen ropes which were in general use, and there was a, strong prejudice among the miners against the new ropes, because they are so thin in comparison with the more substantial looking hempen ropes tq which they had been so long accustomed. I regard this question more from the point of view of the careful &#34; administration which will be necessary when the de-&#39; ferred duty begins to operate. When the Tariff Board commences its investigations, no doubt it will peruse the reports of the debates in this Chamber, and see what was said here in -respect to the different items under consideration. In that way it will naturally benefit by the experience of various honorable senators. I can speak with some little experience of wire ropes, and I hope that when Ryland Brothers begin operations at Newcastle they will be in a position to make just as good a rope as they can produce in Great Britain. They will probably get some of their most skilled workmen to come out to Australia to set this class of work going here, and knowing the reputation of the firm, I think we can depend that it will not turn out a, shoddy article. But, in any case, I trust that every care will he exercised by the administration. I do not look upon the duty proposed to be placed upon wire rope at a. later date as likely to be of any serious moment, because the wire rope makers practically command the market, and can charge any price they choose. In fact, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> I wonder in the circumstances why any duty is to be imposed. Of course, it is preferable to have the work done within Aus- , tralia. instead of at Sheffield, Birmingham, or anywhere else; but I really have not heard any sound reason advanced for imposing any duty upon this article. To my mind, everything depends upon careful administration as to when the duty should come into operation. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has put into my mouth reflections upon the skill of Australian workmen which I certainly did not intend, and I do not think my words conveyed any such meaning to the average intelligence. I suppose the Minister was busy attending to some other matter at the time, because if he had heard me correctly he could not have insinuated, in the nasty way he did, that I was casting reflections upon Australian workmen. I probably know more about the Australian man as a man, when one comes right up against him, than the Minister does, and certainly I know more about his capacity for work and fighting too, in comparison with men from any other part of the world, than any other senator does. I stand second to none in my appreciation of the Australian, and I emphatically refute the Minister&#39;s insinuation in this regard. Wire rope, before it is exported to Australia, is subjected to a very severe test, not only by the manufacturers, but also by the British Board of Trade. I have several certificates issued by that Board in respect to importations into Western Australia. Furthermore, the mines regulations in Western Australia enforce the application of very severe tests before the mining inspectors will permit any to be used in a mine. Even if this rope is made in Australia, it will have to meet the requirements of the mining inspectors of the various States. In a letter to me the general manager of the Associated Gold Mines of Western Australia says - </para>

These were amended so that, on and after the 8th July of this year, the intermediate and general Tariffs became 20 per cent. It was further decided that, from the beginning of 1923, the rates of 15 per cent., 25 per cent., and 30 per cent, should be reverted to. I desire that the original rates shall be immediately re-imposed. I move, therefore -

            <para class="block">As an outcome of the amendments made in another place, the margin between the British and general rates now operating is only 5 per cent. During the war, Great Britain lost her trade in the production of sporting cartridges because her factories were employed in turning out munitions. The percentage of sporting ammunition supplied to Australia by the United Kingdom over a. period of years is set out in the following table: - </para>

            <para class="block">Honorable senators will perceive the remarkable increase in 1920. I am confident that the percentage of British sporting ammunition imported to Australia will return to something like prewar proportions if the margin of preference against American manufacturers is increased without delay to 10 per cent. If the difference of only 5 per cent, is to remain until the deferred rates come into operation, considerably more than a year hence, huge stocks of American cartridges will be dumped into this country. As it is, very large supplies from America are being imported. Sporting cartridges are being manufactured in Australia. In Victoria, one factory is employing between thirty and forty hands. </para>

This industry is established in Australia, and although the manufacturers are not making the whole of the component parts of cartridges, they are using Australian shot and employing Australian labour, and if the industry is given the necessary encouragement, the manufacturers intend to produce complete cartridges. The general tenor of the debates in this Chamber has been in favour of Australian manufacturers meeting the whole of our requirements, and if that is to be done adequate protection should be afforded. </para>

                    <para>.- The duties are set out in this form because the industry at present is largely an assembling one. The manufacture of complete cartridges is intended, and that is why there is a duty of only 20 per cent, in the general Tariff. A deferred duty has been imposed so that when complete cartridges are being manufactured greater protection will be afforded.We do not need to give high protection to an assembling industry. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator thought just now that a low protection was ample for an industry that was meeting practically the whole of our requirements ; but he is now advocating a duty of 30 per cent, to protect what is merely an assembling industry. I quite agree that when an industry has reached the stage when it can manufacture complete cartridges it should be protected with a 30 per cent, duty, but we should not impose such a high  Tate  until that stage is reached. I therefore ask the Committee to adhere to these rates, and the companies concerned will then have to prove that a higher duty is justified. </para>

The duty on fuse under sub-item c has been doubled since this Tariff was originally introduced. The duty on sub-item  d,  covering powder and sporting powder, is to be materially increased on and after 1st January, 1923. On articles covered by sub-item  e,  the duty has been reduced, and if the sub-item is allowed to remain as it stands the explosive industry in Australia must cease to exist.

Government and the irreducible minimum duties required in the interests of the local explosive factory. We have now at Deer Park, near Sunshine, works established on an area exceeding 200 acres. The factory employs, approximately, 250 persons, the amount paid in salary and wages exceeds &#163;45,000 a year. The factory is equipped with the most modern plant for the production of nitro-glycerine explosives of the highest quality. I am informed that there is no factory in the world to-day possessing a more up-to-date plant. So far as I can ascertain, Australia uses about 700 tons of coal-getting explosives and about 1,800 tons of gelatine explosives in the year. The factory to which I have referred is capable of turning out the whole of Australia&#39;s requirements for coal explosives and at least 80 per cent, of the gelatine explosives required in the Commonwealth. What will our position be in the matter of national defence unless we have explosives manufactured in Australia? So far as coal mining is concerned, I want to say that if the whole of the duty I propose is paid by that industry it will not represent more than1d. and a very small decimal per ton of coal produced. At the expense, in an extreme case, of adding1d. per ton to the cost of coal, is it not worth while to continue the manufacture of explosives in Australia, or should we, by leaving the duties as they appear in the schedule, close the local factory and have no explosives of this kind locally manufactured for the purpose of making Australia self-contained? Without explosives we cannot get any coal, any metals, or any of the basic things which are required for the manufacture of munitions of war. I am aware that honorable senators have been inundated with arguments, pro and con, in connexion with the duties on explosives. I do not want to repeat any of those arguments, but I appeal to the Committee to give this industry a chance to keep going. What is the use of spending millions of money on defence unless we manufacture the basic materials required for munitions of war ? I do not intend to flog the question, because honorable senators have probably made up their minds, and I merely remind them again that so far as coal explosives are concerned, the duties I have proposed are the same as those which, appeared in the Tariff as originally introduced, whilst those I have proposed on the other class of explosives represent a reduction upon the duties proposed by the Minister. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish briefly to indorse the remarks which have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> I do not understand the action of the Government in proposing a reduction of these duties which must kill a good local industry, and a key industry at that. When we are at war, of what use will it be to us to have men, guns, rifles, and a Navy, if we cannot obtain here the explosives which we must use ? The industry in Australia is being carried on with white labour, those in charge of it are treating their employees well, and have spent their money in securing an up-to-date plant, and they are competing against explosives made by black labour in South Africa. The company manufacturing explosives here is a very large employer of labour. It must treat its employees well, or we should not have had so many letters from them asking us to do what we can to prevent the destruction of this industry. I shall not speak at length upon the matter, because I believe that honorable senators must recognise the fairness of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> request. Compared with other duties agreed to, those proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> are very moderate. If the industry is not given the protection of the duties originally proposed by the Government, the local factory must be closed, people will be thrown out of employment, and if we should be at war our guns, rifles, Navy, and soldiers will be of no use to us. </para>

At any rate, we are speaking of an Australian industry, and I thought it was the policy of the Government to encourage the employment of our people in manufactures to meet Australian requirements. I strongly urge the Minister to accept the moderate duty proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - It is not my intention to enter upon a lengthy discussion of this matter. In my view, it is removed from the sphere of discussion. It is a question of life or death to miners, and not a question of whether we should establish a local industry in competition with foreign manufacturers of this article. I went home last Friday with the intention not to continue to attend the present sittings of the Senate, but the importance of this one item induced me to come back. I have been told on the most reliable authority that in coal mines, occasionally, the fall of one piece of coal develops gas, and if, by the use of inferior explosive, the gas becomes ignited, it means death to the miners. </para>

                    <para>. -  The higher duties proposed upon explosives used in coal mining, compared with those used for gold mining, and other metalliferous mining are explained by the fact that at present ammonia nitrate, which is used in the manufacture of explosives, is imported, and is dutiable at 15 per cent. If, under a departmental by-law, this commodity were admitted free for the manufacture of explosives, I should be prepared to propose that the duties on both classes of explosives should be the same. I make this explanation in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.</inline> I hope the Committee will realize that my request represents the irreducible minimum. I have not attempted to ask for an increased duty in respect of the whole of the 1,800 tons of mining explosives annually used in the Commonwealth, but have confined my request to those used in coal mining. I might readily have asked that the same duties be imposed in respect of all classes of explosives, but I am trying to meet the position and at the same time to preserve the local industry. As to the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> with respect to the safety of human life, I am informed that tests made quite recently by the British Government have proved the locally-made explosives to be equal to any of those which are imported. </para>

As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said, the safety of the miners depends upon the quality of the blasting material used by them. The composition of an explosive must be such that, in the first place, only the element used to. explode it will explode it, and, in the next place, that it will not ignite the inflammable &#39;element known as gas. The blasting powder used in. Australia to-day, particularly in our coal mines, has been shown again and again to be absolutely free from any dangerous defect of that kind. </para>

I have used tons of blasting powder of every description, and know that there are a thousand and one ways in which the lives of miners might be endangered by the use of inferior explosives. In years gone by strikes took place in practically every mine throughout the country owing to inferior explosives being served out to the men. No one discovers sooner than, a miner the inferiority of an explosive. </para>

Certain imported explosives have been used in- our mines for years, and have been shown to be beyond all doubt absolutely safe. I therefore urge that we allow the item to remain as it stands. When .the company engaged in the manufacture of explosives in Australia has proved that its product is as safe and as well suited to do the service daily required of explosives in our mine&#39;s as is the imported article, I venture to say that the miner will have no prejudice whatever against the Australian explosive. </para>

I do not know whether the honorable senator has the numbers to carry his request ; but  if  he has, I suggest to him. that he should so alter his request as to make it read, &#34; Coal-getting explosives, being those explosives named and specified in any permitted list approved by the Department.&#34; It may be that some other State has a permitted list, and we ought not to differentiate between the States. </para>

                    I should like to emphasize the point that neither I nor any other honorable senator would favour the protection - of an industry if by doing so we would endanger human life. The greater portion of the explosives used in our mines to-day are manufactured by Nobel Limited, of Glasgow. The company which has established the industry here is a branch of that corporation, and must have the advantage of the experience and knowledge gained in the Glasgow factory, so it is unreasonable to suggest that its explosive is inferior to that produced in Scotland. We have heard this same complaint of inferiority with respect to every new brand of explosive placed on the market since the introduction of nitro-glycerine compounds. When nitro-glycerine was first introduced, the miners complained that its use in the mines gave them a headache. As a matter of fact, every nitro-glycerine explosive compound, and particularly dynamite, has that effect. We have had this same bogy trotted out in connexion with every new explosive.

                    GLASGOW.They have been forced out of  the  market by competition! Every new brand of explosive is met with the same objection  on  the part of the miners, who are  encouraged  by the old-established firms  to  make it. The Australian branch  of  Nobel Limited, of Glasgow, has the advantage of the knowledge and experience gained by the parent company, and it is reasonable to assume that it can produce as good an article as is made in the Glasgow factory. This complaint of inferiority on the part of locally-made explosives is only a red herring drawn across the track . I have had a fairly wide experience in the handling of explosives, such as blasting gelatine and gelatine dynamite used in metalliferous mining. Explosives brought here from a distance and stored for any length of time in a hot climate deteriorate. The gelatine exudes through the wrapper, and the explosive then becomes dangerous. That risk would be avoided by the use of locally-made explosives. Surely it is an advantage to have in the Commonwealth a factory that can supply explosives as required, and so render it unnecessary  to  store them for any length of time.

What section has had its two hands on the throat of the community as- the coal miners have during the last five or six years ? They have been prepared ta hang up every other industry whenever it suited them, and yet, when it is a question of imposing a duty upon explosives for the purpose of encouraging an Australian industry, it is a case of &#34;hands off. We nave to think of the coal miner.&#34; . </para>

This information is supplied to honorable senators from a most authoritative source. Nobels, in the Mother Country, produce an article that is in demand the world over; and is it too much to expect that the same firm, under the improved industrial conditions obtaining in Australia, cannot accomplish the same results in the Commonwealth? Why should there be this wild howl from the coal miners that this duty must not be imposed ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says that they did not use this class of powder during the war. Perhaps not. But if we were at war to-morrow he would be very&#39; glad to have the machinery which this firm employ in the Australian industry, available for defence purposes. </para>

The explosives are paid for by the miner, out of his wages. The transaction often does not go through the office at all, the coal miner paying his grocer or his storekeeper for this commodity. This practice is not confined to the coal trade either. What about the working gold miner, and the parties of tributors, in Western Australia? All these men pay for their explosives. Every statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> in regard to the danger of using inflammable explosives is absolutely correct. </para>

                    <para>. - In addition to what has been said about the preservation of the lives of miners, there is another reason why we should be careful before we agree to any extra impost upon this item, namely, the need to preserve the life of the industry itself. Remarks which I made during the debate upon wire ropes apply with equal force to explosives. I do not see why the mining industry should be called upon to contribute so largely to the development of the manufacture of explosives, especially in view of the fact that works of this nature are essential for defence purposes. In the debate upon the iron duties it was urged that the protection should be agreed to from a defence point of view, and it was perfectly understandable that the burden in that case should be spread over the whole community. But the same process cannot be followed with regard to the item now under discussion, because comparatively few people besides those engaged in mining are in the habit of using explosives. It is quite true that one section&#39; of the industry - I refer to coal mining - is in a fairly satisfactory position, but the same cannot be said of the metalliferous miner. We have only to read the reports of almost any of these metalliferous mining companies to realize that the industry is in an unfortunate, if not almost hopeless, position. Mines are closing down all over the country, and yet we are asked in this item to agree to duties for the purpose of supporting another industry, which, let it be remembered, must be intimately related to any defence scheme. In view of this fact, it is false reasoning&#39; and quite unfair to expect that the mining industry, which, as I have shown, is almost on its last legs, should bear the entire burden of this impost. The duties should rest on broader shoulders, instead of upon an industry which it will take us all our time to keep afloat. No mention has been made, so far, of the relationship that exists between the. so-called local company and the big Combine operating in the Old World. It was; set out clearly in the evidence before the Inter-State Commission that the Australian concern would not have been in operation were it not for financial aid received from this Combine at the other end of the world. It is an industrial offspring of the parent Combine, and, like most offsprings, it shows an unmistakable likeness to the parent that begot it. We have the evidence of a Broken Hill mine manager that they were fleeced and almost driven into a corner as the result of the action of this Combine, whose pup has been established in the Commonwealth. The mining industry of Broken Hill had to pay exorbitant rates for its explosives. That being so, is it reasonable to assume that the offspring of the Combine will act differently towards it? </para>

                        <para>- It is entirely wrong to shoulder upon the mining industry the entire burden of promoting this industry at Deer Park, which it is said should be fostered asa necessary adjunct to the defence system of Australia, more particularly when we recall the fact that the metalliferous mines of Australia are to-day in a struggling, position. When men go out to prospect and develop a mine, they work on a very narrow margin for months and perhaps for years. There is no profit in mining to-day; yet here is an undisguised effort to make the lot of the mining companies still harder, and to prevent a prospecting show from having any chance of proving itself to be a success. It is a proposition which I <inline font-style="italic">do</inline> not think this Committee ought to countenance. I have drawn attention to the close relationship of this Melbourne concern to the world Combine known as the Nobel Explosives Company. In giving evidence before the Inter-State Commission, a mine manager from Broken Hill South pointed out that the industry at Broken Hill was in such a bad way in&#34; 1908, because of the high prices then being charged for explosives, that a meeting of the management was called to decide what steps should be taken to improve the position. As a result of that meeting, tenders were called, and the two big Combines - the British and the Hamburg - submitted tenders, but there was no difference in their prices. In fact, there was no attempt to, disguise the existence of a combination between them. The Broken Hill mining companies were then driven into the position of defending themselves; they invited a South African explosives manufacturing company to come into this market, and gave them a five years&#39; contract, which brought about a reduction of from 40 per cent, to 50 per cent, in the cost of explosives in Australia. It is now proposed to shut out this South African Company&#39;s products - at least, that will be the result of increasing the duty; and, seeing that the European Combines showed no mercy to the Australian metalliferous mining industry, if is hardly reasonable to expect that their progeny in Australia will have more sympathy for it. Its nature must be precisely that of its parents overseas. But I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> to have a little more sympathy with those States in which metal is mined - Western Australia, for instance. </para>

                        <para>- If the mining companies of Western Australia are so infatuated with the superiority of the Deer Park product, it is a singular fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hamilton,</inline> the  President  of the Chamber of Mines, Western Australia, has sent a telegram to all the Western Australian representatives here asking them to insist on explosives being made free. If they wanted the Deer Park proposition kept afloat, the Chamber of Mines&#39; would have advised the Western Australian representatives here to at least maintain the duties; but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hamilton&#39;s</inline> telegram to me indicates, they are unanimously of opinion that the duties upon explosives should be wiped out. I am against wiping out the Deer Park industry. I think that the Government and this Parliament ought to take into serious consideration the necessity for preserving it; but, even on the statement of the manager of the factory itself, it is making a small profit, whereas I can name half-a-dozen mining companies which are not making a profit, although they employ five or six times the number of people employed in the explosives industry in Melbourne. Have we no consideration&#39; for the men engaged in mining ? If it is intended to put them out of existence, by all means let us impose this duty and put them out of financial pain at once. I am surprised that the representatives&#39; of States in which gold and silver are not produced have not more sympathy with neighbouring States. If we want to encourage the manufacture of explosives in Australia, we should do it by means of a. bounty, which would make the job one for the whole community, and not for an industry which is on its last legs. </para>

                    <para>&#39;. -  No item, in the Tariff has given me more anxiety than this has. A few years ago, during the war, I had a long conversation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> the Commonwealth Analyst. We were dis cussing by-products, and he pointed out that Australia was not producing some by-products which other nations were. He then made a remark which had a great influence upon me. He said that if the British Navy had not kept open the route between Australia and Great Britain, we would not have got supplies of certain ingredients for the making of lithofacteur - dynamite - and, as a consequence, every metalliferous and coal mine in Australia would have been obliged to close down. When I repeated that conversation subsequently to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> now ex-Senator Watson, he said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson</inline> was not quite right in saying that&#39; all the coal mines would be obliged to close down, because under certain circumstances some of them could still be worked, but the coal won would be extremely expensive, and the quantity produced would be very small in comparison with the normal output. These remarks indicated to me that, should we ever be engaged in war in the future, we must take no risks, and I came to the conclusion that we ought to be in a position to manufacture in Australia, even regardless of expense, explosives and iron and steel. There are many commodities which it is not of much importance from a national stand-point to make in Australia. For instance, we have heard a great deal of pianos to-day. I hope that the piano-making industry will continue in Australia and be successful, but from a national stand-point it would not make much difference in war time if pianos were made here or not. On the other hand, it is a matter of national importance to have explosives made here, not only for the purpose of enabling us to carry on warlike operations, but also so that our coal mines and metalliferous mines may be worked. Had it not been for the conversations I have narrated I would not have hesitated a moment- upon this item ; my vote would have been given to make explosives free. Having come to the conclusion that it is of vital importance to make explosives ourselves, I began to look round to see how this desired result could be brought about. There are quite a number of ways in which explosives can be made in Australia. First of all, I suppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will contend that they can be made under Free Trade conditions, but the Committee has already decided over and over again that certain industries - piano making, for instance - cannot be carried on without protection. Then there is the bounty system referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> and there is a good deal to be said in favour of it, just as I might claim that if a bonus were given to the timber getters of Western Australia the Broken Hill mines might be saved from being penalized by the increased timber duties. However, I will not stress that point. The question of nationalizing the industry is one that should also be considered; but the most vital thing of all is to be able to manufacture explosives of a satisfactory quality, so that we would not be dependent on outside sources of supply during a period of war. I was very much interested <inline font-style="italic">ki</inline> the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> who can speak with authority on mining, concerning the danger of using an inferior article. If the honorable senator&#39;s statement is correct, those who are .advocating increased duties to protect the Australian industry cannot expect very much support. Before this item is disposed of, I think we should be supplied with the names of the companies using the Australian product, and the quantities supplied, and told whether there have been any fatal accidents in consequence. I can speak with some authority on mining as I have worked in the tin mines of Cornwall, the silver mines of Mexico, and the lead mines of Broken Hill, and, as a result of my association with miners, I am able to say that they are very conservative, and hesitate about changing from an article which they understand to one which they do not. &#39; Before dynamite was introduced into the Cornish mines, powder was used, and it was a long time before the miners were convinced that the former was in every way preferable. If satisfactory answers can be given to the point I have raised, I shall be prepared to support higher duties; but if there is a danger, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> suggests, in using locally-made explosives, we should not only oppose the imposition of higher duties; but, if we have the power, prohibit the use of the local product, because lives of men should not be endangered in order to build up an industry. If it is necessary to manufacture explosives in Australia, I do not think the cost should be taken into consideration. I understand that the coal miners really do not pay for the dynamite they use, although prospectors have to do so. Under a New South Wales award the coal miners in that State have to receive 13s. 4d. per day. If they take a contract to extract coal from, a &#34; face,&#34; at the end of a week or a fortnight, whenever payment is due, the value of the dynamite, fuse, and candles used is deducted. If their earnings do not amount to 13s. 4d. per day over that period the difference is made up. </para>

                        <para>- When the men go to work it is on .the understanding that these costs will be taken into consideration, so that they shall receive a certain amount. I do not think it can be said that the coal miners in New South Wales are labouring under any disadvantages in this respect. The metalliferous mines in Western Australia and elsewhere, to which. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has referred, would have to close down if they were not paying ; but prospectors who are searching for minerals on their own account would be compelled to meet the extra cost if the price of explosives were increased. I believe that if the Australian industry is to be properly developed, and becomes firmly established, certain ingredients used in the manufacture of explosives will still have to be imported. If the Committee decides to impose higher duties our requests will have to go to another place for acceptance, and during that time those who are . supporting higher rates should prove that the Australian explosives do not endanger the lives of the men as has been suggested. If they do, their use should be prohibited. </para>

                    <para>. - When this matter was first brought under my notice I approached it with a good deal of doubt. I realize the vital importance of providing our own requirements, more especially for defence purposes, so that in the event of war we would not be dependent on oversea supplies. Even if we were fully equipped with artillery and rifles, our position would be hopeless without an adequate supply of explosives of the highest standard. I. feel, however, that a good deal could be said on the other side, and <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> doubts were quickened by the earnest speeches delivered by SenatorHenderson and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> The former is a practical miner, and when he was graphically depicting the dangers arising from the use qf inferior explosives, which might cause a flash, and set on fire the gases in a mine, resulting in the death of hundreds of miners and the destruction of the property, I felt it to be the duty of those advocating increased rates to prove that the Australian explosives had had a sufficient trial to prove their quality. If it could not be shown that their quality is satisfactory, I would oppose increased duties; but I find on investigation that the Australian-made explosives - the product of the Deer Park factory - have been very extensively used in Australia. I have been furnished with a&#34; list of the mines, and the quantities they are using, and I propose, in order to relieve the doubts and fears in the minds of some honorable senators, to give the names of the companies and the quantities they utilize, It is the coal miners to whom we have to give consideration because the risk of explosions in collieries is much greater than in other mines.

                        <para>- I have just quoted the fact that the Ipswich Collieries use 7&#189; tons a month of the local product, and the Mount Mulligan Colliery half a ton a month. Not only are the particulars which have been given me open to public criticism, but the fact is that the employees actually using Australian explosives in the collieries of the three States mentioned are satisfied to use them, and evidently have no objection on the score of danger. But for the statements which I have been able to place before the Committee I must admit that I would have been ready to take the word of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> and of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> I would have hesitated to give a vote which might have forced upon the coal miners of Australia a material in which, so far as I knew, they had no confidence, and the general use of which might have resulted in grave accidents. </para>

                        <para>- In opposition to what those representatives have stated  in  Parliament, there is the fact that thousands of our coal miners are using Australian explosives to-day, without prejudice. I am not aware that the percentage of accidents is any higher in those collieries  where the  local product  is used than in any other mines. Indeed, I am quite sure that if anything detrimental could be proved by its competitors, the public would very quickly hear of it. . The miners themselves would be the first to complain ; they would have taken action long ago. </para>

                        <para>- I repeat that the particulars were supplied for public information, and that if they are incorrect they can be challenged to-morrow. My objection to the imposition of higher duties has been almost entirely removed by them . For sonic time, of course, the effect may be to cause a small increase in cost to the mining interests, but that will not amount to more than1d. per ton on the coal produced. Meanwhile, assistance will have been given, not merely to the building up of a great industry in Australia, but also to rendering more secure the defence of our great country. </para>

                        <para>- I am, fully alive to the fact that there is a cordite factory at Maribyrnong, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating&#39;s</inline> interjection suggested that the whole of the explosives for use all over Australia in all the mines should be manufactured in a Government factory. I do not favour that at present. I know that the local explosives works are a branch of a great Combine. It was that fact which accounted for my hesitation. I have been tardy in giving the local interest my support for the reason that the Combine once attempted to throttle the mining industry of Australia. It was that effort which caused the De Beers Company to enter Australia upon the advice, and with the co-operation of, certain leading mining companies - among them the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. To-day, however, there is a, factory established in Australia, and it is very largely within our own control. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot understand why the Government do not take every, step to keep the local explosives industry energetically alive. The home production of explosives is vital to Australia, in case of anything happening which might cut us off from British supplies. At present there is a formidable rebellion, in India, and who knows but that in a few years the Indian Empire may have been left from the British Empire. It is not certain but that South Africa herself may be hostile to us at some future date. If such possibilities became facts Australia would be cut off. We would be left without means for defending ourselves unless we had made our own preparations to that end. It has been stated that Australian explosives are dangerous, and that a safe product cannot be made here. An explosive is being imported from South Africa which has been manufactured by black labour; its friends assert that it is quite safe. If cheap South African black labour can produce a safe explosive, cannot white Australian workers do the same ? </para>

                        <para>- The particulars given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> reveal the extent to which the local material is used. If it were not deemed safe by the miners actually using it, there would soon be such an outcry as would be heard all over Australia. The local manufacturers are prepared to bind themselves for the next five years to supply at the same prices as rule to-day. No objection can be taken, therefore, on the score of increased costs following increased protection. The chief ingredient, which comes from Norway, is dutiable in Australia, whilst it is admitted free of duty to South Africa. The manufacturers of explosives in South Africa employ black labour at low wages. Why should we not give this industry a similar amount of protection to that which we have given to other industries of a like nature? It has been said that the local factory is the &#34; pup &#34; of a monopoly; but that is a very extraordinary argument to be used in support of the case of the de Beers Company, -which is a competitor of the local industry, and, as honorable senators are aware, is one of the greatest monopolies in the world. I would personally have been prepared to move for higher duties on this article than have been proposed. </para>

                    on 10th May, states that his company expended capital during the war &#34;in order to keep Australia supplied with explosives at a time when sufficient supply could not be procured from abroad.&#34; Again, so far as Western Australia is concerned, there is no truth in this statement or implication that sufficient supplies could not be obtained from abroad during the war. The Imperial authorities did everything possible in the direction of keeping our industry supplied with explosives during the war &#39; period, and only on one occasion did the English supply fail, and then we had no difficulty in obtaining supplies from South Africa. No Victorian explosives have been used by the Western Australian mines, and those connected with the industry are to be taxed to support a secondary industry that is of no benefit to them.

I go further and say that the time will arrive when it will be essential that we should have this industry established in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; but I have so far heard no reasons advanced why one industry in Australia should have to pay for the establishment of an industry essential to the defence of this country. That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> proposes. He wants the mining industry of Australia to pay for the establishment of the explosive industry. We know that the metalliferous mining industry in Australia is tottering on the verge of destruction, and yet it is asked to supply the funds necessary to keep this factory at Deer Park going. Is that a fair proposition ? Would it not be a fairer proposition to ask the whole of the people of Australia to pay for this factory, or some similar institution, in the interests of the defence of Australia? Is it a fair thing to ask the unfortunate mining industry, which never experienced in its history a worse time  than it is going through now, to carry on its back yet another load? Honorable senators have only to consider the incidence of the Tariff, which I have characterized in very strong terms, to learn how it hits the miner and mine-owner at every turn. Here is the last straw. Miners, mine-owners, and all associated with mining in Australia join in an appeal that this last straw should not be added to the burden of their industry. I am afraid that their appeal does not reach some members of the Committee. We are told that the factory at Deer Park employs a few hundred people, and on that account we should keep it going. The mines of my own State alone employ thousands of people. Are honorable senators going to set the interests of a few people at Deer Park against the existence of the whole of Kalgoorlie, because that is what the request under consideration amounts to? Which is of the greater importance to Australia, the carrying on of its mines or the carrying on of the Deer Park factory? Our first consideration in this matter should be for the mines of Australia, and the small factory at Deer Park should be but a secondary consideration. </para>

I find that my statement was not correct. I like a fight as well as anybody; but when I find that because of a misunderstanding I have made a mistake, I take the first opportunity to correct it. Before the adjournment for dinner some honorable senators asked what tests are made to insure the standardization of locally manufactured explosives in the interest of the safety of those who use them. I am informed that all the explosives made in Victoria are under the direct supervision of the inspector of explosives, and their manufacture is most carefully guarded in every shape and form. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator and I have been standing together very well on Tariff questions, but on this occasion we find ourselves ranged in opposing camps., I think he will admit that if the men who use explosives in our coal mines, and whose lives are at stake, buy the locally-manufactured article, that is a conclusive argument as to its safety. I have referred already to the tests to which the Australian product has been submitted. Samples were sent to England, and the reply of the testing authorities of the British Government was that its use would be permitted in any of the coal mines there, and that it was second to none. It is said that Nobel Limited have an active part in the local industry. I would point out that the explosives that are imported are to a very large extent manufactured by that company. I do not wish to discredit the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> but the explosives used when he was mining are not in use to-day. </para>

                        <para>- I am dealing with this question from a commercial point of view, but with due regard to the interests of the men who use explosives. In view of the fact that the Australian-made explosives have been declared by the British authorities to be fit for use in the coal mines of Great Britain, I fail to understand why any objection should be offered to their use here. The local company is a reputable one, and the information supplied by it in support of its product is public property. No company of any repute would lend itself to misleading statements. Taking into account the work that the local industry is doing, and the  employment it is providing, I think that, apart altogether from the question of the black labour employed in making explosives abroad, a good case has been made out for the protection of the Australian product. </para>

                        has pictured the company engaged in the manufacture of explosives here as a sort of commercial octopus, that is going to throw its arms round the mining industry of Australia and squeeze it to death. The Australian company is directed by intelligent business men, yet
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline>
                        wishes us to believe that it is prepared to squeeze to death the mining industry of the Commonwealth, on which it depends for its market, and thus to destroy itself. Is it reasonable to assume that it will do anything of the kind? It has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds in establishing the industry here; and surely its object will be to develop its trade to the fullest possible extent? It is said that it is identical with the company that squeezed the miners on a former occasion.

                        <para>- That may be; but it has now delivered itself into our hands. It has come here and built up huge assets, so that if it again resorted to such tactics we could, if necessary, deal with it by legislation. We could nationalize the industry if those engaged, in it adopted monopolistic tactics. I repeat that its very existence requires that it should nurse the mining industry of Australia and so enlarge the market for its output. </para>

                        <para>- They should be allowed to do so, but, apparently, some honorable senators have resolved that the miners shall be called upon to pay a higher price for the safe article. We may have a thousand mining men ready always to do the fair thing, and to use only a safe explosive. But it needs only one to employ a dangerous explosive for a great disaster to occur. I am guided in this matter by the opinions of the representatives of the miners in another place. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watkins,</inline> like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> are sincere Protectionists. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> is the only real Protectionist we have here; he has stuck to his guns throughout the consideration of the Tariff schedule. I ask honorable senators &#39; to consider for a moment what may happen if we render it impossible for our miners to obtain a &#171;safe explosive except at an enormously increased price. Consider for a moment the awful results that would attend an explosion in a mine. If honorable senators will keep that in mind they will not be likely to sleep better than they have been doing. </para>

                    <para>- I need not repeat any of the arguments already advanced in favour of the general, principle of protection; but those who have urged as a reason for opposing the request that the locally made explosive is dangerous have given me cause for much thought. I am a practical miner, and have used both the Australian and the German Nobel product. . As far as I am able to judge, there is very little difference between their breaking force and general effectiveness in mining operations. I am not able to speak with authority as to the class of explosives that should be used in coal mines, where there is a danger pf firedamp, and when an honorable senator states, apparently on the authority of the representatives of the coal miners, that the Australian-made explosive is dangerous for such a purpose, it sets one thinking. Since that statement was made I have been hurriedly looking through the reports of the- debate on this item in another place, but I have not found in them any definite statement by either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watkins</inline> that the Australian-made explosive is dangerous for use in coal mines. I hold so high an opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton</inline> that if he said that the locally-made article was dangerous, my vote would be given against its protection. </para>

I have the assurance of those interested in the industry - of course, it might be said that their opinion is prejudiced - that the local explosive is not dangerous, that, on the contrary, it possesses all the qualities of the most carefully-tested explosives produced in England, and is being used successfully, and with perfect safety, in the combustible mines of Australia, &#34;where a lingering fire would be extremely dangerous. In view of these facts, I cannot attach very great importance to what might be regarded the irresponsible statement that it is dangerous to human life. If we had any reasonable evidence pointing to that possibility, I would not only refuse to assist the industry but would agitate for its abolition. We have had some scare speeches on this subject tonight. The industry, I think,  ought to be discussed on its merits. I am as strong in the matter of encouraging this industry as any other. I want to see all such industries established in Australia, and believing as I do that the local explosive is quite as good as the imported article, 1 am going to vote for the increased duties. </para>

                <para class="block">These proposed duties are about the same on to-day&#39;s values as the duties on hair and fibre. I want the fixed duties, because since I mentioned the matter in connexion with another item the kapok values have been reduced by importers from Java to 107/8d. per lb. in order to compete with the new and growing industry that has been established in Australia for making mattresses from thoroughly scoured wool, samples of which I produced in the Senate some little time ago. An analysis by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> the Government Analyst, shows that the grease left in the wool is only . 06 per cent. This should entirely remove any objection that might have been urged against the use of scoured wool for mattresses. Australia is the principal market for Java kapok. In the United States of America, most mattresses are stuffed with cotton, and in Great Britain and Europe wool, hair, and fibre are largely used, and yet when we propose to use thoroughly scoured wool in Australia it is suggested that we are asking too much of the Australian people. As a matter of fact, we should directly encourage the use of this product, because our wool-growers have had a very rough time lately, and, owing to the huge stocks of low-grade wools on hand, the future is clouded in uncertainty. Therefore, the use of thoroughly scoured low-grade wool for mattress filling should be encouraged in every possible way. Honorable senators have had an opportunity of inspecting these mattresses, and I venture to say that they have never seen a better article, or one more comfortable to sleep upon. Medical opinion is to the effect that wool is the healthiest substance that can be used. In view of these facts, the Committee should agree to the request. </para>

                        <para>- They can use the mattresses they have already. I would be sorry to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> sleeping between newspapers in a park. If this duty is imposed, there will be no need for Australians to worry about increased costs, because woollen mattresses are coming on the market very rapidly. They are being bought by some of the biggest hotels and flats in Sydney. According to <inline font-style="italic">The Bedding Manufacturer,</inline> an American trading journal, the American Congress is now considering the advisability of placing a heavy duty on kapok in order to meet the cheap-labour competition of Java. If the people of America realize the necessity for building up a local industry to utilize local products for the purpose of making mattresses, surely it is wise for us to do the same here, especially when we can grow kapok in our own territories as cheaply as it can be grown in Java, but more especially when we can give equality of opportunity to our own local wool-growers. But the duty I support is necessary for another reason. Wool, like kapok,  is  bought at so much per lb., but as the quantity of wool that goes into a mattress is much greater than the quantity of kapok required, weight for weight, it costs much more to turn out a finished woollen mattress than it does to make a finished kapok mattress. I hope that the Committee will see the wisdom of adopting my suggestion to give some degree of protection to this new industry which has been established in Australia. The people engaged in making these mattresses have asked for more protection, but I do not think that we need increase the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate of 40 per cent, for hair or fibre. I think it is quite sufficient to impose a fixed duty, of 6d. per lb. upon kapok. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator has frequently told us that coarse wool is unsaleable, and that the most it will realize is 2d. per lb.; but, when it suits his argument, wool suddenly increases in value. The fact remains that the price of coarse wool, which would be used for these mattresses, is not above a fifth of the price of kapok, and yet it is not used for the purpose of making mattresses. Why not? Because the people prefer kapok mattresses, especially in the warmer parts of the Commonwealth, where woollen mattresses would be insufferable. Kapok is not used out of a pure spirit of contrariness. It possesses certain qualities, which wool has not, that makes it eminently suitable for mattresses. I will quote the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> the Commonwealth Analyst, who was asked for a report upon this proposal, which had been made to the Department by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.</inline> In his report, he says - </para>

                    <para>The fact is generally accepted by the bedding trade that the public prefer a kapok mattress to a wool mattress, even if the kapok costs more. It is common knowledge&#39; that kapok is odourless, and, unlike wool, it does not retain odours. Kapok does not felt under the combined effect of heat, moisture, and pressure. Wool, unless exceedingly, coarse in the fibre, will always felt, more or less, under the above conditions, and the cleaner the wool is scoured the more liable it becomes to felt under the conditions above mentioned. From a hygienic aspect, no objection whatever can be taken to kapok. </para>

It would be absolutely the highest duty in the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has fully realized the effect of his. proposal. From a Protection stand-point, one could not justify &#39; such an impost. At any rate, it would not cause the use of a single lb. of wool more than is being used to-day. If all the mattresses of Australia were stuffed with wool, it would mean utilizing only an infinitesimal portion of the wool produced by us, but at the same time would make kapok mattresses dearer to the people of Australia. For these reasons the Government cannot accept the request. </para>

                    <para>. - I. am very sorry that I cannot accept the Commonwealth Analyst as an expert on wool. I have never heard of an analyst who was an expert on wool. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> is evidently labouring under a misapprehension in saying that coarse wool is cheaper than kapok. There are wools and wools. As I have frequently pointed out in this Chamber, coarse crossbred and Lincoln wool is practically unsaleable to-day; its price is as low as 2 1/2 d. or per lb., but that is not the class of wool required for stuffing mattresses. The most suitable wool for that purpose is what we call crossbred noils. After the wool is combed, there are certain short pieces of wool called, in the trade, noils, which the combing mills in this country find it very difficult to dispose of. Similarly our crossbred, lambs, and pieces are very difficult to dispose of, and they are suitable, after the necessary preparation, for this industry. The average price of the quality of wool most suitable for stuffing mattresses is 6d. per lb. in the greasy state, and the yield of that class of wool after clean scouring is about 60 per cent., so that the bone-dry scoured article can be valued at lOd. per lb. in the raw state. The scouring costs 2d. per lb., and the teasing another Id. or 2d. per lb., so that, when these items are added, the actual cost of the commodity which is to compete against kapok is, on the -present low price of wool, from ls. Id. to ls. 2d. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has pointed out that a greater quantity of wool than of kapok is required to stuff a mattress, that is if people demand the same bulk. It is estimated that it is 40 per cent, more, but I think that it is not so much as that. As the present price of kapok c.i.f. is lOd. per lb., a duty of at least 4d. per lb. would be required to put the Australian article, grown by white people, and handled from the time it is grown until the mattress is made and stuffed, by Australian white people, working under Australian conditions and wages, on an equal footing with the imported kapok grown by black labour in Java, and landed here at the price I have mentioned. The pre-war price of kapok was 4-Jd. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- I know that  kapok was landed in Australia at 4 1/2 d per lb. and bought at that price by people who stuff mattresses. If the price of kapok fell to 8d. per lb., we would still require a duty of 6d. to give the local woollen mattress maker a slight advantage. We produce 2,000,000 bales of wool per annum, and it is very difficult to get a market for the very classes of wools which would be used in stuffing mattresses. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care a rap about what he says ; he knows nothing about wool. Here is a case where we want to do something not only to improve the health of the people, but also to encourage the use of our own product against kapok grown by blacks on land owned by the Dutch in Java. Why should we not use Australian wool? We have a glut of wool, and we are looking all over the world for fresh avenues in which to sell it, more particularly those qualities of crossbred pieces, second pieces, and lamb&#39;s wool, which are eminently suitable for the stuffing of mattresses. The Minister also made the statement that wool will felt. Short crossbred wools, when properly scoured and teased, will not felt. By encouraging the manufacture of woollen mattresses we shall be building up an Australian activity, and finding another outlet for the product of a staple industry, even if we should at first sight appear to be making the people&#39;s bedding a trifle dearer. It should not be forgotten that the life of a woollen mattress is at least three times that of a kapok mattress ; it is much cheaper, therefore, in the long run. A woollen mattress is safer ; it is also warmer in winter and cooler in summer. I cannot understand the attitude of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> He bases his views upon the opinions of some departmental chemist who knows no more about wool than my boot. The firms locally manufacturing woollen mattresses are just establishing themselves. They have scarcely had an opportunity to place their production before the public; otherwise, it would be widely favoured. The reason why the woollen mattress has not previously been placed upon the local market is that the proper class of wool has never before been so cheap. But, just now, when the industry is being built up, the Government prefer to discourage it, and to favour a product from Java. The proposed duty of 6d. is very moderate. The local manufacturers originally asked for 9d. ; but I went into the whole matter most carefully in order to arrive at what would be a fair thing; and I now urge the Minister to agree to 6d. Why should a duty of 40 per cent. be imposed upon hair for stuffing mattresses and kapok be permitted to come in free? In any case I am asking for only the same rate, practically. </para>

                    <para>.- A more preposterous proposal than that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has not previously come before this Committee. From the outset of the discussion upon the Tariff, honorable senators have decried the enormously high cost of living. By their words and their votes they have shown a desire to reduce that cost. Several honorable senators have opposed every proposition calculated to place any additional penalty upon the people. Now, however, they are suggesting . that Parliament should deliberately say to the people, &#34; Henceforth we shall prescribe the class of bed upon which you shall lie.&#34; Kapok has provided not only a cheap but a comfortable bed upon which the weary worker can recline after a hard day&#39;s&#39; toil, but some honorable senators would compel him, for the future, to pay 50 per cent, more for his bed. </para>

He contented himself by saying that the Hotel Australia, in Sydney, had given a large order to the local firm. The management of that hotel will not be at the expense of this purchase; it will pass on the cost. I would not be surprised to find that the tariff for every room in the Hotel Australia had been increased by1s. a day from the moment of the introduction of the woollen mattresses. </para>

                    <para>. - The more I think over the proposition the more I am. inclined to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.</inline> Of the total production of Australian wool only about 5 per cent, is turned to account locally. The Government Analyst contends that kapok has one considerable advantage in that it is odourless. Are not woollen blankets odourless ? Woollen mattresses are almost imperishable; they are handed down from father to son. The trouble with the manufacturers of the local article will be that they will never get return orders. Comparing the cost of the one with the other, and taking into account the life of each, a woollen mattress is considerably the cheaper. As for the argument that it makes an uncomfortably hot bed in the Australian summer, is not wool a non conductor of heat ? Does not the housewife wrap up her ice in a piece of woollen cloth? </para>

                    <para>.- I strongly support the request. Wool producers are experiencing great difficulty in procuring a market for this primary Australian product. If an opportunity is presented for establishing an additional outlet Parliament should not decline it. No hardship will be inflicted on the public, because, although the initial cost of  a  woollen mattress is greater, the article itself lasts for years longer than a kapok mattress. In a few seasons the latter is practically reduced to dust. I have not had actual experience of a woollen mattress, but it should be almost everlasting. </para>

                    Yes, it does. Honorable senators know that on the Island of Nauru, which is under the joint control of Great Britain, New Zealand, and the Commonwealth, there is one of the greatest deposits of phosphatic rock in the world. Australia is rich in sulphide and pyritic ores, and the sulphuric acid manufactured from these ores with the phosphatic rock form the raw materials from which superphosphate is made. Superphosphate is produced very extensively in the Commonwealth. It is also manufactured, I understand, in New Zealand and South Africa, so that there are ample sources of supply within the British Empire. It is true that in the past we have imported a large quantity of phosphatic rock from Japan, and in this connexion&#34; I desire to direct honorable senators&#39; attention to the remarks of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edgeworth</inline>
                    David, one of our greatest scientific chemists, concerning the lessons to be learned from the war. One of these, which he particularly emphasized, is the absolute dependence of a country upon acid production as the foundation of its munition supplies. A country that has not developed its production of acids is impotent and helpless. Here is a country not very far from us which has developed its acid plants to a tremendous extent, not only for the production of acid for commercial purposes, but also that they may be used for the production of munitions. If a country is cut off from its supply of fertilizers in time of war the supply of food, which is essential, at once is lessened. What was it that strangled Germany ? The want of fertilizers for the treatment of the soil decreased the production of food and fats in that country, and had an appreciable effect in bringing about the end of the war. During the war our superphosphate manufacturers had the opportunity, if they had desired, to exploit this market, but they did not do so. They kept their prices below the world&#39;s parity. During the war period New Zealand was paying &#163;12 per ton for superphosphates, whilst we were paying &#163;6 per ton. The definite guarantee has been given by the manufacturers of superphosphates that if the duties now proposed are adopted they will not take advantage of the impost and increase their prices. The Department has that assurance in writing.

                    <para class="block">Much could be said of the necessity or otherwise of imposing duties on superphosphate, but it must be admitted that the soils of Australia must be treated with this product. Every year settlers are compelled by sheer force of circumstances to go further and further back on to the &#34; thin &#34; land in our agricultural areas because the good land has gradually been taken over for sheep farming and dairying. Wheat-growing is essential to the  prosperity of our country, and those who are taking up poorer land are shouldering a great responsibility, but are assisting by the development of the country and the production of cereals to increase our exports, and thus reduce our public indebtedness. Being a farmer it is my intention to assist the farmers in getting their manure as cheaply as possible. We do not desire manufacturers to be philanthropists, and dispose of their products at a price which does not pay; but, after the statement of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> it is difficult for us to conceive what the real object of the Government is, and whether they desire to protect only the manufacturer of superphosphates and the makers of sulphuric acid. </para>

                        <para>- Sulphuric acid is essential in the manufacture of explosives. We endeavoured to impose duties on explosives to give the local companies greater protection, but on top of that a request is now submitted which gives them further assistance, but means that the farmers must pay 25 per cent, more for fertilizers to meet the demands of the acid manufacturers. It is not fair to honorable senators or to the farmers to submit this request. </para>

                        <para>- That is the rate the Minister mentioned. Twenty years ago Japanese superphosphates were coming into Australia, and the price at that time was about &#163;4 5s. or &#163;4 10s. per ton. Japanese manure, according to analyses, was slightly superior to the Australian product; but at that time the Australian manufacturer was able to drive the Japanese product off the Australian market, and, consequently, they have lost our trade. The price at that time was as I have mentioned, but to-day we are paying about &#163;6 per ton, and I understand the strength of the local product has been reduced by 2 units, which is equal to 5s. or 6s. per ton. I admit that it is necessary to protect these industries from dumping, and I understand that the Government intend introducing an anti-dumping Bill. I am sure that no one is in favour of foreign products being dumped here to the detriment of Australian manufacturers. </para>

                        <para>- It may be; but to the farmer it is a very different proposition. We should take info consideration the position of settlers in Western Australia, where there are vast tracts of arid land awaiting development, and of those in New South Wales and in Queensland. Even the banana-growers in the last-mentioned State have informed me that they use 3 cwt. to 7 cwt. of superphosphates per acre to manure their little plots. The same thing applies throughout the State. When I find representatives of the farmers in another place informing the people that the farmers are themselves about to start a manufactory for the production of the manure they require, and to make it a success without protection, how can I, who claim to some extent to represent the interests of the farmers, ask the Government to impose a duty of 25 per cent. ? I will concede the right to the protection of an anti-dumping measure. It is my intention to submit a request that the duties shall be, per ton, British, free; intermediate,1s.; general, ls. If such a request is carried it will lead to reconsideration of the matter in another place, where the Government can give reasons for the imposition of a duty of 25 per cent, and take responsibility for carrying their proposal. It is not reasonable that another place should turn down a proposal for the imposition of a duty and then ask the Senate to impose a duty because they were afraid to do so themselves.. In another place honorable members did not ask for protection, and asked that sulphur should be admitted free. In this Chamber the Government proposed a duty on sulphur, in my opinion, for the purpose of forcing the Committee to impose a duty on superphosphates. </para>

                    <para class="block">The reason for interrupting the discussion of the schedule of the Customs Tariff Bill is that it is essential that this Bill should be passed at once. The operation of the existing Act is about to lapse, and unless this Bill is passed there will be an interval during which no bounty will be payable. The purpose of this Bill is to enable the bounty sanctioned by the Shale Oil Bounty Act to be paid for another twelve months. So that this is really only a carry-on measure. By sections 2 and 3 of the existing Act an appropriation of revenue amounting to &#163;270,000 was made, to continue for a period of four years from the 1st September, 1917, for the payment of bounty in respect of the production in Australia of crude shale oil from mined kerosene shale. Of this sum only &#163;84,685 l1s. has been paid, and as the period of four years is now up it is necessary to secure Parliamentary sanction for the continuance of the bounty for a further period of twelve months, during which the Government propose to review the whole question. There is &#163;186,000 of the amount appropriated still unexpended. It is anticipated that claims amounting to about &#163;400,000 will shortly be received in connexion with production since the 17th June. If Parliament agrees to extend the operation of the bounty under this Bill for another twelve months it is the intention of the Government to have the whole situation in connexion with this bounty and the allied questions affecting the shale oil industry thoroughly reviewed. I therefore ask the Senate to agree to pass this Bill through all its stages to-night, in order that we may be able to pay the bounty, and, as I have said, Parliament will later be given an opportunity to review the whole question. </para>

                            <para>-  I rise to a point of order. I am very sorry that it may seriously interfere with the passing of the measure under consideration, but, to my mind, correct procedure is of the greatest importance. If you, sir, rule that my point of order cannot be sustained, I shall be perfectly satisfied to allow the Bill to pass quickly. My point of order, briefly stated, is this : &#34;We have by deliberate resolution suspended so much of the Standing Orders as would prevent the passing of the Customs Tariff Bill through all its stages without delay. There is now interposed another Bill, and this, to my mind, is directly in opposition to the resolution of the Senate. The consideration of this Bill will delay the passage of the Tariff Bill. The Senate has suspended the Standing Orders for a certain purpose. They are suspended for that purpose, and until that purpose is effected I claim that the Government have no right to intervene with other business. </para>

                        <para>-  The point raised is a very simple one, and does not require any argument to dispose of it. It is true that the Standing Orders were suspended to enable the Customs Tariff Bill to be passed through all its stages without delay. The Customs Tariff Bill is not now before the Senate. It  is  only while that Bill is before the Senate that the Standing Orders are suspended. They are not now suspended, and the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is, therefore, quite in order. </para>

                        <para>. - I have no desire to delay the passing of this measure. Its purpose is merely to extend the operation of  a  measure to which the Senate agreed. But this Bill lacks one principle which, I think, should be embodied in all Bounty Bills. When we propose to assist the development of the oil resources of the Commonwealth by putting the people&#39;s money into the business, we should see that the people are given an interest in the business proportionate to the money, they are asked to invest in it. For every &#163;1 of the people&#39;s money put into a private concern, the public should be given a proportionate interest. If in the course of a year we pay bounty to the extent of &#163;50,000 on the production of oil, at the end of the year the books of the company to whom the bounty is paid should show that the people of Australia are entitled to a &#163;50,000 share in the business. When the people&#39;s money is invested in a private business, the people should get a return for their investment when that business reaches the profit-making stage. I realize that the Government are anxious to get this measure through, quickly, and there is not time to submit the arguments which I could use in support of my view. I had no desire, however, that the Bill should be allowed to pass without mentioning this matter lest it might subsequently be suggested that I had neglected an opportunity to assert this principle. We would not invest our own money in any private concern without securing an interest in it, and we should be even more careful in this regard when we are dealing with the people&#39;s money. In every Bounty Act passed there should be a provision that when the business assisted by the bounty reached the profit-paying stage the public investment in the business, as well as the private investment, should share in the profits. As I know that the Government are anxious to have this Bill passed without delay, I shall not debate the matter further. </para>

                    <para>. - I strongly support the request which has been moved by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> We recently agreed to a duty of 50 per cent, on sulphur with the object of protecting a by-product of the electrolytic zinc industry which has been established in this country. If a market were not created for that by-product it would be wasted, and it would be practically impossible to carry on the electrolytic zinc process here. Having gone so far, we must take a further step and develop a means whereby sulphur can be used with phosphatic rock in the production of superphosphates here. The Commonwealth has spent something like &#163;1,500,000 on acquiring interests in Nauru and Ocean Islands for the purpose of developing the superphosphate industry here; but if the request is negatived, or even if the amendment which has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain</inline> is carried, Japanese superphosphates will be brought in and render that impossible. At the time that we acquired Nauru the Japanese secured a mandate over the Caroline , Islands, where there are also vast phosphate deposits, so that the Japanese are in a much better position than they were in before the war to compete with the superphosphate industry of Australia. They have immense deposits of sulphur, and by means of their cheap labour could but for our Protective duties place superphosphate on the market at a price that would render it impossible for the local industry to carry on. In that event we should get no return for the money that we have expended on Nauru and Ocean Islands. In addition to these considerations, we must have regard to the development of the production of sulphuric acid, which is the basis of the chemical processes of importance in almost every stage of manufacture. A supply of superphosphate is essential. We ought not to be compelled to depend for it on outside sources of which we might be deprived at any moment, either by a direct war with the people who produce it, or by a war with some other nation which would cut us off from our supplies. The last  war  enabled our superphosphate manufacturers to get a good start, and it would be suicidal now to allow the Japanese product to come in and destroy the industry. </para>

                        <para>- I would point out that every .thousand tons of superphosphate that is imported - directly deprives fifty men of employment, and indirectly throws twenty men out of work. If the imported article captured the market, the &#163;600,000 invested in the industry have to lie idle. I do not know what is the annual consumption of superphosphates in Australia, but the figures I have given will convey to the Committee some idea of the number of people who are dependent upon the industry for a livelihood. The Australian manufacturers of superphosphates stood manfully behind the farmer during the war. They had a monopoly of the trade, and could have obtained high prices had they desired to do so. </para>

                        <para>- If we increase the cost of superphosphates we shall make it utterly impossible for a large number of farmers working on the light soils throughout the Commonwealth to make wheat-growing pay. I speak with accurate knowledge of the lighter soils in my own State; I know how important it is to use superphosphates in order to make them productive. Experts everywhere are demanding more liberal application of superphosphates to our poorer soils, in order to insure larger yields. Dearer superphosphate will mean ruin to a very large number of farmers in Western Australia, South Australia, and New South Wales. They are all practically in the same position. I have paired with another honorable senator in the division upon this item, and as my name will not appear in the division list. I take this opportunity to speak against the proposed increased duties. </para>

                    <para>. - Before the item is disposed of, I think it would be as well if the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> placed some information before honorable senators as to the profits from Nauru Island for the last twelve months. This Government have invested &#163;1,480,000 in that venture. I do not know how much they are paying to salaried officials there, but I believe their overhead charges average something like 42 or 45 per cent. Any one who has a knowledge of the business knows -that, no matter what happens, there is never going to be cheap phosphate from that island. Apparently, this proposal to impose a duty of -25 per cent., while it may have the effect of making superphosphate dearer, will, perhaps, enable the Government to show some profit on the island proposition. The Government bought their ships out of the farmers&#39; produce, and now they are going to do the same with regard to Nauru, the acquisition of which I regard as the biggest blunder ever committed by a blundering Government. The overhead charges are enormous, and the proposed increased duties are merely an effort to make the farmer pay more for his superphosphate. </para>

                        <para>- It is absurd for the Minister to say that, in the face of the overhead charges on a capital expenditure of about &#163;3,000,000, of which amount this Government is responsible for &#163;1,480,000. Every one knows that the cost of phosphatic rock is the cost of the labour employed in getting it out, just as with quarried metal. In the case of Nauru Island, the labour costs will be as great as in any other country, and, in addition, there are the overhead charges on the capital cost, as well as the salaries of highly paid officials. Now we are asked to agree to a duty in the general Tariff of 25 per cent., which will probably give the Government enough revenue to cover up their tracks. . I want to voice my protest against this additional burden upon our primary industries, which again have to take second place to our secondary industries. All through this Tariff the primary producers have &#39;had no consideration, and this is the last attempt to handicap them. </para>

                    <para>. - Very briefly I wish to indorse the remarks of honorable senators who have already spoken in opposition to the Government proposal, which is one more blow at the primary producer. We were&#39; told by interjection a few minutes ago that our wheat farmers have done very well in recent years, notwithstanding the increased cost of superphosphate. They did well last year, because they had a record crop and record prices, but the average price for wheat in Australia for the last eighteen years is 4s. 2d., and in the ordinary course of events it is likely to come down, if not tq that level, at least to under 5s., whilst the cost of production is continually increasing. The position has not been improved by this Tariff, which imposes increased duties on machinery, fencing wire, and ever blessed thing the farmers require, and now there are proposed increases in the duties on super.phosohate, which is essential for successful production. The average quantity of phosphate used is, I think, about 1 cwt. per acre. </para>

                        <para>- Well, that is pretty close to my estimate of 1 cwt. It is important that we should encourage our people to go on the land, not off it; and at the risk of wearying honorable senators I must repeat some official figure? which have an important bearing upon this subject. In .1915-16 the area under cultivation was 18,528.234 acres, and in 1920 13,332,393 acres. These figures evidence a serious retrograde step, which it is important to check if possible. </para>

                        <para>- They were not away from Australia in 1920, and I shall give the figures for that year. They are entirely against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior.</inline> He has made a boomerang which will rebound and hit him. in the neck ; because, whereas in 1915-16, when the men were away at the war. the area under wheat was 12,000,000 acres - and it would have been greater, according to the honorable senator, if the men had been here - in 1919-20, when the men were back it was only 6,000,000 acres. Yet we hear the cry, *&#34; Open up the lands and settle people on them. Put returned soldiers out-back in the Mallee, and down &#34;in the south-east of South Australia, or up in the north of the continent.&#34; At the same time, we increase the price of his fencing wire and his plough, and now on top of that rack him with, a higher price for the superphosphates which are so essential for his farming operations to-day. Graziers have also learned that the scientific use of superphosphates improves the carrying capacity of grass lands. For years in Denmark and other countries, superphosphates have been applied to grazing lands, and it has been demonstrated <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> Victoria, according to a pamphlet issued by the State Agricultural Department, that a top dressing of superphosphates has considerably increased the production of milk, butter, and cheese per acre. Provided the price of superphosphates is not too high, they can be used with considerable advantage, particularly on our poorer lands near the coast, and even in the Wimmera, Mallee, and Riverina districts. Although I have given a pair to a. Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> whom we all regret is unwell, I could not allow this proposal to increase the burden of the primary producers of Australia to pass without my strong protest. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, it was inevitable, because if we did not now place a restriction upon the importation of the manufactured article, the protected sulphur would come in in the prepared state as superphosphates. What would be the good of encouraging the production of sulphur in Australia if we allowed it to come in in a manufactured article free of duty <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Surely every honorable senator foresaw that the inevitable corollary of placing a duty on raw sulphur would be a duty against the importation of manufactured sulphur. If we want to establish an industry, in Australia to provide farmers with the superphosphates which are so necessary nowadays, we must protect it against the cheaper product of the outside world. Some honorable senators cannot understand that an impost upon the importation of some foreign substance does not necessarily mean an impost on the people in Australia who use the article. We have had two demonstrations of this. When we were discussing the duty on arsenate of lead, it was shown that by building up the industry in Australia the locally-produced article was being sold at a price which was cheaper than that of the imported article, and that its quality was equal to that of the imported commodity. Again, in the -case of sewing machines, it was shown that through our neglecting the &#39; opportunity to establish this industry in Australia, the users of these machines are paying 300 and 400 per cent, more than they are worth. As a matter of fact, although for the time being we may impose a penalty on the user of an article by restricting its importation and creating the local manufacture of it, we are ultimately doing him a good turn. I would be prepared to face farmers anywhere and tell them that honorable senators who vote to restrict the importation of superphosphates, thereby creating an industry in Australia which will give a reliable and continuous supply within this country, are their very best friends. </para>

                        <para>- If they were of the honorable senator&#39;s intellectual temperament, probably they would; but I think they are too amenable to reason to laugh at such a palpable truth. Notwithstanding all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> Has said, and all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> will say, I claim that I am just as much a friend of the farmer as either honorable senator is. If we do not protect this industry we shall ruin it, and the farmer, who will then be dependent upon importations, will be in a very much worse position than he can possibly be in if the request put forward by the Minister is agreed to. </para>

                    <para>. - All the arguments which I advanced at an earlier stage with respect to superphosphates still hold good. When this Committee expressed itself in favour of a duty upon sulphur, approximating 50 per cent., it was obvious to all who take an interest in the matter that the manufacturer of superphosphates would pass on his added costs to the man on the land. The Government went before the electors nearly two years ago with the cry, &#34; Produce, produce, produce &#34; ; but they have turned round since and put all the burdens upon the producer. A fey? days ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> stated that almost&#39; the whole of the sulphur used in Australia was locally produced. Between 40,000 and 50,000 tons of sulphur is imported annually by the superphosphate manufacturers. In 1914 farmers were paying &#163;4 2s. 6d. per ton for their fertilizers. To-day, the price is &#163;6. I have been informed that the quantity of superphosphate used per acre is about 1 cwt. To-day his fertilizers cost the farmer about 6s. an acre. What will be the effect of the proposed duty? </para>

                        <para>- Only a day or two ago I read, in this chamber, a statement from the  chairman  of a South Australian superphosphate company which indicated that the duties imposed upon imported sulphur would represent an addition of 5s. per ton to the price of superphosphate. That / is how the manufacturers will be passing on the impost, of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 10s. on sulphur. The Government have entered into business-like arrangements for the sale of the product of Nauru Island. Everything, including finance and provision of shipping, has been thought out in the interests of the manufacturer. Why did not the Government include in their arrangements a provision fixing the cost of superphosphate to the producer? The whole difficult question might have been settled once and for all. Now, however, it is Up to &#34; the Senate - seeing that another place has refused to take the responsibility - to fix the price of the farmers&#39; fertilizers. Why should this Committee be saddled with the delicate responsibility? The farmer is not looking for sympathy, but he has a claim for fair play. I plead with the Committee to fulfil that claim. </para>

                    <para>.- There has been a marked inclination on the part of the Committee to sympathetically regard the welfare of the primary producer. Compared with the treatment accorded in another place to farming interests, the man on the land has been most generously considered by honorable senators. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie concerning the great benefits of employing fertilizers. The honorable senator referred to certain soils which would not have been producing anything to-day but for the judicious application of superphosphates. It was the vital importance of superphosphates to the primary producers which induced the Government to secure some control over the island of Nauru, so that we would be independent of any foreign Power, and assured of a supply of this commodity. The Government are to be congratulated on what they did, and honorable senators who are friends of the farmers should remember that if superphosphates were admitted free from Japan and such countries where they are manufactured by cheap labour it would be impossible to carry on their production in this country on a commercial basis. What would be the position of the farmers if they could not depend on a local supply? The whole object of the Government has been to protect the primary producers, and that is the &#39;intention of the request which has been submitted by the Minister. </para>

                    <para>. - If the proposals of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> in his -policy speech at Bendigo were compared with  the present action of the Government, it would be a puzzle to find out what sympathy or consideration is being shown to the primary producers. I have failed to discover a vestige of it. We were told, in the first place, that an interest had been acquired in Nauru as the result of bargaining, and that the island was to be under the triple control of Great Britain, New Zealand, and the Commonwealth. We were told that the island was a valuable possession, and that, as a result of the interests which the Commonwealth had acquired, the farmers of this country would be able to obtain a cheap and plentiful supply of superphosphates. What is happening now? In what way is the product of this island being handled and turned to account? Was not Australia&#39;s interest in Nauru given as a prize to the Prime Minister? As a result of our interest in Nauru, superphosphates will now be dearer. </para>

                        <para>- We know the slim and wily way in which argument can be conducted, and that is how the matter is being handled at the Ministerial table. We were told that the raw material which comes from Nauru and Ocean Islands would be available at a lower rate, and the farmers are now justified in asking what has become of the promise of the Government. It is up to the Government to &#34; deliver the goods.&#34; If there is to be any increase in the price of artificial manures, many of the farmers will have to leave their holdings. </para>

                        <para>- Why was there not a greater increase such as there was in New Zealand ? What is the reason ? If the Minister does not know, I shall tell him. It was because some manufacturers came to the Government, and made arrangements whereby the raw material was to be taken at the Government expense - which means the expense of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth - to the factories where it was to be treated. Notwithstanding this, the Minister is endeavouring to give credit to the manufacturers; but thanks should be tendered to the general taxpayers, who have had to shoulder the burden. </para>

These vessels were flung in the way to assist the manufacturers, who now have the audacity to say that they did not increase their prices. If they did not, it was because the raw material was brought to them below cost price. My statement rests on the fact that raw material was brought down at a lower figure than other ship-owners would carry it. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; he mentioned a different figure. The price of superphosphate is going up to the extent of the protection that is now being afforded. Twenty-five per cent, to-day is equal to 30s. a ton, which means 2s. 6d. a bag. A bag contains 180 lbs., and as it takes, even on rich soil, 60 lbs. per acre, one-third of a bag at 2s. 6d. would be 10d., and that is what the price will increase per acre. I am giving away too much. Here is a proposal to add virtually ls. per acre to the cost of cultivating wheat lands. Would the Government dare to bring down a land tax of ls. per acre? </para>

                        <para>- They do, but not to the same extent as wheat-growers. Superphosphate is essentially a wheat land fertilizer. It is the four wheat producing States that are most concerned in this matter. I return to my figures, and I say that this impost is in the neighbourhood of from10d. to ls. per acre; and I again ask whether the Government would have the hardihood to come down with a proposal for a land tax of ls. per acre on top of the taxation already existing. If they did, they would be kicked from the Treasury bench quick and lively by the primary producers of this country, and rightly so. How many forms of duty is the wheat grower called upon already to bear under this Tariff? This is the last straw to press him into the earth, and I say it is not a fair thing. What is the other side of the picture? Is there any warrant for the proposed duty? Here are two companies established in this country without a duty. </para>

                        <para>- That only makes my argument stronger. I am concerned chiefly with two companies that bulk more largely than any others, whose industries were established without a penny piece of protection. I know that in 1908 those interested in these companies came with the same story, looking for a duty. I do not blame them when they know the Government&#39;s chaotic policy for preventing progress by the imposition of outrageous and unasked-for duties; but I say- that their industries were established without protection. I commend the enterprise and skilful management that enabled that to be done. But it was done without a penny piece of protection against even Japanese imports. These industries are thriving to-day, and apparently are paying a handsome return on the capital invested in them. is it a fair thing that we should give these companies an increased duty? I know that they would not ask for it if it were not that a duty was passed the other day in the interests of those producing sulphur in Tasmania. But was the Tasmanian company established for the purpose of extracting or manufacturing sulphur? Of course, we know it was not, and we know, also, that the farmers must pay this taxation. As Bacon said, &#34; You cannot contend coldly for what you believe earnestly,&#34; and I am quite at a loss to account for the action of the Government in this matter. They agreed, in the first place, to a duty ; then they decided that there should be no duty; and now they ask the Committee to start the ball rolling and to impose this tax on the primary producer. Will he regard the Senate in a friendly light if this proposal is agreed to? He will be possessed of a higher nature than the average of human beings if he does so.. On the contrary, he will regard the Senate, as an institution designed specially to impose a load of constant taxation on him. All the rhetoric of honorable senators to the contrary, this means a tax on primary production. I want to. know why it should be proposed. I have heard all the talk indulged in about motor cars, and so on. But though you may see one farmer using a motor ear, you will see 100 using a rickety old spring cart or sulky. Bacon said that a man always marks a hit, and never a miss, and in the same way, in connexion with Tattersalls sweeps, we hear of the man who wins, but we hear nothing of the scores of thousands who lose. In common with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain,</inline> I make an appeal on behalf of the men who have been driven on to the drier and lighter soils of Australia. By virtue of their native industry and physical powers, they are making those lighter and dryer soils productive, and to pile on extra taxation upon those men is selfish, unreasonable, and unpatriotic in the extreme. Honorable senators have not the slightest consideration for the men who are so situated. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish, briefly, to complete the remarks I desired to make. Although it may not be considered right to contribute personal experience, there can be no doubt that that is the most valuable that could be submitted, and in this matter I can give my own experience for the last twelve years in wheat farming. Personal experience is the best schoolmaster, and hearsay counts for nothing against it. It has been stated, on the best authority in the Western Australian Legislative Council, that there are 600 idle farms in Western Australia. They were taken up some years ago, and for various reasons those who took them up walked off them and went back, into the labour market. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Wittenoom called for a return on the subject, and the figures I have given .were supplied. There are hundreds of farms that have fallen into the hands of the Agricultural Bank where the saplings to-day are growing as high as the roof of this chamber. Perhaps it is not altogether seemly to draw on one&#39;s own personal experiences, but I propose to put my experience of farming before the Committee. In twelve years I have had four failures. I have experienced two droughts, during which I did not get as much wheat off my land as could be picked up with a pen. We had a drought in 1911 and again in 1914, and for two seasons we had too much rain, and did not obtain a return sufficient to cover expenses. We obtained &#163;84 worth of wheat from 600 acres. As a result of the drought of 1914, which swept over the whole continent, we had to pay &#163;1 a bag for wheat which we had sold for 9s. 6d. a bag the year before, and &#163;14 a ton for chaff which we had sold for &#163;3 10s. a ton. That was the experience of hundreds of men on the land. And yet we have here a proposal to tax them to the extent of 1s. an acre - a tax which in reality will amount to nearly 2s. per acre in the case of farmers in the western State. Honorable senators representing the eastern States are prepared to vote for this impost. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton,</inline> for instance, is ready to do so. He is a representative of Victoria, a developed State, I am glad to say, and one having large areas of good land. I invite him, however, to look at this question from a continental point of view and to have regard to the unfortunate position of thousands of farmers in other parts of the Commonwealth whose experiences have been positively appalling. They are his fellow Australians, although they do not live in Victoria, and he should have regard to their interests. My experience satisfies me that there is not a morsel of warrant for what the Government are now proposing. If they place this impost on the farmers of Australia, the farmers - and particularly those who are trying to scratch a living out of the light dry soils - will not look with a friendly eye upon them. I know what I am speaking about, and I do not hesitate to say that even farmers in the most superior positions, men who have acquired cheap and good land along the Midland Company&#39;s lines in Western Australia - capable men, drawn from the mines and the artisans&#39; stops, including many from the eastern States - are in a bad way today. I do not like to tell this doleful tale, but it is absolutely true. I grant that there are some farmers settled on good land in favorable situations who are doing well. They are of the second generation, and there are some who managed to get cheap land in good situations who will, so to speak, &#34;keep ahead of it.&#34; But they could not do so unless they were prepared to disregard clocks and. watches, and as soon as&#39; they recover from their bodily tiredness make a fresh attack every morning of their lives. It is on behalf of such men that I make this plea. If the Committee carries this request it will do so with the most callous indifference to the interests of thousands of poor struggling wretches. The Senate is supposed to guard the interests of all sections of the community, but it will deal treacherously with the interests of thousands of poor farmers if it carries this request. Every honorable senator who votes for this increased burden of Is. an acre upon the poor fellows of whom I have spoken will fail in the discharge of his public duty. I am against this request. I . have voted over and over again for Protective duties, but I am taking up this stand to-night on behalf of a most deserving class. If there were any warrant for the increased duty I should not object, but it is proposed in the interests of companies that are doing well. Notwithstanding the foolish step taken by us the other day in imposing a duty on sulphur, I believe they can still do well. If they cannot, then let us retrace our steps and give them free sulphur. Let the big mining company in Tasmania do what it told the world it would do - extract copper on a more scientific basis than before. Let the &#34;cobbler stick to his last.&#34; Let this company stick to what it set out to do, and not call upon late and early workers to pay for their by-product. Do not let it call upon the poor wretches out-back to pull it through. I invite honorable senators to show me a statement in the prospectus of that company that its object was to produce sulphur. It was distinctly set out in its prospectus that it proposed to carry on the electrolytic process of producing copper, but it now asks the farmers in the back country to come forward and help it to make ends meet. I appeal to honorable senators&#39; sense of fair play and equity; I appeal to them to exercise their common sense and to reject the request. </para>

A lengthy debate ensued, and as it promised to become more lengthy, the Minister in charge <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> on my suggestion, gave an undertaking that honorable senators would be afforded an opportunity, before the schedule left the Senate, of dealing with the whole question of these departmental by-laws, as to the manner in which they were framed and promulgated. A considerable amount of discussion was, therefore, abridged. I hope that promise stands good, and that the Minister will be able to inform the Committee when that discussion may be expected to take place. I understand there is a very general feeling that the remainder of the schedule shall be dealt with by the Committee now. I believe that even motions for recommittal are to be considered during the present sitting. I am not quite sure whether we shall have an opportunity to discuss these departmental by-laws on the third reading, when the Bill comes back from another place after consideration has been given to the requests from this Committee. I rose to draw attention to the Ministerial promise which resulted in the termination of the debate on that occasion. I hope the Minister will take this opportunity of affirming it and indicating to the Committee when the debate may most conveniently take place. </para>

There is an opportunity now, but I do not think any honorable senator would care to inflict a long debate on this suffering Committee. I do not know of any other opportunity than is afforded by the ordinary procedure. Honorable senators may give notice of motion, discuss the matter on a Supply Bill, on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate, or move a special adjournment. These are the only opportunities, other than raising the question on this Bill, and I ask honorable senators not to do that. I can give the Committee an assurance that the Minister intends to take the matter into consideration. Whatever representations have been made during the course of the debate will be considered, and due weight giver to them. </para>

I do not complain about the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> not carrying out <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell&#39;s</inline> assurance, which was given in order to prevent the discussion of this matter at an earlier stage.

I was dealing with some small minor articles imported for the purpose of making homemade sprinklers, sprayers, and similar appliances. If the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will assure me that the matter will be investigated by the Department of Trade and Customs on its merits, and that fair play will be given, I shall be satisfied to let the item go without further comment. </para>

Why should exorbitant rates, ranging from 30 to 50 per cent., be imposed, for example, upon dental alloys,  amalgams,  and gold fillings, and upon amputating, cupping, dissecting, examining, operating, and veterinary instruments? Even under the preferential Tariff the rates are as high, in some instances, as 40 per cent. A new surgical instrument may be invented, and it may be deemed to be of great value to the Australian medical profession. But it cannot be availed of in this country because of prohibitive duties,. and it may not be manufactured locally because of patent rights. Why should such appliances be shut out? </para>

                    <para>- I have referred to sub-item  g  of item 136, and find that it relates to high-grade carbon steel and alloy steels containing manganese. Item 422 relates to thermit and other welding compounds, and tha point of order raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> cannot therefore be sustained. Whilst I am going to admit the motion for a request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior,</inline> I must say that I am in doubt as to its relevancy, but  as  I am loath to restrict the privileges of honorable senators, I shall give the honorable senator the benefit of the doubt. I have not sufficient scientific knowledge to determine whether manganese ore can be regarded as a welding compound; but if the officers of the Department consider that this is the proper place to submit such a request, I shall not reject it on the ground of irrelevancy. </para>

                        <para>- I have said that manganese ore is an alloy of both iron and steel. When used in the manufacture of steel it must not contain more than 8 per cent, of silica, and only a trace of phosphorus. I mention this because the ore of which I speak is remarkably free from both these elements. When used for chemical purposes, manganese ore must be of the highest grade, and it is used for the manufacture of chlorine, dry cells, flint glass, for generating oxygen, for &#39;disinfectants, as a dryer for paints and varnishes, and in dyes. It is used as a colouring agent in paints, as umber when mixed with iron oxide, and as a colouring agent in glass and pottery. The world&#39;s demand for manganese ore for dry cells is about 20,000 tons. So that it will be seen that while there is great use for this article in Australia, there is a probability of its being exported. The principal countries from which we import it - for we are importing it - are Java and New Caledonia. In 1918-19, 1,402 tons, valued at &#163;7,050, were imported from Java; and 1,713 tons, valued at &#163;7,056, were imported from New Caledonia. Honorable senators will note that in Java coloured labour is employed in the mining of manganese ore, and in New Caledonia convict labour is employed. There is manganese ore found in some of the other States, but, speaking for South Australia, our source for its supply is Woocalla, which is about 70 miles by rail from Port Augusta, and the mine is about S miles from a station. The South Australian Inspector of Mines estimates that at Woocalla there are 200,000 tons of the ore in sight. In the course of seven weeks&#39; inspection, he took about 70 samples, of which 500distinct assays were made. The average of these assays showed 85 per cent, manganese dioxide, which would be the manganese available for chemical purposes, and 52 per cent, of metallic manganese. The present output is about 120 tons per month, but it could easily be quadrupled. The wages paid represent fully 40 per cent, of the price realized for the article. Railage, sea-freight, cost of unloading and loading represent an additional 10 per cent. I want to give honorable senators some idea of the cost of this ore from the field in India, which has the greatest output of the article, to England. I find that the cost of mining runs from 2s. 9d. to os. 6d. per ton, with an average of 4s. 1&#189;d. Including rail and sea freights, the charges would be about &#163;2 3s. 6d. per ton from the place where the article is mined to where it can be used. Honorable senators will see from this that we are up against a difficult position unless we do something to protect ourselves. I have said that about 200,000 tons* of the ore is in sight at Woocalla, and that it is of very high quality. The duties I propose are by no means excessive. In the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of Wednesday last honorable senators may have noticed a paragraph referring to the new American Tariff, from which I find that the duty imposed in America on manganese ore is. 1 cent, per 1 lb., which amounts to &#163;4 13s. 4d. per ton. If America recognises the necessity of a Protective duty on this article, the necessity is still greater in Australia. Honorable senators are aware that the mining industry in Australia is not at present in a satisfactory condition. Many miners are out of employment, and the development of deposits of manganese would give increased employment to miners, and extra traffic on railways and for our own shipping. It would lead to the employment of men in handling and smelting, and would involve considerable expenditure in Australia for the benefit of this country. </para>

                    <para>. - I am glad that the Minister has submitted this request. I presume that these, like all other deferred duties, will be subject to clause 11, and if satisfactory provision has not been made for the construction of ships in Australia on the date named, the duties will be further deferred. I understand that some of the shipping companies are rather concerned as to their operation. They do not .consider that the shipbuilding industry in Australia has sufficiently advanced to warrant the placing of orders with shipbuilders here, and they think that this provision may considerably restrict their operations. I am sure there is no likelihood of any trouble in that direction, and that if on the date named it is found impossible to have ships built in Australia at a reasonable price, the Government under the powers vested in- them by clause 11 of the Bill will further defer these duties. </para>

                    <para>. - The importance of the request moved by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> is apparent to any one who looks at the map of Australia and so has vividly brought before him the extent to which we depend upon our coastal traffic. We have no big river systems to open up the interior, and it is necessary for us to see that there is not at any time a shortage of transport facilities. The Minister proposes to extend to 1st January, 1924, the coming into operation of these deferred duties. I do not know that very much can be accomplished by the industry within that time, and I should like the date to be extended to 1st January, 1925. The position would be improved if the Minister would give us -an undertaking as to what will be regarded as the &#34;production in reasonable quantities &#34; of the ships required here. It has been said that if the shipbuilding industry were not in a position on the date named to supply 60 per cent, of the normal requirements of the Commonwealth these duties would be further deferred. If the Minister would give us an undertaking to that effect we should have an ample guarantee that no shortage of shipping would occur. It does not appear that we are likely to be able within the time mentioned to satisfy our own requirements in this very important regard. The plates used in ship construction have to be obtained from the Old Country. I believe it is possible that they may be rolled at the Broken Hill- Proprietary Company&#39;s Newcastle Works, but in the meantime we shall be very much at the mercy of circumstances for. transport facilities generally if we impose these duties upon the shipping trade of Australia. A tax of 25 per cent., or one-fourth of the value of a ship, is very heavy, and will be reflected in the freights and fares which will have to be paid. If there is any country where transport facilities should be cheap and readily available, it is Australia, whose interior is not opened up by vast river systems such as have done so much for the opening up of the American continent. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. The Tariff Board will be able to review the situation, and if the shipbuilding industry is sufficiently advanced, will recommend that these deferred duties be brought into operation on the date named. Everything depends, however, upon the construction that is placed on the words &#34; reasonable quantities &#34; used in clause 11. We must have adequate shipping facilities to assist us in opening up this country, which for all time must depend very largely upon sea-borne traffic. </para>

We shall know what the Tariff Board is doing, and the responsible Minister must have regard to the will of Parliament. . A Minister who, on the advice of the Tariff - Board, took such action as would lead to a shortage of shipping, would endanger, not only his own position, but that of his Government. The restraining influence of the Parliament will always be a check on the Ministry. This period may be extended, but cannot be shortened without the approval of Parliament, so that I think the Committee might very well agree to the request. </para>

                    <para>. - There appears to be a misconception of the functions of the Tariff Board in relation to deferred duties. If it does nothing at all with respect to these deferred duties, they will automatically come into operation on the date specified. Under clause 11, the Tariff Board may certify to the Minister, in a case such as this, that the goods mentioned in th, schedule - that is to say, the ships upon which these deferred duties are imposed - will not be constructed in Australia in reasonable quantities and of satisfactory quality, on or immediately after 1st January, 1924. But if the board does nothing at all the deferred duties will operate from the date expressed.&#39; Neither can the Tariff Board bring the duties into operation before the date mentioned in the schedule. </para>

                <para class="block">That proposal was limited to the construction of ships not exceeding 500 tons; gross register.- Obviously, the Government recognised at the time that it was&#62; within the bounds of Practicability to build ships up to that tonnage here. They proposed an immediately operative duty upon all such vessels, but, later, in another place, the wording of the sub-item was altered by striking out &#34; not exceeding 500 tons gross register,&#34; so that the Committee is now asked to consider a proposal to levy, on and after 1st January, 1923, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties on vessels n.e.i., irrespective of tonnage - they may be 500, 5,000, 11,000, or 12,000 tons register - trading Intra-State or Interstate, or otherwise employed in Australian waters for any continuous period of three months. It is, of course, within the knowledge of all honorable senators that we have yet no yards capable of maintaining the shipping of the various companies trading round our coast. A recent decision of the High Court has established&#39; the validity of the Navigation Act, so far as it relates to vessels employed in the Australian Inter-State trade, so that vessels coming from, overseas cannot, unless they comply with Australian conditions, engage in this trade. This will impose an increased demand upon Australian vessels. These shipping companies have to keep themselves well up to date, and in their ship-building programme- have to contemplate their activities for several years ahead. Some of them have already ordered vessels which. are in course of construction, and apart from vessels on order, they have to keep in mind the programme for vessels to follow. Some probably will be sister ships of existing vessels or of vessels now on order. The completion of this programme, and the arrangements to meet the altered conditions that will result from the operation of this Tariff,1 is not the matter or a year or two. Most of the shipping companies have their regular builders on the Clyde,.  the Tyne, or in- Belfast, or elsewhere. These people know the class of trade in which the various companies here are engaged, and, no doubt, honorable senators who have been through those yards, and have seen the drawings and plans of vessels, remembered seeing those very ships in the Australian trade twenty, thirty, or forty years ago. These plans are carefully preserved by the regular builders for certain companies here which consult with them as to their future requirements. A connexion like this cannot be broken in a year or two. For that reason I urged, by way of interjection, that the Minister might have extended the period for the operation of these <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties to 1925, instead of 1924, and I think he would meet the wishes of the Committee if he compromised, and said 1925. </para>

                <para class="block">The local manufacturer of perfumery containing alcohol will be in a distinctly anomalous position if this amendment is not made, because, partly owing to the way in which during recent years the Excise duty upon the spirit used by him has been increased, imported perfumery will come in at a rate of duty which is actually lower than the Excise and other duty he is paying. I have the whole case set out in detail, but as it would take me a considerable time to state it, I ask the Minister if it is not a fact that the Department of Trade and Customs recognises this anomaly, and is willing- to have the amendment made. The effect would be that the local manufacturer of perfumery would pay Excise duty, say, 40s. a gallon, upon the spirit he uses, and the importer would also pay an import duty of 40s. per gallon upon the spirit in his perfumery. Both would thus start level in regard to the fixed rates of Excise and Customs duty paid by each, and then the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate would apply to the imported article, and afford the local manufacturer a margin of protection to the extent of that rate. </para>

                    <para>.- The request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> is a perfectly fair one, and without it the duty set out in the schedule would be a mockery and a sham. We should on the one hand be giving the local manufacturer of perfumery a protection upon his output, and on the other hand taking it away by making him pay Excise duty on his spirit. In order, therefore, to afford him sufficient protection, it will be necessary to do as the honorable senator suggests, and give the local maker of perfumery the benefit of the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates on top of the fixed rate, which practically coincides with the Excise duty he pays. </para>

                    <para>.- From 1908 to 1911 the Excise duty on industrial spirit, 60 per cent, overproof, was 20s. 6d. per gallon; in 1914 it was 26s. 5d. per gallon. On 25th March, 1920, the duty was raised to 41s. 3d. per gallon, and, on 17th September,  1920, to 46s. 4d. per gallon, which has since been reduced to 42s. At that figure the Excise now remains. If manufacturers are called upon to pay Excise duty it is only fair that importers should also pay proportionately in respect of the spirit contained in their importations. </para>

                    <para>. - This subject-matter was investigated very thoroughly by the Customs Department. I am asking the Committee to seek to impose a duty not of more than 100 per cent., but of only 25 per cent., in circumstances where imported&#39; spirits and Excise spirits are placed upon the same level. If the Committee held that all spirit used for industrial purposes should bo free, and should pay no Excise, I would not ask that the imported spirit should be penalized. But if our manufacturers are to pay a very heavy industrial impost, it is only fair that importers should pay. the same. </para>

                    <para>. - This item was postponed to consider whether scrap-iron should be dutiable; and after making a thorough inquiry we found that instead of imposing an import duty representations have been made for the imposition of an export duty. It would be very inconsistent to have an export and an import duty, too, and as all the evidence seems to point in the direction of keeping this item free in the interests of our manufacturing industries, I ask the Committee to pass the item. In connexion with some industries, something may be said in favour of import duties, but the great bulk of the evidence from a large number of manufacturers is in favour of keeping this item free. </para>

                    <para>. - It is going a long way too far to search out a lot of petty items covering articles in, general use in other industries, and propose the imposition of duties upon them under these conditions. The Minister is most unreasonable, and the honorable senator moving the request is also unreasonable. This is going through the Tariff with a microscope to find out something to occupy the time of the Committee. Every user of an engine requires engine-cleaning waste. Its production cannot be described as a valuable manufacture in any sense of the word. The duty will only tend to build up an unimportant industry by adding to the expense of all who have engines to clean. </para>

                <para>I ask for these duties on collar check for the reason that factories for its manufacture have been established in Australia, and are manufacturing a material equal to any that is imported. I am assured that they are able to supply the requirements of Australia, and since the industry is using low-grade crossbred wools, which we do not know what to with at present, it ought to be encouraged. It has been in operation for some months, and already has a big output., I do not wish to weary honorable senators by reading letters I have received from firms engaged in the retail trade, but I may say that they are to the effect that the locally- made article is equal to the imported, that there is a big demand for it, and that if our requirements are made here instead of being imported, something like 1,500 or 1,600 bales of low-grade crossbred wool will be used every year by the industry. </para>

                <para class="block">My object is to insure that textile fabrics not manufactured in Australia shall be admitted at a reasonable rate of duty, because they are essential as an article of apparel for women and children. I refer particularly to such material as black cashmere, black lustre, nuns veiling, voiles, hopsacks, self-coloured dress fabrics, and light materials of that character for women&#39;s and children&#39;s wear, which are not manufactured here. If the adoption of this request would be detrimental to the Australian woollen industry I would not expect honorable senators to support it; but this class of goods is manufactured chiefly in Great Britain and France, and it is much in demand in Australia as an article of attire. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the general rate should exceed  30  per cent., because three-fourths of the classes of materials covered by my proposed new sub-item are manufactured in France, which country has, for years, gone in for the manufacture of highly-finished light textile materials. I have taken the trouble to interview men who are able to give me advice on this matter. After consultation with many of them, I have come to the conclusion that the Australian industry need not fear any competition from the goods specified in the proposed sub-item, because of the words which limit the weight to material not exceeding  6  ozs. per square yard. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> having been good enough to intimate some time ago&#39; that he proposed to submit this request, the Department of Trade and Customs has had time to look into it; and, having given the matter consideration, offers two objections to it. The first is that it is not consistent with the Protectionist incidence of this Tariff in regard to woollen goods, because the articles which the honorable senator proposes to admit at a lower rate of duty might be used as substitutes for the lighter woollen goods manufactured in Australia, which it is the policy of this Parliament to protect. The other is that it would be extremely inconvenient and difficult for the Customs officials to follow the differentiations set out in the request as between one class of goods and another of similar weight, or, perhaps, of a slightly heavier make, and conflicting decisions would probably be given in different ports. The differentiation suggested by the honorable senator was attempted in a previous Tariff and abandoned. I do not think that honorable senators can accuse the Department of not giving full consideration to the suggestions put forward by them. In this case it is felt that it would not be wise to accept the honorable senator&#39;s proposal, on the grounds that I have stated. </para>

                    <para>. - This request is perfectly justified, as some medicines contain a high percentage of spirit, and if the duties are left as they are, and no Excise is paid on the spirituous contents, local manufacturers will be penalized. I know of a man who acquired the alcoholic habit by using a certain kind of patent medicine which contained a large percentage of alcohol, and under the duties as they stand such preparations are imported without any equivalent duty on the spirit being paid.

I promise him that I shall not take more than twenty minutes in dealing with the Bill to-morrow.

I think that honorable senators, having given the attention they have given to the schedule - and I congratulate all hands on that - must realize the disastrous effect, in its interference with trade, produced by a measure of this character. We realize as we pass from item to item and page to page of the Tariff schedule that some persons are being seriously interfered with - that firms which have made investments in various directions are likely to find themselves in a most precarious position as the result of the duties we have imposed. The interests of secondary industries clash with those of primary industries. The interests of the one have been overlooked in our desire to consider the interests of the other, and we have made things worse than they were before. That at least is my honest opinion.

                <para class="block">I desire to buttress the opinions I have expressed by quoting those of leading business men in England with regard to governmental interference with trade. I take the following from a well-known journal : - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The leading bankers of London have all joined in a public statement, in which they have laid down very cogently the arguments in favour of public economy, and a minimum of governmental interference with trade. It is worth reading, for it lays clown general principles which apply to one country as well as another. The full statement, with signatures, is appended herewith :  - &#34;A hundred years ago, in a time of depression following a great war, &#39; the merchants of London presented to Parliament a memorable petition against the &#39; anti-commercial principles&#39; of the restrictive system then in force. To-day, moved by the same anxieties, weighed down by far heavier taxation, and face to face with proposals intended to renew the restrictive methods of the past, we submit that it is essential fo the revival of confidence that no legislative or administrative measures be taken which would diminish the total output of British industry, or check the free exchange of British goods. &#34;The burden of taxation can only be lightened if the necessity for public economy is resolutely faced. The present rate of national expenditure threatens to cripple the country&#39;s resources and to impair its credit abroad. In our judgment, it is more than the commercial community can bear, more than the capacity of the nation can afford, more than, were proper economics effected, the nation need be asked to sustain. &#34; The system of Government regulating trade by licences, controls, and departmental orders has, admittedly, however well-intended, had in many cases unfortunate results. Political interference with the natural course of commerce without regard to economic laws invariably does mischief. British trade needs nothing so much for its recovery as freedom to deal with its own difficulties, to study and provide for its own interests and to work out its own salvation. &#34; It is as true as i,t was a hundred years ago, that foreign commerce conduces to the wealth and prosperity of a country by enabling it to import the commodities which other countries are best able to supply, and to export in payment those articles which, from its own situation. It is best adapted to produce; that freedom from restraint be calculated to give the utmost extension to foreign trade, and the best direction to capital and industry, and that the maxim of buying in the cheapest market and selling in the dearest, which regulates every merchant in his individual dealings, is the best rule fur the trade of the whole nation. &#34; The poliq&#39;y of trying to exclude the production of other countries, with the well-meant design of encouraging our own, cannot increase the volume of employment here. But it may well compel the consumers, who form the bulk of our population, to submit to privations in the quality or quantity of the goods they buy. The importation of foreign goods . does not diminish the activities of our people, because . such goods can only be paid for by the produce of British capital and labour. The advocates of a restrictive system are too apt to lose sight of the elementary fact that nations, or, rather, individual members of nations, buy foreign goods because they need them, not to benefit, others, but to benefit themselves, and pay for them by producing goods which the foreigner, in his turn, requires. We cannot limit imports into this country without limiting our export trade, and striking a grave blow at the world-wide commerce on which this island kingdom, principally depends. &#34; Trade is exohnnge. No nation which lives by trading with others can prosper unless other nations prosper, too. We hold to-day great stocks of goods. We are ready to manufacture more. There is a large and insistent demand for them abroad. But, owing to the paralysis of Continental commerce- due in part to the restrictive barriers which the new States have set up between themselves - the would-be buyers of our goods have not the means to pay for what they want. We have to build up tha market that we need by encouraging Continental nations to export to us. For it is only by exports that they can re-establish their credit and provide funds for the payment of their debts. In such a situation we believe that all expedients to control and hamper imports into this country, whether by licences, Tariffs, or any other means, can only retard improvement in the Continental exchanges, and prevent the natural recovery of trade. Legislation of this nature, while it may increase the profits of a few selected industries, cannot fail to check our output as a whole, and to increase the costs of production to a level which may make it increasingly difficult for British traders to compete successfully with others in the markets of the world. &#34; With party or political considerations we, as bankers, are not concerned. But in the interests of British industry and commerce, now menaced by anxieties which it would be a profound mistake to underrate, we desire to enter a respectful protest against every restrictive regulation of trade which tends to diminish the resources of the State. </para>

Let us apply them to what has been done in Australia. They certainly are a weighty pronouncement against the interference with trade in which we have been engaged for the last few weeks. In conclusion, I congratulate the Government for the opportunities they have afforded honorable senators to deal with the Tariff throughout the tiring Committee stage.

                    <para>. - I thank honorable senators generally for the consideration they have extended to the Government in connexion with the, heavy ordeal through which we have passed in dealing with the Tariff schedule. I specially appreciate the consideration that has been shown to me in the knowledge that I have been placed in a rather awkward position owing to the absence of my honorable colleagues, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> both of whom are sick at the present time. I gratefully acknowledge this consideration, not only by those who usually support the Government, but also by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner).</inline></para>
