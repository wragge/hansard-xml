                    <para>.- (By leave) -I desire to make a personal explanation in regard to tie correspondence which has been placed on the table of the Library for the information of' honorable' senators. Thewhole incident; I may say; arose from the allegation made against me by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that until I had been refused a divisional command I had not made any objection to the divisional scheme, or to any other of the Defence proposals recently before us. In refers ence to that statement, I pointed out that; bo far from being eager for a divisional command, I had, at the very earliest opportunity, when it was officially mentioned to me, stated that I would not accept any such appointment until I had had an opportunity of considering in detail the Government proposals. That was I understand) denied by the Minister, whereupon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> contrary 'to my wishes,  as  expressed to him at the time, requested that the papers be laid on the table of the Library. On examination of the file, I saw no trace of the original letter on the subject, and requested its production. It is now explained that such a letter was sent, but that it was a personal letter to me, and has been destroyed. </para>

                    <para>As ons of the  senior  officers of the Australian Imperial Force your claims to appointment as a divisional commander cannot be overlooked. Will you please inform me whether, in the event of your being recommended to the Minister for a divisional command,  you  would be prepared to carry out Hs duties f Also, as this would leave a vacancy in your present command, will you please state who of your battalion commanders you would recommend to succeed you and whom you would propose to succeed in turn, to his  battalion. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">I treated that communication as being, for all purposes, official, even to the extent of complying with regulation 827, by returning the original letter to General Brand, with my minute thereon. That minute was to the effect, now admitted by General Brand, namely, that I declined to bind myself to accept any appointment under the scheme until I had had an opportunity of considering the -whole of the Government proposals. Why should I have volunteered that information if, as suggested, I had merely been asked to make recommendations as regards my subordinate officers? It is obvious that the facts must be as I have all along contended. I also, complied, of course, with the second part of the letter, and made the recommendations asked for, treating the. whole matter throughout ae official and confidential; and it was not until I was forced, in self defence, by the' Minister's accusation, to mention this fact, that I mentioned the matter' to any person whatsoever. </para><para>Now that the matter has been brought to a head, I want to say that I never, e any time, contemplated accepting a divisional command,' and that if it had been offered to me I should have refused. I should have refused, firstly, because I should have found myself in an impossible situation. To do my duty to my constituents, I should have felt compelled to continually criticise proposals put forward by one who, to all intents and purposes, was my commanding officer; and no officer should be placed in that position. I should have refused, secondly, for the reason that I am not at present prepared to devote ninety-one days a year - one-third practically of the year - as required, to military duties. I trust that this is the last time that the Minister will resort to the tactics of drawing a red-herring across the path -by making personal insinuations in regard to myself, and declaring it to be a matter of pique on my part. </para><para>My reason for retiring from active military service was, as I have already publicly stated, to draw attention to the constitution of the Military Board, which tends to reduce officers to a state of slavery, without rights, and without appeal; and also to draw the attention of the people to the attitude of the Minister towards those unjustly treated whilst on active service in the Australian Imperial Force. I want particularly to draw the attention of the Senate to the minute of the Military Board, which was approved by the Minister; - </para><quote>

In my opinion, I stated the facts plainly and simply, without any disrespect, but insisted on my rights. That, the Board, apparently, has treated as a crime. In another minute, '' it is stated that - </para><quote>

                    <para>The Board happens to be aware of the circumstances in which this officer was superseded in the Australian Imperial Force.  His  bravery and capacity to command cannot be questioned ; but other officers, who also possess these attributes, were selected because, in the opinion of competent authority, they were more fitted for the command of a division. </para>
                </quote><para>Remembering the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of this Board - General White, General Sellheim, General Forsyth, and  Colonel Thomas  - and knowing, as I do, the history and records of those gentlemen, I must come to the inevitable conclusion that the only one among them who happens to be aware of the circumstances is General White. General White was intimately associated with the matter. When I protested to him in the field against my supersession, I informed him that, although I was under military discipline, and must perforce obey orders, I intended to refer the matter to the Minister.  His  comment was, " Finally, you actually threaten me with political influence. You have written hurriedly, and in regard to your letter, let me say that if the decision rested with me I should send you off to Australia without the least hesitation; calmly and deliberately, you repeat your intention to seek political aid; and if you manage to raise a dozen political military inquiries, I will fight you to a stand-still on that." That communication is in General White's own handwriting. </para><interjection>

Not having those qualities an officer is placed on the shelf, though the Army Act and our Defence Act both provide for an appeal from the authorities in  the  field in the event of an inquiry.

                    <para>I desire to discuss the case of a gentle- man - Captain J. Strasburg - who offered his services to the Rabaul Expeditionary Force, and was given a position as acting-lieutenant, but who is now debarred from receivings a. war gratuity. I propose to deal with the case almost in that gentleman's own words, and by quoting from original documents and copies of correspondence, which prove unmistakably that as acting lieutenant he not only rendered service, but excellent service, to Australia. </para>

That covers the whole of the correspondence, and it satisfies me that Lieutenant Strasburg was entitled to the gratuity. I shall now place before the Senate some information which Lieutenant Strasburg compiled, at my request, from his diaries and logs. The following statement compasses his case as he sees it, and all I ask is that, if there are any good reasons why this officer should not receive the gratuity, the Government should make them known. I certainly am aware of  none ;  - </para>

                        <para>12th August, 1914. - I was summoned to Garden Island, and to produce my papers. After my papers were inspected in Sydney, the reports were sent on to the Naval Board in Melbourne for their approval. Three days later, I received instructions to go and board the s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Berrima,</inline> and report myself to Commander Stevenson. I also handed him a letter from Lieutenant-Commander Cayley, R.N., stating the Naval Board has approved of Captain Strasburg's services being utilized on board the H.M.A.TBerrima.He will receive a commission as Acting Lieutenant, R.N.R. We left Sydney on the 19th August, and arrived at Rabaul on 11th September. I piloted the <inline font-style="italic">Berrima</inline> at Kaba Kaul, and pointed out the road to the wireless station. We anchored at Herbertshohefor the night.</para>
                        <para>12th September, 1914; - Piloted the <inline font-style="italic">Berrima</inline> from Herbertshohe to Rabaul. As soon as the vessel was tied up at the wharf, and before the troops had 'landed to garrison the place, I went on shore, together with Brigade-Major Heritage and Commander Brown, to secure a flagstaff for hoisting the British flag, and also selected a suitable spot for erecting the same.</para>
                        <para>13th September.- TheBritish flag was hoisted at Rabaul, and the Proclamation read to the white residents. An address to the natives in pidgin English, drafted by me, was also read to the natives, and three hearty cheers were given by them, which showed that we were welcome visitors. </para>
                        <para>16th September. - The s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Madang</inline> arrived from Kieta. I was sent on board to take an inventory of crew, passengers, and cargo. </para>

                        <para>19th September. - TheChinese labourers struck, and wanted more pay. They struck for1s. a day more, eight hours' work, and no night work. Being stuck up for Chinese labour, I took command of the motor schooner <inline font-style="italic">Laurengau, and</inline> proceeded in her to Matupi, and North coast New Britain. Recruited 135 native labourers to coal the ship. </para>
                        <para>20th September. - Being successful in supplying labour, I was sent for by the Admiral of the Fleet to supply labour to coal the following ships: - <inline font-style="italic">Murex,Grantala,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Aorangi.</inline> </para>
                        <para>22nd September. - We finished coaling the <inline font-style="italic">Berrima at</inline> 6 a.m., 970 tons. The coal bill - Chinese labour, £87 10s.; native labour, £21. 7s. 6d. The natives did the most of the coaling and all the night work, and the Chinese day work only. At 9.30 a.m., we left for Frederich Wilhelmshafen, the flagship <inline font-style="italic">Encounter</inline> and the French cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Montcalm escorting</inline> us. When at Rabaul, I discovered many recent German plans, and also several reports and soundings, tides, and currents for the whole of the Bismarck Archipelago,German New Guinea, Caroline, and Marshall Islands. This work had taken the German surveying vessels many years to complete, and when translated and published in the <inline font-style="italic">South Sea Directory,</inline> should prove of great value to navigators. These plans and papers I passed on to Commander Stevenson, and I believe he transferred them to the Admiral the next day, when he and the Brigadier, Colonel Holmes, visited 'the Flagship at sea. </para>
                        <para>24th September. - Piloted the <inline font-style="italic">Berrima</inline> to Frederich Wilhelmshafen Harbor,and after the passage entrance had been swept for mines, we entered the harbor at 9.30 a.m. The flagship and <inline font-style="italic">Montcalm</inline> remained outside. The entrance is very narrow, and not enough swing room inside. We landed troops to garrison the place, provisions, stores, and ammunition ; left at 5 p.m. the same day for Rabaul. We were complimented by the Admiral for the quick discharge, and for safely bringing the <inline font-style="italic">Berrima</inline> in and out of port. </para>

                        <para>2nd October. - I was appointed in command of s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Meklong.</inline> This vessel was in a very neglected condition, nearly all her furniture had been .taken out of her, and even the little  chart house  on the bridge had been removed, and even, too, her compass lamps had been stolen. Her bottom was very foul, and had not been docked for two and a half years. Her engine-room and engines were in good order. I had some difficulty in securing a crew for this vessel, as they all had been allowed to go ashore. Her bottom being so foul, she would only steam 3 to 4 knots, and being flat bottomed, 'She could <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> make any progress against fresh winds, sea, and current. </para>
                        <para>4th October. - The <inline font-style="italic">Berrima</inline> left Rabaul for Sydney, and I was transferred to the Administrator, who thought my services would be very useful on account of my local knowledge of those waters, and also of native affairs. After being appointed in command of the <inline font-style="italic">Meklong</inline> and getting her ready - for sea, the King's Deputy Harbor Master was sent on board to bring her alongside the wharf, and I was asked to take a day off. She was sent down with Captain  Komini  as pilot, and despatched to  Kapa Kaul  to take on board some wireless gear and other .matters which had been captured at the Wireless Station. When she returned to Rabaul late that night, I took charge of her again,' but was cautioned not to take the hatches off, and not let anybody know the contents of her cargo. </para>
                        <para>6th October. - S.S. <inline font-style="italic">Meklong's</inline> engines were dismantled, and she has laid up, awaiting instructions. </para>

                        <para>15th October. - I was appointed the Commander of the <inline font-style="italic">Nusa,</inline> a Government yacht, and left in her on the 27th October on an expedition to New Ireland, to secure the release of the British Consul, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jolley,</inline> Brigade-Major Heritage iu charge of the expedition. At Kawieng,  New Ireland, we hoisted the British flag, and secured the release of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jolley,</inline> and left Lieutenant Holmes and a few men to garrison the place; and left the same day at 9 p.m., for Gardner -Island, where we expected to find the s.s, <inline font-style="italic">Sier.</inline> It was in Kawieng where the transport <inline font-style="italic">Eastern</inline> got stranded last January, and damages to the vessel's bottom amounted to £4,000. The stranding of the <inline font-style="italic">Eastern</inline> took place in the middle of the day, and had I been the pilot on board, it would never have happened. All leading marks and beacons in the harbor had been destroyed by the Germans. I took the s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Meklong</inline> through after dark twice. </para>
                        <para>18th October. - I found the s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Siar</inline> and M.S. <inline font-style="italic">Matupi</inline> and M.S. <inline font-style="italic">Senta</inline> hidden in a small cove called  "Tekarake."  This place is not marked on any chart published, and known to very few local people, and I do not believe that there is a navigator in the whole of Australasia that knows the place. Those ships were .taken by great surprise, the captain and officers being on shore. When they saw us coming, they ran down the wharf to board their own boats; but we came so suddenly round the corner, entered' the harbor, and took possession, and sentries posted on each ship, before the Germans had time to go on board. The s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Siar</inline> had no coal on board, so I took her in tow of the <inline font-style="italic">Nusa,</inline> and the other two boats following in their own steam. We arrived off Kawieng  after dark, and were unable to enter the place, the two motor vessels having broken down, and I had .the three ships in tow the whole night. It was rather dangerous work, as we were within half-a-mile of the breakers. We arrived at Kawieng on the morning of the 20th; there we provisioned, coaled, and watered the ships, and left on the 21st for Rabaul. We arrived off Rabaul at midnight,' but did not enter the harbor until 7.30 next morning. On arrival, I was heartily congratulated by the Administrator and his officers, and the whole of the garrison. </para>
                        <para>24th October. - I was appointed in command of the s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Madang.</inline> I had previously been informed of the whereabouts of the auxiliary schooner <inline font-style="italic">Samoa,</inline> and was commissioned to capture her. Leaving the wharf, Commander Lambton jumped aboard, and informed me that he was to command, and that I was navigating officer only. This took me rather by surprise, as if I had been informed previous to leaving the wharf that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lambton</inline> was to be Commander, I should have protested against going in the vessel. We arrived at Kalili  Bay at 6.30 a.m., on the 25th October, found there the schooner at anchor in a small cove, and hidden behind trees, where we could just see the top of her mast. Whilst Commander Lambton was making .arrangements for his men to board the ship, I steamed into the harbor, calling out to the captain of the <inline font-style="italic">Samoa</inline> to lower his boats down out of the davits so that I could come alongside. Commander Lambton and two A.B.'s jumped' on board, pulled the German - flag down, and hoisted the Union Jack. There was no resistance offered, and what firearms they had on board were dumped overboard when they saw us coming. We left at 8 a.m., and the <inline font-style="italic">Samoa</inline> followed under her steam, and arrived at 6 p.m. the same day at Rabaul. </para>
                        <para>26th October. - I was again appointed in command of the s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Meklong,</inline> and left Rabaul with troops, stores, and 154 tons of general cargo, for Kawieng, New Ireland. </para>
                        <para>29th October. - We arrived at Kawieng at' 7 a.m., landed troops, stores, and cargo, and left at 8.30 p.m. for Namatanai, where we arrived at 6 p.m. Landed shore party, who marched along the coast some 20 miles, and captured some of the Germans who were connected with the flogging of the English .missionary, t </para>
                        <para>31st October. - We hoisted the flag at Namatanai, landed a small garrison force, and left at 6.30 p.m. for Kawieng. On 1st November, O I captured the auxiliary cutter <inline font-style="italic">Hilalon</inline> at sea, took her into tow, and arrived at Kawieng at 3 p.m. the same day. </para>
                        <para>2nd, 3rd, and 4th November. - We discharged cargo, and loaded copra at Kawieng, and three other ports; and commenced to inaugurate an inter-island trade service.  </para>
                        <para>5th November. - We -left Kawieng for Rabaul with the auxiliary schooner <inline font-style="italic">Harriet Alice</inline> in tow. </para>
                        <para>6th November. - Whilst steaming close along the coast of New Ireland, when off Kalili Bay, several canoes came off and told us that there were several Germans on shore who had ill treated them (flogged them), and they had also been connected with the flogging of the missionary. We landed a shore party at 7 a.m., with instructions to capture the Germans. They returned at noon,, and reported that the Germans had all fled to the mountains. On leaving Kalili, I again picked up the <inline font-style="italic">Harriet Alice,</inline> which I had left under her own steam while we went into the bay. I steamed further along the coast looking for the Germans, and arrived at 7 p.m. off Labur, and laid to outside for the night. At 6 o'clock next morning I landed Captain Twynan and party at a place called Labur. They returned at 8 o'clock, and we proceeded further down the coast to 'a place called Bum; but we could find no trace of any more Germans, so we proceeded to Rabaul, where we arrived that evening. </para>
                        <para>8th November. - At 6 a.m. (Sunday), left the wharf, went alongside the s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Matunga,</inline> who was anchored in the stream, discharged 250 tons of cargo, and returned to the 'wharf at 4 p.m. </para>
                        <para>10th November. - 8 a.m. Anchored at Herbertshohe waiting high tide to beach the vessel" at Matupi for the purpose of cleaning her bottom, which was very foul. I sent the boat ashore with instructions. At 10 a.m., received signal to return to Rabaul; replied, I could not, boat and crew on shore. Signal repeated; name reply. Received urgent signal, leave boat and crew behind and return to Rabaul. On arriving at Rabaul, received instructions to take cargo from the <inline font-style="italic">Madang</inline> and proceed with cargo and passengers, and to leave the same evening for Kawieng. Replied impossible, vessel requires water, coal, stores, and provisions, and a full complement of crew. We only had Ave natives aboard, and no white officers. At 3 p.m. we commenced to load cargo and coal <inline font-style="italic">Madang</inline> on port side, and coal lighter on the other side, the ship anchored in the stream. </para>
                        <para>11th November. - We left at 9 p.m. for New Ireland, with <inline font-weight="bold">Major Ralston,</inline> two other officers, 155 troops, Captain Twynan, 25 native police, 15 native carriers, and 10 native passengers on board. </para>
                        <para>13th November. - Arrived at . Namatanai, landed <inline font-weight="bold">Major Ralston</inline> and party, and left next day for Kawieng. </para>
                        <para>16th November. - We left Kawieng for Gardner Island. </para>
                        <para>17th November. - Arrived off Gardner Island 7 a.m. Anchored at Zigarrigarri, the same place where the three German vessels were captured last month. Landed cargo, and took on board copra, and left at 11.30 for Tatau where we anchored at 1.30 p.m. Here we landed cargo, and took on board four cutter loads of copra. </para>
                        <para>18th November. - Left Tatau Island at 5 a.m. At 7.30 a.m., we anchored at Terripax, took aboard 252 bags of copra, and left at .1.30 p.m. for Fisoa, New Ireland. Arrived there at 7 p.m., failed to find an anchorage, went to sea intending to return next morning. After leaving the coast, I went below for a couple of hours' rest, when the officer in charge of the bridge turned back with the vessel without my . authority, attempted to pick up an anchorage, lost one anchor and 45 fathoms of chain, and nearly wrecked the vessel. I went to sea the second time, reported this matter on my return to Rabaul; but no official inquiry was held. </para>
                        <para>19th November. - We laid to outside Namatanai the whole night waiting for <inline font-weight="bold">Major Ralston</inline> and party to come on board. </para>
                        <para>20th November. - Received party on board at 10 a.m., and anchored at a place called Muliama at 6 p.m. Immediately we anchored, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Ralston</inline> and party landed in ship's boat, x and proceeded down the coast to capture some German outlaws. I received next morning a message that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Ralston</inline> had captured two- German prisoners at 3 a.m., and that he was expected to come on board at 3.30 p.m. the same day. I may mention at this place the entrance is very harrow, only 200 yards wide, with <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> sharp turning; and had we not anchored there after dark, we would have been unable to capture the Germans, as they had scouts out along the coast. We left at 3.30 p.m., intending to go back to Namatanai; but, having several people on board dangerously 'ill, and acting  on the advice of the A.A.M.C. detail on board, decided to return to Rabaul. </para>

At that deputation on which the League was represented- by the&lt;. secretary or- the  president,  such a strong:case was made out that, the Assistant Minister for Defence- immediately granted . the- request- which was made. He wanted a settlement which the Government 'were prepared to approve with this, difference : They wanted Captain Strasburg- to sign an agreement renouncing- his claim to a gratuity, his claims in connexion with certain lands, and  any claim for prize money in connexion- with the capture-1 of  certain ships. The Assistant Minister was of opinion that he should not have to sign away those rights, and said that he would be paid the amount. Captain Strasburg, accepted that condition; but the Crown Law officers instead of paying him £100 paid him only £50, and refused to pay the remaining £50 until he supplied them with certain documents. ' He is . a poor man who has been harassed and annoyed for a considerable time, and I am. bringing this matter before the Senate in the endeavour to secure- for him that justice to which he is entitled. I .am not pressing his legal claims, as they could be brought before the Court. The claim for a. wor gratuity is not a legal one, and the facts which I have disclosed show that he. has a strong moral claim. I appeal to the Minister for Defence, either to grant, his claim, or to give some valid reason why his request cannot be complied with. Honorable senators know that I do not move the adjournment of the Senate unless the matter which T have to bring for- , ward is of urgent public importance; and I have moved the adjournment on this occasion because I believe the matter will receive sympathetic consideration, even. at. the hands of the  Government.. </para>

                        <para>.- Thiscase is by no means a new one to. me, and before I deal, with, its merits may X . say . that I shall .ha-ve to speak, somewhat. in1 a collective capacity as the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Laird Smith)</inline> as it is, not a- defence matter in so far: as- that Department is.-' concerned. I shall also- have to speak as' the Minister representing the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir -Joseph. Cook)</inline> in. the matter of ., a war 'gratuity, the payments' of which are" controlled by the Treasurer and not by the Minister for Defence. The first letter quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Gardiner-</inline> is, one-, issued,. I understand, by the officer- in command at Garden Island.- He had' no authority to grant a commission to any, one; nor does his letter purport so to  do. The .letter indicates that it was- intended to use  Strasburg's  services, and that he -would receive - the appointment of lieutenant. Defence and. the Navy were at that time - in 19.14- 15. - under the control of one Minister, and'-when-. Strasburg was. engaged the De-1  apartment  waa under- my administration. Later the Departments were separated, andi  Strasburg's  claim for a war gratuity, has been dealt with, since- then! Each- Department has to determine the eligibility  of the members of the Forces who served under it. Therefore, it was not a question which I had any authority to determine. In- 1915 Captain' Strasburg made certain claims which came before me, and <inline font-style="italic">T</inline> referred them to Colonel" Holmes, who was administering what. was then German New Guinea. A number of" reports were received from officers who had dealings with Captain Strasburg, and these, together with the Administrator's remarks; were sent to Melbourne.  On receipt of these reports I referred his claim, together with the report, to the Naval Board, and I have 'here the recommendation, of that body. The following is a copy of the minute by the-First Naval Member, which was forwarded for the Minister's information : - </para>

If Captain  Strasburg's  assistance andi knowledge placed us in possession of these vessels, and they are now -our property, he has carried out a service worth at least f 100, and .to this should be added a few pounds for length of time he has remained here waiting for his money. </para>

                    <para class="block">I point out that .the only appeal from .the Central War Gratuity Board is to. the Treasurer,, and not to me. </para>
                    <para>The Secretary, for Defence, in a minute dated 16th November, 1920, -sought information from the Adjutant-General as to whether it was proper for the Department to employ Captain Strasburg in a civilian capacity -on military operations of the nature referred to; and, further,- if it was improper to do this whether it would not be -equitable to now appoint Captain Strasburg to the Forces for- the duration of his employment in order to -make him . eligible to benefit under the War Gratuity Act. The Adjutant-General pointed out that Captain Strasburg was employed for Naval service, and not military, and, therefore, the question is one for decision by the Navy Department, but no objection could be seen why a person should not have been employed in a civilian capacity for navigation work during the war. A similar query to that addressed to the Adjutant-General was on 24th December, 1920, forwarded to the Navy Department, which Department replied on 10th February, 1921, to the effect that the Naval Board, after full consideration of all the circumstances attending the case, -are unable to concur in the proposal to appoint Captain Strasburg to the Naval Forces for the period Ot his employment, as such action would create a very undesirable precedent, which other persons would  seize upon. Captain Strasburg was not "the only person employed in- the -same locality in a civilian capacity for pilotage and other such work. Moreover, under the Naval Defence Act, Captain Strasburg, feeing an alien, is ineligible to be granted a commission in the Commonwealth Naval Forces. On the. 26th November, 1920, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> again brought this matter before the House, and spoke at length </para>
                    <para>On the subject. I then replied that it would appear that .the Navy Department ;are taking up fie attitude that, technically speaking, .Captain Strasburg is not entitled to a war gratuity, and if such was the case- representations would be made to the Minister for the Navy to consider whether he could -see his- way on the- facts. I .said that I did not propose to pass any "judgment on them,, to recommend Parliament to vote. a sum of .money to Captain </para>
                    <para class="block">Strasburg for the services he had rendered if he was not entitled, technically speaking, to the war gratuity. That I have done; but so far no decision has been arrived at. Captain Strasburg had issued a writ against the Commonwealth Government claiming £12,000 for services rendered, &amp;c. The plaintiff solicitor suggested, without prejudice, that the action be settled by the payment of £2;000 in full settlement of all claims due. The Commonwealth legal authorities considered that Captain Strasburg had no legal claim against the Commonwealth, and, stated that it was a matter for Departmental consideration whether or not it would be preferable to settle the matter by paying. Captain Strasburg the sum of £105, being the difference between the amount of his claim made immediately the services were rendered, viz., £285 - that is the claim with which I dealt in the earlier stages of the case - and the total of the payments made to him, viz., £180, because the £125, of which I approved, was subsequently increased by £55. The Navy Department took the view that the matter involved was the assessment of the services of Captain Strasburg to the Administrator at Rabaul, and remarked that Captain Strasburg rendered very useful service to the Administrator, and his local knowledge apparently proved of much value in a number of ways, apart from his actual duties as a pilot in uncharted waters. It was, therefore, recommended that the amount of £105 be paid. The offer of £105 in full final settlement was made to Captain Strasburg's solicitors, who submitted a counter proposal for settlement as under: - </para>
                    <para>To accept the amount of £105 offered, if consideration is given to application for war gratuity, and if his right to take up and develop the island lands over which he held certain rights from the then German Government is not dealt with in the settlement. </para>
                    <para class="block">To this the reply was given that the suggested payment of £105 was in full and final settlement of all claims for compensation which the plaintiff then had, or thereafter might have, including war gratuity and interests in lands, and that the amount of £105 must be accepted or unconditionally rejected. A further letter was then received accepting the offer of £105 on these terms, conditional on the Crown paying plaintiff's costs assessed at £21, but on acceptance of this offer being notified to the solicitors, the plaintiff refused, to agree, and again put forward his request that settlement should exclude claims, if any, to war gratuity and prize money. Settlement on these lines was eventually agreed upon, viz., payment of £105 and £21 costs, but not to prejudice claims (if any) to war gratuity and prize money. </para>
                    <para>Captain Strasburg originally applied for war gratuity, but his application was rejected by the Director of Navy Accounts, on the ground that he was not a " member of the Forces " within the meaning of the Act. The case was later referred to the Central War Gratuity Board. . The Central Board's decision was that the applicant was not eligible, not being a " member of the Forces " within the meaning of the Act. The Central Board further states - </para>
                    <para>The file relative to the case indicated an apparent intention to grant Captain Strasburg a commission, but this is not an appointment, and the Naval Board, therefore, did not appoint him. He was not, therefore, a member of the Forces, and is not entitled under the Act to war gratuity. </para>
                    <para class="block">Further, he did not receive the full pay of his rank or alleged rank (section 5 (2) of the War Gratuity Act), which would also render him ineligible. The Central War Gratuity Board (prescribed authority) is vested under the War </para>
                    <para class="block">Gratuity Regulations with power to decide on any appeal lodged by a war gratuity claimant. The Board, before finally rejecting Captain Strasburg's claim, were in possession of the full facts in connexion with his service, and were familiar with all the circumstances as disclosed by the Navy Department's file. </para>
                    <para>I have in addition only to say that it is clear that Captain Strasburg's original claim was not for anything like the amount for which he afterwards claimed. Inquiries were made at the time when the facts were new and in the minds of the officers who dealt with the matter. The reports were considered by the First Naval Member of the Naval Board, and his recommendation was made and approved. The amount of compensation he recommended was subsequently increased by £50, and later by £7 for some technical reason. It was finally accepted  by Captain Strasburg's representatives, any suggestion that he was entitled to war gratuity, or any claim in respect of lands, being waived. Therefore, I do not see that he can have any further claim on that score. Whatever claim he may have must be with regard to the payment of war gratuity. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that although a naturalized British subject,' under the Navy regulations he was ineligible for a commission. In his claim he himself assessed the value of his services, and the matter was fully gone into. He received his pay, but put forward a claim for £3S0 as extra payment, and, after it had been given consideration, he accepted payment at the reduced figure. Therefore, what other moral claim can there te? He himself assessed the value of his services when the whole of the circumstances were fresh in his mind, and lie has been paid. I have submitted to the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> the question whether in the light of all the facts he can approve of any further payment. </para>

                            <para>- No. His claim referred to services in 1915. At that time the question of paying a war gratuity had not been dealt with. It appears to me that his moral claim must rest upon the fact that if he had been entitled to a commission in the Navy he would undoubtedly have been entitled to the payment of a war gratuity. Through a technicality, due to his nationality, he was not appointed, because he was not eligible. </para>

                        <para>. - It must be satisfactory to honorable senators who listened to the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to learn from the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that this matter has not been finally dealt with, but is receiving consideration at the hands of the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith).</inline> It would seem that this man just missed appointment in the Navy, and that the real reason why he is not entitled to a war gratuity now, is a technical reason ; he was not really commissioned in the Navy, and could not have become one by reason of his nationality. (But, in spite of his nationality, it would appear, from his record read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> that he rendered valuable and signal service to the Empire during the war. In determining whether he is entitled to receive war gratuity it would be well, I think, if the Minister bore in mind the fact that we are dealing with a foreigner. This man, before he was in the service of the Commonwealth, apparently held some land in German New Guinea, under conditions, from the then German Administrator of that Territory. If there is one thing more than another about which we should be zealous, it is a determination to uphold the reputation of British people in their dealings with foreigners. I hope this aspect of the matter will be taken into consideration by the Minister for the Navy when dealing with tha .claim. .There is not the slightest doubt that if it had been possible to appoint this man to the. Australian Navy he would have received an appointment, and there could then have1 been no question as to his claim for the gratuity. When he made his claim' the question of a war gratuity was not in the mind of any one. That matter was determined afterwards. When wo were dealing with that particular measure we could not be expected to advert to singular instances of service such as this man rendered to the Commonwealth ;.and the Empire. Had we done so, possibly some provision would have been inserted to meet such cases. There is not the slightest doubt, if such instances had come .before honorable senators .at the . time, no opposition would have been raised to Captain Strasburg receiving the war gratuity. I hope that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> when he receives a reply from his colleague, will' be able to indicate that the matter has received sympathetic consideration in a practical form. </para>

Captain Strasburg is. an old man, and he. feels his position very keenly, because he says that people will believe that. he has not. received the. gratuity, because of the. fact that there is something against him. He willingly gave his services - certainly he was paid for them - and there is only the. fact against him that he could not be appointed a lieutenant, seeing that he was not of British birth, although he is not a German. There was nothing in the regulations to prevent, his taking charge of one of the Navy's vessels, and as he was appointed to command one of them he became entitled to thewar gratuity. So long as I remain in Parliament I shall press his claim. </para>

                <para class="block">When the Tariff was under consideration by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> he decided that if the articles mentioned in this sub-item could be made in Australia, he would readily protect them, but through some oversight this was not done, and a firm which had already commenced the building of its. factory in accordance with the Minister's assurance that protection would be afforded to. it, drew his attention to the omission. He then promised that he would have the matter rectified in this Chamber. The rolling of aluminium sheets had not previously been undertaken in Australia to any extent, but at the urgent request of the Government the Australian Bronze Company at Sydney decided to erect a rolling mill for the purpose of rolling these sheets in order to place other manufacturers in the position of being able to obtain their supplies of raw material in Australia instead of being dependent on outside sources. Their mill is now in course of erection, and will be completed shortly. Should they not be in a position to supply the requirements of others by the 1st January next, the date for the coming into operation of this duty will be further extended. </para>

There is now being erected in Sydney a factory with the necessary plant to produce aluminium, and, in view of our experience during the war, we must' recognise the importance of encouraging such an: enterprise. There were occasions during the war period when it was exceedingly difficult to obtain what were relatively small things, although of great importance to various industries and essential to the progress and defence of the. country. We made inquiries through the Board of Trade for aluminium for the use of the Defence Department. </para>

                            asked for an increase of the duties on plates under the general Tariff, which would apply to imports from Germany. I do not know how they were brought in, but quite recently aluminium plates bearing inscriptions in German have been seen in Melbourne. That is an indication that some goods at least are being brought in illicitly from Germany.

                    <para>.- The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> tells us that there is being established in Sydney a factory which will be able to produce these goods and on that ground he asks us to agree  to  a request that, although the item has hitherto been free, the goods covered by it shall, from a certain date, be dutiable at the rate of 25 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> under the British preferential Tariff. I venture to say that this is a wholly unreasonable proposal. If there is any metal which of recent years has come into more general use than others it is aluminium. The growth of its use has been remarkable. I do not know of the extent of the factory that is commencing operations in Sydney, but I think that we should at least impose the condition that these duties shall not come -into operation until that factory is, or others are, in a position to supply the whole of Australia's requirements in this respect. Why should the people of Western Australia, for instance, have to pay a duty of 25 per cent, on imports of these materials from Great Britain merely because of a desire to protect one factory in New South Wales which is about to commence operations. No one will say that this one factory will be able to supply the whole of Australia's requirements, nor with quite a number of such factories, shall we be able to meet the local demand for some time to come. Here we have another illustration of the way in which well organized sections of industry can reach the ears of the Ministry. I can conceive of no more pernicious principle than that . under which ' the Legislature gives power to a Minister  to  say when a duty shall come into operation. Such a system may place the responsible Minister quite unjustly under suspicion. The Parliament alone should impose or. remove duties. In the good old days of which some people love  to  talk there were men who would have been delighted to have such a power as we are giving to the Minister in this case.. The principle is utterly wrong. </para>

                        <para>- A bounty would be the lesser evil. I prefer bounties rather than Protectionist duties. In a widespread community such as ours it would be better to assist a growing industry by means of a bounty than by the imposition of protective duties since, until the industry so protected is able to supply the whole of our requirements, people are forced to purchase imported goods, and to pay the duties levied upon them. I know that members of the present Government are quite above suspicion - I make that statement in all seriousness - but I do not think any Minister should be exposed to such a temptation as this system offers. There might come a time when a Minister would make use of such a power as this to his own advantage. I have read quite a number of articles on the corruption which the Tariff of the United States of America has produced. I do not believe that there is any more corruption in the United States of America than there is in Great Britain or Australia, but American writers would -lead those unacquainted with American people to believe that almost every American is a lobbyist looking for concessions and ready, if necessary, to pay for them. If we give power to the Minister for Trade and Customs to impose or withhold duties the lobbyists will be in perpetual employment. </para>

                        <para>- Yes," we shall have departmental trotters wearing out the carpet on the back stairs to the Minister's room. We know that there are lobbyists watching the passage of the Tariff through the Parliament, and who desire to see it shaped to suit certain industries. They do not approach me, because they know what my fiscal views are. I know of no body other than the Parliament itself which could exercise the power of withholding or imposing duties without being open to suspicion. Under such a system as is to be provided for in this case we might have trade rivals saying that the Government give advantages to some and disadvantages to others. This pernicious system will give rise to a suspicion against our governing authorities whoever they may be. I do not think we shall ever have other than a Protectionist Government in power in the Commonwealth, and it should be left to the Government of the day to submit to Parliament the duties which they consider necessary to protect our manufacturers. I should like to ask the Minister whether these deferred duties will come into force when the Sydney factory starts to produce these goods, or whether it will be withheld until the local industry is capable of supplying the whole of our requirements. </para>

                    <para>-. - I support the proposal of the- Government. I should have preferred,, however, , to see some, provision made for the interval, between now and. the date- at which the deferred duties will come into operation. Before the war the great German firm of Krupp's produced, large quantities of these aluminium, plates. My informan t on this matter is a Scotsman, who before the war was employed at Krupp's, and also possesses considerable knowledge of conditions in Switzerland'. In regard to the latter country, he tells me that there is no' aluminium plant there, and he showed me samples of articles produced by Krupp's and imported into Australia as from Switzerland. In confirmation of this, he showed on the plates themselves certain words' written in German. At the present time that gentleman is representing in Australia a British firm which, established during the- war, has made great strides', and- he preferred a request that there should bc a duty of  15  per cent, on the foreign article,, leaving a British preference of  15  per cent. I have no objection to the. Government proposal, because it maintains that preference when the duties become operative. At the same time, it is my. desire that this industry shall- be established in Australia,, because I regard it as one of great importance. Honorable senators may be aware that the whole of the water-bottles for the Defence Forces are now made of aluminium on account of the lightness of the material; which is more and more being used in the manufacture of mess tins and other articles of the sort. I am informed that there are extensive natural deposits of the metal itself in Australia, and' if we desire to establish the industry here we should* support a duty, even on the British article, in order to develop our natural resources. Then, again, a great deal of the metal work in the construction of aeroplanes, work which is becoming increasingly important, both commercially and from a defence point of view, is* of aluminium; and it is very desirable that we should be self-supporting in this regard. Events in the future may temporarily cut us off from Europe, and if we are then dependent for supplies of this kind on Great Britain, or any other part of the world, we shall find ourselves in a very desperate situation. It is from that point of view I support the" Minister, but I am just a little- anxious as to whether adequate1 provision is made to keep out the German goods, pending the establishment of the industry here. </para>

Articles of German, manufacture may have been taken into Switzerland years ago, and others may have some little work done to them in that country; .with a view to claiming Swiss origin. </para>

                    <para>. -  In this case we are asked to impose a duty in order to encourage an industry that does not yet exist. I have heard many reasons stated for. duties, but this item is exceptional. It is a gem! But I recognise some merit in. a proposal of the kind, provided  it is properly safeguarded. We have heard of the necessity of protecting; infant industries, youthful' industries, and able-bodied adult industries: We have imposed duties in the case- of the able Bodied industries which have not only  settled competition within our own borders, but have been the means of giving a " knockout blow " to competitors in the outside open market. Protection, of course, has also been given to the infant and youthful industries, but now we are asked to protect an industry which . is only in the gestation period, .and in regard to which we do not know what may happen. </para>

                        <para>- We have only the word of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Bussell),</inline> and we know how optimistic he is as to what is going to happen in the manufacturing field. We are building our case for protection on too expansive a foundation, and, as. I have said, I cannot give a duty in the present instance unless adequate safeguards are provided. I realize that it is very necessary to afford encouragement to men who have the inclination and will to establish industries of the kind, but I do not approve of giving encouragement to weakling industries, as that would only mean additional taxation without any compensating advantages. I suggest, and I shall move if the suggestion is not accepted, that until this industry supplies one-third of the requirements of the Commonwealth no duty shall be imposed. I do not desire to leave the field open for adventurers to start some tin-pot enterprise which, with the help of the duty, will supply only a fraction of our requirements,  while imposing a tax on the general community. Manufacturers under Protection are growing fatter a-nd fatter, while the poor wretches who buy their commodities are growing leaner and leaner. Shortly .the manufacturers' circumference will be such that they will not be able to see their boots, while the gaunt figures of the consumers will become so thin as to be unable to cast a shadow. </para>

                        <para>- But the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> has moved in the direction of placing actually higher rates on aluminium angles, bars, plates, rods, sheets, strips, and tees than are provided upon aluminium wire. Aluminium wire can be drawn just as easily as steel or  brass wire. If a duty is to be imposed upon ingots and the other classes of product which I first mentioned, where will the raw material come from ? Aluminium ware is rapidlly  growing in public use;, more and more domestic articles are being manufactured from that metal. It would he in the best interests of Australia to encourage and foster any and every local phase of the aluminium industry. But, until Australia has reached a point at which the actual raw material is locally produced, the National Parliament should be very careful to insure that importation of supplies of the raw material is not hindered or cut off. I understand that there is a possibility of aluminium being mined and smelted in* Western Australia. If that is the case, I shall be the last to do anything in the direction of discouraging the industry. Aluminium is a mineral which is largely extracted from clay. The delicate process of segregating the metal from its component parts is one which Australia is not likely to be in a position to undertake for some time. That is why the importation of the raw material must be safeguarded. </para>

                        <para>- But that process of extraction will be undertaken from the imported raw material. There is a national side to the consideration of the item. Aluminium is very considerably used in the manufacture of aircraft. Australia would be fortunate if the local production of raw material could be taken in hand. Until then, however, the ingots must come in free. Further, this Committee would be unwise to seek -to impose higher duties upon the products mentioned in the Minister's request than have  been  placed by another place upon aluminium wire. </para>

                    <para>. - As far as it goes, the explanation of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> is satisfactory, and I can quite understand that a factory handling other metals will not have to incur much expenditure in the matter of extensions to enable aluminium to be treated. If the British preferential duty of 10 per cent, on aluminium wire is a scientific one to protect those engaged in the wire industry, does it not seem strange that sheets unpolished and unworked should be dutiable at 25 per cent.? I realize that the Protectionist wishes first to protect the primary producer who raises the metal from the earth, then those who mould the metal into ingots, and finally those who roll the ingots into plates, sheets, or strips. It must happen, with this metal in such general use, that quite a number of small factories will b.e established, which will want to be in a position to manufacture their products from bars ob plates, and the proprietors of these factories will look upon bars and plates as their raw material. In view of the fact that these industries are most likely to develop first, I would like to * know why the manufacturers should be called upon to pay a British preferential rate of 25 per cent., and the other duties mentioned by the Minister, when importations are from foreign countries. Would it not be better to impose lower duties when the industry is in its initial stage, and, when it was sufficiently developed, to supply a portion of our requirements, to increase the rates? Personally, I am against the imposition of any duties at all. Of course, there is the danger of the German goods coming in, and I do not see how pipes, plates, rods, sheets, strips, tees, and tubes of German origin can be excluded. Even if they are not stamped with the country of origin, there is quite a number of business people in Great Britain who would export them to Australia. When this industry has developed, there will be an extensive demand for raw material, and sheets, bars, tees, and tubes will be very largely used, particularly in the construction of aeroplanes. I understand that if sufficient of this material is not coming forward, duties will not be imposed. But if the duties are proclaimed, the users of this material will have to pay 25 per cent. for the raw product obtained from Great Britain. </para>

                    <para>.- Whilst I am willing to support the request submitted by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> for deferred duties on aluminium goods, I am somewhat apprehensive that the local factory may' not be in a position to begin supplying Australian requirements for these goods on the 1st January next. I foresee that during the next few months there may be a very great deal of activity on the part of American and German manufacturers to load up our market with supplies in anticipation of the heavy duties which it is proposed shall come into operation on the 1st January, 1922. In the circumstances, I intend to submit a request for the immediate imposition of duties of 5 and 15 per cent. in the intermediate and general columns respectively upon importations under sub-item a. In order that I may do so, it is necessary that the Minister should temporarily withdraw his request. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not like this practice of anticipating the establishment of industries. If a factory were already established, there might be some justification for imposing duties before the articles made dutiable were actually produced; but to give importers of goods notice that in 1922 heavy duties will be imposed upon them necessarily offers them an opportunity, and an invitation, to import such goods as fast as they can. </para>

                        <para>- Is it wise for us &gt;to adopt the system of deferred duties and give importers notice that we intend to impose them ? I desire 'to see the manufacture of aluminium good's carried on in Australia, as the material is used for the manufacture of the most useful and effective culinary utensils. Any importers who look at this proposal will know that it is intended in twelve months time to impose duties upon these goods, and they need be out of their money only a little while if they expend it in importing them in unlimited quantities. Then when the local factories do begin the manufacture of these goods, they will find the Australian market for them glutted. </para>

                    <para>. - The request which is now before honorable senators is that which we have been debating all the morning. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> supplied evidence that these goods are coming here from Switzerland, and we have grounds for suspecting that they are really coming from Germany. In the circumstances it has been thought well, before the proposed deferred duties become operative, to impose " duties upon foreign importations of these goods. The firm to which I have made reference intend to manufacture these goods in connexion with the manufacture of copper, brass, 'bronze, -zinc, and nickel goods. Their 'factory is already estimated to be worth £60;000, and it is the intention of the firm to spend another £60,000 in con,nexion with the manufacture of these aluminium goods. They expect, soon, to be able to go right ahead with- the development of the industry. Therefore, we propose to give them the necessary protection. "We do not want to tax the people of Australia until we are .in a position to provide for the whole of our own requirements from local sources, hence this special provision; but we will not hold the manufacturers up for the period stated. As soon as they are in a position to supply, we shall bring this provision into force. In the meantime, to prevent dumping, we impose the duty. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to draw the attention of .the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> and of -honorable senators to the fact that in the general Tariff we are asking for a duty of 15 per cent. After the 1st January next this may be. increased to 40 per cent., and against the British product there will then be a duty of 25 per cent. This is a very  heavy impost. In order to keep out what is believed to be the German product, we impose a duty of 15 per cent.; but after 1st January next, to keep out the British product, we are to have a duty of 25 per cent., and increase the general Tariff to 40 per cent. To be consistent with my attitude right through the debate on this schedule, I intend, before resuming my seat, to move for a reduction of the British Tariff fo 15 per cent. This is a. compromise on my principles, because I believe in free trade with Great Britain, and I hope that even Protectionists will see that, as this sub-item deals with the raw .material for the manufacture of aeroplanes, and -an enormous number of articles in domestic use, 15 per cent, against Great Britain is a pretty stiff Tariff. Were I to consider my own principles, I would move that the Tariff against Great Britain be free; but I realize that it would be hopeless to attempt to 'do that, because, apparently, honorable senators have no desire to deal with Great Britain on this basis. They are prepared to carry on the trade war. Very many other industries already established, and employing large numbers of men, may be affected by these new duties, which will have the effect of making their raw material dearer.

It appears to. me that if we impose a duty of 25 per cent. on the raw material, and if wire comes in at 10 per cent., business men will be keen enough to realize that by importing the wire and converting it for use in the other processes they will be getting their materials at the cheaper rate. </para>

Therefore, the duty will interfere with the manufacture locally of aluminium wire, which in sub-item b is listed at 10 per cent. If the Minister will include aluminium wire in the deferred duties at the same rate as- angles, bars, sheets,&amp;c., I shall be satisfied. </para>

Throughout the world, as a result of the war there are large stocks of scrap iron, and it is more than likely that much of it will be imported in large quantities to Australia. Therefore, it should bear the same duty as pig iron, because it is used for the same purpose. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - Whilst there may be good reason for lower duties against scrap iron from Great Britain than from outside countries, I do not know that we would be justified in absolutely shutting it out, because that will be the effect of the imposition of heavy duties as proposed, for the simple reason that scrap iron is very much used in the production of the raw material for the iron manufacturing industries. It is necessary to mix scrap and pig iron in order to produce raw material of really good quality-. Therefore, if we impose a duty on scrap-iron we shall, indirectly, be increasing the cost of the raw material to those engaged in our secondary iron industries, and to that extent reduce the amount of protection afforded to them. under other items in the schedule. Iron moulding shops were established throughout the Commonwealth long before the Lithgow or Newcastle steel works came into being, , and they have had to import scrap iron for mixing with pig iron even since then. I think some difference should be made in the duty, though on the spur of the moment I am not prepared to say what the difference should be. I do not wish to see any of our established industries placed at a disadvantage; but I think we will be making, a very great mistake indeed if we impose a heavy duty, as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.</inline> I think some consideration should be given to the importers of scrap iron. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> is not so prepared to fix a low rate of duty upon scrap iron, he ought to defer the further consideration of the item until he has an opportunity of looking into the matter.

                    <para>.- We are indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie for uttering a note of warning in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan's</inline> proposal. The schedule, as it has come before us, provides that scrap iron and steel, and materials for use as scrap iron, shall be admitted free, " as prescribed by departmental by-laws," and I fully anticipated that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> would give us some explanation as to why the Government placed this limitation upon the free import of these materials, The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> must have had something at the back of his mind when he added these words. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has probably suggested the reason. I thought' that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> would have moved to strike out the words " as prescribed by departmental by-laws.." Evidently he does not recognise what a great bearing they have upon the free admission of scrap iron. If it is essential for the maintenance of our industries that a certain proportion of scrap iron should be made use of, the free admission of the material would be helpful, and not prejudicial, to those industries. However, I would like some information from the Minister in reference to the form in which the item appears in the schedule. </para>

Hoskins Limited have forwarded a communication to honorable senators asking for a duty upon cast scrap iron equal to that imposed upon pig iron. Evidently they find that scrap iron comes into competition with their pig iron, and do not regard it as necessary for fluxing with the iron they produce from their own ore. If this should be the case, to be consistent we ought to place a duty on scrap iron. If the opposite is the case, we ought to be made aware of it. I know that some smelters have to be very careful in the choice of the different class of scrap iron they use, but I do not know whether or not it is necessary to import a certain amount of special iron in order to' flux it with the iron produced from our own ores. </para>

The 'billets are hammered out when they come from the furnace, and they form the material from which our- strongest axles are made. Within the last twelve months I have had the opportunity of inspecting an axle factory in South Australia, where all the scrap iron gathered in that State is used in the way I have described. For the purpose of making axles, it is found to be more valuable than any other form of iron. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lysaght,</inline> a local manufacturer of galvanized iron, told the InterState Commission that one of the contributing causes to the high cost of the article he is manufacturing was the price he had to pay for spelter, which was much cheaper in Great Britain than here. We know that an agreement has been made between the Commonwealth Government and the British Government whereby 50,000 tons of the material from which spelter is made is shipped annually  from  this country to Great Britain. If the British manufacturers are gaining an advantage by that bargain, we are evidently giving them too much preference, to our own disadvantage. In any case, if spelter can be brought out to Australia from the Old Country more cheaply than it can be produced here, surely it is a waste of effort to impose a high rate of duty on this raw material so indispensable in the manufacture of galvanized iron, thereby increasing its cost. </para>

Also Great Britain, which is buying this material from us, is a competitor with Australia in regard to the production of spelter, but we import a very limited quantity of this material. In fact, the total importations from all sources in 1919-20 did not exceed 4,940 cwt. </para>

                    <para>. -  I desire to draw the attention of the Committee to this item in so far as it affects one of the most important industries in Australia - important not only because of the number of men engaged in it, important not only because of its connexion with one of our basic industries, but important also because, if successful, it will very substantially affect the balance of trade in connexion with the excess of  our  exports over imports. I propose to place before the Committee the whole of the facts at my disposal, and to appeal to honorable senators, in the interests of fair play, to consider whether a slightly higher duty is not both justifiable and equitable. The statistics show that since 1915 the average yearly importation of galvanized sheet and corrugated iron has been about 47,500 tons. Before the war the quantity was somewhat greater. The statistics further show that the average f.o.b. value - that is to say, the Customs value of this 47,500 tons of imports since 1915  -  was about £50 per ton.We have not until this year produced much, if any, galvanized iron in commercial quantities. I believe that a few years ago a spasmodic attempt was made at Lithgow to produce galvanized iron, but that attempt died of sheer inanition and competition. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator  Will  make himself conversant with the facts, he will . find that that spasmodic attempt failed because of the want of a Tariff to give it life. If the whole of this galvanized iron, were made in Australia, it would mean, directly and indirectly, the employment of about 4,000 men, and so, averaging five persons to a family, would ?support a population .of 20,000 people. An output of 60,000 tons :a year would mean the .use of about -51,000 tons of blooms made by the Broken Hill. Proprietary Company, and 9,000. tons of zinc made ;by  the  Electrolytic Company carrying on operations in Tasmania. It will thus be seen that .the .industry is of very great importance to .the iron producing industry .and .the zinc companies here. It would mean, further, the consumption of a considerable quantity of sulphuric .acid. The whole df Australia's requirements in respect of galvanized iron df produced locally would be made  absolutely  by Australian workmen from all Australian products, and at an average ;price of £30 per ton would mean nearly £2,000,000 additional "values from primary production in Australia. </para>

I was glad that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> last night, in the course of the discussion upon black sheets, referred to the visit paid to Australia by very large manufacturers of galvanized iron at a time when that iron was both scarce .and dear, and could hardly be obtained for love or money for the protection of our wheat stacks. I understood the .honorable senator to make that statement, and to say that during 'that visit the question cropped up as to whether galvanized iron could not be made in considerable quantities in Australia. -If I understood the Minister rightly, conferences were held with the Wheat Board in regard to the manufacture of galvanized iron, and certain proposals were made, &gt;with .the result .that this visiting .firm .promised to .establish the industry here in a big way. </para>

                        <para>- But, in March, 1920, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> brought down a proposal to place upon galvanized iron &gt;a duty of £3 12s. per ton. I believe that since then this -firm has submitted to the Government its working costs, and has shown that this item, as compared with other items in the Tariff, covering the raw material which it must use, is not sufficient to enable it to carry on. A request was therefore made some months ago for an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 20 per cent, under the British preferential Tariff. Since then - and I draw special attention to this fact - there has been a great deflation in prices abroad. The best brands of galvanized iron at the beginning of this month were quoted at about £30 per ton f.o.b., and,, with respect to second-grade brands, I have here a quotation, so recent as 3rd August,, of £17 per ton for 18 gauge and £19 per ton for 24 gauge c.i.f. and e. Australian ports, and shipment probably within four or five weeks from receipt of the order; In. connexion with tie policy agreed upon with the Board of Trade, this firm has recently erected and completed one unit, of its galvanized-iron works, which has cost £400,000, inclusive of £70,000 spent on erecting seventy cottages for the workers. It has so rapidly developed the arrangement made with the Government that I am informed that, as and from 1st October next, it will be' in a position to turn out 2,000 tons of galvanized iron per month from this first unit alone. If it can carry on its operations at a reasonable profit, it is prepared to spend some hundreds of thousands of pounds more, and to make practically the whole of Australia's requirements of galvanized iron. I want to say quite frankly that, with the prices of the world's parity twelve months ago, this protection of £3 12s. per ton would. have been sufficient - in fact,, no protection at all would have been required. But the position is that when this firm was ready to start it found itself faced with the- fact, that it would have to pay £14 10s. per- ton for blooms to make into sheets- for galvanized iron, whereas prices abroad had fallen to £8 per ton., Thus there was, and is today, a difference of £6 10s. per ton. between the price paid for the Broken Hill Proprietary Company's blooms and the price which this firm's competitors: are paying- abroad for blooms for' the manufacture of the article ultimately to1 be imported. </para>

The firm is paying £14 10s. per ton today, as against £8 paid by their competitors, for the blooms for making sheets; £35 a ton for Australian zinc, as against £25 a ton abroad; and £5 10s. for acids, as against £3 10s. paid abroad. It will be seen at once that the duty of £3 12s. entirely disappears when we consider the firms position in relation to that of its competitors abroad. </para>

                        <para>- I am advocating protection for this industry, as .the first line of defence of the Commonwealth. I am sure the honorable senator will agree with General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Monash that we .must establish these key industries if we hope to do any good with even a trained Army. That is why I consistently- advocate that the key metal industries shall be adequately and fairly protected. And what is fair protection? If a duty which is equivalent, say, on a world's future parity of price, to 6d. per 6-foot sheet, is. imposed in order to preserve the industry, it will not mean 6d. per 6-foot sheet, or a Id. a foot on galvanized iron according to length, to the' galvanized iron manufacturer, but, so far as I have been able to, work out the figures, it will mean 2d. a sheet to the Broken Hill industry in- view of the duties that have been passed by this Committee. It will mean 2d. a sheet to the zinc industry, k .view of the item we passed a few minutes ago, and there will remain to this very important galvanized iron industry a real protection of only 2d. per sheet. I think that, in accordance with other items in the Tariff, in regard to which 25 per cent, duties have been unhesitatingly ' passed by the Committee as fair protection to the manufacturers of metal, a fair thing would be a British preferential duty of 25 per cent. Therefore, I propose to move that in lieu of the duties at present in the schedule there be substituted duties of 25 per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per cent., on and after the 1st November. That will bring this item into line with other items passed by the Committee, and will also provide more reasonable duties in the peculiar circumstances of this- industry. There is no reason to doubt that if this industry had been established during the war it would have saved the consumers of galvanized iron nearly £20 per ton. I have pointed out how the average imports of galvanized iron into this country from 1915 have averaged over £50 per ton f.o.b. value. Honorable senators know as well as I do that, owing to the shortage of supplies from England, the profiteering by American importers or manufacturers, and to short supplies getting into the hands of speculators, the retail price rocketed sky high. The establishment of this industry will prevent a repetition of this sort of thing - there will have to be paid out of the slight protection I ask, Inter-State freight from Newcastle all round the coast-the position will be stabilized, and the whole of its processes will be carried out by Australian workmen with Australian material. If the industry develops, as I hope and believe it will, it will be able to sustain an extra population here of 20,000 persons. I move - </para>

                        <para>- The industry developed in New South Wales under the able management of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford,</inline> and when the retail price in the country was £17 a ton - and many a ton I bought at that price - he was still able to compete and keep going. When the iron masters became favoured with such a degree of protection as not to be compelled to worry about outside competition, they turned) their thoughts to the question of how to make the most money for the least expenditure' upon material and labour. And, since it appeared to them that there was more in the production of other varieties of iron products than in galvanized iron, they no longer manufactured the latter commodity. I take it, at any rate, that some consideration of the kind moved them. If, however, they, had been able to make a success of the production of galvanized iron at £17 a ton, what kind of a wicket would they have been on when the price was £30 a ton ? During the war the quotation actually reached £80. Six months ago the price in Sydney was about £66 per ton! </para>

                        <para>- If the Minister for Defence were a commercial traveller for a firm of galvanized iron manufacturers, he would be rushed with orders in this very chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> remarked that, if the industry had been established and .properly assisted 1 to reach a flourishing output before the war, users of galvanized iron in Australia would have been saved the enormous charges for imported galvanized iron throughout the war years. I. am trying to imagine the situation. A firm sets out, somewhere in Australia, to produce galvanized iron. It is given practical encouragement, either by means of a bounty or high protective duties. - I ask honorable senators next to try to imagine the firm returning good for the good done to it by expressing practical sympathy with users of galvanized iron, and refusing to take the opportunity to sell their product at £80 a ton, but demanding only £50 for it. In the course of my Ministerial experience during the early months of the war, when it was my task to supervise the purchase of far more goods than ever <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has been concerned with in the whole of his successful business career, I found that the Australian manufacturer who was not eager to charge the Government to the absolute limit of possibilities, was an emphatic exception to the rule. I dare say that it would be impossible to find a more generous and philanthropic gentleman than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> I invite honorable senators to follow me in delineating a mental picture. I am now imagining <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> as the head of a galvanized iron industry which has been nursed and protected and encouraged to a state of unquestioned success. A world conflict intervenes, and the price for imported galvanized iron rises enormously. At this stage my imagination fails me. I cannot visualize <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> in the act of refusing to avail himself of an opportunity to sell his local product at the highest price he can secure. I fail altogether to imagine him saying that, in view of the severe financial pressure brought to bear upon the. people, it is his large-hearted policy to decline to sell his galvanized iron for £80 a ton. I cannot imagine the manager of a factory informing his directors that, in view of the stress under which the public are suffering, he has decided to sell the firm's galvanized iron for £50, although he knows that the ruling price for such of the commodity as can be imported is £80. One thing that I can see mentally, however, is an advertisement appearing  in the next day's newspapers inviting applications for a new manager.. The public never look for such unbusinesslike philanthropy. They have had to deal with hard-headed business men, who have based their fortunes upon the practice of buying their raw material as cheaply as possible, and selling their finished products for as much as they can get ; in doing which - by the way - I have never blamed them, and never will. It is absurd, therefore, for successful business men such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> to endeavour to persuade this Committee that, had the galvanized iron industry been inaugurated and fostered and brought to a state of flourishing success in Australia, prior to the war, the users of galvanized iron would have signally benefited. Is it reasonable to suggest that, in those hypothetical circumstances, the business ideals of the men at the back of the industry would have changed ?  I recall that, with respect to those industries and minor activities which the. Government partially controlled, permitting only portion of the output to be devoted to the supply of the public demand, the manufacturers made fortunes. I, as the responsible Minister at the time, was glad to see those people doing so well. However, I cannot possibly accept the. argument advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> One cannot be a business man and a philanthropist at the same time. I recognise, of course, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has had much more experience of business men than I have had. He must know their good qualities better than I do,, for my experience has been merely that of a unit in the general community. That is. the reason why I. say that, even had the galvanized iron industry been established before the war, and encouraged to prosperity by a bounty or high protective duties, the men who put their money into it would not have proved the type of philanthropist depicted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> but would have got the last penny possible for the last ton produced. </para>

                    (Western Australia). [3.55]. - I agree with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>
                    that neither
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline>
                    nor any other business man in the community is entirely an altruist. Commercial men are out to make as much profit as they can; and as a rule they are not too particular concerning where the profits come from, or respecting the consequences to the individuals who pay. I have been looking, hitherto in vain, for some word to be uttered in this Chamber by, or in behalf of, business altruists to indicate that they have any real feeling for the men and women who are developing this continent. As I predicted, and confidently expected, honorable senators from New South Wales have once more demanded an even higher degree of protection for a New South Wales industry than was imposed elsewhere. Those honorable senators now solemnly state that the galvanized iron industry must be given more protection on account of the higher protection afforded in connexion with the raw material They argue that, because they were responsible for placing an iniquitous duty on pig iron and similar primary products, a little bit more must now be added to the protective rates upon galvanized iron. I feel almost in despair because I am convinced that the Government will, accept this latest request. They will apparently agree to any increase which any Protection-fanatic may care to propose. The great majority of. the members of the Senate have gone Protection-mad.

                    <para>- I have: looked in vain for it. The latest proposition is to add to the more than necessarily high duty of 72s. imposed upon builders of iron homes, and sheds', and water tanks by making the rates respectively 2.5 per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per. cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> If: the price of galvanized iron is £50 a ton., those rates will involve the collection of duties-, not of 72s., 90s., and 110s. respectively, but £12, £15, and £17 per ton. If the quotation should be £30 a ton, the rates will equal £8 British, £10 intermediate, and £12 general Tariff per ton. Is the request reasonable? Can reasonable legislators be asked to accede to it? Will even the high protectionist artists in, the Government accept it? The request amounts positively to. a prohibition. The effect will be to permit one firm carrying on in. Australia to secure a virtual monopoly of a commodity used by every class of Australian in every corner' of the Commonwealth. I raise my voice particularly in the interests of the man in the back-blocks. Tanks manufactured from this material are used extensively by primary producers. Notwithstanding all these facts, I look in vain for any indication from the Committee that these people are to receive the fair deal to which they are entitled: </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>SenatorBolton.  -  But you have secured a reduction in the duty on wire. </para>
                <para>SenatorDRAKE-BROCKMAN. - Yes; a generous reduction of 8s per ton, , which is to be counteracted by increasing the duty on galvanized iron to the extent of £12 per ton. I again appeal to the  Governmentshopeless'  though it may be - to adhere to the duties appearing in the schedule and to take up the same attitude in. connexion- with this request as they have adopted in connexion with those for decreased duties. I. do not expect the members of this Committee to have any regard for the poor unfortunate men in the back-blocks, who, in many instances, are struggling on under adverse circumstances; but I trust that the appeal that I am despairingly making will meet with some consideration from the Government. </para>

                    <para>. -The pitiful appeal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> has interested me, and one would imagine that he alone was able to form an opinion as to whether a duty was right or wrong. Does the honorable senator contend that he is the only one in this Chamber who has the interests of the primary producer at heart? He declares that he despairs of getting anything and, so far, appears to think that he is the only one who can see the light, and that the rest of us walk in darkness. The attitude of the honorable senator reminds me of the old lady who, on seeing her son drilling, said; that the whole regiment were out of step with the exception of her Jock. Those who advocate increased duties may, in the opinion of the honorable senator, be " out of step " ; but we believe we are doing what is right. I also wish to remind the honorable senator that the majority rule; and an overwhelming proportion of Commonwealth electors are in favour of effective protection being given to Australian industries. It has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> that he has listened in vain for a. word or two to be said on behalf of those who have to use the iron. I intend to support the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> in the interests of those people. Let us recall the happenings of the last few years, and consider the position in which the unfortunate primary producers were placed, when, owing to a shortage of iron, tens of thousands of tons of wheat were ruined by inclement weather, owing to the necessary covering not being available. In many instances it was impossible to obtain adequate supplies, because we were depending upon the manufacturers in other countries, when we should 'have been able to call on our own producers. It is fair to assume that, had this industry been firmly established ten years ago, the Australian primary producers would have escaped a good deal of suffering, expense, , and hardship, and tens of thousands of tons  of  wheat would have been saved. The changing world conditions necessitate provision being made for the local manufacture of an article so widely used, and which is an absolute necessity to the primary producers. I do not believe that the manufacturers are philanthropists. They are out for profit; but they will not be able to charge unreasonable prices, because the proposed Tariff Board will be able to watch  and  closely scrutinize their profits. I am prepared to give the manufacturers an opportunity of making fair interest on the capital they have invested, but nothing more. This is an established and growing industry, and within a few years will insure that we shall not be faced with the calamitous happenings of the past, when we experienced a serious shortage. Even without any local production we might be able to obtain all the galvanized iron we require for  the  next-five or ten years. We could do without our factories. We could dismiss the men working for good wages and maintaining their wives and families, and force them into other avenues; but the. day would come again, as it did in the, past, when we would be depending on overseas markets for our supplies, and these would again fail us. That would happen if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman's</inline> advice were followed. I trust the proposal submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> will be adopted. I know that people have been asked to contribute something in order that this industry may be firmly established; but the benefit to be derived will be worth the outlay, and by assisting to develop the galvanized-iron industry on a sound basis we shall be in a position to supply our own requirements at a reasonable price, and be entirely  independent  of outside manufacturers. </para>

                    <para>. - The present discussion supplies one of those examples of possible happenings which I had the distinction of prophesying during the early stages of this discussion. Here is a proposal for increased duties, submitted in the most modest way, that is positively outrageous in  its  essence. I do not know what honorable senators  are  thinking of. We  are  in an atmosphere in which  the  tendency appears to be  that the  higher  the  duty  the  more normal  the  proposition. I do  not  wonder at  the  request. I do  not blame those who are submitting these requests; but this is the high-water mark of bare-faced' effrontery. That may be considered strong language, but, in my opinion, it is very moderate. What is the price of galvanized iron to-day? Quite recently I purchased iron in the Western State and paid £27 for half a ton. What impression does that carry? Here is a quotation from a Melbourne wholesale house. What does it convey? I have before me the <inline font-style="italic">Hardware and Machinery J</inline><inline font-style="italic">Journal,</inline> a publication devoted principally to the interests of the hardware trade. It contains quotations for sundry brands of this particular commodity. " Orb " brand is quoted in Sydney at £50 per ton. </para>

                        <para>- 4th July, 1921. The. prices in Melbourne, Adelaide, and Brisbane respectively are £47 10s., £48. and £48. This is the publication that did not hesitate to severely criticise the manner in which the members of this Parliament dealt with the ' Tariff. I do not blame this publication, because it is conceived in an atmosphere where there is always a demand to reach out further and still further. Persons interested in business have- an insatiable desire to get hold of what they consider are their just dues, which sometimes are most extraordinary. But I want a square deal for the users of this material. Those who are responsible for 'the publication of this journal had the hardihood to attack the members of Parliament because considerable time has been devoted to dissecting every proposal in the -Tariff. What does the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> amount to? It is £17 10s. per ton. Is not the honorable senator ashamed to ask for that? Even allowing for a reduction in prices to the neighbourhood of £40, which we may not reach for some time - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> underestimated the position completely - it means an increase of from £10 to £17 per ton. It is a wonder the honorable senator does not blush. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator wants to run him back to the stage of the bark humpy. He wants to compel him to live in a habitation of bags and bark. How can he afford to pay £40 per ton for galvanized iron? Let honorable senators bear in mind that by the time the article reaches the interior of the country, its cost will be in the neighbourhood of £70 per ton'. Where is the prospect of any reduction in price? Yet we have this request made with the idea of fostering the manufacture of the article in Australia. The proposal is so preposterous that it is difficult for one to restrain himself when trying to discuss it. Here is a. request for a duty of no less than £17 per ton' on galvanized iron, with a prospect of its reduction to £10 per ton. The Government proposal is that the duties should range from 72s. to 110s. per ton. Those duties are sky-high compared with the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission. It is true that the Commission made its recommendation just as we were entering upon the war. Its proposals were moderate compared even with those of the Government, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> betters all previous efforts by proposing a duty of £17 pelton. In common with other honorable senators, I have received an appeal from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lysaght</inline> for an increased duty. I do not imagine that he could have expected that such a request would be made as that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has put before us. I am inclined to believe that if he knew of this request he would be disposed to say of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> " Save me from my friend ! " This request for increased duties is put forward, as similar requests have been in the past, on the plea that we require protection against the cheap labour of other countries. Let us see what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lysaght</inline> himself had to say about the wages paid in the manufacture of. this particular commodity in the Old Country. At page 93 of the report of the Inter-State Commission' on Iron and Steel, it will be found that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lysaght</inline> said, in connexion with wages :  - </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it was; and the suggestion is that Australian wages and conditions have gone sky-high, whilst wages and conditions in the Old Country have remained at a stand-still. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> mean to say that? He will not attempt to do so, because he has some respect for his reputation for veracity. I have stated the wages and conditions obtaining in the industry in the Old Country in 1914 on the authority of the man who is directly interested in this industry, and who is making a plea for increased protection. He showed that his competitors in the industry at that time had no advantage over him in the matter of wages. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> want anything more convincing? I ask that question, although the honorable senator has tripped across the chamber, and blindly voted for increased duties time after time. Are we to tell <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lysaght,</inline> as we have told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Delprat</inline> and other iron masters, that he does not know his own business ? That is what we shall do, even if we support the proposal of the Government. So far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> request is concerned, all I can say is that if we have any pretence to sanity, any sense of fair dealing, any desire to hold the balance with equal poise between different sections of the community, or any regard for the interests of the people to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> referred, who do the pioneering work of this country, and are without a voice here, we shall scout such a proposal as a duty of £17 per ton on galvanized iron. We should resist even the proposal of the Government, because on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lysaght's</inline> own showing, so far as the difference in wages and conditions in the Old Country is concerned, he does' not require the protection offered. Honorable senators may blindly follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> lead or that of the Government, but I want to know where I am going before I follow the lead of any Government or any individual. I have to bear in mind the effect which a vote cast in this chamber will have upon those men who are pioneering far afield. I am afraid that my, plea may be regarded merely as a voice in the wilderness, but I hope that honorable senators will reject <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> request, will deal with this matter on common-sense lines, and will be prepared to pare down even the proposal of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I think so. I also mentioned that later, when there was  a slump in the market 'and prices had fallen, on .the '3rd August another firm of brokers in Sydney quoted galvanized iron, cold rolled, close annealed, soft working up quality, as before the war - this was plain galvanized iron - :18-gauge, at £17 , per ton, -with variations in price according to .gauge, up to 24-igauge .at £19 per ton, c-i.f. and e., main Australian ports, sight draft basis. Now that he has heard these figures, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will absolve me from taking up what I admit would have been an extreme attitude, and asking for a duty of £17, or even of £10, per ton on galvanized iron. He will see -by the last figures I have quoted that on those prices .a duty of "25 per cent, would represent practically '£5 per ton. <inline font-weight="bold">-Senator Lynch.</inline> - What would the iron quoted at £33 per ton cost, landed, including charges? </para>

                        <para>- It would depend entirely on the freight, and of course the freight would put some pounds per ton on to the price. I remind the honorable senator that recently prices fell so rapidly in England that within three or four weeks after the first quotation there was another quotation for a different brand of iron, which was equal to 40 per cent, less than the first. </para>

                    <para>As . you have been good enough to interest yourself in the duty on galvanized iron, I am writing to let you know that after carefully going into our costs at Newcastle we find that the proposed duty of £3 12s. per ton will not be sufficient to enable us to profitably carry on the industry, and unless a higher duty .is imposed we shall, most reluctantly, be compelled to shut down our works. It should be sufficient, I think, to mention .that to-day's price for English sheet bars is £8 per ton, and spelter, £25 10s per ton, ' while we pay £14 15s. 6d. per ton, and £35 per ton respectively for these -materials. In addition, wages, acid, muriate, water, and rolls are also considerably higher here' than in England. At the time we decided to put down our works here, the slump in metal prices in England, on the Continent, and in America, was never anticipated, nor the fact that wages in these places would be . so drastically reduced. Had we considered this likely to come about, we should have deferred taking any steps until we had received assurance that an adequate duty would be imposed. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened, with a good deal of interest to the remarks made by Senators Lynch and Pratten. During the war the Government, through the medium of the Wheat Board, were the heaviest importers of galvanized iron in the Commonwealth. At one stage it was impossible to secure this commodity from Great Britain; although it was urgently needed to deal with the mice plague in, connexion with our wheat stacks. Our lowest price for very poor quality iron was £55' 10s. per" ton. The iron which we were getting from America,, allegedly first quality, was not within 10 per' cent, or 12' per cent, equal in value to the ordinary British product. Subsequently, the Board of Trade made an investigation into the question, of encouraging the manufacture of galvanized iron in Australia. Ocean freights were then so high that practically nobody could reasonably ask for protection; but it. was decided to- recommend a bounty of £2 per ton to local manufacturers. Since then there has been- a- considerable increase in the cost, of production, and the Government met the- position by increasing the protection to £3 12s. Shortly after the armistice travellers representing firms all over the world were in. Australia offering galvanized iron- for delivery in three months* at £32 12s. Though there has been. an. increase in- the cost of local production, L do not think we would be justified in accepting the requested amendment proposed; by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> In the development of. these great industries it is advisable, that, we should come together industrially and. exchange confidences as to all aspects of the position. I have met quite a number of those interested in. the industry during and since the war period. They have- always-- been candid in the expression of their views, and prepared to give the- fullest information" in connexion with their businesses. Nearly all of them have honestly endeavoured to redeem the promises made to the Board of Trade. There have, of course, been, complaints about the rising costs, and probably no harm would result from a fuller inquiry into the position. We  want the industry, to be well established in the Commonwealth,, because its successful development will . mean a great, deal, especially to people living in country districts, where it is so largely used for roofing purposes. Judging by the tone of the debate to-day, I think that the Government proposal represents the happy medium of the- two extremes ; but if those engaged in the business make application a fuller inquiry may be made into the whole of the circumstances of the industry. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily. There is a provision in another measure under which the question of reasonable profits may be remitted to the Tariff Board for inquiry. Obviously, no one will establish a business of this nature without the prospect of getting a fair return upon his- capital. We do not begrudge that, but we do begrudge giving away millions of public money by means of tie Tariff duties if they are not required for. the protection, of. local industry. I shall bring the matter under the notice of the Minister for Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> on his return, and recommend sympathetic consideration. At present I do not feel justified in agreeing to any increase&gt; or reduction of the duty on. this item. </para>

                    <para>. - I merely want to say a few words by way of reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> own statement volunteered to. the Committee. He suggested, in his own way; that what I had said was far from being, in the region of truth, and I take his own statement, which is the best he can furnish, to buttress my case. In support of his plea for this duty he said that the British price for galvanized iron was £33 f.o.b. at some recent date. All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> has to do in order to ascertain tie duty - and he knows this as well as I. do - is to. add to that quotation the statutory 10. per cent.- which the Customs Department; insist upon, and he will find that with c.i.f. charges the price- would be £39 per bon. At that rate, a Tariff, of. 35 per cent, would represent a duty of £13. Then he quoted another class of galvanized iron, not of the same specification, and", therefore, it had nothing to do with the case at all. I am taking his own figures, and, on his own showing, his proposal would mean a protective duty, of over £13 per ton. My statement was that at the utmost it would represent a duty of £17, with the possibility of dwindling down to £10 per ton. The average will be in the region of £13, as I. told the Committee, though the honorable senator1 has suggested that in making this statement I was playing loosely with the truth.  His  own figures prove that the duty payable, under his requested amendment, would be £13 per ton. I need only remind him that if he will take the figures in the publication to which I have already referred, he will find that the present selling price for, the most popular brand of galvanized iron used throughout the country is £50 per ton, and that with the f .o.b. charges, the landed cost will be in the neighbourhood of 'the figure T stated, if not a bit more. Instead of telling the Senate in his pedantic way that I was wrong, he needs to revise his own figures, and show, if he can, that with f.o.b. charges added, it would be less than £30 per ton. If he can do that, I shall feel inclined to vote for his request. But I am sure he cannot do that. I stick to my original statement that his proposal means anything from a duty of £17 to £10 per ton in the immediate future. On his own showing it means £13 per ton. He cannot deny it. </para>

                    <para>. - I point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has been quoting a rate in the schedule that is not effective in connexion with this duty. The effective duty will be the 25 per cent. British. I think I showed" conclusively that the average duty under my proposed amendment would probably be about £5 per ton on the British product.' I listened with interest to the statement made by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell).</inline> I have no desire to press my request to a division, but I have a very earnest desire that the industry shall not be compelled to close down. That was my reason for_ bringing this matter before the Committee. It is quite obvious, I think, tha£ if this industry is giving away 2d. per sheet to the makers of iron' that' is used to roll  the sheets, it is giving an equivalent of 2d. per sheet to the zinc producers of Australia, in both cases, as an extra price. The two together amount to more than the duty proposed by the Government on galvanized iron; Instead of camouflaging talk about establishing industries, we ought to speak the truth, and admit that the galvanized-iron industry cannot live under present circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, most deliberately, with the idea of later on putting the duty on galvanized iron upon a proper basis. If I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> properly the Government are sympathetic towards the continuance of the galvanized-iron industry at Newcastle, and are anxious that those persons who have invested their capital in it - the amount already spent is £400,000 - shall get a fair return from their expenditure, and that if it can be proved that they are not getting this, an endeavour will be made, by means of a bounty or otherwise, to devise some form of help whereby a fair return upon capital invested can be earned by the industry in question. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who, for the moment, is in charge of the Senate, will confirm this. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that that would be very close to the wholesale selling price. For five years past galvanized iron has not been sold in Australia within £20 of the price mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Pratten;</inline> and, although the  war has been over for three years, no one is able to buy galvanized iron at under £50 per ton. In fact, within the last  three months I paid £66 per ton for some. I bought at Anthony Hordern's, in 'Sydney. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> wants <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties, so that the higher the price of the article the more duty the importer will bo expected to pay. I wonder how the Protectionist <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> would like to see <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties imposed upon newsprint. My idea of fixing a duty is to make the impost lighter the dearer the commodity becomes, so that people may get it at the cheapest possible price. I hope that the Government will oppose <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates, which have the effect of making the amount of duty payable go up or down, according to how the market is arranged. In any case, an aci <inline font-style="italic">valorem</inline> rate is a dangerous form of protection to the manufacturer. A fixed rate assures him that, although he will get no increased protection, the rate will not be decreased. </para>

                    <para>. - I have already pointed out that one of our great difficulties has been our lack of tinned plate, particularly during the war, when we managed to draw some supplies from Wales and America, but only at a price which was ten times the pre-war cost. We had at the time all sorts of foodstuffs badly required by the Allies, but could not send them away because we had not supplies of tinned plate. No matter how much we may desire to help Great Britain as our Motherland, we are not in a position to render her all the help we could give her in- time of war unless we have the tinned plate industry established in Australia. An army travels ' on its stomach; and, though I sincerely hope that .we will never have to face another war, we must look at this matter from our own defence point of view. Naturally, it will need a greater effort to establish this industry in- a country with a population of only 5,000,000 people than is required in a country with a market of 50,000,000. persons ; but a start has already been made in Australia with an experimental plant at Newcastle. The existence of establishments in Australia capable of supplying merchants and packers with tinned plate at a reasonable-  price would be of considerable benefit to those engaged in. the export trade. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. Many advantages would be derived from the tinned plate industry.. For one thing, it would provide a local market for our tin miners. Likewise there would be a good market for the manufacturer of tinned plates, because we. produce sheep and mutton which could be tinned for export, and we could also increase our export of tinned fruits, and, possibly, engage in the trade of tinning preserved vegetables. We have only a limited market for tinned plate, and. I do not think we can hope to develop a big export trade ; but if by means of this duty we can establish an industry that will supply our own requirements and provide us with reserves to meet emergencies, we shall do well. I ask honorable senators not. to treaty the item as affecting only one trade. It is of the utmost importance to the packing and canning industry. With ample supplies of tinned plate during the war we could have sent away much larger quantities of tinned foods than we were able to do. -I find' that during the war period tinned plates went up to £8 per box of 100 sheets, 28 inches x 14 inches. That was an extraordinarily high price, and it was sufficient practically to keep us out of the world's markets when we had to compete with supplies of tinned preserves from California and elsewhere. It is estimated' that tinned plate is now bringing about £45 per ton. I shall, confirm that information later on, But, if it is correct, honorable senators will recognise that a duty of 76s. per ton is not a very heavy impost. </para>

                    <para>.- This is one of the items in the Tariff concerning which much care must be exercised by the Government. It provides that, on and. after 1st January next, duties of 76s., 95s., and 115s. per ton shall come into operation in respect of tinned plate, which is absolutely essential to the industries of Australia that pack our. surplus products' for export. Those surplus products have to compete with the exports of other countries, and consequently care must be taken not. to impose duties that will place any handicap on the Australian canners. I gather from the observations made by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> that we are not producing tinned plate or sheet in Australia, but that he is hopeful that we shall be able to do so. There is a clause in the Bill which gives the Minister for Trade and Customs power to extend the date on which a deferred duty shall come into. operation, if he is satisfied that the article to which it relates is not being produced here. I think we should go further, and give him such a power where he is convinced that the commodities covered- by deferred duties are not being " satisfactorily produced here." </para>

I rose chiefly to point out that if any differentiation is to be made it should be in respect of the pipes of small diameter, particularly those used for irrigation purposes.I should like to know what is the position of the industry engaged in the manufacture of these pipes in Australia. I know that the class of pipes used in Western Australia are largely if not. entirely imported, and if there is no immediate prospect of their manufacture here it is a short-sighted policy to impose a duty. </para>

                    <para>. - The class of pipe dealt with in sub-item a is in general use for mining purposes. The mining industry is in a low state to-day. Why, then, should the Government seek to injure it still more by increasing the cost of pipes imported from Great Britain after the 1st January next ? I understand that the manufacture of these tubes or pipes has not been undertaken in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The reverse of that argument was advanced when the Committee was dealing with the, duties upon pig iron. I guarantee that if a vote were taken of the people of Australia, fully 80 per cent. would favour freedom of trade with Great Britain. Still, the Government will persist in imposing a rate of 27½ per cent.. It is virtually the imposition of a fine of £27 10s. upon every person who dares to trade with his Motherland to the extent of £100 worth of goods. What kind of loyalty is that? Will the Government accept a compromise if I amend my request to the effect that the British Tariff be 15 per cent. ? </para>

                    <para>. - With all due respect to the Minister I cannot quite agree with him when he says that these articles are all made in Australia. All we use are not made here, as is proved by the fact that the Fremantle municipality recently required some rails, and as these could not be obtained from Newcastle;, they had to be imported from Great Britain. The class of rails required by the municipality is not the class regarded by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company as that which Fremantle ought to use. The particular class of rail that is required is not manufactured in Australia, but the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, with all the arrogance of monopolists, have, as I say, laid down what they consider the standard that should be adopted. The class of rail required is the grooved, which is the British rail. It is perfectly true that when it was discovered by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> that this particular class of rail is not made in Australia, he allowed, as a matter of grace, a consignment to come in free of duty. There is, however, no guarantee that he will do likewise on every occasion, nor is there any guarantee that as sane a Minister will always be in charge of the Department. I am not suggesting that the Minister for Trade and Customs is altogether sane in submitting these extremely high duties, but on that particular occasion he did take a reasonable attitude. What we require in Australia is the opening up of the country, and an absolute essential for this is railways. The more cheaply we can construct railways the better, as I am sure honorable senators, including even Senators Pratten and Duncan, the high priests of high Protection, will agree. There has been an increase in this duty from 17s. 6d. per ton, in the case of Great Britain, to 35s., or 100 per cent., and in the general Tariff there has been an increase from 25s. to 75s., or 300 per cent. This means another tax on the development of Australia. If these high duties were serving any useful purpose there might be something in the arguments of the high Protectionist. But in the case of a recent tender, the price submitted by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company was £20 10s. per ton, and the freight from Newcastle to Fremantle added another £3, making the total price £23 10s. per ton, while the price of the successful tenderer in Great Britain was £16 7s. 6d. per- ton, plus £1 15s. duty, making the total price £18 2s. 6d. per ton. We have not, therefore, afforded that protection to our Australian industry which some honorable senators desire. All we have succeeded in doing is to make it more expensive for Governments and private companies to construct railways for developmental purposes. That being so, what is the object of this duty? I am sure the Government do not desire to obtain revenue from the States in this way. These duties are imposed, I presume, to protect an Australian industry; but, according to the most recent contracts let, they have completely failed to do so. In order to afford that protection to the Australian company which some honorable senators consider necessary, the British preferential duty would have to be increased to83s. per ton, and I do not think that any one contemplates doing that. As the proposed duty of 35s. per ton is useless for the purpose for which it is imposed, I move - </para>

                    has said, development in many parts of the Commonwealth has been retarded owing to the excessive cost of rails used for railways and', tramways,, which are necessary for developing certain areas. A few weeks ago, when evidence was being taken by the Tasmanian, Public Works Committee while inquiring- into the advisableness of connecting a very rich agricultural area with the main- line by a light line of railway,, the Engineer-in-Chief of the State put the whole position in a nutshell when he said -

                    <para>The cost of 40-lb. rails before the war was f6. 10s. per ton,, f.o.b. English port; and today rails from the Broken Hill Proprietary Company cost f 17 per ton at port of shipment. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The difference between the two prices proves conclusively that the development of Australia is being retarded. The activities of State Governments are controlled by the funds at their disposal, and in Tasmania, where the contour of the country is such that railway construction is expensive, development has been hampered owing to the excessive cost of steel rails. The 40-lb. rail has been used extensively in Tasmania; but on some of the more important lines the lighter rails have now been replaced by those of a heavier weight. The development of our timber areas has also been retarded; because light rails are also required there for tramways. By the duties proposed in the Tariff, those portions of the Commonwealth in which light rails can be. successfully used will be penalized because the higher duty is imposed on the lighter rails. I do not think I can go as far as. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> who advocates a reduction of the British duty to 17s. 6d. per ton,' because we have to consider the industry which has already-been established on a firm basis.

I believe it would be possible for the  in  dusty to be profitably conducted with lower British preferential duties than those proposed.

                        <para>- It may be for a time; but the object of Protective duties is to secure the establishment of industries in Australia, and when they are established here we can control them. Honorable senators should recognise that if they destroy an Australian industry, those who use its products will have to depend on foreign manufactures for their supplies, and we have no control over foreign manufacturers. If 'honorable senators destroy the Australian industry for the manufacture of steel rails, our State Governments, private contractors, and mine-owners will have to depend upon some foreign manufacturer, over whom we have no control, for the steel rails they require. Our people can control the local manufacturer, and if they do not do so the fault is their own. If local manufacturers charge exorbitant prices, it is within the power of Parliament to control their prices. I want to see all these industries established in Australia. I am optimistic ' enough to believe that before very long the people of the Commonwealth will insist upon having the power - and so long as they had it they would never need to exercise it - to prevent the exploitation of the consumer by local manufacturers because of the advantage given to them by protection against importers. </para>

                        <para>- - The honorable senator is referring to the total output. I -am speaking of rails under 50 lbs. in weight. I am1 most concerned about rails of 25 lbs. weight. ' They are generally used, though some mining propositions use  1'2-lb. rails. The 25-ib. rail is very much used for mining and timber-getting. If the company has the machinery installed, and is in 'a position to undertake the manufacture df these light rails, I am prepared to ask the users of the rails, for the present, to make some sacrifices in order to build up the industry. I have no hope that these steel rails will be manufactured m Tasmania', but I contend that if the New, South Wales works are closed up, Tasmania will have to depend -upon some one in Great Britain, America, or somewhere else, to manufacture the rails she requires. I do not desire to see Tasmania or Australia placed in such a position. I am prepared to ask the people of my own 'State to pay a little more if necessary at the present time for the steel rails they require in order that this Australian industry may be maintained, in the full hope that the time will come when these rails will be manufactured in plenty in Australia, and at a reasonable price. </para>

If I may say so, I think there are many items in the schedule which lend themselves to the "greasing of the fat pig." In ninety-nine cases out of one hundred, the heavier steel rails included in sub-item a are purchased .by Governments on behalf of the taxpayers of the different States, and .the burden is thrown on the whole community. The lighter rails, which are used for developmental purposes in mining, in vineyards, in wine cellars, and by .the .smaller industries, .are purchased by .private persons, who, under this schedule, will be called upon to pay the higher rates of duty. </para>

                        <para>- Then why not submit duties on the same basis? The Government are asking for the higher duties on the lighter rails.. I think that is wrong. We should strive to secure, as nearly as possible, a scientific Tariff that will be fair to all. That cannot be said of a Tariff which imposes heavier charges upon the individual than upon the community at large. We have just been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> that in Tasmania rails under 50 lbs. in weight are very exten.sively used. Why should Tasmania be called upon to pay more for steel rails required for its development than is charged to other States using rails weighing an extra 10 lbs. In Western Australia, in light sandy country lighter rails can be used, and why should Western Australia be charged 10s. per ton more in the shape of duty on steel rails than South Australia, where, to cope with the heavy hills traffc, 100-lb. rails are used? I should be very sorry to be understood as desiring to do anything which would prevent the progress of the iron industry in Australia. Rather than do so, I should prefer to err on the side of supporting a high duty to assist its progress. The discrimination in the duties imposed on steel rails', according to their weight, will not influence the development of this industry in New South Wales, and it is my intention to move a request to make the duties the same on sub-items  a  and  b. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> has just intimated his intention to move in the direction I originally suggested when I directed attention to the different duties proposed on steel . rails of different weights. An arbitrary line is drawn at rails weighing 50 lbs. per yard and over, and an extra tax is imposed upon the users of 45-lb. rails. I know of branch lines in this country, run by private enterprise over a distance or 145 miles, which are laid with 45-lb. rails. Such lines will be subjected to a very serious tax under this ill-balanced proposal of the Government. Why ' should users of rails weighing 50 lbs. per yard and over be able to secure their requirements for 10s. per ton less than those who use rails of 45 lbs. per yard will be called upon to pay? I support the contention of previous speakers, that this discrimination is really a ta* upon production. It is a tax upon development, and .a heavier tax upon those engaged in private enterprises than upon the community as a whole. </para>

                        <para>- It should not be forgotten that the development of a State does not depend entirely on public effort. The, development, particularly of the younger States, possessing huge territories, depends as much upon private enterprise as upon State enterprise. As timber and mining resources are becoming exhausted, those exploiting them must go further afield. Why should they be called upon under this schedule to pay an extra duty if they use the lighter rails ? Some branch lines in the State I know most about, .Western Australia, extend for over 130 miles, and the extra duty on the lighter rails in such cases will involve considerable extra expenditure. The proposal to impose an extra duty of 10s. per ton on the lighter rails represents a direct tax on private and State enterprise requiring the lighter rails for development purposes. I shall be prepared to support the request of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> has given notice, to make the duties the same on sub-items  a  and  b,  without respect to the weight of the rails. </para>

                    <para>. - Some honorable senators appear to be labouring under an extraordinary misapprehension in connexion with this particular item. They seem to be under the impression that because a higher duty is imposed on the lighter rails it will cost much, more to use the lighter rails than to use the heavier rails. If a private individual, or a State Government, is purchasing 5,000 tons of 40-lb. steel rails, it must be obvious that they will get a far greater mileage of rails than they would get if they were purchasing 50-lb. rails. It will therefore be seen that the object of the discrimination in duties is really to equalize the cost of the different rails. It seems to be assumed that 1,000 tons of the heavier rails will cover the same distance as 1,000 tons of the lighter rails. That, of course, is not the case; and although the extra number of lighter rails in a ton would not be many, it is obvious that there would be a great many more light rails supplied in a large order than there would be of heavy rails in an order for the same weight of rails. The lighter rails being of the same length would cover a greater distance than a similar weight of heavier rails. </para>

                    <para>. -  I listened with pleasure, until I was unfortunately called out of the chamber, to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> who was pointing out, for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle's</inline> benefit, that the Government proposal would mean an increased cost upon the particular kind of rail so largely used in Tasmania. Honorable senators are naturally solicitous about the interests of their own State. I am watching New South Wales' interests. In my State we use, and are the sole manufacturers of, the big heavy rail. Therefore I intend to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman's</inline> amendment, which is the nearest approach to my Free Trade ideal. If that is defeated or withdrawn, I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson's</inline> proposal to impose the same amount of duty on all classes of rails. What surprises me as much as anything else is that the Queensland senators, who have been so earnest in advocating high duties upon cane sugar and the other commodities produced in that State, are not equally alert to see that this item might possibly affect Queensland's producing interests, because the class of rail mentioned in it is, I should imagine, used extensively in the cane fields of the State for the purpose of conveying the cane to the sugar mills. But, of course, I have no right to complain if they are prepared to pay a higher rate of duty on rails. Is it necessary,  in  this item, to impose a higher duty than is levied on the raw material? </para>

                        <para>- I doubt if any extra labour is involved; but if there is, then it is balanced by the greater length of light rails produced from a given amount of metal. It would be as well if the Minister accepted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson's</inline> proposal. The lighter rails are used chiefly in country districts; as, for instance, for conveying, in the case of Queensland, the cane crop to the sugar mills. They are also extensively used in mining operations throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and I remember the case of one copper mine, where whether it could continue operations depended entirely upon the price at which wood fuel could be brought to the mine. Therefore, if we put on a shilling here, and another shilling there, in the Tariff, we must add greatly to the difficulties of all engaged in primary production and industrial ventures. I can quite understand, of course, that this Tariff schedule, having been framed on scientific lines, the whole question of the weight of rails and the duty necessary for a light rail as against a heavy rail were fully considered, and that may be one reason why the Minister feels justified now in resisting any attempt to alter the schedule, even if the object be to make certain commodities cheaper to the consumer. I have been struck with the fact that in every case these duties fall very heavily upon the primary producers of this country. </para>

                        <para>- The success of mining operations depends upon the working miner. Similarly the success of the pastoral and agricultural industries depends upon the agricultural labourer, the shearer, and other necessary employees. Therefore, the burden of unnecessary duties placed upon commodities required in these industries falls finally on the men who are actually engaged in the work of production. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> seemed to complain that Protectionists were losing their grip of Protectionist ideals. Sooner or later they will have to realize that the whole of the wealth comes from the land, and if in this Tariff we put on a little duty here, and a little more weight somewhere else, the burden will soon become so heavy that those engaged in our great primary industries will be unable to continue. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the honorable senator for the interjection. I realize that he does not, and that is one reason why we should watch this Tariff very carefully. In it there are 480 items, and I venture to say that at least 200 of them are taking a little more from the man on the land either directly or indirectly.. If we admit it as a sound proposition that the man on the land and the mirier produce the wealth of this country - and I claim that they do - and if we put on 10 per cent. here, 15 per cent. there, and 20 per cent. somewhere else, the primary producing industries of this country will eventually be crushed. I am afraid that the whole of ' the Protectionist building will collapse by Sheer weight of the duties imposed. Perhaps the Protectionists will not see it coming. I do not know where we will be then, but we shall have to begin again, and perhaps the business of reconstruction will not be in. the hands of people elected to a deliberative assembly, like this. I venture to say that when the crumbling comes the disaster will be like that of the temple which Samson destroyed, and perhaps in the destruction there will be more destroyed than we can now conceive. I am very much concerned about this duty. I am concerned because it presses upon the mining industry, and I have to thank the miners for any introduction to parliamentary life, though not to this Parliament. Naturally, I have some regard for the people who first took me in hand in this way. I do not want to see that industry injured by this Tariff. </para>

                <para class="block">If this is done, the duty on the lighter type of rails of British manufacture will be the same as that on heavier rails imported from the same source. My purpose in submitting this request is to assist those States which find it very difficult to carry out developmental railway construction because of the engineering difficulties caused by the rough country through which their lines have to pass. In Tasmania, the latest estimate for putting down a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge branch line to serve a district which is now beyond carting radius from the main line, is £8,333 per mile. In addition to the heavy cost of earthworks and so forth, the State Government is asked to pay a heavy duty upon the 40-lb. rails which, owing to engineering difficulties, must be used in these branch lines. The duties upon rails actually favour those States where the railway lines traverse fairly level country and thus can be built cheaply, as against  those which encounter considerable engineering difficulties in constructing: developmental lines; which are. essential for the general welfare of the Commonwealth, and which, the States should be encouraged to build.I realize that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company must have a reasonable amount of protection to insure the stability of their: industry; but I am not prepared to give them what is more than reasonable, and thus possibly run the risk of imperilling the carrying out of projects which; are more than ever necessary at. the present time for the well-being of the community.. Several branch railway lines have been held up in Tasmania during the last three or four years in the hope that before long the cost of construction will fall, instead of which it has increased, in regard to supplies of rails, fish bolts, and fastenings. My request is not put forward for the purpose of opposing the policy of affording protection to the steel rail industry. My object: is to avoid placing a burden on. States which find it necessary to carry on developmental work, and to reduce the financial responsibilities which must be undertaken in the endeavour to open up the country satisfactorily. Therefore I hope that the Committee will put the States which find it essential to use the lighter rails on the same footing as those in' a position to use the heavier rails. </para>

                    <para>. -This item furnishes the usual anomaly in regard to wire and wire netting products. I notice that the duties on wire netting are the same as those on barbed wire. I have no technical knowledge of the subject, but the market, quotations for these two commodities are such as to lead one to inquire why the duties are the same in both cases. The quotations for wire netting in Melbourne this month range from £62 to £80 per ton, according to the gauge, or, roughly speaking, an average of £70 per ton, and, assuming that it costs about £10 per ton to land it here, from the country of production, we have a net average cost of £60 per ton. On the other hand, the quotations for Australian barbed wire are £38 per ton for 12 gauge, and £45 per ton for 14 gauge, or an average of about £40 per ton. We have the same duties in respect of both manufactures, although there is not much difference between the grade of wire used in each case. </para>

                        <para>- There is a difference of: about £30 per ton between the average wholesale prices of the two commodities in Melbourne. The price of American barbed wire in Melbourne is £33 per ton for 12 gauge, and £45 per ton for14 gauge, as against £40 and £45 per ton for the same gauges of Australian barbed wire. I make this comparison in order to show that the consumer gets the benefit of the competition of the American with the Australian product. There is a difference of about £30 per ton between the average price of barbed wire and the average price of wire netting. If there is more labour involved in the manufacture of wire netting than is required in the production of barbed wire the. Minister should explain why a heavier duty is not imposed on wire netting. </para>

                        <para>- I do not pretend to have much knowledge of the processes,  but these quotations have aroused some curiosity on my part. "We find that black and galvanized wire made in Australia, which has to compete with' imports from America, is much lower in price than the raw material from which that wire is made. I shall not be allowed to refer in detail to that matter at this stage, but I may be permitted to emphasize die outstanding fact that rod iron is dearer than the wire that is manufactured from it. Wire is cheaper than bar and rod iron simply because American competition is hard against the locally manufactured wire. If American competition reduces the price of this article to the consumer' there is no reason why we should seek to put an additional barrier in the way of imports from that country so as to insure greater security to our manufacturers. I am not in favour of doing so. The Minister says that the manufacture of wire netting involves more labour than is required in the production of barbed wire; that being so, the duty on wire netting should be higher. It seems to me that the whole Tariff will have to be recast. Barbed wire is sold here at a reasonable price, because it is up against the competition of the American article, which is the product of white labour. Wages are high in the United States of America, and, so far as this item is concerned, the black-labour cock -will not fight. Because of the importation of the American product the consumer outback is getting a cheaper article. We hear much of the ingenuity and inventiveness of the Australian, and we should have sufficient courage to say that we are prepared to stand up against American competition without any artificial protection. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that in respect of this item the Government have gone a long way out of their road to impose an additional burden on the already burdened land-owners of the Commonwealth. Wire netting and barbed wire are used only by the people on the land. In the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of Saturday last there appeared an advertisement, in which quotations for barbed wire were given, and a glance at it reveals the remarkable fact that prices are f dur times  as  high as they were before the war. Here are the figures : -  Gliddon  barbed wire, galvanized, in 100-lb. coils, 430 yards to the coil, 36s. per coil; Iowa barbed wire, galvanized, 12 gauge, 440 yards to the cwt., 39s. per cwt.; 13 gauge, 560 yards to the cwt., 44s. per cwt.; 14 gauge, 700 yards to the cwt., 45s. per cwt.;  Waukegan  barbed wire, galvanized, 14 gauge, 820 yards to the cwt., 50s. per cwt. I venture to say the price of the last-named wire before the war was not more than 12s. 6*d. per cwt. Why should we impose this extra burden on our primary producers who, in addition to combating various pests, have to face increased costs, and to compete in the markets of the world? We cannot protect their wheat, wool, meat, or fruit, because these are sold in the world's markets, yet in respect of barbed wire, which they alone use, we are asked to impose a duty of 68s. per ton under the British preferential Tariff, while under the general Tariff the duty is 105s. per ton. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> intends to move a request for a reduction- </para>

This is a direct tax upon the primary producers. I know that we are manufacturing barbed wire in Australia, but it cannot be claimed that the general public is assisting in the maintenance of the industry. If the Government want to maintain industries at the cost of the people, it would be the lesser evil to provide, in this case, for a bounty rather than a duty. If that were done the whole of the community, instead of the primary producers alone, would have to pay for the maintenance of the industry. If we are to continue the practice of calling upon people to put their hands into their pockets in order to develop industries here, then the' sooner we adopt a system under which the whole community, instead of a section of it, will be called upon to bear the cost, the better for all concerned. Every one admits that the lot of the primary producer is harder than that of the manufacturer. The manufacturer has a relatively easy time. </para>

There is not a farm or grazing property in Australia that has not heretofore been compelled to use barbed wire, and will be compelled to use it again ; and now the price is practically four times what it was seven years ago. That being so, there is. no need for the additional duty. </para>

                        <para>- America is the place where barbed wire was invented, and, naturally, in that country the machinery for making it has been perfected, and from it more material can be exported than from elsewhere. That, however, is no reason why those on the land should be compelled to bear the burden of all this taxation. I would not mind so much if there were a sort of rebate system, under which the purchaser of every ton or cwt. had an interest in the industry in proportion to his purchases. </para>

                    <para>Formed with a nominal capital of £500,000, Rylands Brothers (Australia) Limited will take over the businesses of the Austral Nail Company Proprietary Limited and Rylands Brothers (Australia) Limited, and develop the wire and wire products enterprise carried on by both. Established in Melbourne in 1891, the Austral Nail Company have been known as manufacturers of wire nails and barbed wire, and, latterly, of fencing and nail wire. Two years ago the company moved their works to Newcastle, and have since manufactured fencing wires and other wires on a much larger scale. Rylands Brothers (Australia) Limited' (the company now absorbed) only came into being last year, with the objects of taking over the Australian interests of Rylands Brothers Limited, the well . known English manufacturers, and of entering upon the manufacture in Australia of wire netting and fine wires, and, ultimately, of wire rope. They established works adjoining those of the Austral Nail Company at Newcastle, with whom a fusion has now been effected. The directors of the amalgamated or new company will consist of Mr.' G. O. Delprat as <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Sir W.</inline> Peter Rylands <inline font-weight="bold">(chairman of Rylands Brothers Limited), Mr. H.</inline> H. Field (general manager of Rylands Brothers Limited), Messrs. C. L. M. Potts, M. M. Howarth, J.K. Mac Doug all, R. A. Mac Doug all, and James Mac Doug all, the last-mentioned being the managing director of the new company. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, the fusion is making barbed wire, wire netting, the finer qualities of wire work, and speak of making wire rope as well as nails. What I have said about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Delprat</inline> has to be remembered. I value his abilities very highly, but still we must not forget that this new company is merely, at least to an extent, an off-shoot of the Broken Hill Proprietary. I do not know the exact amount in shares held by the Broken Hill Company, but I do know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Delprat</inline> is in both companies. Under the circumstances, we have to ask ourselves whether it is possible for an independent company to start in opposition; it may be or it may not be, but, so far as I can see, the chances are very slender. In this fusion of two companies, operative in kindred activities, there are all the beginnings of what may finally become a Combine. I do not wish to stress that point; far from it. , I believe there are Combines which, up to a certain point are useful. In the old Labour days, I said that in the industrial field it is sometimes absolutely necessary to combine in order to wipe out suicidal competition'; and, as a victim of such competition, I &gt;say the same now. When that phase has been passed, however, another phase presents itself, and it is a phase which will take all our resourcefulness and courage to combat. I have read quotations regarding the two necessary articles of barbed wire and wire-netting, and have shown that the Americans can compete successfully, so far as barbed wire is concerned. We have to ask ourselves whether or not we are giving too much consideration and protection to what is certainly the germ of a Combine. When the wire is taken and bent into all shapes and forms, by this new company, formed on a very respectable foundation, we ought to ask ourselves whether we are not giving too much protection. In my opinion we are, and too much protection has been given all through to these industries. I am putting in a plea for those people who have to use barbed wire, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has shown the difficulties of the users in the interior of the country. This duty particularly affects people engaged in opening up new territory, and if we handicap settlers with burdens which they cannot bear, there will be a natural disinclination on the part of others to follow them. </para>

The importations from America for 1916-17 were 8,531 cwt. ; in 1917-18, they were 11,945 cwt.; in 1918-19, they were 13,420 cwt.; and in 1919-20 they were 56^280 cwt. These figures tell a doleful tale ; they show how Great Britain, owing to the war, lost her power to produce for commercial purposes, though she is making a splendid effort to regain her old position under the more nearly normal conditions. </para>

                            <para>- I always try to do so, if possible, but I cannot regulate the whole world; every man who has tried to do so has, I believe, failed. At any rate, when I had charge of the Department which dealt with prices, I think I did my duty by the consumers, though that does not say the scheme was a great success. It is clear that we have not the constitutional power to deal with these matters from the consumers' point of view, but we are going to try what can be done with a Tariff Board to prevent the exploitation of the people. The machinery for this purpose is not perfect, but it is the best we can provide under the Constitution to-day. Barbed wire is being made in practically all the States of the Commonwealth, but no exact figures regarding output are obtainable. The information at hand indicates that Lysaght Brothers and Company Limited can turn out 400 tons a month, equalling 4.800 tons a year, while the United Wire Nail and Manufacturing Company Limited has a capacity of 3,000 tons a year. The protective effect of the proposed duty depends chiefly on the margin between the duty on wire rods and barbing wires and that on the barbed wire. The rods pay, per ton, 44s., 65s., arid 80s. ; and barbing wire, per ton, 52s., 72s. 6d., and 90s.; while the duty on the barbed wire is 68s., 85s., and 105s. In 1913, the duty collected on barbed wire averaged 34s. per ton. The rate was then 10 per cent, and 15 per cent. In 1918-19, the duty collected averaged 115s. per ton at the rate of duty - 15 per cent, and 20 per cent. - then in force. Those comparisons demonstrate that the increased prices brought in considerably more revenue. Nevertheless, the counter effect was by no means beneficial to Australia. At the same time the duty on wire rods and barbing wire of foreign origin was 5 per cent.,- while, from the </para>

The Broken Hill Proprietary Company can produce wire rods-- that is, rods for the manufacture of wire - to the extent of 90,000 tons per annum, and the natural development of the industry will make local manufacturers of wire and other wire products, such as barbed wire and wire netting, independent of overseas supplies. Lysaght Brothers and Company have a considerable plant for the drawing of wires from wire rods. On the 26th March, last year, that firm wrote to the Department of Trade and Customs - </para>

                    <para class="block">It is evident from that statement that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company have been, and are, able to supply the requirements of Lysaght Brothers in wire rods, except under exceptional conditions which might occur abroad as well as here. The British firm of Rylands Brothers Limited has established works at Newcastle for the manufacture of all descriptions of wire. The enterprise had got into thorough-going operation some time ago. The Austral Nail Company and Rylands Brothers began by working together for the production of plain and galvanized fencing wire, barbed wire, wire netting, and all other classes of wire used in the Commonwealth. I understood that the two interests have since merged. In December of last year, when the information which I am now supplying was compiled, Bylands' factory had not been completed, so that the Austral Nail Company was then the only producer of barbed wire, and its output was limited to 25 tons per day. Rylands' plant having been established, however, the output of barbed wire was increased, and I understand that all local requirements are now being met. The Austral Nail Company spent £86,000, and it was the 'firm's expectation to be employing 1,500 men by the end of this year. Thus, it will be seen, Australia is now becoming self-supporting in" one more important phase of. industry; and, among other good reasons why that fact should give satisfaction, there is this consideration : with the establishment of industries in our midst we are able to control industrial conditions in a manner which would be beyond the power of the Government so far as foreign enterprises whose products are imported to Australia are concerned. Prices have by no means returned to normal, although we have left behind us the days of highest quotations, and matters are generally settling down. Particulars of importations over a number of years, prior to the war reveal that Germany audi the United States of America were largely supplying Australia's wire requirements No one desires that those countries shall again monopolize the Australian market. It is because industry is not yet- stabilized that local manufacturers should be givens practical encouragement in the manner designed by the Government. </para>

                        <para>. - I am in agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> in his desire that primary producers shall obtain their- materials as cheaply as possible. All honorable senators certainly favour the establishment  of  the iron industry in this country. During the war, I was not able to buy barbed wire. Australia was then put to great straits to secure any supplies at all. That fact demonstrates the need for the establishment of the industry within our own borders. I am glad that a renowned English firm has practically interested itself in the Commonwealth to the extent of establishing an enterprise, and I trust that Australia will shortly become self -sustained - if it is not so already - in the matter  of  the wire products under consideration.  If  the Australian iron industry were to languish and fail, importers would combine to " skin " the man on the land far more thoroughly than local manufacturers would ever be likely tq do. To keep prices down to reasonably low limits, the best means is to encourage local competition. I understand that the average price qf barbed wire to-day is about £40 per ton. </para>

                            <para>- There are various qualities of barbed' wire, but  I  think £40 may be taken as a fair average figure. Before the war, barbed wire could be bought for £12 10s. Prices may return to normal some day, but there will be fluctuations round about comparatively high quotations for a long time to come. The British preferential rate of 68s. per ton is equivalent at present prices to an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 10 per cent. That is not a very high impost, but it certainly would be if the price of barbed wire were  to  fall, with a return to normal times, to somewhere about £12 10s. I suggest, therefore, that, instead of imposing fixed duties, the Government would be acting more equitably in devising <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates, so that, if a duty equal to 10 per cent. is considered fair to-day, that relative degree of protection should remain, no matter what the price might be. My suggestion applies both to barbed wire and to wire netting. </para>

                        <para>. - I sympathize with the view  of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn,</inline> and agree that  the  preferential duty of 68s. per ton is not a high <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> percentage, and that buyers of barbed wire are not heavily handicapped by the Protective Tariff. But  if <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates were now imposed, they would be placed upon importations when prices are probably higher than they  are  likely to be for years to come, and the revenue would be materially swollen. But  the  Government have no desire to further tax the hard-pressed farmer and grazier. I can foresee that when trade  and  commerce become approximately normal, and there is ever-growing competition in the industrial world, the Tariff Board will be a very busy institution. While prices are still far from normal,  the  imposition of a fixed duty will cost buyers of wire less, at the same time providing deserved assistance to local industry. </para>

                        <para>.- We have now reached the absurd . position that the duty imposed on wire is higher than that suggested on wire netting. That is the position which has been created, and is one which may have to be adjusted later. Before the war, Germany supplied netting valued at £112,747, and exportations from United Kingdom were worth £221,645. The Austral Nail Company is producing wire netting on behalf of Rylands Brothers, but the arrangement is only a temporary one pending the completion of Rylands Brothers' factory. </para>

                        <para>. - Before recording my vote on this item, I desire further information concerning the wire-netting industry. I do not know if the works are under the same proprietary, but an industry on the .Parramatta River conducted by Lysaght Brothers and Company has been producing wire netting .for at least thirty-five years, and I desire to know the incidence of the duty on the wire they will have to use. Perhaps the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator' Russell)</inline> will enlighten the Committtee in regard to the effect of the proposed duty on this industry. I do not think that the whole of the wire netting required in Australia will be manufactured by the Newcastle firm, because, as I have mentioned, Lysaght Brothers and Company, which is not the same firm as that producing galvanized iron, have been manufacturing wire netting for a long time under the old Tariff. The Minister said that we were now in the position when the duty imposed on the wire is higher than that suggested on wire netting. This is not a new industry in Australia, and I am anxious to ascertain how Lysaght Brothers and Company, of Sydney, who use a lot of wire, will be affected. </para>

                        <para>. -. - Wire netting is extensively manufactured by Lysaght Brothers and Company, of Sydney. Their plant is capable of turning out 1,600 miles of netting per month. Other manufacturers are Malloch Brothers, Perth; and the Samson Wire Netting Company, of Sydney. The manufacture of barbed wire and. wire netting has been hampered by the difficulty in obtaining supplies of wire from overseas; but it is expected that this obstacle will be overcome very soon by the establishment of works at Newcastle. Such works will be able to supply galvanized wire more cheaply than it can be imported. The position in regard to wire netting and the arrangement of the duties in comparison with those on wire depend on the same conditions that apply to barbed wire. Rylands Brothers Limited are erecting a plant at Newcastle which they expect to be in operation towards the end of this year, and which will manufacture wires for all purposes. I have a letter from Rylands Brothers, which I will quote that honorable senators may know what they think of the duties proposed. It is dated 18th August, 1921, and is as follows : - </para>

                    <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir,</inline></para>
                    <para>The duties of British preference 68s. per ton, intermediate 85s. per ton, and general 105s. per ton under item 158 on wire netting were passed by the House of Representatives, and we ask your support to those figures on the following "grounds: - </para>
                    <para>Our firm was approached by the Government With a view to establishing works for the manufacture of netting in Australia. The general manager of the company visited Australia to investigate the position, and as a result of his inquiries it was decided to erect works for the manufacture of wire netting and of fine wires at Newcastle. </para>
                    <para>The works haver now been set up, and we started the  manufacture  of wire netting two months ago. The capital actually invested in Australia in this industry by us amounts to £400,000. This venture was gone into on the assurance of the protection shown in the Tariff, the present rates of which are now low, and are the absolute minimum on which it would be possible to carry the industry on successfully. </para>
                    <para>We manufacture the netting with wire made by ourselves at Newcastle from Australian raw material', and of the quality that has made our name the standard throughout the world. When we started our plant at Newcastle we began by offering our netting at about £13 per mile below the prices then ruling, feeling that with the duty we would be able to supply all Australian requirements and produce cheaply, because we would be producing on a large scale. If the duty is reduced, wire netting will be imported, our output reduced, and our cost of production increased in consequence, and we would therefore have to raise our selling price to meet the increased cost of production. ,- </para>
                    <para>In the production of wire netting the labour cost is very high, and we employ a large number of highly skilled operators. The number employed by us throughout our works is very large, and we have every reason to assure you that this will be one of the largest industries in Australia, assuming we can retain the measure of protection now offered. Trusting you will give this your sympathetic consideration. </para>
                    <para>The duty proposed on wire, iron, and steel as prescribed by departmental bylaws for the manufacture of wire netting is 90s. in the general Tariff, and the duty  on the completed article is 105s. in the general Tariff. The difference of 15s. per ton represents the additional protection afforded to the manufacture of wire netting. Surely honorable senators will not consider the duty extreme in the circumstances. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but it might have influenced the votes of honorable senators on the item with which we are now dealing. There is a difference between the consideration which should be given to the manufacture of barbed wire and that given to the manufacture of wire netting. In the first place, there was a fairly heavy duty previously on barbed wire, but in the previous Tariff wire netting was admitted free from Great Britain, and was dutiable at only 1Q per cent, in the general Tariff. In the circumstances, the duties now proposed by the Government on. wire netting - 68s., 85s., and 105s. per ton - are very heavy duties indeed. There is greater justification for the reduction of these duties than- there was for the reduction of the duties on barbed wire. Wire netting is becoming every -year more necessary in Australia to those carrying on agricultural pursuits. We should hesitate before we do anything which would be likely to impose an additional burden on agriculturists, who have heavy enough burdens to bear at the present time. Whilst I am prepared to give every consideration to the workers engaged in ordinary industrial pursuits, I desire . that the workers following agricultural pursuits shall also be given consideration, because there are no harder workers in Australia, and no men who risk more, since they must accept the market price for their products, whether it recoups them for their expenditure or not. They cannot control the market, whereas manufacturers to a great extent can do so. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> had proposed a further reduction of the duties on wire netting, I believe it would be agreed to. When we come to deal with the item covering wire used in the manufacture of wire netting, we can reduce the duties proposed, and give a corresponding relief to the manufacturers of wire netting. </para>

The statement which has so often been mode concerning the millions, of pounds that have been saved to the people of Australia through being able to use commodities manufactured here does not really bear on the question at all. During the war we were compelled to manufacture here, and .very great inducements were offered to manufacturers because of the profits to be made! This argument, which I have, heard used twenty or thirty times during the consideration' of the schedule, is not a- fair argument to use. I do "not begrudge local' manufacturers the profits which they made during the war ;' but it -is not fair to continually refer to the* fact that but for local manufacture* ' our people would have had to pay muck more for the commodities they use. - it is as well to remember that- they have had to pay, for the local manufactures, though it is true they may not have had'.

One gap. in his netting may mean the. loss, df -years of work' through the inroads of rabbits. It will take a great deal of education to. bring people on the land, who are faced with the necessity, for shutting put' rabbits, to realize that they, should pay for the establishment of industries , in Sydney or' Melbourne.

                        <para>. -  I desire to pursue this- subject a little further in order to see whether, with the assistance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> t. cannot fairly accurately state the position, of wire and the surrounding manufactures by reason of the -Tariff as agreed to so far. ' There are four . items in the schedule revolving around the question we are now discussing. Last night we .agreed, after considerable debate, to a reduced duty of 44s. per ton on fencing wire upto' No. 16 gauge, and., a reduced <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> Tate of 20 per cent, on wires of finer gauge.. I am alluding to the British preferential Tariff. It . was ' rightly pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> in giving  reasons- for a reduction .of the duty proposed, that, in effect, a 20 per cent, adf <inline font-style="italic">valorem</inline> rate would vary from .£5 .to perhaps £12 a ton on {-he, finer gauges of. wire. . However, the Committee agreed to the reduced rates I have mentioned, The . next item in connexion with  wire we have agreed to is barbed wire, which, I take it, is manufactured from wire up ' to No. 16 gauge, upon which we -have fixed a. duty of- 44s. per ton.. We have agreed to a rate of 5.0s., on barbed wire coming from Great Britain,, and. there. , is, a difference of only 6s... between the duty on the completed article and .that .'on the drawn wire from- which, it is made. Now we have the item wire .netting before us, and the duty attaching to it .. is- 68s. per ton. Following is another item: providing a duty of 52s.per ton for "Wire, iron and steel, for use in the manufacture of . barbed wire and' wire netting, , as prescribed by departmental bylaws." It seems to me that the wire scheduled at 52 s. per ton for the manufacture of wire netting will, in most cases, be finer than the No. 16 gauge wire, the duty upon which we have fixed at 44s. per ton, and will be of a gauge for which we have fixed an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate of 20 per cent. I believe that rabbit-proof netting is made largely from No. 17 and No. 18 gauge wire, and a good deal of wire net- ' ting is made from even finer gauges. Therefore, we have the anomaly that, in spite of large expenditure of capital at Newcastle by Ryland Brothers to establish an industry for drawing the whole of Australia's requirements of coarse and fine wires, other Australian wire netting manufacturers will be able to import No. 17, No. 18, No. l9 or even- finer gauges of Wife to make thoir netting under a rate of duty which was' only intended for fencing wire. In other words, the effective protection already given <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> the Committee' upon the finer wires will not operate on Wire for the- niahuf facture of wire netting,' and 'Ihe manufacturers of . this netting iwifl . be able to import their . raw material - at a cheaper rate than was intended. I know that wire netting has been made- in Sydney for a good many years . Without any assistance from a Tariff; but I would suggest in connexion with what has now become a very involved question,' that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Bussell)</inline> should, in 'the interests of the wire netting, industry, postpone these items until further . consideration ban be given th'em. On the one hand, we have an appeal for a 20 per cunt, duty to establish' a new industry -of drawing wire at Newcastle; on the other hand, there is an item- in this Tariff specially, designed to enable . manufacturers of wire . netting to import' wire suitable for their require; merits' at a very low rate of duty. -The two things are. not compatible. </para>

If wo impose' Protective duties on the raw material so «s to assist the man engaged In, the primary stages of wire production, and then impose Protective duties to assist those employed in the secondary stages, followed by additional duties to protect those engaged in the final stages of wire production, we shall have prices so high that no one will be able to purchase the finished article. In that way Protection destroys itself.  The  completed article will require such an enormously high Protective duty that no one will have sufficient money to purchase it. That is why Protection is a fallacy, and ineffective. Notwithstanding the statement of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> we have never had a scientific Tariff, and I believe that before we have concluded our consideration of this schedule the honorable senator will say that this scientific Tariff has been destroyed owing to the interference of amateurs. </para>

                        <para>. - The Committee, it seems to me, is in a difficulty. It has agreed to a request to reduce the duty on wire netting from 68s. to 55s. per ton under the British preferential Tariff. The maker of barbed wire or wire netting, unless he draws his own wire, has to pay a duty of 52s. per ton if he imports his wire from Great Britain, so that there is now only a difference of 3s. per ton between the duty on the wire that he wants to use and the duty on the completely manufactured article. That is not quite a fair position in which to place the man who does not draw his own wire. On the other hand, we have to consider the position of the wire-drawers here. In order to compete against the importers who supply wire for the manufacture of barbed wire, they will have to sell their product in the neighbourhood of the import cost. The protection granted in respect of these finer wires for the manufacture of wire netting is only £2 12s. per ton, or just about that which was given last night to the coarser grades of fencing wire. Anomalies in connexion with this item have cropped up all round in view of the requests that have been made by the Committee. The Minister has read a letter  received  from Messrs. Rylands Brothers, but I would point out that the wire drawing industry which they are establishing at Newcastle is not the only one of its kind in Australia. An enterprise of considerable proportions has been carried on for some time on the Parramatta River. Has the Government received representations from it in connexion with the duty? </para>

The enterprise of Rylands, at Newcastle, is as yet, to a large extent, in the elementary stage, and it is not the representations of that' firm to which I should pay so much attention as the representations of a firm which has been engaged in. the business for thirty-five years, and is capable of employing 1,400 people. Before the Committee finally deals with this item I should like to know a little more about the real position, in order that we may give fair play all round. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. One firm which is launching out in a large way is manufacturing its own stuff, and drawing its own wire. The reasonable thing to suppose is that if we reduce the duty on wire, these people will give up the business of drawing wire as unprofitable, and depend on imported wire from cheaper countries. The only result of our endeavours to do the right thing will be to knock out the industry of . drawing wire, and retain the industry of manufacturing netting. We may be able to patch up the vessel and sail through if we do not do any more damage. Honestly, I think we have done wrong ; but do not let us ruin, or run the risk of ruining, another industry. If the Committee have made a mistake, it is not a very big one, and no doubt the company will make an effort to carry on. If they can produce evidence to the Tariff Board that they cannot carry on and compete with foreign manufacturers, it will be within the scope of Parliament to remedy the position. If, however, we pursue matters to the ridiculous conclusion, and because we have done wrong in one respect do wrong in another, we will " knock out " both industries. If we leave the Tariff on wire as it is, it will, I believe, make it necessary for the manufacturers of netting and barbed wire to manufacture from Australian raw material, and that is very much better than going to the other extreme. It would; in my opinion, be a great mistake to adopt the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline></para>

The- rates of duty upon- " Wire, other," are set out' in' the schedule respectively at 52s., -728. -6d., and 90s. per ton, but the Committee has requested a reduction of the British preferential rate to 44s. The item at present under consideration is allied with that which I have  just  indicated, and honorable senators should not request more considerable reductions in the present instance than that which was secured in respect of sub-item b of item 186. </para>

The "Wire, other," set out in item 136 is distinctly specified and governed by paragraph 1 of sub-item b of that item, which reads, " Wire of No. 16 or finer gauge." The gauge of the wire covered by .the phrase, "Wire, other," tin paragraph 2, upon which the British duty was reduced to 44s., must be of 15 gauge or less to be admitted at that rate of duty. The wire provided for in sub-item b of item 159, namely, that for use in the manufacture of barbed wire and wire netting, is any wire than can be employed in the production of those commodities, irrespective of gauge. </para>
