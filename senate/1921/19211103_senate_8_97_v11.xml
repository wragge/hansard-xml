                    <para>The object of this measure is to give authority to the Government to borrow the sum of £5,000,000, but, apart from the payment of the- expenses of flotation, it will give the Government no authority to spend' any money. A Loan Appropriation Bill, which will be introduced' later will be necessary to enable the Treasurer to use the net amount raised. As in the case of all Commonwealth loans, the rate of interest, price of issue, date of maturity, and other conditions will be fixed by the Governor-General in Council. Under the powers to. be conferred by the Bill, it is intended bo raise £3,000,000 for the redemption of Treasury bills and. £2,000,000 towards the works programme for 1921.-1922. No money,, however, can be actually expended until the Loan' Appropriation. Bill to be introduced; later has been passed. </para>

                        <para>. - The times are not so easy as they once were, and, consequently, I think it is the duty of the Senate to know exactly where we are before passing this Bill. I do not rise to oppose the passing of the measure, though we have been given but scanty information by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> in moving the second reading. We have heard, first of all, that the terms, rate of interest, and so on will be fixed, as usual, by the Governor-General in Council. We have been told, also, that of the £5,000,000 which the Government seeks the authority of the Senate to borrow £3,000,000 will be spent in the redemption of Treasury bills, and it is intended that £2,000,000 shall be spent on works. A Budget statement was brought down by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> a few weeks ago, wherein he intimated that the public debt of the Commonwealth waa so many hundreds of millions sterling gross, and so many hundreds of millions net. I should like to know if the Treasury bills which are to be redeemed from money borrowed under this Bill are included in this statement. </para>

This is a proposal bo aubhorize the Government to borrow £5,000,000 for the purpose of redeeming £3,000,000 worth of Treasury bills, and to spend £2,000,000 on new works. I want bo know whether the Treasury bills which are to be redeemed out of the proceeds of this loan, were taken in as a liability by the Treasurer when he delivered his Budget recently. </para>

This Bill authorizes the raising of a loan in London, not locally, because recently a local loan of £10,000,000 was raised for repatriation purposes under an authorization given by Parliament last year for a larger amount than was borrowed at that time. </para>

                            <para>- I shall be governed by the circumstances of the case. At present I am talking about the advisableness, or otherwise, of the Commonwealth borrowing outside Australia; and if so, of borrowing outside of the Empire. Again, on the question of the terms and conditions of this proposed loan. Heretofore the Government, by good luck or good judgment, have obtained money on favorable terms, and therefore I hope they will wait until they are reasonably sure of a satisfactory result in connexion with this proposal. The loan raised by the Minister for Repatriation early in the year was, I think, placed on terms as favorable as could have been obtained at that time. I am one of those who think that money is going to be cheaper rather than dearer. New York loans to prominent American institutions are being issued to-day at 1 per cent, less than six months ago. In other words, the average rate of interest obtained, from New York loans to public institutions in the United States of America six months ago was about 6¾ to <inline font-style="italic">7¼</inline> per cent., whereas loans to similar institutions to-day are not averaging more than about 6 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- It is. I do not think the Commonwealth Government should pay an excessive rate for any money borrowed abroad because, after all, we do not actually get the money. It is quite an hallucination to think that large sums are exchanged in payment for goods, because I do not suppose that more than 1 per cent, of all commercial and exchange transactions are paid for in coin. When we speak of money we really mean credit, and if we borrow from America it means more American goods, and if we borrow in Great Britain,  more  British goods. </para>

                    <para>I desire to direct attention to the very great importance of legislating, as far as we possibly can, in the direction of encouraging a favorable balance of trade, because our total indebtedness now to Great Britain means an annual interest . bill of approximately £20,000,000, which has to be sent out of the country. That can only be sent out in the form of goods, and, consequently, if our balance of exports over imports does not amount, approximately, to £20,000,000 annually, governmentally, commercially, and privately, we are running into further debt. I am glad to have the Minister's assurance that this loan will not increase our public indebtedness if £3,000,000 more is borrowed in Britain for the redemption of floating Treasury bills, because it is really a book entry. </para>

                            <para>- I heard an interjection that circumstances existing at the moment should be a warning against further public borrowing. No one likes  to borrow; but I venture to say that in a country such as Australia borrowing is inevitable unless we desire to remain stationary. I do not wish to suggest that we should launch out into lavish borrowing, even if that were possible; but it would be extreme folly to shut down, on borrowing in a country clamouring for development in almost every district. When we speak of our public indebtedness we ought to remember the valuable asset we have against our liabilities. Take' our railways as a case in point. Whether or not they would to-day realize the amount of money which has been borrowed to construct them, no one would suggest that Australia has not benefited by carrying such a debt for the. construction of railways, which have really been our life-blood and one of our main aids to progress. Unless more private money is available for developmental work than there appears to be, it becomes essential for the State to borrow for this, purpose. </para>

                            <para>- If. every £1 we borrow returns more than £1 in assets, the more we borrow the richer we become. It is not a question of whether borrowing is right or wrong,, or advisable or inadvisable, but whether the money we borrow is wisely expended. Every honorable senator at some time or other has asked for increased postal facilities ; and it is absurd to ask the taxpayers this year to pay for postal facilities which will last for fifty years. Therefore, if many works of this kind are wisely undertaken and proper supervision exercised over the expenditure of the money, we are helping ourselves by expending it on reproductive works'. </para>

                            <para>- These bills were floated at different rates of interest. They are not permanent investments, and have been taken up largely, by the balances arising from revenue accounts which have to be repaid. It has been a. means of utilizing unexpended balances and getting money at a comparatively low rate of interest. The time has now arrived when these balances have to be paid back with the money authorized by this Bill. </para>

                        must be aware that it has never been the practice to include the rates of interest in a Bill,, and the reason is obvious. If we go to London, and negotiate with financiers as to the terms and conditions it might be. found impossible to float a loan, at the rate specified in the measure. On the other hand, if the rates stated were- more favorable than the market demanded, financiers would insist on securing the maximum rates. In the past, this has always been left to the Government and their financial advisers to secure the best terms possible in the circumstances. This measure merely follows the established practice, which, I venture to say, experience has justified.

                        <para>.- This is not a very extensive Bill, but I am naturally interested to know what the prospects would be of raising money at this particular juncture in London. It gave me a good deal of gratification when I read a statement in the press, dated 23rd October, from London, to the effect that the loan had been completely underwritten. The terms of the loan were stated to be that the stock was to be issued at £96, and was to carry interest at the rate of 6 per cent. A day or two afterwards I read in the same journal that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)'</inline> had expressed his gratification at the successful flotation of the loan, especially as the underwriting expenses were something like 20 per cent, less than for previous loans. I naturally connected that paragraph with the present Loan Bill. Am I right in doing so? </para>

                    <para>. - I promised yesterday to obtain information in reply to inquiries by certain honorable senators. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> asked me what percentage of telegraph messengers . remained in the Service after attaining the age of eighteen years. The answer is that for the year ended 30'th June, 1921, only seven out of 2,327 telegraph messengers retired, not having passed the examination. The . number who remained is; therefore, roughly 99 percent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> wished to, know how many  lads between the ages of seventeen and eighteen years are in the Service. The number between sixteen and eighteen years is 949 ; it would take some days to ascertain the number between seventeen and eighteen. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> said he understood there was no possibility of all the telegraph messengers, when they reached the age of eighteen years, being drafted into the Public Service, irrespective of any examination. The. reply is that no difficulty is found in providing positions for telegraph messengers who have qualified: <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> remarked that it would be very interesting to learn the number of boys who had passed the examination and had not been absorbed in the Department. I would refer him to the answer previously given, that no difficulty is experienced in finding positions for telegraph messengers who qualify. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator B.eid</inline> wished to know the number of boys who had been used in the telephone office, and the number of girls who had been kept waiting for positions held by boys. The answer is, " None." A certain number of boys are appointed as male telephonists for night work to relieve girls, as it is undesirable for girls to work night shifts. 1 think the foregoing record wi'l show that the Department has been particularly considerate. Take the last instance I. have mentioned. In seven years I have never seen cause for complaint in that regard in the. Department, and I am sure that it would have come under my notice if there had been any ground for complaint. "We find that nobody has been put out of the Service. » One honorable senator - I believe, my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> - said he knew of hundreds of cases, but we find that in one year only seven lads have left the Service on reaching the age of eighteen years. This reveals a splendid record of care and attention in the interests of the boys themselves. The departmental statement, from which I have been quoting, continues : - </para>

                    <para>At the present time, the number of telegraph messengers in the Public Service between the ages of sixteen and eighteen is 949. The amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> namely, to make the age limit .seventeen years, would thus affect a large number of boys who at the present time expect to obtain permanent positions. It is probable that, under the provisions of the existing Act and the Bill, if amended in accordance  with the Government proposal, all those boys will be absorbed in the Service. </para>

                <para class="block">That is a wonderful record. It is my intention to propose an amendment which will make it. quite clear that the Government will not dispense with the services of returned soldiers who have been temporarily employed. The postal and telegraphic services are such that- they will require very much larger staffs when material and necessary new offices are available. Owing to the war activities were considerably hampered. The demand for telephones is far and away above the available supply of material.  I might mention, as an example of this shortage, that a prominent solicitor residing at Brighton had made repeated applications for telephone connexion. I took the matter up, but the Department had to intimate once more that it would be impossible to provide the connexion for the reason that the Brighton exchange was already full. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; and when the material comes to hand there will be greatly enhanced activities, calling for additions to staffs. Meanwhile, I repeat that no returned soldier temporarily employed1 will be dismissed " merely to provide a permanent position which may be filled by the promotion of any telegraph messenger." There is no question of the Government creating an army of unemployed men. The Government have under consideration the whole question of appointing temporary employees as permanent members of the various staffs. It had' been decided to suspend the making of permanent appointments while so many young and eligible Australians were away fighting for their country. Now, however, our men have come back. There are too many temporary employees in the Service. It is high time that the temporary labour was done away with and the individuals concerned, in every instance possible, appointed to permanent positions. </para>

                        <para>- It will be provided for in this measure. As for the question of examination, it would be unfair to ask returned men, who have practically lost several years of their lives, to undergo long and extensive preparations for qualification tests. Of course, if a returned soldier is aiming to secure a higher position he must necessarily be qualified to take it, and he must be prepared to undergo an examination, if necessary. It is essential that a certain standard of efficiency should be maintained. But I repeat that special consideration will be given to ex-soldiers in every instance, and there "will be circumstances in which, at the discretion of the Board, no examination will be required. </para>

One thing that has to be borne in mind is that the high wages earned by the young people outside the Service is an inducement to them to remain outside. For this reason there may not be such a rush as there used to be to get into the Service. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister has proposed a very important amendment. Its spirit appears to me to be quite contrary to that of the Public Service Act we are now working under. It is evident that those who drafted the Bill were determined, with the concurrence of the Government, to make it impossible for every lad employed as a telegraph messenger to look forward with certainty to becoming a public servant. If the amendment is accepted it will mean that, willy nilly, the Government must find positions for every telegraph messenger who passes the prescribed examination. On the second reading of the Bill honorable senators will remember that the majority of the members of this Chamber gave expression to the view that the Civil Service ought not to be looked upon as a certainty for life to every lad who enters it. The exigencies of the Service may require fewer persons to be employed in certain Departments in the future than have been employed in the past. Under the present Act there is no possibility, as far as I can see, of dispensing with the services of a public servant unless he breaks the law and is disobedient to his superiors. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister has not stated why it. has been thought necessary to bring down this amendment. The clause is deliberately worded in contradistinction to the clause governing telegraph messengers in the old Act. The clause in the old Act reads as the clause in this Bill will read if the amendment is accepted.

That is a very wide distinction. Personally, I think the Government were wise in having the clause drafted as printed in the Bill, which provides that unless a position is available for a lad employed as a telegraph messenger he shall cease to be employed. If the amendment is carried we must find a position for every1 lad who passes the examination. At the present juncture I am certainly opposed to the amendment. If honorable senators accept it they will be going back on the attitude taken up by -them on the second reading.

                    <para>. -  The expansion of the Post Office will be as rapid in the future as the supply of materials will permit. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has overlooked the fact that the Bill does not deal with persons outside the Public .Service, but with employees df the Postal Department. It refers to boys who have served for four or five years in the Department. Surely it cannot be said that the Government has a right to take the best years of a boy's life .and then to throw him out on the street. One of the biggest curses of Australia to-day is not the natural, but the artificial limitation of apprentices and junior workers. I believe it has been computed that -there -ought to be about one apprentice or junior worker to three male adult workers, but in some trades the Wages Boards or the Arbitration Courts have fixed a minimum of five seniors to one apprentice. This re-  striction of apprentices is .forcing the boy who has no trade into the labour market as an unskilled worker. The Government very much regrets this condition, and will do what it can to remedy it by seeing that the proper proportion of boys to adult workers are trained in its own Departments. It has become a practice in some of the best trades in Australia to limit the number of 'apprentices as much as possible. </para>

                    PRATTEN  (New South Wales ; [4.2].  -  As the position with regard to telegraph messenger boys develops, it becomes more obtuse. The original Bill provided that a telegraph messenger should cease to be employed as such on reaching the age of eighteen years, unless he had been previously transferred or promoted to another position. Yesterday there were some fairly strong opinions expressed in this chamber that the age at which a boy should cease to be a telegraph messenger should be seventeen, and not eighteen, years.

I am not 'clear as to whether the whole of -the 'telegraph messengers employed by the Commonwealth can, as they reach the age  of  .eighteen years,  be absorbed- into 'the . Service. There is a conflict of opinion on this point; but 1 am informed . that not anything like all of those who annually reach the age of eighteen years can be found positions in the Service. </para>

The effect of the amendment would be that the 'Government would be morally bound, after a telegraph messenger had passed the prescribed examination, to find1 him a position  in the Service, irrespective of its require&gt;ment's. If", as the Minister has- said, the Service can absorb all these boys as they arrive at the age of eighteen years, then the. effect of the amendment will be merely to prescribe that, before they are absorbed by the Service, they must pass an examination. But if the Service cannot absorb all. these boys,, year after year, as they arrive at the age  of eighteen years - and I am informed that, so far,, it has been unable to do so - by passing the amendment we shall be committing ourselves to a moral obligation to every boy who passes the prescribed, examination, to find him a position in the Service, irrespective of its. requirements. </para>

                        <para>- No, the obligation does not at present exist. I have it on several authorities that there are injustices perpetrated, in connexion with  these boys at the present time. The complaint is. made that a boy, after serving three or four years as a- telegraph messenger, is very often dumped out into the world when he reaches the age of eighteen years, irrespective of his qualifications for promotion in the Service, because he is not wanted. </para>

                        <para>- No. The Minister, in introducing the Bill, and also last year when dealing with this matter, clearly laid it down that the policy of the Government was to reorganize the Public Service, so far as possible, with the object of securing more efficiency, and avoiding the possibility of overmanning in the various Departments. Notwithstanding that fact, he now brings down an amendment that will necessitate the continued employment as public servants of every telegraph messenger who reaches the age of eighteen years if he can pass a certain examination, irrespective of whether Departments want additional assistance or riot. That is quite contrary to the whole principle underlying the measure. </para>

There may be no vacancies in the Post and Telegraph Department or any other Commonwealth Department, but if this amendment is carried, those lads will, have to kept on and paid. </para>

                    <para>. -  Through the operation of our Standing Orders I was unable to complete my observations a few moments ago. I want now to summarize the position as I see it. In the Bill as drafted there is no responsibility on the part of the Post and Telegraph Department, or any other branch of the Service, with regard to these boys, the only qualification being, if a lad had been previously transferred or promoted to some other position, it was mandatory on the Department to employ him. That responsibility will be very materially altered by the amendment submitted by the Minister. If adopted, it will be mandatory on the Postal Department, provided the lads pass a prescribed examination, to appoint them all to the Public Service when they reach the age of eighteen years. Is there room for the whole of these lads ? </para>

                        <para>- It would be fairer, because a lad of seventeen years of age has a better chance, by one year at all events, to enter other employment. The Government have already admitted this by, I believe, bringing down the age, in the case of telegraph messengers, from twenty years to eighteen years. I should prefer the clause to be so drafted as to provide that when a telegraph messenger reached the age of seventeen years he should know definitely whether or not he was to continue in the Service. I should like an_ elastic provision whereby the authorities of the Postal Department would not be obliged to employ the whole of the telegraph messengers who may pass the examination, unless the exigencies of the Service permitted of this being done. </para>

Prom inquiries made, I. understand that there, are from 250 to 270 maimed men in the Post and Telegraph. Department who have been compelled to take up this occupation, as the work is comparatively light. Their positions were not interfered with for some time until, the Acting Public Service Commissioner was faced with the difficulty of providing employment for telegraph messengers who had attained the age of eighteen years, and had passed the necessary examination. </para>

We must make the Service elastic to some extent, or otherwise . divide it into watertight compartments. The Board will comprise responsible men, and the clause meets a grievance that has existed altogether too long. We have Been instances of men remaining in one Department . while other officers not comparable with them in ability have obtained promotion. "The power proposed to be given to the Board is very reasonable, and it should be willingly extended. </para>

                    <para>. - The Board will be a responsible body, specially selected to re-organize and stabilize the Service. "I might mention the case of an officer in 'Papua, who, for seventeen or eighteen 'years, was 'secretary to the . Executive . Council at -Port Moresby. I believe that, mainly for health reasons, on account «of . his long and continuous period of service there, he asked . to be 'transferred to Melbourne. He was sent back to the Home and Territories Department, and 'he is in that Department now. He was a competent officer, and . had held a most responsible position in Papua. A man with a record like that does not need to be examined before being given a position here. He had proved his ability, because the Executive Council in Papua controls practically all the operations of . government there. I hope that we shall be more generous in future . to men who go to 'these outposts of civilization. I have visited New Guinea, and I do not know why officers should not serve for a certain period there. <inline font-style="italic">Qn the occasion</inline> of my visit, we had a party of about eighteen, and not one <inline font-style="italic">aS</inline> us suffered the . slightest illness. Certainly we made the trip at a favorable time. ' We did not experience the monsoonal gales. Every . one of us voted the climate a splendid one, although -we' travelled many miles, and slept inland. Officers there need &lt;a good holiday once in two years, in order to preserve average health, and be fit . to do their work. Some 'of the officers there . have been without a good spell for a long period, and it is time some of them had a twelve months' rest to recuperate, or were transferred. I do not think any man should be kept in a place like Papua all his life, but the work there should be reasonably distributed among suitable officers. If a person knew that the maximum period of service there would be two years, no doubt single men would be quite willing to go. </para>

If men who are not of the right type are recommended by the Board, other people who feel that an injustice has been done to them can appeal against the appointments within six months, and thus every protection is afforded. No officer can be appointed to any position except on probation for six months. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause seems to me to be an improvement on the provisions of the existing Act. I take it that it provides that the Board can appoint a person from outside the Service if it is of opinion that he can do the work more capably than any one inside the Service. I would like to ask whether that is also the case under the present Act, or whether the prevailing practice is that a person from outside can be appointed only if there is no one inside the Service capable of doing the work ? </para>

                    <para>.- I want to. bring under the notice of the Committee the possible necessity that may exist for adding a new clause to clause 46. It is felt in the Public- Service that if this clause is passed as amended,, it will not. give an. officer in. the Service a fair opportunity of. obtaining a position for- which he: may be qualified, because the Board may have certified that there is no officer in the S'ervice as capable as an outside applicant of filling the. 'position. The contention of. the Public Service Association is that- it would be. almost impossible for any Board to give a certificate of that kind on really first-hand knowledge, unless the officers of the Service had ah opportunity of demonstrating their capabilities for the position. </para>

I addressed a question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister to-day, and received a reply from him in connexion with the appointment of radio-telegraphic officers. It appears that, so far as the Commonwealth ships are concerned, the appointment of such officers does not rest with the Commonwealth Government at all, but with some outside company, organization, or body. There are wireless operators who served on the various fronts during the war on land and sea. </para>

                        <para>- I think the Minister is not stating the facts quite correctly. There are men who served Australia and the Empire on the various fronts during the war who did not receive, and could not possibly have received, their training from this organization, company, or body with whom the Commonwealth has now made an arrangement. For the purpose of filling the positions of wireless operators on Commonwealth ships this company, organization, or body was resorted to, and it is only the trainees of that company, organization, or body who are appointed to those vessels.Therearemenwho,beforethat company, organization, or body was in existence, qualified themselves and went abroad, and rendered valuable -services on land and sea to the Commonwealth and the Empire. Many of them are now back in Australia, and they are seeing men appointed to Commonwealth vessels who did no service for Australia or the Empire. The agreement that has been entered into is absolutely wrong. I have no objection to an agreement to insure that the Commonwealth Governmentshall be supplied with qualified men, but it ought to contain some provision for compliance with the Commonwealth policy of preference to returned men. It is a very poor thing for men who have served in the Mediterranean - " can fishing," chasing submarines - or who have served in the Atlantic or on the Mesopotamian, Palestine, or Western Fronts as 'wireless men, to come back to Australia and be told that they cannot be appointed to Commonwealth ships because some company or organization has a right of appointment, and that it appoints only its own trainees. If a trainee who has not seen active service is appointed, the company's explanation is that he' was not old enough at the 'time of the war to be on service. Men who rendered service during the war to Australia, the Empire, and the Allies, should have the first claim to appointment to these positions. I do not suppose that the clause under consideration could be modified to give effect to what I desire, but I am thankful for the opportunity it has afforded me to discuss the question I asked to-day, and the reply I received to it. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russellto</inline> take a note, of what I have said,' and to see that the policy of the Government and their supporters, which has been indorsed by the country, shall be carried out. I think that in all great emergencies at sea where there has been danger of shipwreck and loss of life, the history of Britishshipping has so far revealed the fact that, like the captain on the bridge, the wireless operator has invariably stood to his post. These men risked their lives time and again, and now, when they return to Australia, find that they are ineligible for appointment because they were not trained by a company or organization that has some arrangement with the Government in connexion with Commonwealth ships. That is a preposterous thing, and the country will not stand for it. I trust that the Minister will see that some provision is made by which those who have served Australia, the Empire, the. Allies, and the cause of civilization, may receive recognition in appointments to positions on Commonwealth vessels. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am thankful for the suggestions which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has made, and I am sure that we all agree with the spirit of his remarks. It is my intention to postpone the consideration of the proposed new clause in order that I may look into the matter. I believe that the machines that are operated are the property of the Marconi Company, and, under a contract for a royalty with the company, we are using them on the leasehold system. I am at present under the impression . that the contract was entered into about eighteen months before we had determined on the policy of preference to returned men. It will be remembered that comparatively few soldiers returned within the first twelve months of the war, and that it' was only when they began to come back in considerable numbers that the policy of preference to returned men was adopted. If the contract was entered into after that period, it should contain a clause giving preference to these men. I propose to make inquiries and, as I am in charge of the business, if there is such a condition in the contract I shall insist upon its enforcement. If there is no such condition, whilst we cannot of course break the contract, I shall confer with the company and it should not be difficult to induce them to give effect to our policy. I am in full sympathy with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has said. If there is no condition in the contract giving preference to the men referred to, there should be such a condition, and I shall do my best to have it embodied in the contract. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what the conditions of the contract are with regard to wages. We have entered into a contract for a certain number of years on a royalty, and I question at the moment whether we could now alter the wages conditions of the contract. I remember that the terms of the contract were sent out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Larkin,</inline> and I had an opportunity of looking over them. I approved of  the contract as the best course to be followed in the circumstances as we were not building wireless in Australia at the time. I shall look into both the matters to which reference has been made, and for that purpose will ask for the postponement of the consideration of the proposed new clause 46a. </para>

He has indicated that the Government are fully in accordance with the sentiments I have expressed, and I think that honorable senators generally are agreed that recognition should be given to returned men in connexion with these as in connexion with other positions in the Commonwealth Service. I am not quite sure whether these wireless operators are employees of the Commonwealth or of the organization or body that has contracted with the Commonwealth for the supply of wireless services for Commonwealth vessels. Whatever the position is, I think the Minister is well advised in taking the course he proposes, and I have risen now merely to acknowledge his courtesy and to thank him for his promise to give attention to the matters I have submitted. </para>

I may state the two different principles of promotion. Under the existing Act all promotions in every division of the Service are made by the Public Service Commissioner, of course after consultation with the heads of Departments. Under this Bill the Government propose a different system, and that promotions should be made by chief officers or heads of Departments. </para>

                        <para>- Then it is proposed that in future the permanent head of a Department, and not the Public Service Commissioner, shall make necessary promotions. I desire that the Commissioner, or in his place the Public Service Board, should be responsible for all promotions: Under the existing practice, if an opportunity is afforded for a promotion the Commissioner advertises for applicants for the position, and no matter in what part of Australia, or in what division an officer may be, he can send in an application for the position. The Commissioner consults with the head of the Department concerned, and the promotion is then made by the Commissioner. The Minister may, of course, object, and in such a case the matter is laid before Parliament, but I do not think that a single instance of that kind has so far occurred. If the clause under discussion is agreed to, the permanent head of a Department will make promotions, and any person aggrieved by his decision may appeal to the Board. If, for instance, there is an opportunity of promotion in the Treasury, an accountant in any other Department of the Public Service may apply for the position, and if he is not given it, may appeal to the Board, who can turn down the recommendation of the permanent head and appoint the appellant to the position. To my mind this clause will have the effect of making the different Departments more watertight than they are now. It will mean that there will be very few transfers from one Department to another, and that a man once employed in a particular Department will remain in it during the whole of his service. Another effect of the clause will, in all probability, be that promotions will in future be according to seniority or to the nearness of particular officers to the permanent heads of the Departments in which they take place. Under the existing system a man in another Department is given a better chance of promotion than he will have under this clause if it is passed. The clause practically proposes going back to the system of political appointments. We cannot get away from the fact that if the permanent head of a Department has the right to make promotions political  influence will be used. Pressure will be brought to bear on the Minister in charge of the Department, because 'members of Parliament knowing that promotions will practically depend on the heads of Departments will use their influence to secure .the promotion of particular persons. In these circumstances, it is clear that those near the Minister or the permanent head will have a better chance of promotion than those farther away. </para>

                        <para>- Their opportunities for promotion will be reduced under this clause. I was talking some time ago to a man who has left the Commonwealth Public Service. He rose to a prominent position, and subsequently retired. A little while ago I met him, and in conversation with me he contrasted the Public Service of to-day with the Public Service as he knew it. He thought the conditions of to-day were better than in former years. He said, " I happened to be in the Post Office in New South Wales, and was stationed right out in the country. I knew very well that unless I could get into Sydney, where I would be nearer the heads of the Department, I would have no chance of promotion. Those were the days of political influence. I approached a friend of mine, who happened to be the member for the district, and a3 a result of his representations I was brought into Sydney. I believe I made good." This gentleman, of course, did make good, but if he had not been transferred to Sydney he would never have had a chance of rising. The Act&gt; so far as -possible, eliminates political influence, but this Bill (encourages the use of outside influence. </para>

                        <para>- Probably not, but they do clash sometimes. I know this of my own personal knowledge because formerly I administered one of the Departments, and if the Commissioner stands by his own opinion he makes the appointment. Sometimes, of course, he gives way to the head of the Department, because no doubt he thinks the latter has put up a good case. Under this Bill appointments will be made by the permanent heads of Departments. It is true that there is provision for appeal against their decisions, but what chance would a young officer in the country have in any appeal to the Board ? At present, if there is a difference of opinion between the Commissioner and the head of a Department, an officer in the country who may be interested knows that he has the Public Service Commissioner fighting his case for him-; but in future, if this Bill is passed in its .present form, he will  have  no one. The head of the Department will make the appointment. I admit that at present our Departments are to some extent watertight in the matter .of appointments and promotions, and that amongst certain classes of clerks there is a good deal of dissatisfaction. This is especially noticeable when new Departments are created. Young, men who are fortunate enough to join a new Department rise rapidly with it, and in a. short time are in receipt of a considerably higher salary than is paid to other officers, equally capable, and who have seen much longer service in other Departments of the Service. Honorable senators have only to contrast the Taxation Department with the Post Office Department to realize this. </para>

                        <para>- Not at all. The Minister has cited the very case I wanted. I had not thought of mentioning Mr. Box's name. When I- was at the Post Office he came to me asd. said to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> wanted him as an assistant. He asked me if I had any objection to his going over to the Prime Minister's Department. I replied- that I had not the. slightest objection if it would help him in any way. He hesi bated at first. If he had remained- in the- Post Office he might have been occupying some responsible position, no doubt, but certainly would not have been where he is. to-day. lt is only fair that officers who have been many years in the Public Service should have an opportunity of transferring to new Departments, as they are created, and rising with them.. I was impressed a little while ago with the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> with regard to the conditions in the Australian Imperial Force during the war. </para>

                        <para>- I have too much respect for the Acting Public Service Commissioner to attribute to him any statement that may be doubtful, and,, therefore, I withdraw it absolutely. My experience is that the permanent head of a Department is. the best judge in the matter of promotion. The Board will not be- sufficiently in- touch with all the detail work of a Department to discharge this duty satisfactorily. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know just what form the inspection will take, but I presume it will be more or less specialized, and in this matter the Board will have a power of delegation. However, the head of the Department will not make permanent promotions. There will be promotion on probation for six months, during which time any officer of the PUb.die Service will have the right of appeal to the Board on the ground that he is better fitted for the position. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly, so. Ministers should have secretaries whose ability is undoubted. My secretary has had more to do with the commercial activities of the Government than, possibly, any other public servant, and, although the Defence Department would like him to be transferred to that branch where he was previously employed, I cannot consent, because he has had special training in connexion with wheat, wool, and metals. Exceptional opportunities may sometimes present themselves; but certain officers should not be appointed without the claims of others possessing similar qualifications being considered. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> complained of lh,e present "water-tight" system: but this Bill is framed with the idea of improving it, and an appeal can be made to the Board against what may be considered an unfair appointment. . It has been the practice in the past for appeals to be made to the Public Service Commissioner who was responsible for the appointments, and, although the work may have been conscientiously performed, it is undesirable for a man to consider an appeal against his own decision. Under the proposed system appeals will be made to an independent body, which should result in more contentment and increased efficiency in the Service. The provisions of this measure have been perused by the Acting Public Service Commissioner, representatives of returned soldiers' organizations, and of the public servants, and the measure is considered to be one that will give general satisfaction. It is not contended that the Bill is perfect, but a sincere attempt has been made to remove some of. the difficulties which at present exist. </para>

                        <para>- I am rather surprised to hear that, because heads of Departments always prefer to deal with promotions and appointments. They say they should be responsible for the selection of the officers who have to carry out the work in their Departments. Some time ago a Bill was introduced to give the Auditor-General the right that is being sought in this measure, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> and others opposed it. Is not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ewing</inline> fighting for this? </para>

If this provision is adopted heads of Departments will naturally wish to retain the services of the efficient men under their control, and there will be little likelihood of them being promoted to other Departments where progress may be more rapid. The Minister said that the Public Service Commissioner did not know anything of the capabilities of officers in outlying centres, but the Commissioner, through his inspectors, has an opportunity of becoming acquainted with their work. </para>

The Minister has said that it would be impossible for the Board to make itself acquainted with all the ramifications of the Service. Of course it would, unless there were inspectors, as under the present system.

It was deemed necessary, therefore, to bring in officers from other units, who were experienced, and in other respects also qualified, to take command of the battalions in question. So the principle became established - and I think rightly so - that the whole of the officers of the Australian Imperial Force should be regarded as being upon one regimental list. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The position that obtained in connexion with the Australian Imperial Force during the war is analogous to the present situation in the Public Service. There should be no water-tight compartments. "When a battalion went into battle and was decimated, young officers were rapidly promoted to positions of command. </para>

                        <para>- The result was that a young man, who started as a lieutenant, might quickly become a general; while a lieutenant in another battalion might only rise to be a major or a lieutenant-colonel. The Health Department is a new one, and I venture to say that, in eighteen months or two years, there will probably be some young officers who will have risen so rapidly in that Department that they will be getting a good deal more salary than other officers who were originally on the same level as themselves. The present clause would have the effect of intensifying that inequality. </para>

                        <para>- No; but complaints come from members of the Service who have not the advantage of being officers of the Central Administration, and under the observation of the permanent head of the Department and of the Minister. This is a very vital clause, and one deserving of a little more consideration than the Minister seems disposed to give it. I do not blame the Minister, ' because he has not had the experience of honorable senators who come from the more remote parts of the Commonwealth, where most of the grievances arise. Those of us who come from States removed from the seat of administration have, as constituents, officers of the Public Service whose claims we recognise, and whose ability and integrity we know to be not second to that of some of the most exalted officers of the Central Administration. </para>

                        <para>. - I have been at some trouble to read carefully the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> in support of this motion. I want to say, in the kindest possible way, that the proposition he put before the Senate is quite impracticable. All public works to cost over £25,000 have to be referred to the Public Works Committee. I trust that the work at the future Federal Capital city will not be slummed, and that a full and complete inquiry will be held by the Committee before it makes tts recommendations to the Government. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but I do not think it is intended that Parliament shall meet in tents or lean-to's. Although the accommodation will probably be of a temporary character, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> no doubt, intends that it should be reasonably comfortable. I do not think that it is possible for the Public Works Committee to complete the inquiry in the time desired. I have a very able report by the Federal Capital Advisory Committee, which says that the minimum of time required to provide a minimum of accommodation with anything like reasonable comfort will be three years. This Committee has done very good work, judging by an analysis of its report. It was asked to report on the time required for construction, and it stated - - </para>

The Committee says that it will be impossible to make the arrangements in less than three years, except at very heavy cost, particularly in view of the labour shortage and the high price of materials.

The construction of an outfall sewer does not complete the work, and to finish it will take a considerable time. It is impossible for the Government to accept the motion, because they do not think it is practicable. The Government does not want to baulk the natural aspirations of the representatives of New South Wales, or of the people of that State. Instead of the motion that has been submitted, I suggest that a motion on the following lines should be moved: - </para>

If the accommodation is temporary, at least it should be comfortable for both members of Parliament and officials. Reference has been made to what was done in America 150 years ago, but life was simple and sweet in those days, and not subject to the bustle and1 pressure of present-day existence. </para>

                            <para>- New South Wales senators, when they cannot secure all that they want, desire to obtain -the next best thing; and, no  doubt,  that is quite right for them. A number of statements, has been made by the  Hon.  Wm. Webster, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> referred, and to which probably some honorable senators from New South Wales may reply in the course of the debate. Some allegations have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster</inline> in regard to what has been done, and what he fears may be  done in the future. In dealing with the work that has been done, and the arrangements that were made when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> was brought out to Australia to undertake the building of the Capital city, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster,</inline> uses some rather strong language in regard to the officials of the Department, whom he charges with responsibility for the position in which Canberra is to-day, which, in his opinion, means a loss of .£500,000 of the money which has so far been spent upon it. </para>

His  colleagues, whom, I. fear, are also his nominees, also sign. This tribunal consists of  Colonel Owen,  one of his junior officers, 'a State officer, and apparently one outsider, virtually a departmental tribunal.

                            <para>- I do not know that it is the fault of the Government or of Victorians, but it seems to me that it is a case of finding the man next door nearer than the man in the next street. When -people on the spot can approach the Commonwealth Government and Parliament , we may expect them to do it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> knows that recently we had a delegation from Tasmania coming here to interview a Commonwealth Minister on a matter concerning that State, and I expect that some members of the Government are ready to thank God that Tasmania is not closer to them than Melbourne is, because they would, doubtless, have as much pressure put upon them by Tasmania as they are now subjected to from Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- It is to be hoped they got something for coming. Despite the fact that Ministers and members of Parliament receive a great deal of pressure from people in this State, they will agree that wherever the Seat of Government is established that kind of thing may be expected. Probably when we get to Canberra the pressure will be from those who are provided with gold passes, or who have plenty of money to spend on railway fares. With all the difficulties that have arisen, and despite the pressure brought to bear, we must still admit that the Commonwealth Parliament and Government have been very well treated in Victoria, and in view of the present financial stringency and the great expenditure during the last year, we ought to be very thankful that, as a Parliament, we are not put to much greater expense than we have to meet at the present time.

That statement is in keeping with the attitude adopted by Senators Wilson and Vardon when this matter was last under our consideration. Those honorable senators, like all intelligent people in the Commonwealth, pay an occasional pilgrimage to the queen city of the south - the city of Sydney - for the purpose, no doubt of enlightening their minds as to the most recent improvements in Australia, and educating themselves as to how things should be done.

To my mind it is a complete answer to the statements of my honorable friends who say that the people of New South Wales are not in earnest. They are very much in earnest in seeing that the obligations entered into by the Commonwealth are fully discharged. </para>

                            <para>- So far as the assembly of the next Federal Parliament at Canberra is concerned, I do not think it is, but I believe the Conference had in view the desirability of pointing out to certain honorable senators what their attitude as representatives of the people of the Commonwealth should be. I cannot understand the view of honorable senators from Souths Australia. The Commonwealth Government entered into a certain obligation with the State of South Australia, and a very considerable portion of that obligation has been discharged. The Government took over a white elephant in the Northern Territory that was costing South Australia tens of thousands, of pounds, every year, audi which, would have practically bankrupted that! State long, before now if. it had continued to " nurse the baby." The Commonwealth,, I repeat, took it over, and. has continued to administer its affairs at; an enormous loss every year, entirely in the interest of the people' of South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Well, I thought I might mention one obligation which the Commonwealth has discharged towards the. people, of South Australia in order that I might emphasize the need for the fulfilment of a prior, and I may add, a mace important; obligation, because it is constitutional - which the other was not - entered into between the Commonwealth and the people of New South Wales. So far it has not been fulfilled. We know, of course, that- because of the intervention of the war,, it was, not possible to continue with the building of the Capital city. But the war has- been over now for several years, and we should no longer hesitate. The cost of building is tumbling. Timber has fallen, and labour costs are coming down. In addition, there are enormous stacks of well-seasoned timber at Canberra. It is also possible to turn o.ut bricks, cheaper and better than in Tasmania or South Australia, and hundreds of thousands are ready. Where, then, is the need for all this quibbling about the cost of building? The. Advisory Committee which was appointed by the Government to inquire into- the position has advised that about, three years will elapse before the Federal Parliament can meet at Canberra. I do, not believe the necessary works could be completed earlier, but I am satisfied that if the Government enter into this business in the proper spirit it will be possible for the Federal Parliament to meet at Canberra in three years' time. As I have already pointed out, the cost of building is falling, and labour costs are also coming down. All over Australia thousands of returned soldiers are looking for employment. In what better way could they be engaged than in the construction of this great national work - the building of our Federal Capital? There need be no difficulty so far as labour is concerned. </para>

They could have been, trained, and put to work on the Federal Capital scheme. Indeed, I think it is' not too late even now to do something in that direction. </para>

                        <para>Something has been said about the circular letter sent to honorable senators by the  Hon.  William Webster, an ex-Postmaster-General, known to fame for his poetry, and altogether a very estimable gentleman. But, unfortunately, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster</inline> thinks if things are not done in just the way he wants them to be done they cannot be right. He had certain ideas concerning the building of the Federal Capital, and, as a member of the Cabinet, he attempted to have them carried out. Some were adopted, while others were not. Where the work was not done quite in accordance with his own ddeas, in his opinion it has not been done properly at all. But he is not alone in such egotism. I know other honorable gentlemen who, if they cannot get things all their own way, are firmly convinced that everything is not right. . It must be remembered, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster</inline> had nothing to say against the immediate construction of the Federal Capital. The most 'that he has said in his circular letter is that certain things have not been done properly, according to his point of view. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster</inline> is not a trained critic. He is not a builder. Neither is he an architect nor a constructional expert. Therefore he has no technical knowledge. </para>

                            <para>-  Colonel Owen is  only associated with theCommittee 'as a departmental officer, 'and for the purpose of co-ordinating the work of the Government Departments with the building schemes authorized by the Committee, the principal member of which is a man who has had very wide experience in other parts of the world. He has had ample opportunities in America to study just the class of work that is to be carried out at Canberra. He is a man with a very full knowledge of all details in connexion with -city building, and, with, his colleagues on the Committee, he is satisfied that the work already done at Canberra has been well done. The sewerage is ready, there is a magnificent water supply now available, the electrical and brickmaking plants are ready, and the roads have been constructed. In fact, everything is clear for the actual construction of the city itself, and New South Wales is now asking - I think I know the opinion of my State - that . the work . shall be proceeded wilh definitely. Do honorable senators think that we who represent New South Wales would concern ourselves in this matter to such an extent, and fight as we have been 'fighting of late, if we were not fully convinced that the people in New 'Soufi Wales were behind the -movement? We believe that at the next election they will he behind the party that is sincere in this matter, even if that party 'be the Labour party. It has been suggested that the Capital -city will never be built until a Labour 'Govemment gets into office. Sometimes I am almost afraid there may be something in that suggestion. At all events, 'the people of my 'State are determined that this constitutional obligation shall be carried -out, and I believe that they are prepared to do what they can to put in office, and continue to support, a 'Government that will do it. 'This is one of the biggest things, so far as our State is concerned, that we have 'had to face. </para>

If this is observed in  the  spirit as well as in the letter, there  is  no doubt that the Federal Capital will  be  established at Canberra within a very  few  years. In view of the attitude of the Government, and the support given to that attitude by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster,</inline> who has hitherto been a bitter opponent of the Federal Capital, I look forward with every confidence to taking part in a grand opening ceremony at the first meeting of the Parliament there before my time of office as a senator has expired. </para>

                            <para>- " King Charles' head " bobs up again. At present, we are needing money for many important Commonwealth public works ;  and  I have  been  informed in regard to telephonic . connexions that, after all the money allocated to the Postal Department this financial year has been spent, there will, still be 5,000 people waiting, for telephones. That is scandalous. When important public undertakings are being retarded, " patriotic " senators from New South Wales are urging the Government to expedite the establishment of a Federal Capital which is not required. In spite of the demand for increased postal, telephonic, and telegraphic facilities, these honorable senators are endeavouring to expedite this work, and £200,000 has been placed on the Estimates this year for that purpose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> in referring to South Australia, dealt with the question of the Northern Territory, and spoke as if the taking over of that Territory was a compact with South Australia; but the Commonwealth was anxious to take over the Northern Territory. </para>

                        <para>. -  As  a  senator representing New South Wales, I approach ' this matter from a broad national stand-point, and I hope to always approach all questions that come before this Senate in a similar spirit. During the four years I have been a member of the Senate, 1 have, from a broad national stand-point, recorded my vote to help the State of Tasmania, and my assistance will always be given to help a sister State when I think it is in the interest of the Australian nation. My vote has been recorded in favour of defraying out of Consolidated Revenue a yearly deficit of nearly £500,000 on the transcontinental railway, which links Western Australia with the eastern part of the continent. My vote has also been recorded in favour of paying out of Consolidated Revenue the money to meet the very heavy deficit in connexion with the Commonwealth's administration of the Northern Territory; and I have also supported proposals for taxing the whole of the people of Australia in order to preserve the Queensland sugar industry. Probably next week I shall be on the horns of a dilemma in deciding whether I shall support an import duty of1d. per lb. on bananas in order to preserve another Australian State industry. </para>

                            <para>- New South Wales is peopled by at least 40 per cent, of the total population of the Commonwealth, who pay 42 per cent, of all the taxation derived in the Commonwealth, and that State does most to fill the overflowing coffers that the Commonwealth Government have had during the last few years. In view of this, the people of New South Wales regard any permanent dispossession of the Capital city, provided for in the Constitution, as a breach of faith, and it may be considered more than that in the not distant future. It may be a <inline font-style="italic">casus belli</inline> against the rest of the Commonwealth. As I have said, I desire to approach this question from the broad national stand-point. </para>

                            <para>- I merely mentioned something that may occur without my assistance if the strong feeling which exists in the mother State is consistently ignored and flouted. I believe one of the many reasons why the people of New South Wales are united in this connexion is because of the disabilities under which they labour owing to the Seat of Government being in Melbourne. It can readily be seen that if a State in which nearly one-half of the population of the Commonwealth reside is treated indifferently in consequence of the administrative Departments being centralized in Melbourne, that dissatisfaction will prevail and increase. That centralization results, too, in the corridors being filled by the inhabitants of this fair State. We see evidences in  the Melbourne press every day of the unfairness with which Federal matters are treated. Seeing that the time is now fully ripe to take into serious consideration, not only the construction, but the completion, of the Federal Capital, I ask myself what judgment one should come to on the matter. I am with the Minister in believing that the suggestion of my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> to go to Canberra in the next session is impracticable. A practical problem has been suggested by the report recently issued by the Advisory Committee. On that report, and <inline font-style="italic">apropos</inline> of the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster,</inline> and the criticism of an ex-Minister, I am not altogether satisfied with the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of that Committee. From its inception I was of the opinion that no officers of the Department concerned should have been appointed, to it.. It should have been an independent body, representative to an even, greater extent than, it is now of outside opinion and experience. No departmental officers should be placed! in the invidious position of sitting in judgment on their own work. The Commonwealth owns in the Federal Territory an area of nearly 1,000 square miles - not the minimum of 100 square miles, as provided for by the Constitution. Our proposition is to obtain revenue to balance the expenditure, as far as possible. We shall get no revenue- by the present dilettante methods which so often lead to- report after report, and  imbroglio  after  imbroglio.  For four years I have been in this Parliament, and after oceans of reports, and all sorts of recriminations Between the parties concerned, professional jealousies, and piquant personalities, .we have arrived at the stage,. T think, when this Parliament is unanimous, and will be unanimous, in- insisting that we get en with the work of establishing- the Capital at- a reasonable rate. While doing so we should have value for the money expended; and within a minimum, certainly, of three years, and perhaps a maximum of five, we should be able to legislate in our own hall, free and un-trammelled by any of the sectional State interests by which we are at present surrounded. </para>

                            <para>- I disagree entirely to that suggestion. If the work progresses at a reasonable rate, some return on the money already expended should begin to come in within a year. I am not satisfied with the rate of progress made at the Capital site during the last twelve months. Honorable senators will remember that, after a good deal of argument, a majority was obtained in both Houses, on division, to re-start the Federal Capital works, and to spend for the then current financial year, which ended on the 30th June last, the sum of £150,000. </para>

                            <para>- There was some opposition, and there was a division, and those in favour of going on with the building of the Capital forthwith were in a handsome majority in both Houses. Following on the vote for £150,000, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was good enough to interest himself personally in connexion with the continuation of the building of the Capital. I was one of a party that went there with the Prime Minister, the Minister for Home and Territories, and the Minister for Works and Railways, for the express purpose of deciding on some plan by which the £150,000 could be best expended in the financial year: I think it was fairly unanimously decided by all of us, including the Works Director, the Commonwealth Surveyor-General, and one or two experts who accompanied us, that the money should be spent in the erection of a Convention Hall, a Hostel, and a number of workmen's cottages, and by making miles of roads, doing a good deal of tree-planting, and also by purchasing from the Imperial Government, the internment camp at Molonglo for the temporary housing accommodation, for a few years at all events, of the many hundreds of workmen intended to be employed. </para>

                            <para>-  I do not wish to be side-tracked into an argument with the honorable senator. I wish to deal with what has actually occurred in connexion with the proposal for the erection of the Federal Capital. All those things were decided last November, and were acquiesced in and approved by the Director of Works, and the Commonwealth Surveyor-General, but I do not believe the roofs are on ten out of the many cottages that were to be built. Certainly a little rood-making has been, done, and a little tree-planting. But I believe a great number of trees had to be burnt, because there was no use for them. It is true that the internment camp has been bought, and the money paid to the British Government, but I understand that not even the plans and the designs for the Convention Hall and the Hostel are completed. </para>

                            <para>- I believe it was, and I say unhesitatingly that, should a Convention be called in the not distant future, the most spectacular and most reasonable place to hold it would be in a hall built in the Federal Territory, and there only should we be away from, the sectional influences which so often affect the deliberations of the National Parliament. Now we are in the year of our Lord 1921, and it is the month of November, which is the last month but one of the year. In spite of all the talk and efforts of the last three years, and in spite of the decision of Parliament itself, if the work at Canberra does not progress any faster than it has up to the present we shall not be there for twenty years. I believe the whole control of the erection of the Capital city will have to be reorganized. The present position is exceedingly unsatisfactory, so far as the  representatives  from New South Wales are concerned. There appears to me to be the mailed fist, the cloven foot, or the clutching hand still overshadowing the proposition. I would like to see some business men in control of the whole enterprise, with instructions from this Parliament to carry on the work to the extent of the money voted, and on the basis of the plan decided by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> Burley Griffin. </para>

There is a very strong feeling indeed in Sydney amongst architects in connexion with Government work. Does the honorable senator realize that the Commonwealth is spending millions of money on buildings to-day, and there is not one competitive architectural design called for ? The whole of the work is done in the Department by an attenuated staff. The same conditions may obtain in connexion with the work at Canberra. We know what human nature is. The only hope for Canberra is to get more outside business assistance than it has today. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps so, but I do not think the New South Wales representatives would be satisfied to leave the matter to the business men of Melbourne. I am altogether dissatisfied with the laboured results of Canberra up to date. I am sure that it is not the fault of the Prime Minister. Parliament has voted the money. There is a hitch somewhere, and a hitch will not do for New South Wales. I want to say quite frankly that Parliament will do the fair thing this year in the present state of the finance if it votes for Canberra the £200,000 which is on the Estimates. I believe it. did the fair thing last year in voting £150,000 proposed by the Government, but I would like to see something substantial obtained for the money that is spent. The longer the time the works are spread over the greater the amount of money that is frittered away. The land ordinances have been issued; they provide for an immediate revenue if the development of the Capital is attractive enough, to bring people there to build on their own account, and to lease land from the Commonwealth. It has been stated, I believe, with much proof, that when the Capital is. well advanced we shall receive a very substantial sum indeed in rents from the land - a sum that will go a long way towards meeting the interest on the money that will be spent there. I support the amendment, and I hope that my honorable colleague from New South Wales will accept it. I hope it will be unanimously carried by the Senate, .in the national spirit in which these deliberations ought to be conducted. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that we cannot commit ourselves to any speculative expenditure just now. Our attitude towards the Capital, in post-war days, must of- necessity be quite different from our attitude before the war. I believe that the people of New South Wales will be satisfied if they see that there is not merely an earnest and sincere desire to proceed with the Capital, but that the work is actually going on. I want to remind my colleagues? that not only has a resolution been placed before honorable senators from a National Conference, but that a large public meeting was held not long ago in the Sydney Town Hall for the purpose of urging upon the Government the necessity of expediting the erection of the Federal Capital. At that meeting the principal  speaker  was our late friend, the honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> J. Ryan, who spoke for, and on behalf of, the Labour party. The town hall was packed. At the meeting a resolution was passed, and indorsed by the Labour leaders of New South Wales, that the Government should be urged to complete the Federal Capital quickly. It is an obligation which this Parliament owes to the whole of the people of New South Wales. Not only the honorable senators who represent New South Wales, but the representative organizations of that State expect that the compact will be kept ; but it is not asked that it shall be more than reasonably kept. The definition of " reasonable " in this matter is a "steady, solid, real progress towards the ultimate completion of the Capital," and a progress accelerated in certain directions to enable members of the National Parliament to meet at Canberra at a reasonably early date. </para>

                        <para>. - I think I have already defined my position fully, but I want to emphasize again that we have got to make haste slowly with regard to the building of the Capital. I want it to be distinctly understood that, in voting for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster's</inline> amendment, I put emphasis on the words "earliest practicable date." Like all members of the Senate, I have no desire, when the time becomes opportune, not to carry out the obligation that Australia has entered into. As I stated when speaking on this matter on the last occasion, when Australia entered into this compact it was only burdened with a debt of £9,000,000 ; it is now burdened with a debt which saddles the community with £60,000,000 of taxation annually. With the markets for our products depressed, is this not a time for honorable senators to stop and think seriously before voting large sums of money for works which can be put aside for the present, at all events? I take very strong exception to the action of the Association in New South Wales that has addressed honorable senators in a "stand and deliver" attitude. Unfortunately, I am not a member of the Association. I am rather, sorry for the Association. </para>

The statement made by me has been justified and amplified by the documents which honorable senators have received. </para>

                        <para>. - I am very glad to have had the opportunity of bringing my motion before the Senate. I. desire to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> whose motion had precedence of mine on the business-paper, for being good enough to give way to me this evening, in order that the debate on my motion might be concluded. I have accepted the amendment for a reason somewhat different from that which has commended it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon. Senator Vardon</inline> has accepted it because he is not in favour of my motion. I have accepted it because I do not think I could carry my motion, and it is' wise, in the circumstances, that I should accept the next best thing. I am prepared to admit that if work3 to be carried out at Canberra must undergo investigation by the Public Works Committee, it would be impossible for us to call the next session of Parliament at the Federal Capital. I shall not further refer to the Public Works Committee now, as I have a separate motion on the paper dealing with it. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The main objection raised to my motion to-night and when it was first discussed is that we have not the mo. <inline font-style="italic">"j</inline> now to give it effect. It is somewhat comical, when we come to consider where this objection comes from. Of all the money which will be spent at Canberra, 43 per cent, will come from the people of New South Wales, and 37 "'per cent, from the people of Victoria. I will say this to the honour of the Victorians, that during the debate on my motion not a single word has been uttered by a Victorian senator against our going to Canberra. One member of the Ministry who spoke today is a representative of Victoria, and said that he is in f avour of going there as soon as possible. Not one word of protest against expenditure at Canberra has come from Victorian senators. </para>

                            <para>- One cannot but be amused at the source of the objection to the motion on the ground of expense. Let me remind honorable senators that last year we had to meet a loss of £500,000 on the East-West railway. Western Australia and South Australia derive most benefit from that railway, yet New South Wales has to pay 43 per cent, of the annual loss upon it. The representatives of South Australia come along and say, "We cannot go to Canberra yet because of the expense." Four or five men in Adelaide have not yet had their telephones installed, and until they are supplied with telephones we cannot raise money for expenditure on the Federal Capital. </para>

A certain amount of revenue is coming from the Territory now, and a good deal more will be derived from it in the future. I have it on the authority of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> who was Premier, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cann,</inline> who was Minister of Works in New South Wales" at the time when the Federal Territory was handed over to the Commonwealth - and I am justified in using their names,, because I have their authority to do so - that, had they known that it would be twenty years before the Seat of Government would be transferred to Canberra, they, as members of the New South Wales Government, would never have agreed to hand over that area. </para>

I do not wish to take up any further time. I have been looking up the exact definition of the words"early" and "practicable." I find that. the dictionary meaning of " early " is"soon, betimes," and. ''practicable"" means "capable of being put into practice, done, or accomplished." I thereforeasume that the expression " the earliest, practicable time " means the earliest time that it is possible to be done. I have said that I am glad that the discussion has taken place, and I trust that the motion, as amended, will be carried unanimously, because it will definitely commit the Senate to the resolution that every practical effort will be made to get to Canberra at the. earliest possible time. </para>

                    <para class="block">This motion is merely a sequence of a policy which I have numbly, but I venture to say persistently, advocated as worthy of adoption by the Australian people. Honorable senators will remember how particularly solicitous I have been for some years past to indicate to the Australian people how desirable it is that they should orient themselves, so to speak, towards the people of the United States of America, with whom we were on the best possible terms, and in regard to whom- we stood in the most satisfactory relationship. There have been, unfortunately, occasions of friction between the Great Republic of the West and the people of the United Kingdom, but nothing of the' sort has ever taken place between the Australian people and the people of the United States of America. Whilst we have the most friendly feelings towards the people of America, we have, of course, a full and implicit allegiance to the people of the United Kingdom, from which the great majority of the inhabitants of the Australian 'Commonwealth derive their ancestry. We can,  so to speak, while extending the hand of sympathy and support to- the Mother Country in her trials, extend the other hand of fellowship and fraternity to the people of 'the United States of America, and on all occasions can be a most influential factor in removing causes of acerbity which perhaps may arise through circumstances of time and chance, between the1 people of the United Kingdom and those of the United States of America. </para>
                    <para>I do not, of course, wish to go outside the limits of my somewhat voluminous motion,- but it will be remembered that even before the war I was particularly insistent upon this policy of a good understanding between the people of the Commonwealth and the people of the Republic of the West. I have been particularly solicitous because long before she was given that diplomatic status which was accorded to her by the Peace Conference, when she was made one of the1 signatories to the Peace Treaty, I foresaw that the importance of Australia in the world was such that she should be accorded, and should secure for herself," diplomatic representation at Washington. I have from time to time delivered myself in this chamber on subjects of great importance to- Australia, which might be characterized by the .general term of Pacific questions. The unfortunate world-wide war took place, and although we have come out of it victors, the economic condition of the world is such that we may say, as was said of Napoleon's army after the battle of Borodino, " Fate had fixed upon the victor half undone." All the nations' of the -world associated with us in the last great victory are economically half undone. In consequence of this the present  President  of the United States of America, seeing that .perhaps the attitude of the 'great Republic had not altogether commended itself to the peoples of the civilized world, has determined to take time and occasion by the forelock, and has convened a Conference which, has for its avowed object the averting of what I have had, unfortunately, to tell honorable senators and the people of Australia was to be regarded as present in the offing, namely, another war. No higher and no more practical objective in the interests of humanity could be held in view than that which is to be placed before the Conference which will meet at "Washington on 11th November, namely, the securing by some practical means to the harassed and tried people of the world that peace which is necessary for us to prosecute those ideals of civilization which undoubtedly are dear to the hearts of most of the nations of the earth. </para>
                    <para>I have privately and publicly been supporting the action of the Government in Bending <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to Washington. Australia ought to be represented there. It is being represented in a somewhat indirect method, for which I do not intend to blame the United  States Government. Were we the governing authority in America, we would probably have taken the same stand, and regarded the British Empire as a diplomatic entity, although in other respects it may Be considered as a society of nations. But, internationally it is a diplomatic entity, excepting that the Dominions were allowed to become independent signatories to the Peace Treaty. America, no doubt, desires to clarify the position. Evidently the view is held that separate representation of the British Dominions at the Conference' would be  regarded as a source of friction. It is to make a dignified declaration as to the rights of the people of Australia, but in a full sense of friendship with  the  people of th.e United States of America, that I desire the Senate to support the motion. Its indorsement will enable our delegate to convey to the Conference a correct and dignified expression of the sentiments of the Australian people as recorded by this, the highest Chamber of the highest Parliament in 'the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>The importance of this matter can be gauged by public deliverances within the past few days. In the press of to-day there appears an important statement from General Smuts, who expresses, as I do, the most earnest hopes as Ito the outcome of the deliberations at Washington. He declares that the British Dominions should have been directly represented at the Conference, particularly in view of the fact that they were given separate diplomatic representation, so to speak, in the signing of the Peace Treaty. I myself would have preferred that to be clone, but I have already indicated what I think are possibly the reasons, and what, I believe, is possibly the stand-point of the United States Government in the matter. These questions of diplomacy are very intricate and many sided. Important though the Dominions may be to the British Empire, if they were accorded separate diplomatic representation at the Washington Conference, beyond all doubt there would be protests from some of the minor nations that would be ' represented there by one, two, or possibly three, delegates. </para>

All the delegates will attend in their respective capacity, in response to an invitation from the United States Government, which stands in the relation of an influential and powerful host to his friends. The rules of etiquette governing the matter are precisely those which would govern an invitation issued by a hospitable and wealthy man to his friends from far and near. </para>

                    <para>Whatever may be urged against it, this Senate is, I venture to say, the foremost body in Australian politics. In regard to i every important question demanding consideration by a legislative body, the Senate has never failed. to indicate to the nation' the right course to be taken. This Chamber, years ago, by a resolution, passed without a dissenting voice, affirmed the necessity for the separate diplomatic representation of Australia at Washington. In that matter it received very little support from the press of the Commonwealth. The debates of this influential Chamber were hardly reported. Yet when the  President  of the United States convened "the Conference, shortly to be held at Washington, there was a general "chorus of journalistic approval of the suggestion for separate representation at the place which, for the moment, is regarded as the hub of the diplomatic universe, so to speak. This Chamber was the first legislative body to recognise the serious nature of the war in which Australia, as one of the Dominions of the Empire, was engaged. This Chamber realized, earlier than the legislative authorities in Great Britain, the possibilities of that great struggle. Many measures which Great Britain had to adopt in order to secure victory and avoid defeat, which was only narrowly averted, were first suggested in this Chamber. Prior to the meeting of the Imperial Conference a few months ago, the Treaty agreement existing between Great Britain and Japan, so far as concerns its relationship to Australian interests, was very substantially queried in this Chamber. We debated here the question whether its renewal was desirable or necessary. Although the opinions of honorable senators on this subject have not been fully conveyed to the Australian people by the important journals of the Commonwealth, we find now that some of the most influential Dominions of the Empire are in favour of the abrogation of the Treaty. Indeed, we have a journalist, a Peer of the Realm, going right up the coasts of Australia and out on the eastern coast of Asia, proclaiming in all his newspapers in the thunder tones of international journalism that it is desirable to abrogate the Treaty. All I say is that I hope the forthcoming Conference will result in a wider, more comprehensive, and -more humane understanding than at present exists between the British Empire, America, and Japan. I believe that is one pf the objects which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harding</inline> had in view when he issued the invitation. I ask no more than to see this continent, which is only thinly peopled by less than 6,000,000 of people, endowed by fate and by the wit of man with a long period of peace, during which we may be able to develop, satisfactorily to ourselves and with admiration from the rest of the world, those resources which we in no small measure possess. No jingoistic policy do I advocate. I am not one of those who desire to see the people of Australia marching, like the ancient people of Rome, to extend their deadly might over all the nations of the earth. . No. I ask only that our politics, both external and internal, shall be such that we may be able to prosecute our industries and our current economic life in peace; that we may be able to hold all we possess for the purpose of developing those national ideals which, notwithstanding anything that may be said against them, have inherently in them much that is practical, much that is valuable, and a great deal of that which is very noble. </para>

Outside the people of the Mother Country, we are on greater terms of affection with, and we have a more fraternal feeling towards, the people of the United States of America than any other nation in the world. Their Democracy is like ours. I believe those Americans who are most competent to judge, acclaim us as having a better and more democratic constitution and legislative system than they themselves possess.

                    <para>Long ago the United States of America, by an unfortunate combination of circumstances, so far as our Mother Country is concerned, erected themselves into what is known as the American Republic, and' though the Constitution under which the economic and legislative life of the United States of America has developed was framed nearly a century and a half ago, it was selected as the model for the Australian Commonwealth, and a very good model it is. It has enabled the 3,500,000 people who constituted the thirteen States, or the revolting colonies as they were termed, to become the most influential and powerful nation in the world. That being so, very little, I think, can be said against the Constitution. It cannot be said, for instance, that it has hampered or restricted the energies of its people. And the Constitution which we have adopted has served us very well indeed up to the present time. </para>
                    <para>The first clause of my motion is an affirmation of approval of the United States of America, through its  President,  for having convened the Conference, and it differentiates, as honorable senators will understand, slightly - I think it is wise thus to differentiate - between the feelings we entertain for the American people, and our feelings of friendliness towards the other nations that will be represented at Washington. Other nations are, of course, composed of human beings with whom we wish to be on the most friendly terms; but the people of the United States are, to a large extent, our own kith and kin, bone of our bone, blood of our blood, and flesh of our flesh. Although it is true - and this is admitted by a number of the American people - that there is a large percentage of blood of foreign peoples in . that of the people of tha United States of America, this fact cannot be gainsaid, that the governing strain is decidedly that which has been derived from the people, of the United Kingdom before and since the days of severance. There have been only two American Presidents with foreign names. The names of the Presidents from the beginning to the present day, with the exception of two, have been distinctly English or Anglo-Saxon, or whatever we may call the people of the British Isles. (So it is only right and seemly in every respect that we should differentiate between our feeling for and attitude towards the people of the United States of America and those of other nations of the earth. Consequently, I have endeavoured to express that particular shade of difference by saying that the Senate of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, expresses the most fraternal feelings towards the  President,  Congress, and the people of the United States of America, and full friendship for all nations which are to be represented at the Conference. </para>
                    <para class="block">I need hardly say that we are also interested in the welfare of all those nations which may not be directly represented. I wish to indicate to the United States of America that the people of Australia, through their Senate, have a very keen appreciation of their importance in regard to this matter, and of the importance of an ^ decisions -in connexion with the problems to be considered. Paragraph 2 of the motion reads - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That, while observing that representation at the Conference a deliberative entity has not been accorded to the Australian Commonwealth, the Senate declares its keen and full consciousness of the fact that the interests of Australia in the questions to be discussed at the Conference, particularly those affecting land south of the equator, is not inferior in degree and importance to that of any nation which will be represented by a special delegation. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That, I venture to assume, as far as my knowledge of the English language will permit, is a keen, pertinent, and dignified expression of the attitude, of the people of Australia in respect of special representation at the Conference. I desire also to express my sense of appreciation of the attitude of the British Government in this regard. When it discovered that the Dominions of the Empire were not to be accorded separate representation, it extended an invitation to the Commonwealth, New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada to be represented on the delegation which would represent the British Empire as a whole. Notwithstanding that I would have preferred - and I wish the American people to understand this so far as my utterances may reach them - that Australia had been invited by the United- States of America to send a delegation, just as she was permitted to be a special signatory to the Peace Treaty. Paragraph 3 of the motion reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">We would be indeed foolish if we did not - and, if it deems any action indicated by the participants at the Conference as conducive to  the attainment of the great objective of world peace and more friendly international intercourse, will accord its full support. </para>
                    <para class="block">We, the representatives of the Australian people in the Senate, tender to the American people that expression of opinion, which will be a very ample commendation of the objective of the Conference, if such happens to be necessary; but we reserve to ourselves, as the representatives of the people of the Australian Commonwealth, the power of confirmation or of rejection of any of the decisions that may be arrived at. The Australian people and their representatives, notwithstanding anything that may be said in derogation of such representation, are not fools, and can easily discriminate between decisions conducive to the world's peace and those which may be fruitful of that discord which we all hope may be averted. </para>
                    <para>If the Senate, in its wisdom, sees fit to agree to this motion, I think we ought to accord another place the courtesy of its concurrence. In a moment of  forgetfulness  I did not add to the motion a paragraph to that effect, and I shall ask the Senate to grant me permission to make that addition at a proper time and in a proper way. </para>
                    <para>I prefaced my remarks by saying that I believed honorable senators individually and collectively have already formed opinions in regard to this great question, and, that being so, it is unnecessary for mo to labour it. The hour is late. I have explained the motives which have inspired me in submitting the motion to the 'Senate, the principal of which are to express to the American people our fraternal regards towards them, our admiration for the motives which inspired their Government in calling this Conference, and an indication of our full determination to support our representative in the direction that will tend to secure the high objective of the Conference to bring about what may well be termed a true and holy alliance in the interests of the world's peace, and in the general welfare of mankind. </para>
