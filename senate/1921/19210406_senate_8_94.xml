A funeral service was held in the Queen&#39;s Hall on the same day, and the body was then taken to Adelaide. Upon behalf of the Senate, I conveyed an expression of sympathy to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Guthrie</inline> and family, pending the more formal resolution of the Senate, and I journeyed to Adelaide to represent the Senate at the funeral. This course I pursued, feeling assured that it would meet the wishes of the Senate. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline>whose loss we mourn, rendered distinguished public service in the Commonwealth and the State for something over a quarter of a century. He rendered no less useful service outside the Parliaments of which he was an honoured member, in his association with the big industrial movement of which he was so conspicuous a leader. In that service, as we who were privileged to meet him here can bear testimony, he was at all times animated by the highest conceptions of public duty and patriotism. In the expression of his views, he was always frank and manly, and, above all, courageous. In dealing with his public service, I cannot refrain from a reference to that stupendous piece of legislation, the Navigation Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> who was peculiarly equipped by his intimate knowledge of the subject, threw himself with tireless energy into the shaping of that measure, and followed it, clause by clause and line by line, during its very prolonged passage through this Chamber. Throughout the debates, which will remain in the memory of many of us, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> by the knowledge to which I have referred, and by his broad and humane views, did much to secure in that measure provisions which made for the safety and the comfort alike of the public and of the crews of the vessels.  His  technical knowledge was of immense value to the Senate, and if he had rendered no other public service than the assistance he gave in the shaping of that measure, he did enough there to secure for himself a lasting monument in the thoughts and hearts of those whom he benefited by his work on that occasion. But there is another aspect in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> memory will remain with us, and that is our private associa tion with him. Naturally, in Parliament, there are differences of views, but there was no difference of personal feeling towards <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> himself. This Chamber consists of thirty-six members, and I venture the statement that thirtyfive of them were his very warm friends and admirers. I think I may go further and say that in the larger world outside <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> had innumerable friends, and I doubt if he had a single enemy. The memory of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> whom we were always delighted to call &#34; Bob &#34; Guthrie, is not merely that of a fellow legislator, but also that of a man whose friendship it was a privilege to claim, and that memory will remain with us, I hope, for many years to come. The latter portion of the motion refers to those he leaves behind. Our sympathy will go out to them. It will not account perhaps for much; but it may do a little to remove a shadow from a sorrowing home, and to lift a cloud of grief from hearts which are sorely stricken. </para>

          <para>. -  In seconding the motion moved in such suitable and excellent language by the Leader of the Government in this Chamber, I. associate myself with the sentiments he has expressed. In common with . him, and with all the members of the Senate, particularly thosewho were associated with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator R.</inline> S: Guthrie for. many years, I feel deeply and earnestly the severe loss the Senate has suffered by his sad and tragic end. It was my good fortune, in party and other places, to be very closely associated with the late senator. The Leader of the Government has fittingly referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> great labours on behalf of that industrial section of the community, the seamen, and it was to them, indeed, that one might say that he gave the best part of his life, working with a strenuousness, ability, and industry that we all, at all times, admired. When the news of his sudden death came, I felt it as a very great shock. I join with the Leader of the Government in everything that he has said about the late senator, and in his expressions&#39; of sympathy with the loved ones left behind. We here, who knew him, not only admired, but loved him. How much more greatly then will the loss be felt in that home which knew him so much better than we did? &#60; Personally, I shall always look back with feelings of pleasure to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> more youthful days, When he was actively and strenuously engaged on behalf of that particular section of the working classes to whom he devoted so much of his life. </para>

          <para>. -  As one who knew the late senator for some thirty-one years, I rise to support the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen and seconded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner..</inline> When we recall the fact that at our last meeting in this chamber, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator R.</inline> S. Guthrie was full of cheerfulness and abounding in life, with, I suppose, no thought in his mind that his end was so near, it makes us reflect upon the wellknown words of Edmund Burke: &#34;What shadows we are, and what shadows we pursue!&#34; Since we last met here, a very notable figure, not only in the Senate, but in the public life of Australia, has been removed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> sudden end. I was particularly struck by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> early struggles, for the reason that I happen to know a little about them. Some thirty-one years &#39;ago, the late .senator was an obscure figure in this country, but by virtue of the inherent qualities that it was well-known he possessed, he raised himself from that obscurity to one of the highest positions in the gift of the people. The contemplation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> life, and of what he achieved by his inherent virtues, must bring home to us the boundless opportunities that exist in this country, and make us feel that it. is indeed a good country to be in, and that we are fortunate to be in it. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> landed in this country he, as well as many others here, had neither a lengthy purse, social status, nor influential friends to help him forge his way along in life, but he possessed those rather rare and golden qualities which help to make a man amongst a  Body  of men. He therefore marched along, and as he progressed, stage by stage, in popular favour, he never, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has rightly said, forfeited the good-will of any person disposed to approach the consideration of his character with an unbiased mind. He helped, as I am aware, to raise the seamen of this country, that body of workmen with whom he was so long associated, from a lowly and unsatisfactory position to that which they now enjoy. Moreover, he assisted them, in an associated and collective sense, at a time when they were absolutely helpless. That was the condition of the seamen at a time when this great and good man, who has been removed from us, took their cause in hand with such satisfactory results. Their conditions have so improved that to-day they are the best paid and the most satisfied body of seamen in any part of the known world that I am aware of. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> appeal was always to reason; never to force. By virtue of his political sanity and the dispassionate manner in which he discharged his duties as a legislator, he was able to accomplish- so much for our seamen. He is mourned to-day,- and rightly so, .by all seafaring men; and although in his latter days he  was thrust aside, as these new young men arose, I am satisfied that, when the time comes to assess properly the progress made by the Australian seamen under the leadership of a man who may be regarded as the Samuel Plimsoll of Australia and the progress under the leadership of these new young men, of whom I speak, the historian will record a heavy balance in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> otherwise known as &#34; Bob &#34; Guthrie. Of hie private life, I can only say that he was an exemplary figure within his own household. Socially speaking, as has been well said by the previous speakers, we all liked to&#39; meet him, for he had the sun shining in his eyes, and he earned nobody  &#39;6  ill-will. His opinions were always expressed in the straightest and most unequivocal language. I was pleased to be associated with him as a member of the Labour party, as a worker in the industrial arena , and pleased still more to meet him here on common ground as a member of this Senate. I re-echo all that has been said  bv  the previous speakers. The Senate has been much impoverished by his removal. In all sincerity I indorse -what has been previously said in regard to the loss which this country and the Senate have sustained, and I join in the message of condolence to his bereaved relatives. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator R.</inline>S. Guthrie. It was my privilege to have his acquaintance for over a quarter of a century, and during that period I came to know something of the strenuous work he did on behalf of his fellow-craftsmen of the sea. As a member of the South Australian Parliament he worked just as strenuously in the interests of that section of the people to which he belonged, and, indeed, for the whole community, as he did during his later association with us in the Senate. As the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> has properly observed, one of the greatest monuments - possibly the greatest - that could ever be erected to his memory is to be found in our Navigation Act. It has been well said of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that no one had any occasion ever to doubt where he stood. He. was always straightforward and candid in his criticism of those with whom&#39; he differed, as well as in his expression of confidence in those with whom he agreed. But whilst he ploughed that straight furrow, as it were, during the whole of his public life, I feel that I am quite&#39; safe in saying that he left not one single enemy behind him on earth. During recent years he and his family suffered sad bereavements in the loss of two sons at the war. This probably had something to do with his failing health, which; as we who were intimately associated with him knew, had not been so good of late years. I desire to express with the previous speakers, my sympathy with his widow and her family in their sad bereavement.I feel confident that as the years roll on the late honorable senator&#39;s name will be honoured even more, if that were possible, than it was during the period of his public life in the Commonwealth. I join in the expressions of regret at his untimely end, and  tru3t  that anything that may be said or done here to-day will help to lighten the blow that has fallen upon those whom he has left behind. </para>

        <para class="block">Right through his life, he was a man who could be loved and trusted without reservation; a man who, as the years rolled on, seemed to grow broader and bigger. He was probably one of the biggest little men that we have ever had in Australian public life. The calamity that severed our happy friendship - that clouded our lives for the time being - struck deeply all those who were associated with him.  His  end was so unexpected, that it was hard to realize we should not see his cheery face again.  His  death came as a sad blow to all who knew him in South Australia. Nothing could have been more pathetic, as the funeral procession moved down towards the last resting place of the late honorable senator, than the spectacle of large numbers of seamen in Port Adelaide reverently acknowledging the loss which they had sustained by his death. We who were associated with him in the Senate know how unsparing he was with his help, and how devoted he was in anything he undertook to do. Those who had the pleasure of working with him as a comrade could never have wished for a more faithful or more generous helper. He was true to his mates, just as he was true to those with whom he worked in the larger sphere all through his life. To his wife and family we can do little more than convey our appreciation of the character he left behind, and associate ourselves with them in the sense that we feel his loss,&#39; and mourn his passage from us. </para>
