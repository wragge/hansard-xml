                    <para>- I wish to know from the Minister for Repatriation if he is in sympathy with the suggestion that every complaint made by a returned soldier should be dealt with on its merits, and not solely in accordance with hard and fast regulations. From my experience there are many cases which might be satisfactorily dealt with on their merits by the exercise of a little give and take which cannot be satisfactorily dealt with if the regulations are rigidly applied. </para>

                    <para>- It is not possible to answer the honorable senator&#39;s question. The War Service Homes scheme is a business proposition, as it should be ; but if, in the effort to consider a case on its merits, and not on business principles, sentiment were allowed to exercise too great an influence, it would obviously become a benevolent institution rather than a business proposition. </para>

                        <para>- Then I beg <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Adamson&#39;s</inline> pardon.  His  suggestion is in accordance with the principle which underlies the Repatriation Act, but where there are certain definite prohibitions and directions in that Act, it would not be right or proper for the Commissioners to take the responsibility of violating the provisions of the measure. The proper course would be for Parliament to amend it if it requires amending. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable senator, as an old parliamentarian, knows that he has put a question to me that is extremely difficult to answer. I can only tell him the probabilities of the case. It is anticipated that in another place the Estimates will be dealt with before the House rises to-night, or at least to-morrow. In that case, the Appropriation Bill will be available for the consideration of the Senate next week. Later on I shall ask honorable senators to consider the question of meeting next week before Wednesday. If honorable senators are of opinion that by meeting on Tuesday we shall be able to finish the business which the Government will invite them to undertake next week, I shall ask them to meet on that day. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Lynch</inline> and others desire that we should meet on Monday next week, the Government will raise no objection. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Minister, for Repatriation, as representing the Government in this Chamber, whether he does not think that the Government forgot themselves a little at the function which was held last night in honour of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook, the High Commissioner. The selection of speakers on the occasion would lead to the impression that such a Chamber as this does not exist. In view of the fact that this is not the first time something similar has occurred, and that the Government have an infinitely greater following in this Chamber than in another place, I ask whether at the next function of the kind some indication will be afforded of the manner in which the Government propose to select speakers in order that members of the Senate shall be in a position to decide whether, as self-respecting members of this Parliament, they can attend the function at all? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s question reminds me that Ministers were engaged with members of this Chamber last night in very solemn communion, which, I hope, resulted profitably to those who were present. I know nothing as to the arrangement for speakers. I take the liberty of doubting if any arrangement were made, for the reason that, as honorable senators are aware, Ministers, and particularly the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> have, during the last few days, scarcely had a moment to call their own. I am sure that, in the circumstances, no honorable senator would think of finding fault with the Prime Minister in connexion with the matter. </para>

                                <para>- I am quite certain that the Prime Minister did not contemplate any slight upon the Senate. I understand that he looked to me to speak for this Chamber. Circumstances prevented me from being present, and, on that account, I imagine I must be an object of sympathy to those who were there. I do ask honorable senators to dispel from their minds any suspicion that there was any intention to reflect upon the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- There is no justification for the statement. There has been a notification of the conditions under which the Commonwealth Government are making financial advances for the purpose of soldier settlement. But the statement that it represents, in any way, a repudiation of obligations to returned soldiers is entirely without foundation. </para>

                    <para>. - Arguments were used yesterday in the debate on this clause raising the question whether the  President  already has sufficient power to deal with servants of the Senate, and also whether he has not too much power, inasmuch as, if he be a man of a certain temperament, he might possibly become an autocrat, if he were not one already. It was represented also that the House Committee should have power over the officers of the Senate. Thinking over some of the arguments which were adduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> I have wondered whether the honorable senator could have been justified in what he said. He told the Committee that at least twenty members of the Senate had approached him, and had used undue influence in connexion with certain appointments to offices in connexion with this Parliament. He argued that it would be quite rights and within the bounds of decency, for a member of the Senate merely to write to the  President  in regard to the appointment of some individual; but that the twenty men to whom he had referred had used undue influence. I have no wish to indulge in anything which might be considered offensively personal in this debate. I think we should recognise our responsibilities as senators; and I have no wish that anything I may say should be taken as of a personal character. It is some thing to know that we have at least one Presiding Officer who can give himself a first class testimonial and say, &#34;While I have had twenty of you men come to me and seek to exercise undue influence, I remained the great, firm rock, and was not influenced by you people. I recognised that the Presiding Officer was a separate entity from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> from Queensland, and I refused to allow any of you people to influence me unduly in regard to appointments.&#34;&#39; It is very nice <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> know that we have a  President  who is able to subscribe to so fine a testimonial for himself; but I think that such a charge, if true, in regard to members of the Senate, should not be capable of bearing such an interpretation as was placed upon it by some members of the Committee yesterday. The statement was stressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> and by other members of this Committee, that the officers of Parliament are under the control of Parliament, and ought not to be under the control of the Government or the Public Service Commissioner. It places a senator in rather a difficult position if it is said that when standing in his place in the Chamber he can criticise the Presiding Officer regarding the appointment, promotion, or dismissal of a member of the staff, but that in his private capacity, outside the doors of the Chamber, he is not allowed to have any voice. If I make a suggestion to whoever happens to he the Presiding Officer of the Senate regarding an applicant for a position, am I guilty of corruption, and of endeavouring to use undue influence ? The Usher of the Black Rod, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Broinowski,</inline> came to me a few weeks ago and questioned me in regard to a man who was seeking appointment to a junior position on the staff of the Senate. He asked me what I knew about the man, and so forth. Suppose I had given a very favorable report, which I did not, and suppose I had urged that the applicant was the right man to be appointed, and had done all I could for him, could I be accused of having tried to use undue influence? If I had gone on my own account to the officer who was responsible for the recommendation, without having been approached, I would, according to the arguments advanced in this Committee yesterday, have been using undue influence. The charge against three-fifths of the members of this Senate of using &#34;undue influence&#34; was stressed in the debate yesterday by the Presiding Officer of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>- If members of the Senate insist upon retaining authority and responsibility in regard to the control of officers of Parliament, they must see that the duty is carried out properly. To be told by any Presiding Officer that we have delegated our authority to the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Presiding Officer, and must therefore have nothing further to say, is not in accordance with what ought to be the practice. I do not think that any honorable senator should be charged with improper conduct because he recommends a person in whom he may have no personal interest, and for whom he has merely been asked to do what he can. Are we to say that when any one approaches the Presiding Officer, who is a separate entity from a senator representing a State, he is seeking to use political influence? I am sure that every Presiding Officer must have been approached by persons outside the Chamber, and! asked to do what he could for a candidate for a certain position. If any one approaches the Presiding Officer as an entity representing a State, and asks him to use his influence with the Presiding Officer, as another entity, the position becomes absurd. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> stated yesterday that there was discontent among the officers of Parliament. I find that that has been the case, not only with the officials we meet in the Chamber, but with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> Staff and others. I am not going to enter into the rights and wrongs of that question ; but I say that if we had a Presiding Officer who was dictatorial, who wanted only those people to serve him who would bow to his autocratic will, and who would appoint only those men who would do the necessary&#34;smoodging&#39; &#39; to him, the candidates passed over ought to have the right of &#39;appeal to the House Committee. If the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> were adopted, and all appointments to the staff of the Chamber were under the control of those members of the Senate who are members of the House Committee, the  President  would still be able to act in the absence of members of the House Committee. There should be within this Chamber some body of men to whom an aggrieved person can appeal against the Presiding Officer&#39;s decisions. It is all very well for a Presiding Officer to say, &#34; I am in the hands of members of the Senate.&#34; How many honorable senators would be prepared to come into the Chamber and move a vote of censure on the Presiding Officer because of some action he had taken - probably a right and fair action, judged from his own temperamental view-point, but which, in the opinion of other senators, -was unfair and unjust ? As has been said in the press recently, in regard to an official who was made the subject of some inquiry, it is not becoming to the dignity of the Chamber that members should fight the cases of individuals, who may be employed in junior capacities on the staff, but who are entitled to all the justice that we expect in the honorable positions that we occupy. If the Committee ia not directly responsible for the employment, promotion and welfare of officers, it should at least be a Court of Appeal to which any aggrieved individual can go. </para>

                    gave expression to the wish, that the debate should be kept free from personalities, and followed that up by making an undeserved statement that I was giving myself a first-rate character. I never attempted to do any such thing. There is no necessity for me to give myself a character of any kind. All I did was merely to relate the facts.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline>
                    asked whether it would be wrong for a member of the Senate to give a testimonial of fitness of character. . I replied &#34; Undoubtedly not.&#34; Every one is entitled to do that; but when one person buttonholes another who has appointments to make, and suggests that he should do this and that in favour of one particular applicant, if notice is taken of those representations, undue advantage would be given to one candidate as against others who had no member of Parliament to speak for them.

                        <para>- All political influence in the making of appointments is objectionable, and not only is it objectionable, but it is contrary to the Act under which we have been working. It is one thing to give a certificate of character or fitness, but quite another thing to buttonhole a man and ask for special concessions, especially if the applicant happens to be a relative or a personal friend. In all the appointments that have been made during* my term as Presiding Officer, not one of the men appointed has been known to me in any capacity whatever until he came before me as an applicant. I had not the remotest connexion with any of them, or the remotest knowledge of them. It was said yesterday that until I became Presiding Officer the Committee was always consulted. I have looked up the records, and find that that statement is not correct. In the first Parliament of the Commonwealth, before the Public Service Act was passed, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Chaffey Baker did consult the Committee. He did that because there was no Public Service Act to guide him, but immediately the Act came into operation he ceased the practice, and obeyed the law. The records of Parliament prove the accuracy of that statement. Parliament was consulted in connexion with the Joint House Committee staff, but not in regard to the Senate staff. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39; s recollection may be all right, but I prefer to accept the written records. It might be a happy relief to most Presidents if they were relieved of the responsibility of controlling these appointments, and were spared the continual nagging that takes&#39; place; but it would be a, bad thing for the officers of the Senate if every member of the staff, from the highest to. the -lowest, was free to buttonhole every member of the Committee and seek personal favours and concessions. It would destroy all discipline and all good feeling among the staff.  Every officer would be trying to get the better of every other officer, and to &#34; work &#34; as many members of the Committee on his behalf as possible, lt is true that it might be invidious for an honorable senator to submit a motion objecting to the action of the Presiding Officer, but the Presiding Officer is responsible, and if he does anything wrong he is amenable. Would the House Committee be equally amenable <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Would it be under the control of the Senate in any way ? I have known members of Committees who, as soon as they could not get their own way, went into a temper and resigned their positions. If the House Committee had control there would be no responsibility at all. I plead with honorable senators,  for the  Bake ,  of the good service of this House and the discipline of the officers, to place the responsibility upon one Presiding Officer. It is a very bad thing to have divided authority, with no individual actually responsible, and with members of the staff trying to exert as much influence as they can with memben&#39;s of a Committee. If I were the Presiding Officer, and a Committee were given the measure of control that is proposed, I would refuse to accept responsibility. What is the head and front of my offending ? It is that I have obeyed the law, and the law is the expressed will of the Senate and Parliament. I would have been quite all- right so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is concerned if I had &#39;acceded to his various requests; I would probably have been a favourite with him, but my appointments would have been his appointments, and while he would not have been responsible, I would. That would have been a ridiculous and absurd position. If some one else has a .right to dictate appointments, the Presiding Officer cannot be held responsible. The head of a Department, in making his recommendations, ought to be left absolutely free, especially in regard to the question of fitness. All applications for appointment should be addressed to the head of a Department, and, in the case of Senate, officers, the  Clerk  of the Senate ought to be free to make his recommendations without the exercise of any pressure by members of Parliament. Take the case of the head of the <inline font-style="italic">.Hansard</inline> Staff. He ought to be entirely free&#39; in the selection of his officers. I have had an assurance by the head of one Department that when an appointment was made a member had asked him to reconsider the claims of a particular applicant. That was highly improper. I trust the Committee will accept the amendments in the form in which they are submitted, because their effect will be .to continue the provisions Qf the Act and insure -the proper conduct of business. With, regard to dismissals, I may say that during the whole of .the eight years of my -occupancy of .the presidential .office ,only one officer has been dismissed, although, technically, there has been -another dismissal. I have very little acquaintance with officers of the Parliament, speaking generally. Therefore, I have to rely upon the reports of the heads of the various Departments under whose observation &#39;the various 0111- cers are working. The dismissal to which I refer was that of a junior officer, whose services were dispensed with on the recommendation of the head of the Department, based not only upon his own observations, but also on complaints made by several members, not to ,me, but to the head of the Department. There has, as I have said, been another technical dismissal. There was no complaint against the officer concerned. He was doing his work properly, but, for private reasons, of which <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> know nothing, .he absented himself. To prove that his absence was voluntary on his part, I may say that when he left there was some money owing to him. After he had. been absent for a week without any explanation, he was suspended and an inquiry ordered, but no communication could reach -him,. After :he had been absent foi&#34; a month, in order to comply with the requirements of the Act, a charge had to be formulated against him, -and he was dismissed, .though, in reality, he had dismissed himself. </para>

                    <para>. -  It is somewhat difficult, I think, to confine .the debate upon this series of amendments to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of sub-clause 1 of the proposed new clause. I think we ought to deal with the matter as a whole. I cannot see my way clear to support <inline font-weight="bold">-Senator df</inline> Largie&#39;s amendment. In my judgment, it would be better for the  President  of the Senate to . have -full control over our officers. As a member of the House Committee, I object to that body being asked to accept any responsibility for the appointment or dismissal of officers, although, before my appointment I may have, held other ideas in regard to that .matter. Unless a member happens to live in Melbourne it is almost impossible to attend regularly the meetings of the House Committee. Since I have been a member of the Committee there have been four meetings, only two of which I have been able to attend. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree, and, of course, I take the full blame for my absence from those meetings. In one case - I am not sure that the circumstances in regard to the other were not the .same - I received the notice of meeting in the usual way, but, as the Senate  subsequently decided not to sit during the following week and as I was in Sydney, it was not likely that I would make a special trip across to Melbourne to attend a meeting of the House Committee. My recollection is that it was difficult to get a quorum on the two occasions when I was present at meetings of the House Committee. If the Committee were a Senate Committee no doubt the difficulty I mentioned could easily be overcome, but the Committee has to deal with matters relating not only to this Chamber, but to the other House as well. </para>

                    <para>- I must draw the honorable senator&#39;s attention to the fact that, although the amendment does not specifically mention the House Committee of the Senate, that is implied. If I thought it was proposed to give the Joint House Committee jurisdiction over Senate officials, I would rule the amendment out of order. My conception of the amendment is that it refers to the Senate House Committee, and does not propose to confer any power upon members of another place to regulate appointments in the Senate. </para>

It is difficult for honorable senators to attend regularly the meetings of the House Committee, and if they were to be held responsible for appointments and dismissals ofofficersofParliamentthenIforone would ask to be relieved of my position on that Committee. I am not prepared to accept responsibility unless I have a fair opportunity to be present at all the meetings. I prefer to leave this business in the hands of the  President.  This should not be a personal matter at all. The  President  may be removed from office at any time if it is the wish of the Senate. I may disagree with the motion to appoint any senator  President  of this Chamber, but if the majority of the Senate think otherwise, then I must bow to the wishes of the Senate. Taking it all in all, I think that it is better that responsibility should rest in one person - in this case the  President.  If he is not fit to control our officers, then he is not fit to be  President  of the Senate. Another point that has been raised is that we should hand over control of our officers to the Public Service Commissioner or Board. </para>

                        <para>- If the officers of Parliament were classified by the Public Service Commissioner, an outside authority would be interfering. Some time ago I thought if desirable for the Public Service Commissioner to control the officers of Parliament; but in view of a speech delivered by the <inline font-weight="bold">President (Senator Givens)</inline> some time ago, when it was suggested that certain persons were about to investigate the work of Parliament and examine its officers, he strongly opposed the idea of any interference by an outside authority. The  President  then said that if we allowed that it would be an interference with our. privileges, and derogatory to the dignity of the Senate. He also said that it was the duty of the Senate to definitely instruct him in the matter, and we now have to decide whether any outside authority shall have the right to dictate as to the procedure to be adapted in connexion with the work of Parliament.&#39; If we allow the Board to classify the officers of Parliament, we allow an outside authority to interfere. We should either exclude the Board entirely or give it full authority. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall endeavour to clear up one or two points which appear to be hampering honorable senators. The personal element introduced into the debate is to be Tegretted, and I do not propose to add in the slightest to the comments made in that direction. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> that if the  President  of the Senate is not a fit and proper person to be intrusted with appointments in connexion with this branch of the Legislature, he is not a fit and proper person to act as its Presiding Officer, and should be removed from office by the Senate. If we analyze the proposals of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> it will be found that the  President  or the  Speaker,  or the  President  and the  Speaker,  are to be substituted for the Board to be appointed. A good deal of discussion took place concerning the constitution of the Board, which is to consist of three members, and it will have the power to delegate to any one member all the powers which are conferred upon the three. That was necessary, because the Board will have to deal with officers spread over a vast continent ; and if the members of that body were to remain in one centre it would be impossible for them to carry out their work effectively. That was why the powers of delegation were given. The proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is that, instead of the Board controlling the officers of Parliament, the  President  and the  Speaker  are to act when dealing with the officers of the two Houses, and the  President  or the  Speaker  are to act when dealing with the officers of their respective Houses. We are, therefore, not making a marked departure in the matter of control when compared with the procedure to be adoptedinconnexionwiththePublic Service.TheproposalofSenatordo </para>

                        <para>- I must endeavour to make the position quite clear to the Committee. In the <inline font-style="italic">Journals of the Senate</inline> of 3rd March, 1920, it is recorded that the Minister for&#39; Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D.

                </quote>
                <para class="block">My interpretation of that is that the House Committee would have power to act independently, if necessary, and, in regard to other matters, to sit as a Joint Committee with a similar Committee of another place. I understand that the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie refers to the Senate House Committee; but my interpretation is, of course, subject to the decision of the Committee, and ultimately to the decision of the Presiding Officer of this Chamber. But I do not, having regard to the verbiage of the amendment, take it as conferring a power on a Joint House Committee. TheJournals <inline font-style="italic">of the Senate</inline> make it appear that there can be, and is, indeed, a separate House Committee of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- Then the position is more complicated than before. I think the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is that the Joint House Committee shall control the officers of Parliament. If that is not the proposal, the position would be ridiculous. If we incorporate in the Bill a provision that the Senate House Committee shall control the Senate officials, and the officials of another place shall be controlled in an entirely different way, there can be no control at all over officials working in both branches of the Legislature. </para>

We have, therefore, reached an absurd position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> favoured the  President  and the House Committee controlling the officers of Parliament, and suggested that during the absence of honorable senators from Melbourne the  President  should exercise all the powers and functions of the Committee. It waa pointed out that there were long periods when the Parliament was in recess, and that it would be impossible for a House Committee or any Committee of Parliament to control the officers of Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> suggested that during a recess the  President  should have control. If the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is accepted, it will not accomplish what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> desires, in view of the statement which has just been made by the  Chairman.  No one but the Committee could carry out the functions of the Board. </para>

                        <para>- I quite understand what the honorable senator wants, but the  Chairman  has made it clear that his amendment will not achieve his object.  I understand that, if he succeeds with this amendment, he intends to go further and include the Library Committee. The House and Library Committees, in fact and in practice, are undoubtedly joint Committees. Some time ago there was a Select Committee appointed by the Senate to inquire into the question of alleged grievances, and also into the question of the control of the servants of Parliament. The Committee recommended, amongst other things, that Parliament should retain control of its own. servants. If this Bill goes through in its present form, Parliament will be giving up control of its own servants. If the provisions suggested by the  President,  or some similar provisions, are not inserted, the control toy Parliament of its servants will entirely disappear. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The new clause gives effect to (the recommendations of the Select Committee, and there is very little difference of opinion on the question of whether Parliament should control its own officers. There is some division of opinion as to how that control should be exercised.  I prefer the old method, and I agree that if the  President  is not fit to exercise this power, he should not occupy his position. Even though we adopt the proposals of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> all the servants of the Senate, and of Parliament generally, will come under the Public Service regulations automatically; but it is provided in sub-clause 2 that the  President  or the  Speaker  or the  President  and the  Speaker  may make regulations, which, if they are in conflict with those made by the Public Service Commissioner, shall prevail. </para>

                    <para>. - The remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-</inline> Brockman have cleared the air considerably. I agree with his main point, that without some such provisions as are proposed in the new clause, the Bill will apply to every officer of Parliament in the same way as it applies to public servants generally. I propose to deal with the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie in an absolutely impersonal manner, because I do not want anything </para>

                <para class="block">I may say to be regarded as a reflection on the  President.  The jurisdiction of the House Committee, as exercised under the present system, is a perfect farce. As a matter of fact, it has no jurisdiction or functions whatever, unless they are of the rubber stamp variety. I imagine that the Senate had an idea, when it appointed a House Committee, that that Committee would be worthy of the name. Questions of the appointment and promotion of officers of the Senate should surely come within the purview of the House Committee, but the proposal is that such matters shall be left to the  President,  who need not consult the House Committee at all. That means giving autocratic power to the  President,  and, in the case of the House of Representatives, to the  Speaker,  to determine who shall be officers of the Parliament. If the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie does not confer any such power on the House Committee, it should&#39; be made to do so. This would obviate friction in the future, and would prevent any imputation being levelled at the  President  that he had acted unfairly. </para>

                    <para>. - The question before us, I understand, is an amendment by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie that we take certain action which will result in a big departure from past procedure. We are led to believe that in some way or other officers of this Senate have been suffering injustices and grievances. During the fifteen years I have been a member of the Senate, I have had but one appeal made to me by an officer, who supposed he was labouring under a grievance, and I was unable to approve of what lie had to say, and declined to hear him further. It is not only the  President,  as the mouthpiece of this Senate, who is responsible for any wrongful act towards an officer of the Senate, but every senator is also responsible. If an officer has a just grievance he may go to the public press, as well as approach members of the Senate, so, if there is any manifest injustice done, there is always a chance of the matter finding an echo in this Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- I did, because I  knew he was asking for something less than eight hours a day, and I was not prepared to give it to him. I said, &#34; You look to me for less than eight hours&#39; work a day.  You  can hardly be said to work when compared with the man outside who has to pay the taxes which keep you.&#34; I am driven to the conclusion that I must be a very curious make-up of a man when I cannot be approached by a person who desires to plead his case. I am so hard of heart, I suppose, that I will not listen to a plea for justice ! Let me say that the officers of this Parliament are in a very good and a vary snug position. I want to see them justly treated, and want to see them appreciate it, as I feel they do. I am trying to treat this matter seriously, and to discover what sort of a man I can be that I should not have been approached in the past. The amendment is intended to superimpose the House Committee on the existing tribunal for the settlement of these questions. The idea behind it is that individual justice is a failure, and that collective justice is likely to be more satisfactory. The contention appears to be that we cannot select from amongst ourselves a man possessing sufficient intelligence, integrity, and impartiality to do the fair thing. It is a  confesson  that we have failed in our duty. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. As I, on one occasion, put what appeared to me to be a very fair request before the present occupant of the position of President, and he refused it, I might be disposed, if I were prepared to deal with this question on personal grounds, to back up any proposal, such as the amendment, which would deprive this man of some of his power. But I came to see, on reasoning the  matter  out, that if the  President  had acceded to my request, it would have opened the door so widely that it would have become impossible for this Chamber to preserve its status and its dignity. I still have faith in individual justice. I can recall the fact that exception has been taken from time to time to many decisions arrived at by Committees, and some of the shivering members have said, &#34; It is not -my fault ; it was the Committee.&#34; It is always the other fellow who has done it. In my opinion ttc should saddle responsibility on one man.  </para>

                        <para>- That brings me to the question of the Appeal Board. We are told that the House Committee will represent a Caesar from whom there will be no appeal. That is not correct, or in accordance with our past experience. I remember that the Printing Committee on one occasion brought up a report, and the Senate said to the Committee, &#34;You have not done your work properly, and we shall review your report.&#34; The Joint Printing Committee was not a Caesar om that occasion. Senators Foster and de Largie have suggested that the House Committee, with the  President,  will constitute an Appeal Board, from which there will be no appeal. The experience of the past is against that contention. </para>

I do not believe in supporting an amendment unless it is clear to me that it will bring about some tangible improvement. I have already said that if I were influenced in the matter one way or another by feeling I should be disposed to relieve the present occupant of the position of  President  of responsibility, but I hope that the &#39;Committee will stand to the maxim that &#39;&#39;behind law&#39;s decision stands the man.&#34; Give &#39;a man a job, and hold him responsible for it, and if he fails in his trust put him out! <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> would put upon a dozen men the responsibility for what ought to be one man&#39;s job.

                    <para>. - There seems to be an impression that yesterday I advocated giving power in these matters to individual members of the. House Committee. Nothing was further from my mind. What I desired, and what I advocate to-day, is that the control of the parliamentary staff should be placed in the hands of the Joint House Committee. The  Chairman  of the Committee would, of course, be the  President,  and he could make regular reports to meetings of the Committee. I never suggested, for one moment, that an individual member of the House Committee should have the right to interfere with the administration. If honorable senators are asked to accept positions on the Joint House Committee, I desire that they should be clothed with such responsibility as will make the position worthy of their time and attention. If the  President,  whoever he might be, did something which gave rise to complaint, he could submit his report to the House Committee, and it would be for the Committee to decide whether or not he had done wrong, and to make its report to the Senate. To suggest that every little grievance of an officer of this House should be a matter for decision by the Senate is, in my opinion, absolutely ridiculous. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> has said that he does not think the amendment would be any improvement&#39; upon the existing condition of affairs. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps the senators concerned were like myself, and did not know anything about the matter until they were elected. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> has clearly stated the position. Certainly I think we should have a change. He has forcibly said that the House Committee is a concern put up to be shot at, with very few powers, or, at least, with insufficient powers. Any honorable senator is wasting his time on such a Committee. Too much of the personal element has been brought into this discussion. If Parliament gives the powers asked for to the  President,  he will be responsible, but I think they should be given to the House Committee in the form I suggest. That would hot fully meet my desire, but it would go a long way in that direction. The  President  would then be in the position of a managing director, who would submit his reports to the Committee, and any difficulties would be settled by the Committee, instead of being forced on to the floor of the Chamber. Suppose one of the employees had to be disposed of, and the  President,  justly or otherwise, gave him his &#34;walking ticket.&#34; That action might represent the honest opinion and judgment of the  President  for the time being, but he might have acted wrongly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> puts forward the suggestion that the Senate, in those circumstances, should put the  President  out of his job. That, would-betooex- tremearemedy. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think&#39; there will be any difficulty. My experience, as far as it has gone, tells me that with a Joint House Committee consisting of seven or eight members from each House there would be a lot of political &#34; engineering &#34; whenever a case had to be decided. It is only recently  that a certain thing was done which was advantageous to those who find the money for running the concern; political &#34; engineering &#34; was started, and the whips were cracked. I heard that some members said they would not proceed any farther unless they got their own way. The Committee is too big and too cumbersome. I am not going to be a party to voting for anything that will take the responsibility of administration from the  President,  but I do want the  President  to be answerable to the House Committee, as the executive head. I am not going to advocate that individual members of the Committee should have a right of intervention. They can only have that right through the medium of a properly constituted House Committee, to which the  President  presents a report. I want it to be distinctly understood that I am not going to be a party to getting away from the principle of having only one administrative head, but I want him to be answerable to the House Committee, and the House Committee to be answerable to the Senate. </para>

                <para class="block">That recommendation was made to Parliament in the light of several years&#39; experience, which made it plain that something of the kind must be done if the continual political interference and agitation on behalf of officers was to be avoided. The  President  and the  Speaker  recommended to the Government that, in order to stop political agitation, the classification and salaries of the officers of Parliament should be fixed by the Public Service Commissioner. That is a definite statement. It is not an instance in which the  President  may have been speaking heatedly, in reply to arguments on the floor of the Chamber, and saying things which he might regret afterwards. It is a statement in black and white, that was written deliberately. I shall vote againstSenatordeLargie&#39;samend- ment. We shall then come to the question of whether the  President,  the Senate, the House Committee, or the Public Service Commissioner shall have control. When we come to vote on the principle as to who shall have full control, some explanation ought to be given of why the  President  has gone back on the recommendation which he signed in conjunction with the  Speaker.  It looks as if the Bill now before the Committee is an attempt to carry&#39; out that recommendation. </para>

                    <para>. - Not one of the honorable senators who have spoken has pointed out a better way of meeting the proposition than that proposed in my amendment. I stated very clearly, and I think it is the view of a number of honorable senators, that tha House Committee ought to have control in matters of this kind. I have yet to hear one sound argument against that proposition. I pointed out that, originally, the House Committee undoubtedly exercised these powers, but that in the course of years, and by the change of Presidents, the power had gradually been withdrawn from the Committee in such a way that the withdrawal was not observed by honorable senators. If the Senate had been composed of the same members all the time they would have seen quite clearly where and when the change took place. I have given my experience of the first and second, at least, of these House Committees, and have stated what was the practice in those days. My present proposal is to put into the Public Service Act a. provision that the House Committee of the Senate shall have the power now held by the Presiding Officer to control officers of the Senate. And if it is agreed to, I shall submit other amendments, making the same principle applicable to all officers of Parliament. That will bring this clause of the Bill into conformity with other parts of it. We have provided Boards of Appeal and Boards of Inquiry for other sections of the Public Service, and it will be a very one-sided Act if the same provision is not made for officers of Parliament. Officers of the Post Office, the Customs Department, and other Departments under the Federal Government are safeguarded,andtheCommittee ought not to refuse to provide a means, of appeal or  inquiry for officers of the Parliament. Parliament is a public Department, and the officers who are sitting at the table in this Chamber, or are doing work outside it - no matter how humble or exalted their duties may be - are carrying out a public function, and are entitled to the same privileges that we have given to the public servant generally. Why should not affairs connected with the staff of Parliament, which spends public money, and in which the taxpayers are interested, be made known? Why should the  President,  who is the one man that administers the affairs of this branch of the Parliament, be above criticism ? Criticism somewhat of a personal nature is all the more necessary in view of the fact that the  President  is the only man who has a say. No others are permitted to be heard. I wish to remove this personal element in administration as much as possible, and allow the members of the House Committee to share this responsibility. Are honorable senators aware that since the Public Service Act has been in force there has never been a report, as provided for in the Act, in connexion with the administration of the parliamentary Departments? If honorable senators ask for an explanation as to what was done last year or the year before, they have no report to guide them, and no information is vouchsafed as to who classifies the officers. Where is the classification scheme that is provided for in connexion with all other Departments of the Public Service? It is non-existent. There has never been any classification of our parliamentary officers. It may be said that we have at the head of affairs a man who is prepared to look after our officers. I dispute that. I deny that the  President  is looking after the rights of our. officers. I could reveal glaring cases in which favoritism has been shown. I could show that men, after twenty years&#39; service, have been kept back from promotion and others from outside promoted over their heads. I do not wish honorable senators to run away with the idea that the Denholm affair is the only case of injustice that has occurred in connexion with the administration of the parliamentary Departments. There are many others. I could, if I wished, quote a case in connexion with Hansard, butIhavenodesiretodoso.Allof our parliamentary officers are as much entitled to have their rights preserved to them as are officers in any other Department of the Public Service. In the early days of Federation we used to hear a good deal about the preservation in the Constitution of the rights and privileges of officers transferred from the State to the Federal Public Service. Every officer in the Service, from the humblest to the most important, should have all his rights and privileges safeguarded. What happens at present if any officer of Parliament complains of his treatment ? He is black-balled, boycotted, and dismissed. Our officers are afraid to express an opinion as to their treatment or to stand up for their rights. There is no one to&#39; whom they can appeal. I am certainly not going to have my name associated with any measure that will permit tyranny of this kind to continue. </para>

What kind of treatment was meted out to a man who insisted upon getting the legal wage provided for under the Arbitration Act, and the wage that was being paid outside? Honorable senators should read the evidence given before the Select Committee of the Senate in regard to these matters. Because he stood up like a man, this employee was not only dismissed, but was insulted on the floor of this Chamber, where he could not speak for himself. He asked for the right of appeal to the House Committee, and that was refused to him. He asked again to be allowed to put his case before the Select Committee, and that also was refused. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is wrong. The newspapers did not report the proceedings of the Select Committee. The press were not given the opportunity to be present at our meetings, nor did they report the proceedings. I am sorry that the personal element has been introduced into this debate; but I was not responsible. I very carefully avoided any personal references in my early remarks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> introduced the personal aspect, and, as I was singled out for special attention, I would be something less than a man if, in the circumstances, I did not defend myself. I feel that my personal honour is now involved, and I am going to clear the matter up thoroughly. It is my intention to read some of the evidence that was given before the Senate Select Committee, in order to show the character of the man we have as  President  of the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> said that if he had adopted a certain course in regard to an appointment, it would, in effect, have been my appointment, and not his; the inference being, of course, that I was improperly using my position as a senator for personal ends. I deny that absolutely. I did recommend a certain individual, who was an applicant for appointment to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> Staff, but he did not get the position, and I did not mention his name again - that happened six or seven years ago. I realized perfectly well that the man who received the appointment was better qualified than the individual whom I had recommended. I was quite satisfied, and had nothing further to say about the matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> talks about the improper use of political influence, and on one occasion he delivered a lecture to me on the conduct of a member of this Chamber. What did he do when I tabled a motion for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into certain aspects of his administration,? He went around buttonholing members to vote against my motion, thus endeavouring to prevent an inquiry being held. Then he talks about the dignity of the Senate ! </para>

                    <para>That cannot be decided until the matter has been submitted to Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and myself made that recommendation in the light of several years of experience, which showed us conclusively that if political influence and agitation was to be avoided, something of that kind would have to be done. What we recommended would not have interfered at all with the control by Parliament of the officers of Parliament, except with regard to classification and the fixation of the salaries appropriate to the various positions. Our recommendation was that in every other respect the  President  and  Speaker  should remain in absolute control as at present. My experience in regard to political influence proposed to be exercised has been a very long and bitter one. </para>

It is rather unbecoming to the dignity of this Chamber that minor matters should be brought up here, and that the time of the Senate, which is alleged to be worth something, should be wasted for hours in discussing them. </para>

I purposely entered into a certain phase of the; inquiry to expose the inaccuracy of statements which I was informed had been circulated amongst honorable senators by the  President.  If I had been afraid of any disclosure I would not have pursued such a policy. As a fact I had to submit about ten questions before I reached the point where he said that there were twenty honorable senators - of whom I was not one, although he said yesterday that I was - who had endeavoured to influence him. I shall not quote the evidence up to the point where I dragged an answer from him, and I assure the Committee that it had to be &#34; dragged.&#34; The evidence reads - </para>

That incident happened many years ago, and I think I can prove that during that interval, so far as I know, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> and I were always on the most friendly terms. On frequent occasions I was invited into his room, and on other occasions I had to go to his room in connexion with various matters associated with my duties as Government Whip.

I did not think I was doing any harm, and he certainly did not suggest that I was; Ave thought we were acting in a fair and proper manner. I have assisted the  President  on many occasions, and have done things which I would not have done had I been biased against him. I recollect an occasion when I assisted him out of a very serious difficulty, when, owing to his action, this branch, of the Legislature was in danger of being placed in a very false position. During the visit of  His  Royal Highness the Prince of Wales to Australia, in consequence of a squabble between the  President  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> the Senate adjourned before deciding to present an address to the Prince. The Senate was not to blame; the squabble arose between the Presiding Officers as to who should have the honour of presenting the address. </para>

On the&#34;5 Wednesday following, after the Senate had adjourned, the House of Representatives agreed to present an address. On the Saturday morning I visited the building, and was informed by the President&#39;s messenger that the  President  wished to see me. I saw him, and he informed me of the position, which had been mentioned in the press that morning. The  President  then said to me, &#34;Here is a letter I am drafting to the press explaining the position.&#34; He further said - &#34;I am going to give Johnson a showing up. I know why he is doing this. </para>

                        <para>- Private conversations have been repeated and dragged on to the floor of the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> in his charge of political influence against me. I am fighting him with the weapons he has chosen. It was not until I moved for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the position of Senate officials that any difference of opinion between us arose. The  President  did everything possible to burke that inquiry, and these facts should be disclosed, so that honorable senators may realize the type of man with whom we have to deal. It will be a cruel shame if the officers of this branch of the Legislature are to be deprived df a Board of appeal. We should protect them, as has been done in other instances, instead of leaving the heads of Departments to do as they wish. If the Committee do not support my amendment, they will have to take the responsibility.I have discharged my duty, and have shown the necessity for the amendment. Any one who is familiar with what has been going on in connexion with the appointment and promotion of Senate officials must recognise that these officers should have some Court of appeal. In the past, and at the present time, they have no such privilege. When they have asked for the opportunity of appearing before the House Committee, they have been prevented, and when some desired to appear before the Select Committee they were refused, and finally dismissed, merely because they stood up for their rights as men. I do not apologize for the attitude I have adopted. My honour has been impugned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> who has indulged in personalities, and made false charges against me. I have a right to defend myself, and shall at all times do so. </para>

                    <para>. - Sub-clause 2 of the proposed new clause, briefly, provides that any action to be taken by the Board under the Act with regard to the Public Service may be taken with regard to the Departments of Parliament by the  President  or  Speaker,  or by both, as the case may be; and any action required to be  taKen  by the permanent head or chief officer of a Department outside may be taken by the permanent head of a parliamentary Department. This really makes no alteration in the practice which at present obtains. Sub-clause 3 is a new provision, but it is necessitated by the wording of the present Bill. It provides that any reference to &#34; the Minister &#34; shall be read as a reference to the  President,  or  Speaker,  or to both, as the case may be, so far as officers of Parliament are concerned. Sub-clause 4 merely constitutes several branches of the parliamentary service separate Departments under the Bill, just as the Bill itself provides for separate Departments in the Public Service generally. This sub-clause is merely consequential on the others. </para>

                        <para>- They are all eligible. On sub-clause 5 there has been some discussion. It provides, as drafted, for a classification of the parliamentary officers by the  President  and the  Speaker.  There is a further provision to the. effect that if the  President  and  Speaker  so desire, they may request the Public Service Board to classify any officers of Parliament. I may ;briefly explain that there has always been a tendency in this&#39; Chamber -to play off one Department against another, thereby creating anomalies, and allowing one officer to get ahead of another officer in another Department. It has been exceedingly difficult to combat that. So far as I have been able to ascertain, every succeeding  President  and  Speaker  have met with that difficulty, and it has not made for good feeling amongst the officers of Parliament. In the view of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and myself, it would be advantageous to have a classification. There would be salaries appropriate to the classification  but the question of salaries need not be considered in this  matter. The sub-clause distinctly states that the  President  and  Speaker  may classify, and, if in difficulties, they may call the Public Service Board to their assistance. I think that is reasonable, because it must be evident that a new  President  or  Speaker  would not necessarily have anything like the experience of the Public Service Board. This proposal would give the  President  or the  Speaker  the option of calling in such assistance. So far there has never been a classification of the parliamentary officers by any  President  or  Speaker,  nor has the need of it really been felt; but officers receiving salaries appropriate to their particular classification in the Service outside have been regarded as belonging to that classification, with the exception of the heads of Departments, who, of course, have not been classified. The latter are in a different category altogether. There are so few of these officers - their classifications being necessarily peculiar to their particular positions - that the need has never been felt for a classification; but it is possible that such a need may arise, and I think it would be wise to give power to the  President  and  Speaker  to call in the assistance of the Board. </para>

                    <para>. -I am glad that the matter of classification has been referred to, be cause it is one to which I have repeatedly directed the attention of the Senate. I was beginning to give up hope that anything would ever be done in connexion with it. The provision in the Public Service Act for classification has been allowed to remain a dead letter, and if sub-clause 5 is to be treated in the same way we shall be but wasting our time in agreeing to it. I hope that something in the way of classification will be done in the future, as it should tend to&#39; remove some of the worst anomalies that exist in connexion with the service of Parliament. Officers of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> Staff have, in the past, constituted one watertight department, whilst the officers of the Senate have constituted another. No matter how able an officer of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> Staff might be to fill a position at the Senate table, he could not hope to attain such a position. We have officers on the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> Staff who are well qualified to take up the work of a Clerk of Parliament, but because of the recognition of watertight departments and the lack of classification, Parliament has not in the past been able to do justice to all its officers. I hope that it is intended by sub-clause 5 to overcome the difficulty in arranging transfers, and that it will not be allowed to remain a dead letter. </para>

                <para class="block">The object of this amendment is to permit the Board in certain circumstances to delegate certain of its powers. If, for instance, a dispute should take place in connexion with an officer of the postal service at Cairns it would be a waste of time and money to send the Board to Cairns to inquire into the matter, and also a waste of time and money to bring the officer down to Melbourne. The purpose of the amendment is in such a case to enable the Board&#39; to delegate &#39;to any other officer authority to take evidence on commission. The evidence could then be sent to Melbourne for consideration by the Board. The officer to whom the power is delegated will not have the right to give a verdict. </para>

                    <para>.- I propose to move an amendment to this clause. It is an important clause, because it is the first of Division 5, which deals with &#34;Promotions and transfers.&#34; It appeared to me when we were previously discussing this clause in Committee that the Committee did not take a sufficiently serious view of it. I objected to the clause remaining in its present form, and I would not have given way so readily had not the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> by interjection, given me to understand that the question had been fully discussed with the Public Service Association, and that the Association was agreeable to the clause remaining in its present form. Briefly, the position is that no opportunity is given to an officer of the Public Service to fill a vacancy in another Department, because in this clause, when a vacancy occurs in any office in other than the First Division, and it is expedient to fill that vacancy by the promotion of an officer, the chief officer may, subject to the provisions of the Act, &#34;promote an officer of his Department to fill such vacancy.&#34; </para>

I propose that instead of a chief officer promoting an officer to fill a vacancy the Board shall do it. The Board is brought into existence in order to secure, if possible, the more efficient and economical working of the Departments. If a vacancy occurs in any Department other than the First Division, it appears to me that it is not only possible, but probable, that in another Department there may be a more efficient officer available to fill the vacancy than can be found in the Department in which the vacancy has arisen. </para>

The fact that a man may be appointed, even provisionally, will make it exceedingly difficult for any  appeal to be successful. If the Board had the power of appointment, the officer best qualified for a position, irrespective of the Department in which he might be employed, would have a reasonable chance of securing it.

                    <para>. - I am rather glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has raised this question, although I am afraid it is too late now to alter the clause. During the second-reading debate&#39; I pointed out that it was most unfortunate that this clause should be inserted in the Bill at all, because, whatever may be said to the contrary, the various Departments of the Public Service will, I fear, become absolutely watertight. There is, of course, provision for appeal, but the appellant will have the chief officer of his own Department against him, and will have to depend on&#39; his own advocacy to support his appeal, whereas, if appointments were made by the Board or the Commissioner, the position would be entirely different. It is possible that if certain positions were advertised there would be as many as twenty applicants, and the Public Service Commissioner would select the man he thought most suitable, and discuss the position with the head of the Department concerned. Possibly they would both come to the same decision, but if not, then the will of the Public Service Commissioner would prevail. I could quote case after case of officers who, under the present Act, have been transferred from Department to Department; but heads of Departments have always opposed the system. At present the Public Service Commissioner relies upon reports from the Public Service Inspectors in the several States. Under this Bill the heads of Departments will simply strive to secure the appointment of their own nominees, and an ambitious and promising officer in another Department will have no opportunity of appointment to a vacancy higher up in the Service. Suppose a young man at Broken Hill or Cobar appealed against the decision of the head of his Department. In the absence of inspectors, for which there is no provision in the Bill, how would the Board deal&#39; with that matter? </para>

                        <para>- If twenty persons in different parts of the Commonwealth&#39;&#39; apply for a position, and appeal against the decision of the chief officer, the Government will have to appoint a special Board to make the inquiries, whereas under the Act as it stands the inspectors in the various States, knowing the qualifications of the appellants, are able to advise the Public Service Commissioner. I did.&#39; my best, when this clause was before the Committee, to amend it, but no other honorable senator then appeared prepared to support me, so I did not take the matter to a division. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> can succeed where I failed, I shall be very glad, and I shall do all I can to help him, because I regard, this clause &#39;as a serious flaw in the Bill. It will make the various Departments of the Public Service watertight. The question -whether Departments in the Senate and the House of Representatives are watertight was raised to-day. In spite of all that has been said to the contrary, I still think they will ,be watertight, and I am afraid the whole of the Departments of the Public Service will be in the same position. </para>

                    <para>, -  Some months ago I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> say he Was opposed to the present system. I am afraid he has not made himself acquainted with the later views of the Public Service Commissioner on this subject. I cannot accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne&#39;s</inline> amendment, which would mean that all questions of appointments and promotions in the Service would have to come before the Board sitting in Melbourne. The object of clause 48 is to save a great deal of circumlocution. Sub-clause 6 gives the right of appeal ,to the Board. If an appeal is lodged by, say, a postal official at Geraldton, it would not be proposed to send the Appeal Board to Geraldton, or bring the appellant away from his work. That would be ridiculous. The local postmaster would probably be asked to report to the Board. </para>

                    <para>The provisions of the Ian requiring a report from the permanent head or chief officer, recommendation by the Commissioner, and approval by the Governor-General were designed, no doubt, as safeguards against unfair discrimination in the selection of officers for promotion, but in the application of those provisions successive delays have occurred in filling vacant positions, and consequent expense and inconvenience to Departments because of the necessity of making temporary arrangements pending the permanent promotion of officers. It is not unusual for months to elapse between the notification of a vacancy and the filling of the position, and in cases where the vacant office is in the higher grades of the Service, the consequential changes following upon the initial promotion can only be made <inline font-style="italic">long</inline> after the occurrence of the original vacancy, with hampering effects upon Departments which call for rectification. The time and attention of Public Service Inspectors, especially in the larger States, are absorbed in dealing with promotions and transfers of officers to such an extent as to militate seriously against their usefulness in other directions, particularly in regard to the general organizations of Departments and the disposition of  offices  and officers to insure efficient and economical management. If inspectors were relieved of the responsibility of advising on staff changes involving promotions and transfers, more beneficial results would accrue from the exercise of their inspectorial functions, which are highly important and far-reaching in relation to successful administration of the Public Service Act. </para>

                    <para>.- If the Senate should meet on Monday instead of Tuesday, it would meet the  convenience  of honorable senators who have to remain in Melbourne over the weekend. Honorable senators representing distant States have had very little consideration in the past, and as we shall have to discuss the Appropriation Bill and other important measures, I  think  we should meet on Monday. Honorable senators should be allowed the same latitude in discussing proposed expenditure in connexion with various Government Departments as has been extended to honorable members in another place, and I do not think that opportunity can be afforded unless we sit on five days. </para>
