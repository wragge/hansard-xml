                        <para>In view of the approaching termination of the present agreement, negotiations were entered into by the Government with representatives of the Orient Company. The latter stated that, in their opinion, it was desirable to treat the immediate future as a transitional period, and that it would be unwise for the Commonwealth Government to enter into commitments of an onerous and far-reaching character at the present level of prices, whilst the same reason, combined with the uncertainty as to future revenue, would make such commitments wholly unacceptable to the company. They, therefore, proposed that an arrangement of a temporary nature, which would cover the transitional period referred to, and which could be terminated by either party giving twelve calendar months&#39; notice at any time. Their proposal provided for thirteen despatches per annum each way at four-weekly intervals (which was the most frequent service they could give with the vessels at their disposal), and was based generally on the terms and conditions of the present contract. </para>
                        <para>The result of the negotiations was that an arrangement has been entered into under which the Orient Company have agreed to continue to carry mails under the terms of the present contract, subject to the following alterations: - </para>

Once we resume the debate tomorrow, if honorable senators show reasons why the agreement should not be dealt with finally, the ultimate decision of the Senate on it may probably be arrived at on some day after to-morrow. For the present, I am going to support the motion for the resumption- of the debate to-morrow. </para>

                            <para>. - I am inclined to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> that the agreement is far too important to be discussed the day after it is introduced. It particularly and peculiarly affects the commercial community. I should like some expression of opinion from the chambers of commerce, the bankers, and those engaged in international and oversea trade and finance, because they are the people largely concerned in the regularity and frequency of the English mails. I have been led to understand that the only matters requiring the urgent attention of the Senate before 4 o&#39;clock to-morrow afternoon are the remainder of the Defence Bill and the Air Defence Bill. Now the Minister representing the Postmaster-General has brought down, unexpectedly to me, a motion which in effect he is tabling today, printing to-night, and asking us to pass and approve of to-morrow. </para>

                            <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> and possibly another honorable senator, seem to have misconstrued, I hope unintentionally, the- purpose of the motion before the Senate. The question of the agreement has come forward, and the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, in conformity with accepted practice, has placed it on the table of the Senate with a proposal that the adjourned debate on the motion ho has submitted shall appear as one of- the Orders of the Day for to-morrow. No exception can be taken to that course. The question, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> points out, is - what we will do with it to-morrow. Senators Thomas and Pratten say they want time to consider it. They can have that time so far as the Government are concerned. If tomorrow honorable senators say they want further time to consider it, they can have over the week to do &#34;so. There is nothing to prevent them, if they so desire, from resuming the consideration of the agreement on Wednesday next. </para>

                                <para>- It is, but it occurs to me that the company may reasonably ask to be informed as early as possible what the decision of Parliament is. These arrangements are not made or unmade in a few hours. I hope the Senate will get out of its mind any thought that the Government are trying to stampede the agreement through. The Senate is master of its own business, and can have whatever time it likes for the consideration of the motions submitted to it. If the Senate is prepared to allow the motion to pass without further debate I shall make myself more familiar with the position before to-morrow, and ascertain the urgency of the matter. If it is urgent and it should go through now it may be necessary to ask honorable senators to meet again next week in order to complete the discussion. </para>

                            <para>. -  I do not like an opportunity such as this to pass without having a few words to say, as I believe it is the first time that a motion of this character has been debated. In moving that the debate be adjourned I did so with the desire I always have of meeting the wishes of the Government, and of allowing those outside who are interested an opportunity of perusing the agreement.. As the arrangement to be entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the company affects outside business interests in particular, ample time should be given to its consideration. I am quite as anxious as other honorable senators are - I openly state it - that the Senate should rise this week; but in view of the importance attaching to the motion, I suggest to the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> that we should be allowed next week to consider it. There are various interests to be considered, and a motion of such importance should not be too readily carried. The Minister should let us know immediately whether he is agreeable to the Senate meeting next week - that will meet my convenience - although I do not intend to pose as one who is anxious to do well. I think I have previously stated that the Senate should adjourn while another place is discussing the Tariff, so that the members of this Chamber could come back prepared to give it the attention it deserves. </para>

                                <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was quite right in saying that it was the first time a motion of this character had been debated, and I had considerable doubt at the outset as to whether such a course was in order. During the debate I have been looking up our records, to see if there is any precedent, and I find that under standing order 74 the placing of business cannot be debated. This motion was not on the notice-paper, and as there is no precedent I did not at the moment realize that honorable senators who were addressing themselves to the question were out of order; I allowed them to proceed because other honorable senators had spoken to the motion. My ruling now is that in future no debate can be allowed on a motion relating to the placing of business. </para>

G. F. Pearce. </para>

                        <para>- The establishment of the war museums in the States is a matter for the State Governments concerned. Pending the provision of a permanent home for the exhibits reserved for the Commonwealth War Museum, the Museum Committee decided to exhibit half the collection in Sydney and the other half in Melbourne, in cooperation and sharing expenses with the respective State Governments. The present New South Wales Government refused to co-operate; the Victorian Government accepted the Committee&#39;s proposal. The Committee is now arranging in Melbourne an exhibition which will be open to the public in a few months&#39; time.

                    <para>. -  This may be a little bit informal, but if honorable senators will turn to the memorandum they will see that it is quite clear. This clause amends section 108 of the Act dealing with the powers of the commanding officers, and the amendment is largely one of draftsmanship. Sub-section 1 in the principal Act already includes the power of &#34; dismissal,&#34; and the words &#34; or discharge &#34; give no additional power, but use the term &#34; discharge,&#34; which is the term more applicable to a soldier. Proposed new sub-section 2 repeats the old sub-section by providing for the right of trial before discharge or reduction, but it limits the right to cases where the discharge or reduction is due to an offence, and not due to such causes as reduction in establishment, or disbandment of a corps, such as the disbandment of the Australian Imperial Force battalions. If the reason for discharge is not for any offence, it is obvious that he cannot be tried. Proposed new sub-section 3 contains amendments consequential on the withdrawing of clause 18 applying to the Army Act in peace  time.  The sub-section as so. amended applies to war service only. It repeats the provisions of sub-section 3 in the Act, namely, the giving of the powers under the Army Act to a commanding officer to punish offences on war service against the Army Act, but in addition allows those powers to be exercised in respect of offences committed on war service against the Defence Act and regulations. It is to be remembered that every soldier has the right, except in very* minor punishments, of refusing to be punished by his commanding officer, and of being tried by court martial instead. The maximum punishment a commanding officer can give on war service is twenty-eight days&#39; detention. Proposed new subsection 4 will prevent a trainee who is bound to train under the Defence Act from being discharged from that obligation by a commanding officer discharging him. </para>

                    <para>. -  I should like to know why it has been deemed necessary, to substitute the &#34;Military Board or a prescribed officer&#34; as the authority for launching prosecutions. . I quite realize the advisability of striking out the words &#34;District Commandant,&#34; and providing some other machinery, but it appears to me that this clause will unnecessarily load the Military Board, which should confine itself to giving effect to the Government policy rather than dealing with the minor matters of administration. </para>

                <para>SenatorPEARCE (Western Australia -Minister for Defence) &#91;3.48&#93;.  -  In practice, of course, prosecutions would not be launched by the Military Board, and that is why it is proposed to insert the words &#34;or a prescribed officer.&#34; We are not constituting the divisional commanders as the prosecuting authority, and therefore this must be the function of the Military Board or a prescribed officer. In nine cases out of ten&#39; a divisional officer or some of his staff might be required to conduct a prosecution, but there may be cases &#39;in which the Military Board might have to launch prosecutions, for  instance, against a divisional commander who, perhaps, had misappropriated funds. This of course is unlikely, but it is a possibility. </para>

Obviously, it cannot be the persons who subscribed the money or the band instruments. They would not be a legal entity.

                        <para>-I am not speaking of Government property. It seems to mo that the section which this clause is intended to amend does confer something in the nature of a legal ownership of money or property subscribed or appropriated, in the manner set out in the section, upon the commanding officer. Throughout the war there were many private subscriptions by various persons of . money and goods, and there were rumours that on certain occasions money and goods subscribed in this way were improperly disposed of. The section would appear almost to legalize that kind of thing. </para>

Section 112 of the principal Act was amended in 1918 by the insertion of the words &#34;not serving under Part XII. of this Act.&#34; That amendment was made in order to bring the section into conformity with the provisions of Part XII., under which persons arc liable to compulsory training. The amendment went further than was intended, and this clause represents merely a drafting provision to make the necessary correction. </para>

                        <para>. -  This clause amends section 113 of. the principal Act, which deals with the power to arrest by the addition of a now subsection (2), as set out in the Bill. That sub-section applies only to the war service when troops are subject to the Army Act. It does not override the application of the present section 113 of the Defence Act, but provides that the section shall not be construed as preventing the application of the provision of the Army Act regarding arrest, when in war time the troops are subject to the Army Act. The amendment is really one of drafting to insure that the intention of the Act as a whole is not inadvertently defeated by the form of drafting of the section. </para>

                <para>I submit the motion, perhaps, through excessive caution. I have listened to the statement of the Minister for Defence, and I take it that the powers of arrest and. detention would really be extended by the proposed new sub-section. Another objection I have is that there is a reference in it to the Army Act. I think that wherever these words appear in the Bill they should be struck out. We do not want the Army Act. We want the Defence Department to develop an Australian Defence Act. Every reference to outside Acts should, in my opinion, be removed from our Statutes. </para>

                        <para>- When the Minister introduced the Bill he stressed the necessity which exists for training our men, in time of peace, so that in time of war they would be accustomed to the Act under which they would then be operating. That was one of his principal reasons for desiring to apply the Army Act to our Forces in time of peace. The Committee, however, emphatically decided that the Army Act should not be applicable to those Forces in time of peace. The Minister has asked whether we should have one Act operative in time of peace and another Act operative in time of war. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that when I indorsed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster&#39;s</inline> remarks I had no intention whatever of reflecting upon the Minister. In my opinion, the. retention in this Bill of the Army Act in its application, even in time of war, to a grown-up nation like Australia, is altogether unwarranted. During the recess the Minister will do well if he calls together his officers and advisers and instructs them to draft an entirely new Army Act, so that when our troops again engage in war they may do so under an Australian Act, and under the command of Australian officers. I trust that the honorable gentleman will look into the clause with a view to seeing whether - without weakening our Defence Act - this new provision cannot be struck out. It is not a provision which he cannot do without. The provisions under which he has been working for a considerable time are already in the principal Act. This is a new proposal, and in my judgment he may well allow it to go by the board. The matter will still be provided for in our Defence Act. </para>

To pretend that the deletion of this clause would interfere with the co-operation of our troops with the British Army is too absurd to warrant serious consideration.

                    <para>. - I am sorry that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> should have thought that I accused him of being either an Imperialist or a bad Australian. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that the clause should be negatived. When the matter was previously before the Committee I was quite willing that the Army Act should be made applicable to our Australian Forces in time of war. But I objected to its application to them in time of peace. Anything, therefore, which I said by way of interjection whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was speaking, and which was applicable to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> is equally applicable to myself. We are retaining the Army Act in its application to our Australian Forces in time of war because we anticipate that if ever we are at war again we shall be at war in conjunction with the British Empire, whose Forces will be governed by that Act. I do not object to that, nor was I seeking to cast any reflection upon the attitude of the Minister when I made the interjection to which he took exception. </para>

                    <para>. - Proposed new section H9a is intended to cover the cases of men who were discharged, whilst absent through desertion, by the Governor-General. It is also a necessary provision for the future. Proposed new section 11 9b is designed to cover the cases of men who, at the time of the armistice, were placed upon leave of absence, without pay, and who were not discharged for some time. These men were not given permission to engage in civilian occupations during their leave. The Government gave their cases full consideration and granted them every possible benefit. But it decided not to discharge them, because the armistice might have been of only a temporary duration. Hostilities might have been resumed, and, accordingly, these men were discharged only as if they were on leave without pay. Subsequently it was discovered that they might be able to claim pay. To avoid that contingency this provision is being inserted. Provision is also being made to cover the question of the pay of men who were allowed to return to their homes on account of sickness, &#38;c, and who never returned to duty, but were discharged. The cases of men who were reduced in rank for inefficiency ot for offences are also covered by the clause where the reduction was irregular. There is a number of these cases - not a very great number - and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> pointed out earlier in the discussion, many of these irregular discharges were due to a lack- of knowledge of the Army Act and of the procedure to be followed. The man himself suffered no wrong in any- way, except that the technical requirements of the Army Act were not complied with. Any cases of hardship that may arise are left under the proposed section to the discretion of the Minister, but no hard and fast rule is laid down. Some men, for instance, were placed on leave of absence without pay, and they may have been unable to obtain employment by reason of their not possessing a discharge certificate. These cases can be dealt with, although we have not met any of them so far. Then there were the men who deserted in England, and did not report, although frequent advertisements were inserted in the newspapers. We had eventually, by order from the Governor-General, to discharge them. Our Act makes no provision for it. Some of those men may come along- </para>

                        <para>- No; I meant irregularities in the administration of the Army Act overseas. These were faults of administration. Things which were quite justified and morally right were done, but were technically irregular because of our officers&#39; lack of knowledge of the Army Act. This is really a validating clause to deal with those cases. </para>

                        <para>.- This clause in proposed new section 123f raises a rather interesting question. It is intended to prevent the Minister or departmental officers being required under subpoena to produce what are considered to be confidential public documents before Courts in litigation between private parties. For instance, the Department has been subpoenaed in a number of cases to produce the medical history sheets of returned soldiers, particularly in divorce cases. This has entailed the frequent employment of counsel, and the incurring of large expenditure which has not been recovered. A number of applications have been made to me, as Minister, by Courts for the production of papers, and I have been advised by the Crown Law authorities to follow the rule laid down in Great Britain, which is that a Minister or a Department is not entitled to refuse to produce a paper if the refusal would enable the law to be defeated, or is against the interests of public policy, or the proper interests of the people. It is obvious, however, that when the citizens of Australia enlist, as they did in &#39; the Australian Imperial Force, we should not use their enlistment to injure them by allowing some other person to get from our records - for instance, from the medical history that we may have of any man, and that we only obtained through his volunteering to fight for his country - information to his detriment or possible injury. I do not know of any case where a refusal has been made which would be detrimental to &#39;the best public interests of the Commonwealth, but it is necessary in the interests of the soldiers themselves that we should have the power to refuse to produce documents in certain&#39; cases. </para>

                <para>The second proposed new section in the clause relates to the prevention of undesirable trading in Red Cross goods. That is a very necessary power, not only in war time, but in peace time, because there are still a number of soldiers in our hospitals, and we should have the right to protect the Red Cross Society by preventing trafficking in their goods. Unfortunately there are people mean enough to have trafficked in those goods during, the war. In one case I know of the store in which the goods were housed was broken into and a large quantity taken away. &#34;We have good reason to believe - although it has been impossible to produce the necessary evidence to prove - that those goods were subsequently sold by people taking them round for sale. </para>

                    <para>. -  We arc on dangerous ground. In a case arising in a centre_ some distance from Melbourne: the&#39; prompt production of a document may be of the greatest advantage to the Court. I am not referring to secret or valuable documents which would give away information that should not be given to the public. I take it that, beyond everything else, the Government and Parliament, should take very fine care to keep justice pure. No document which is required to enable justice to be done should be withheld from a properly-constituted Court. It may be taken for granted that if a document is asked for, and counsel for one. side or the other thinks its production will injure his case, he will object; but. if the immediate production of a document by the Defence Department will help to put the truth more clearly before a Court, I can see no reason for delaying, it. Justice delayed is justice denied. Already in the great and important city of Sydney we are suffering fearfully throu&#39;gh having to come to the Minister in Melbourne in connexion with the most trivial things, and by this clause it is possible that our Courts of justice in Sydney will be compelled to send to Melbourne for evidence which is essential to accomplish the ends of justice. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> were asked to attend a Court inSydney, he might not consider himself subject to the laws of the State of New South Wales. The production&#39; of some document may be essential to prove or disprove an allegation against the reputation of a soldier. The production of his own certificate will be the very thing that is required to prove that the allegation against him is untrue. </para>

The production of documents may be the means of helping counsel in conducting- cases, but we are going somewhat out of the well beaten track if we allow the officers of the Defence Department to enjoy privileges which are not possessed by other members of the community. </para>

                        <para>- No. I understand that this clause is not for the protection of the Minister, but for his officers, and to prevent them disclosing documents without his knowledge. We have had the same experience in South Australia in connexion with our Boards of Health, where the Secretary of a big Department has refused, on the same grounds, to disclose information or evidence to a Court of justice, and surely in connexion with the Defence Department we should see that the right of the Minister is safeguarded. I trust the Committee will support the clause. </para>

                    <para>. - It was my intention to make a similar speech to that delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benny;</inline> but I was not going to draw quite the same conclusion. I agree that the common law, as handed down to us by our forefathers, is excellent, and provides the proper and necessary protection for the custody and non-disclosure of documents which should be kept private; but I cannot see any necessity for an extension of the power which this clause contemplates. Experience of the administration of the common law in regard to this matter in, the past has not revealed any necessity, either in Great Britain or in any of her Dominions, for the extension contemplated. As there is protection at present, why should we extend it &#39;( It is really carrying the principle a little farther, but to just what extent I am not prepared to say. </para>

The small amount of money involved is hardly worth considering, and I might incidentally mention for the benefit of those who have made somewhat facetious interjections that no member of Parliament can be briefed by the Federal Government or any of its Departments. For the reasons given, it is not my intention to, vote for the clause. I do not see that there is any necessity for it, because if we adopt it we are departing from the old-established common law. In this instance I am in accord&#39; with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> and also with the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott.</inline> Although it may be somewhat irrelevant, I desire to say that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is at present perusing the evening newspaper, I am hoping that we shall be able to dispose of seven or eight clauses as we did yesterday when he was similarly engaged. </para>

I can prove it by saying that while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> was speaking I was following his argument and reading with pleasure that the Australian cricketers, after a very bad start, had compiled a total of 263 runs, of which number Gregory had contributed 104 not out. </para>

The honorable senator immediately replied that- that was not so,, because the Government had not the power to brief members of Parliament. Although the Government may not have the power, members of the legal fraternity in this Chamber are endeavouring to protect the interests of that very strong and splendid union of which they are members. The honorable senator also suggested that there was an opportunity of hurrying the Bill through while I was reading; but I think he will now realize that it is better to let sleeping dogs lie. </para>

                        <para>- Some time ago an action was instituted in the Supreme Court of Victoria by an ex-member of the Australian Imperial Force against a newspaper for libel. He claimed that in his. capacity as a soldier he had been libelled, and that for the proper conduct of his case it was necessary that certain documents relating to his conduct in the Australian Imperial Force should be produced. If I remember aright, it was stated to the Court that the documents could not be produced, because their production would be against the public interests. I do not know whether they would have helped his case or not, although he and his counsel claimed that their production would have materially assisted. I believe that the papers were not produced because an officer from the Defence Department declared that the Minister had certified that to produce them would not be for the public good. I&#39; can very well understand that a Minister, especially the Minister for Defence, with- a large number of important matters to deal with, involving questions of policy and administration, would have very little opportunity to give personal attention to this question of producing documents. It is quite conceivable that some senior officer would &#34;advise that the papers be not produced, in the public&#39; interests, and the Minister, relying upon the- loyalty of his officer, would act accordingly, and say - &#34; No: I decline to produce the documents, on the ground that to do so would he adverse to the public interest.&#34; Although the Minister would not be to blame personally, he would be responsible officially for any such refusal, and I can well understand that the interests of justice might not be served by the non-production of documents asked for. If this clause is agreed to it will be necessary to get the consent of the Minister before any document is produced in the Court, and as the Minister in the multitudinous details of general administration and policy would not have time, personally, to attend to an application, he would accept the advice of his officers and refuse, or consent, as the case may be. The public interest is very &#39;well served by the present: methods of administration of justice in regard to. the  production . of public documents. . Anybody connected with the legal profession will agree that the Departments are amply protected at present.  Under this clause no public documents relating to a Department will in any circumstances be produced unless the prior consent of the Minister has been obtained. That, I think, would be putting too much upon the Minister.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.</inline> - &#34;What would be the position, if the Minister was personally affected. </para>

                        <para>- I should say that if a Minister were a party to the litigation he might, under this clause, be induced to block the production of certain documents which might tell against him. But this, of course, is an extreme supposition. In the case to which I have already &#39;referred, the newspaper- which was alleged to have libelled an ex-member of the Australian Imperial Force relied &#39; upon justification., and endeavoured to prove that their comment had been fair and justified by the circumstances. It was stated that if certain documents were produced by the Defence Department it would be shown that the alleged facts were not&#39; facts at all. But the documents were not produced. That is the present position, of the law. I do not know whether we need strengthen or buttress it. I think it would be putting upon the Minister an unnecessary obligation to ask him, in every instance&#39; where documents are called for either to consent to or refuse their production.&#39; At present the Minister has to state if, in his opinion, it would be adverse <inline font-style="italic">tol</inline> the public interests to produce them. If such a statement is made to the Court, I do not know that it is necessary for the Minister even to appear; the Court does not enforce their production. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it is. An application is made, and a subpoena is issued to some officer calling for the production of certain documents. The Minister then has to decide whether he shall, or &#34;shall not, object to their production. If he objects he has to brief counsel to appear in the Court and say that the Minister objects, on the ground of public policy, to the production of the&#39; papers asked for. Under this clause that course would not. be necessary, because the Court would have to get the consent of the Minister for the production of the documents asked for. It would not be necessary to brief counsel to appear to object to the production &#39;of papers in connexion with all these divorce cases which really do not concern the Department at all. *I can assure honorable senators that the great majority of the applications for the production of papers&#39; have been for the medical history of soldiers in connexion with divorce cases. The trouble. is that one refusal is not sufficient, and every time an application is made the Department has to brief a solicitor to appear in court. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether the court would &#34; see &#34; him. I am informed that- the Department must be represented. The amendment proposed will not&#34; alter the procedure, because the Minister will still have to decide whether he will, or will not give his consent. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> that any Minister would regard this as a matter of no consequence. I consider that it is one of the most responsible things which the Minister has to decide. If in connexion with a law case a document is asked for, I think that the Minister has to take a great responsibility in saying that he will not permit that document to be produced. I approach the consideration of such applications with very great care. I inform myself fully as to the circumstances before I refuse to produce documents that are asked for by a .court. I consider that such refusal must he justified by very strong reasons. As to the class, of case affecting medical histories, I have no doubt as to how they should be dealt with, and there is a Ministerial minute in the&#39; Department, which is regarded as a rule, and is acted upon accordingly, refusing applications for medical histories.. One part of the clause is intended to prevent officers acting is this connexion without the Minister&#39;s consent, and that certainly should be provided for. </para>

                    <para>. - A point that has been overlooked is that, under the clause, in future no document can be produced without the consent of the Minister, and he need give no reason for his  refusal.  In the past, he has been required to say that he refuses to produce a document because to do so would be against public policy. Ministers are public men, in whom the public have confidence, and when a Minister, in refusing to produce a document, gives as the reason for his refusal that to produce it would be against public policy, no further inquiry is made. But under this clause, in future the Minister will be given the power to refuse to produce a document without giving any reason, although to produce it might not be against public policy. I strongly  urge upon  honorable senators that this power should be rejected. </para>

                        <para>- The Red Cross is a permanent organization: Trench comforts funds were organized during the war. An attempt is being made to continue them for the Citizen Forces, but I am very doubtful whether that can be done. I am afraid that it would be found so difficult to administer the amendment that it would become a dead letter. I doubt whether it would accomplish anything, and it might make it an offence to do certain things which should hot be regarded as offences. If a man gets an article from a canteen, what objection can there be to his selling it afterwards? </para>

I suggest that the insertion of the words &#34; or other prescribed organization or person &#34; would probably meet the case. </para>

The proposed new section goes farther and meets the case put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> who pointed out that as the officer appointed to a divisional command is appointed on the recommendation of the. Military Board, an officer&#39;s appeal under the existing regulations can go only to that Board, and that therefore it is really an appeal from Caesar to Caesar. The honorable senator suggested that an officer should have a right of appeal to the Governor-General, and that is provided for in the proposed new section. It will also give an officer similar power to obtain redress to that which is provided in the Army Act, bub for the Army Council it substitutes the Military Board or the General Officer Commanding of the Australian Forces; for the Secretary of State it substitutes the Minister : and for  His  Majesty it substitutes the. Governor-General. It is similar to the Australian Military Regulations, but it goes farther by providing for an appeal by an officer to the Governor-General, both in time of peace and in time of war, whereas the present regulations provide that an appeal in time of peace may go only as far as the Military Board. &#34;Under the proposed new section a soldier will have a right of appeal to a different authority from that which has caused the thing to be done of which he complains. In other words, if a wrong has been done by his captain he may appeal to the captain&#39;s next superior officer, and so on, right up to the General Officer Commanding. In the British Army the appeal by a soldier does not go to the King. This, however, is not a class distinction as between the officer and the soldier. The distinction is made because in the case of an officer he would be appealing for redress from the act of his superior officer to that superior officer. A further reference to the King is therefore given in the case of an officer in order that the civil authority may intervene between the officer of whom complaint is made and the officer who makes the complaint. Under the Army Act the right of appeal is up to the General Officer Commanding: in the case of the soldier. The proposals I have submitted provide for a right of appeal in peace time from the General Officer Commanding to the Military Board. In the case of an officer, however, the appeal is to the Governor-General, who, in some cases, is the only authority through whom redress can be obtained. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has given notice of a number of amendments upon this proposed new section. I have not had time to study their effect, but I gather that the last portion of them really relates to a different subject. I would therefore suggest to him that it would be more convenient for the Committee to discuss these two matters separately. The first question has reference to the redress of wrongs. The other question relates to a civil remedy for injustices done. That, of course, will be supplementary to any question involving the redress of wrongs, and I suggest that it need not be debated upon these proposals. The provisions dealing with the redress of wrongs which are contained in the proposed new section, are more liberal than any which have hitherto existed, and the question which we have to determine is whether or not they are adequate. After that matter has been disposed of, we can proceed to decide separately the question of whether in respect of wrongs done, there shall be civil redress in addition. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> , has made a very fair attempt to meet the wishes of the Committee as expressed when the subject was previously discussed, but it is not quite clear that his amendment gives the right of appeal on anything except a wrong done by an officer. A soldier may be labouring under a grievance or wrong which cannot be sheeted home to any one in particular. Still, it may be a real injustice which ought to be redressed, and which would be redressed if he had an opportunity to state his case fully. Does not the opening sentence of the amendment limit the appeal to the case of a wrong or injury done by some one person ? </para>

                        <para>- I am not moving that part at this moment. Honorable senators who have familiarized themselves with the Army Act will see that my amendments will introduce into our Defence Act the most desirable features of the Army Act, giving full power for the redress of wrongs. They go somewhat beyond the Army Act, seeing that they give to the soldier the same power as they give to his officer to appeal to the highestCourt in the land, which is Parliament. I -was led to make that alteration because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> was influenced to vote against a previous amendment by reason of the fact that I had not provided similar rights  for the soldier and officer. In this case I have in a democratic way given similar rights to both. </para>

Is it the pleasure of the Committee that the honorable senator have leave to move, as one motion, the omission of sub-sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Minister&#39;s amendment ? If that is done, those who desire to retain any one or two of those three sub-sections will be debarred from doing so. If there is any objection, I shall simply put the question that subsection 2 be left out. </para>

                        <para>- If the Minister agrees to an amendment in the first portion of the clause it will prevent honorable senators from moving amendments subsequently. Is the Minister satisfied with the wording of sub-clause 1 of the proposed new section 123h? Does he not consider that that might be more clearly stated? Evidently the draftsman had in his mind that an officer would have the right to appeal if he considered that he had been wronged. The view I hold is that the proposed new section is so worded that it seems to deal only with actual wrong. </para>

                        <para>- To me it appears that the wording is not sufficiently clear, and I believe that in- the first portion of the clause some alteration in the form of expression would enable it to be more correctly interpreted later. If the Minister is satisfied with it in its present form, I shall allow it to pass, but not without protest. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot think of any word at the moment that would make the proposed sub-section clearer than it is, because if an officer thinks he is wronged, it does not matter how, or by whom, &#39;or whether he has any rights under the Act - the fact that he thinks he has been wronged gives him the right to appeal. The wording is as wide as we can possibly make it. </para>

                    -seems .to have some doubt as to whether the wording is .sufficiently wide. I &#39; originated the discussion on this particular subject, and I considered it most carefully in conjunction with the provisions of the &#39;Army Act. I&#39; do not think we can go wrong in adhering to the words in the proposed new clause. If a man thinks - he need not have any greater foundation than that - that he is wronged, he can have his case heard.

I have no objection to the sub-clause in relation to officers, but wish to provide that officers and soldiers who are dealt with in the following sub-clauses shall be in a similar position. I can assure honorable senators that the men are better provided for under my proposal than under that of the Minister. When I first gave notice of certain amendments, the Minister had not made any provision for the redress of wrongs except by regulations, which, for various reasons, I considered ineffective. I came to the conclusion that, in this instance, we should follow the British Army Act, and have it in black and white, and not in regulations which could be varied from time to time by the autherities. I am merely moving in this direction with the idea of providing that soldiers and officers shall start in the same place and end by appealing to the Governor-General if necessary. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> places members of the Committee in a somewhat peculiar position. The amend.ments of which the honorable senator has given notice are numerous, and embrace so many more details on the lines of the proposal submitted by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> that one is somewhat fearful that in deleting a portion of the Minister&#39;s amendment, one may interfere with its passage. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> amendment is in order, but he has not put the case sufficiently clearly to demonstrate why - with the exception of one point, that the soldier and officer should have equal finality of appeal- we should go any farther than the Minister&#39;s proposal. In my opinion, the proposed new section provides something which has not been in existence even by regulation. </para>

Some of the officers with whom I came in contact when in the ranks were a pretty &#34; crook &#34; lot, but I think the Minister&#39;s provision is sufficiently wide, as there are various channels through which a man can appeal. The complaint made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> was, I believe, that the officers in appealing to the Military Board were really appealing from Caesar to Caesar, and that we do not go beyond that in this amendment. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> informs us that to get beyond the Military Board to the Governor-General political influence is necessary. An appeal to the Governor-General really . means to the Minister in charge. </para>

                <para>SenatorFOSTER. - Yes, and the Minister must be guided to some extent by the recommendations of the Military Board. He might consider it his duty to give consideration to a complaint in the case of a man who held the rank of the honorable senator in the Australian Imperial Force. But the position as stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> the other day was, I think, altogether different. I thought his idea was to ignore the Military Board altogether. </para>

                        <para>- I take it that the honorable senator means through the proper channels. It is rather difficult to understand just where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> series of amendments will take us. At present we must confine our attention to the point at issue. I fail to see what more the honorable senator could hope to accomplish than the Minister expects to achieve. The soldier, with four different courts of appeal available to him, is in rather a different position from an officer holding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> rank. In his case there would be appeal from the General Officer Commanding to the Military Board and the Governor-General. With my knowledge of the men in the ranks, I am afraid that many men will be inclined to cause any amount of trouble on all sorts of decisions if they have an opportunity of appealing to different authorities right up to the Governor-General. </para>

                <para>General and the Minister for Defence, will be raised. I would also like to point out that, even under this amendment, it would be necessary to frame regulations setting out the complaints in respect of which no appeal would lie, and in respect of which there should be no suspension of sentence. Otherwise you are going to land the Defence Department in a lot of trouble. The authorities will not know where they are. For. instance, it would be a simple matter for a man sentenced to detention to say, &#34;I am appealing against the sentence, and until my appeal is dealt with by the Governor-General I maintain that you must not keep me in  quod.&#39; &#34; It would appear, therefore, that regulations should be framed providing that no appeals should be allowed for the purpose of evading punishment lawfully awarded by the Court. </para>

                        <para>- The wording does not matter very much. There is only one principle at stake of any importance. The difference between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> amendments and mine is just this: In time of war an appeal by a soldier would be dealt with by the General Officer Commanding, and in time of peace by the Military Board, whereas an appeal by an officer must go to the Governor-General in time of peace or war. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> has already pointed out that the soldier has really four courts of appeal. He appeals to his colonel for redress of what he may consider to be a wrong done him ; then to the brigadier, and to the general or the superior officer commanding the Army, and from him to the Military Board. At least three of these courts of appeal would have no direct connexion with the soldier&#39;s unit, and, therefore, there could be no personal feeling in the matter at all. The courts would be quite disinterested, and not disposed to cover up any injustice that might have been done in the smaller unit. In the case of an officer, on the other hand, he could appeal to his superior officer, who might be the General Officer Commanding, as in General Elliott&#39;s case, and then to the Governor-General. A senior officer would have only two courts of appeal, but an officer placed in General Elliott&#39;s position, appealing to General Birdwood as the General Officer Commanding, and then to the Governor-General, if he still thought himself wronged, would have only one court of appeal. In the case of a. soldier who enlists, nothing arising out of his enlistment can constitute a wrong. There can be no question of supersession. If qualified he is appointed to a commission, and then is selected from a number who are all equally competent, or are presumed to be equally competent, to a position of command. Honorable senators can see the possibilities of injustice at this stage. Supersession is infinitely greater in the case of an officer than in the case of a man, because an officer may be wronged by the opinion of the officer commanding who makes the selection. Therefore, there are a variety of reasons why an appeal by an officer to the Governor-General should be allowed without conceding the same privilege to a soldier. Their positions are not analogous. Really, so far as this amendment is concerned, the point which honorable senators are asked to decide between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> amendment and mine is as to whether the soldier should also have the right of appeal to the Governor-General. </para>

                        <para>- The later amendments raise other issues. I ask the Committee hot to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> amendment, because in practice it would so clog the wheels of administration that no Minister could possibly find time to personally investigate the large number of cases that would come before him, in time of war especially. This matter came before me rather prominently when I was in England during the time of demobilization. While in London I got a request from a soldier who wished to state his grievance, in the belief that I was in London for the purpose of inquiring into grievances. I listened to the man, and took a note of what he said. He left the room, and subsequently I left also, but by another door, and I happened to pass down a corridor in which he was standing in conversation with another soldier. They were talking loudly, so I could not help overhearing the conversation. The other man said to him, &#34; Hallo, Bill. I remember you were down seeing General Monash the other day.&#34; The other man replied, &#34;Yes,&#34; and his companion said, &#34;Did you get that story into Monash?&#34; &#34;Yes,&#34; said the man who had seen me, and then his friend asked, &#34;What are you doing up here? Are you seeing the Minister about it?&#34; The, man who had interviewed me replied, &#34; Oh, yes. I am going to give them all a&#39;fly&#39;.&#34; I am afraid that is how it would be if we gave every soldier this right of appeal to the Governor-General. I trust the Committee will not accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- - The Minister has fairly pointed out to the Committee precisely where we stand in regard to the one point at issue, namely, whether we should give the soldier the right of appeal to the highest Court in the land : the Governor-General  in Council. I ask honorable senators to give the matter very careful consideration. A great many men come to me, just as the Minister said they came to &#34;him in London, and on their story, <inline font-style="italic">prima facie,</inline> they have suffered grievous wrong. It would appear that their superior officers, one after another, acted like rubber stamps. Apparently, they accepted entirely the word of the officers below them. If a captain or a major inflicts a wrong upon a man, and he appeals to his colonel, the captain or the major may come along and say, &#34; Private So-and-so is a rotter. You cannot believe him.&#34; The colonel then confirms what the captain or major may have done, and his decision, perhaps unconsciously, implicates him in seeing that the decision is upheld before the brigadier. Unfortunately, the private has no chance of getting in first, and so superior officers get their minds prejudiced against the man. This is the danger I see in refusing this ultimate right of appeal to Parliament. It would be a case of <inline font-style="italic">in terrorem.</inline> Many colonels and brigadiers are not disposed to put themselves about to redress wrongs; but if they thought there was a possibility of a soldier getting his grievance ventilated in the Parliament, they would feel it necessary to do their duty. Honorable senators will find that my amendments provide drastic penalties for an officer who wilfully neglects his duty in this respect. He may be sued for damages. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that in respect of any appeal to the Governor-General the evidence and all the papers could be brought to the Parliament and discussed. I propose that if a man disputes the correctness of documents or complains that documents affecting his case have been extracted from the file - and such things are not unknown - his complaint may be referred to a Judge, so that the preliminary facts may be sifted with the assistance of counsel, and the complete case could then be brought before Parliament. I hope that honorable senators will not be influenced by the idea that there would be so many of these appeals that they would block the ordinary course of administration of the Army. They will remember that I propose to provide that in time of war the Minister shall have power to suspend the hearing of a complaint until the end of the war. </para>

                        <para>- That is possible. But his complaint will be on record and the officer of whom he has complained will know that if both survive., his action will ultimately be subject to review. I admit that what I propose is the introduction of provisions which will be largely <inline font-style="italic">in terror em.</inline> It is possible that some officers will take the chance that they, or those who have complained of them, will be wiped out, and complaints against them settled in that way. But if the proposals I make are accepted, officers will know&#39; that their conduct may be severely criticised in Parliament on their return to Australia. I am aware of the difficulties in the way of giving effect to what I propose, but I am prepared to go very far to at any rate create the impression that our soldiers, who are not free to join the Army&#39; or leave it alone as are men in Great Britain, but are conscripted willy-nilly, will ultimately, so far as we can secure it to them, be given a square deal and be protected from grievous wrong. My proposed amendments are in keeping with the democratic idea that we should make no distinction between officers and rank and file. I have crossed swords with the Minister for Defence in this matter to secure for all ranks the right of an ultimate appeal to Parliament, if they feel aggrieved. </para>

                        <para>- !AU that the use of the words &#34; except in time .of war &#34; means, if read in conjunction with the rest of the amendment, is that there will still be the right of appeal to the General Officer Commanding but not to the Military Board, in time of war. I am afraid that the honorable senator is basing his remarks on a copy of an amendment which I submitted but which has beep withdrawn. </para>

                        <para>- We have to consider what the Executive really is. If a soldier appealed from the Military Board to the Executive, what real advantage would that give him? He could not appear before the Executive. He might send his complaint to the Minister to have it brought before the Executive. The Executive Council at &#39;which the complant is considered might consist of three or four Ministers and the Vice-President of the Executive Council. The Minister might say at the Executive meeting, &#34; This is a case in which the soldier has already been to So-and-so. He has had four appeals already.  His  case has been thoroughly investigated, and I cannot recommend that anything should be done.&#34; The Minister might take this course in the honest performance of his duty, and what benefit would the appeal to the Executive be to the soldier in such a case. </para>

                    <para>.- This clause, which looks rather an involved one, is not so in fact. It provides for the insertion of certain words in various places, and is intended to permit of the regulations giving confirming officers power to deal with any findings or sentences of courts martial found after confirmation as being completed to be invalid. The new paragraph <inline font-style="italic">gb</inline> permits the regulations to govern the nature of the restraint, discipline, and training of trainees under sentences of detention awarded by a civil Court. The word &#34; command &#34; is intended to allow the regulations to provide for affiliated units of Senior Cadets being under the command of the Citizen Force Divisional and Unit Commanders. They are really technical amendments. </para>

                    <para>. - My answer to the honorable senator is that the paragraph in question will not give a general control of aerial navigation.We have already legislated in regard to civil aviation by means of an Act, and of regulations framed under that Act. But, so far, we have not an Act providing for the establishment of an Air Force, notwithstanding that we have an Air Force in existence. At present that Force is being governed by our Defence Act. But in addition, it is necessary in connexion with our military defence that we should possess certain powers over aerial navigation, so as to prevent, for instance, flying over a magazine or a fort. </para>

                    <para>.- This clause involves no new principle. It is really a drafting clause, revising the form in which the compulsory training and registration provisions appear in the principal Act. Except for the drafting amendments, the only real amendment is contained in the proviso. It is proposed that the words &#34; imminent danger of war&#34; shall be . omitted, and that the words &#34;unless the Governor-General otherwise directs &#34; shall be substituted for them. The right to require training by the use of the omitted words becomes dependent on the question of fact which may be difficult to prove in the absence of a power to declare the existence of imminent danger of war. If the words &#34;unless the Governor-General otherwise directs &#34; are rejected the words &#34; except in time of war &#34; could be substituted. &#34; Time of war &#34; is defined in section  4.  However, the use of the latter words would entail the Governor-General suspending training under the Defence Act, section - 125d, at the present time, for it is still technically a &#34; time of war.&#34; The word &#34; registration &#34; as at present used might be construed as -qualifying the word &#34; parade.&#34; For this reason the wording has been altered to read &#34;one muster parade or one registration&#34;. For the sake of uniformity the word &#34; training&#34; in the proviso has been substituted for the word &#34;service&#34;. Honorable senators will gather from the explanation which I have given that even in the proviso there is no important principle involved. At the same time, one can easily see that a declaration of &#34;imminence of war &#34; by the Governor-General might be extremely inadvisable. The words which it is proposed to insert in lieu thereof constitute, I think, an. improvement. The fact of the late war technically continuing, although practically it has ceased to operate, justifies the amendment proposed in this clause. </para>

If there be one thing more than another at which we aim in connexion with our Military Forces, it is efficiency. It is practically a stupid thing to compel a man to devote a certain amount of his time to something in which &#39;he has become proficient years before. I do not think there is any military advantage in it. The average intelligent young Australian will learn all the ordinary drill necessary for a private in six weeks, and become quite efficient. He may not be a show man, but he will at least be fairly efficient in the time, as regards all the movements and orders he is called on to obey, with the excellent physical training that most of our schools give. I am not- trying to limit or take from the Department or the military authorities the right to have what they consider efficient training. I have here an amendment which has been hurriedly drafted, but if the principle is accepted it can easily be put into proper shape. I move - </para>

Why should a young man who, at the age of 19, is as efficient as he ever will bie, be compelled if he stays in the ranks to go  through the same  movements  and the same training year after year? </para>

                        <para>- The ordinary intelligent young man, if taken into camp for six weeks, would probably become in that time as efficient as ever he would be as a private drilling in the ranks. Of course, in certain technical arms, it would take much longer for a man to become efficient. But what I want to avoid is the humdrum &#39; repetition year after year of movements and orders that are so familiar that they become repugnant. The Department could prescribe a very strict examination. I do not mean that the senior cadet should be exempted for all time on passing, the examination. I would&#39; have the Senior Cadets and Citizen Forces kept separate in that regard. The cadet needs his first two years of training as a junior, then he goes into the Senior Cadets, and if after his first twelve months there he can show he has reached the standard of efficiency required by the Department, why not exempt him until it is time for him to go into the Citizen Forces? A similar principle has been applied to public schools. An age was fixed at which boys could leave school, but an examination was .also provided to enable a boy who passed it to leave before that age. If efficiency up to the standard required by the Defence Department can be secured in two years, why compel a man to drill six or seven years? From inquiries I have made and what I have seen of the cadet training, I feel that the Department will be compelled sooner or later to reconsider seriously the whole system of training for the youth and manhood of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt&#39; many young fellows do.&#39; &#39; I read an account lately of how a deputation waited on the camp commandant to ask that their time in camp should be extended. I can quite understand that, particularly at present, when the military life is very popular among young men. What good is to be obtained from training men for . a long period to reach&#39; a standard of efficiency when you could prescribe that standard and induce them to reach it in much less time? What is desired is efficiency. The test of efficiency is examination, and that examination will be prescribed by the Department. I have had this proposal in my mind for a long time; in fact, somewhere about 1911 I moved a similar amendment. Time has gone on, and the Forces have been trained. The compulsory system is undergoing a test. Whether it will be successful or not has yet to be seen. Because it is in the experimental stage, I desire to make it as popular and intelligent as I can. I therefore want a standard of efficiency prescribed that will give the senior cadet or the citizen soldier an opportunity of winning his way out, not by shirking, but by proving that he is efficient. That would be a step in the right direction to popularize compulsory training. </para>

                    <para>. - No one could object to the terms in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has put the amendment forward. I think he &#39;has said all that could be said to recommend it; but there are some serious objections to it. It is extremely doubtful whether, if a proper standard of efficiency were laid down, any person doing only the amount of training demanded by the Defence Act would be able to pass it. Consequently, only those who could obtain outside coaching, in addition,- Would be able to pass it. That, obviously, would  play into the hands of one section of the community: that is, those who could afford the time and money for such coaching. Among the Senior Cadets the boys who by this means would escape their obligations under the Defence Act would be those attending the secondary schools, and not those who have to go out to earn their own living. The senior cadet is not only being trained in military movements, but the training aims at his physical development. If a fourteen-year-old boy were able to pass tha test of efficiency he would not be compelled, under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> amendment, to undergo any more physical training until he reached the age of eighteen,&#39; and he might neglect his physical development in the meantime. The physical development brought about by this training is a great asset to the country. It is the principal part of the training. I do not say that the amount of training the cadets get is sufficient to develop them thoroughly; but it gives them a liking for physical development and encourages them to take up sport of various kinds to develop themselves further. What would happen when the cadet became a soldier? The Army is art organization, and the organization is carried down to small units, companies, and platoons. If the amendment were carried, as these men became efficient they would be lost to the platoon or company The standard of training in the unit is raised according to the number of efficient soldiers in it, and the presence of efficient soldiers has a beneficial effect on those who are less efficient. Very often an officer calls attention to the efficient way in which a certain soldier is performing an exercise, as an example to the others; but under the amendment we should lose all the efficient soldiers, and the company would consist only of the less efficient. That would have a very bad effect. Our Force is officered by Citizen Force officers. The company officer gets a good part of his training by drilling his platoon or company. If he had only the less efficient, it would militate against his training as an officer. It would be more helpful to him as an officer to have a more efficient company, and to be able to take on the higher training. For these reasons, I must ask the Committee to reject the amendment, although there is at the back of it a very important principle. I can see that, from an economic point of view, it would be better if we could shorten the number of years in which the training is carried out. There would be an economic value to the soldier and to the country if we could compress the training into a shorter period, and it would be less irritating, because the trainee would know that, having made himself efficient, he had relieved himself of the obligation of coming up year after year. If we did that, however, it would be by units, and not by individuals. The quota of a certain year would come in, do its annual training and reach a certain standard, and would not be required to go through that course again ; but that would apply to all the members of  it. . If they did come up again it would be only for extended training in the shape of battalion or brigade drill. That is a variation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> proposal, although the same principle is at the back of both? ideas. However, I cannot accept the amendment at this juncture. </para>

                    <para>. -  There is some . satisfaction in moving an amendment when the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)1</inline> admits that from one point of view, at&#39; least, it may be the means of effecting; economy and increasing efficiency. I desire to ask the Minister if he could not insert in the Bill a clause which would! give the Defence authorities power to do what I ask, and , which he, to some extent, supports, although it need not be compulsorily carried out. The Minister can adopt whatever form he likes, and if some such provision were embodied in the Bill it would, I think, tend to higher efficiency and greater economy. I am not surprised at the silence which followed my amendment, and as there does not seem to be much prospect of obtaining general support I shall not press it. But I want to show that even in the matter of companies, battalions, or brigades there might be a saving if we had a clause based on the principle I have mentioned, which, I think, is generally admitted to be sound. There should be some tangible, reward for efficiency. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not want <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to think that, because honorable senators did not immediately rise to discuss his amendment, there was any lack of sympathy with his proposal. The difficulty we feet is in connexion with effectively carrying it out as training progresses from year to year, and it would be impracticable to compress the whole of the various sections of military work with which a man should be familiar in one or two years. If it were only a matter of becoming efficient in the old-fashioned drill that was undertaken in the days of the Peninsular War it might be possible. But the modern military syllabus is very extensive in its scope and training during the war and since has become still wider in its scope. Before the war we knew nothing of  bombs or trench, mortars, but with them we are now quite familiar. The probabilities are that in or after future wars the syllabus will again be extended. Whilst I have the greatest sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> idea, I believe that it is somewhat impracticable. In the past we have had competitions between brigades in an endeavour to create a spirit of rivalry, and to make battalions efficient, but I do not think it is possible to work along the lines indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> by exempting any portion of the Forces for a period. It is true that some individuals may in a week&#39;s time acquire as much knowledge in a particular branch of military work, as other individuals would acquire in three weeks, but even then there is great danger in attempting to make any exemptions and exceptions in favour of individuals. It would inevitably lead to an outcry as to favoritism, and would generally cause discontent, if we were to attempt anything of the kind. I am not criticising the amendment in a hostile manner, and desire to. assure <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Gardiner</inline> that I am opposing it only because I consider it impracticable. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> should be depressed at the reception given to his proposition. It has received the close attention of the members of the Committee, and after hearing what the Minister has said it is evident that the principle on which the honorable senator based his proposition is one which appeals to the Minister. The Minister has pointed out that if a clause of this kind were inserted it would prejudicially affect training as a whole, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has mentioned that it might possibly lead to all kinds of complaint being made by individuals on the ground that favoritism was being shown. That, to an extent, could be avoided if the conditions of the examination or the requirements to enable any individual to be exempt were laid down in sufficient detail. The Minister has said that he will give consideration to the principle, and has intimated, I think, that it might be applied not merely to individuals, but to units. I am not quite sure whether the Minister, even under the clause he has proposed, would not have that power, because if he will look at the operative words he will see that any male inhabitant of Australia, except those exempted by this Act, will be liable to be trained as prescribed. I do not think that there is any one in this chamber who knows the meaning of the words &#34;as prescribed&#34; better than the Minister, and&#39; possibly when regulations are being introduced to give effect to the principle of compulsory service it will be possible to prescribe something that will give effect to the principle embodied in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> amendment, and in a form that will not be detrimental to the efficiency of the trainees. I invite the Minister&#39;s consideration to the words I have quoted, because I think he will find that if he desires to give effect to the principle there is sufficient power to carry out what is in his mind and in the mind, of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline></para>

                        <para>. - Honorable senators will see that this is a new provision which precludes the Government from doing by regulation what was suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> in discussing another clause. This embodies a desirable drafting amendment, and reduces the present proviso to a definite subsection. The important amendment is in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of sub-section 1. There is no alteration in the number of years of training for Senior Cadets, nor in the present minimum or maximum, but as in the training of naval and military cadets there is naturally much difference, an amendment has been necessary to provide for greater elasticity. The present section, 127(1) (b), and the present second proviso lay down specifically the total number of whole, half-day, and night drills with an accumulated minimum of sixty-four hours annually. </para>

                <para class="block">The maximum hours provided in the Act at present is only limited by the. duration of a whole day, half-day, or night, and taking the basis of an eight-hour day, the present maximum is 128 hours. It is intended in the Military Senior Cadets that the parades, with some variations for local circumstances, shall be of a duration of two and a half hours minimum, and the number of parades will be based upon the number of times the period of two and a half hours is contained in the proposed minimum of sixty-four hours. On the other hand, Naval Cadets may be required for parades of longer duration to enable them, for instance, to be taken by boat for naval training. The proposed wording of section 127(1) (b) is framed accordingly, providing only the present minimum and maximum, but leaving to the regulations of each service the number and nature of the parades to be held each year. The present second and fourth provisos are omitted as being unnecessary in view of the new wording of 127 (1). The fifth proviso is also omitted as being unnecessary in view of the amended wording of the present third proviso, which is now incorporated in the proposed sub-sections (2) and (3). In the first proviso &#34; Army Veterinary Corps&#34; and &#34;Army Ordnance Corps&#34; have been added, as the attendance of their members throughout the seventeen days&#39; camp with the artillery and engineers is necessary for the maintenance of veterinary and ordnance services in the camp, in the same way as the medical officers must be maintained throughout the whole dura&#39; tion of the camp for artillery and engineers. The second proviso in the proposed section is intended to cover the policy of allotting a proportion of Citizen Force officers for duty with the cadet battalions affiliated with their units. By this system, the cadet and militia units will be brought into closer touch and a continuity in training in the cadets and militia attained. </para>

Usually this training consists of one muster parade or registration for which the regulation would prescribe no pay; but if during this last year they should be required to do full training, that is in time of war, under the provisions of the Defence Act, . it is necessary that they should then be paid.

                    <para>.- The amendments represent a general revision df the experience of the Law Department in connexion with prosecutions dealing with compulsory service. We have been accumulating experiences over a number of years, and the Crown Law officers and the military officers with legal training have been in conference with a view to redrafting the whole clause dealing with this vexed and somewhat involved question of enforcing the compulsory training provisions of the Act. The present sections 135, 135a, and 135b, dealing with prosecutions in connexion with compulsory service, have been recast. The provisions of the present sections have proved far from satisfactory. There have been a number of cases in the past of illegal detention which have been mainly due to the absence in the Act of definite provision as to awards of detention being cumulative or concurrent, and as to the date of commencement of awards of detention, as well as to the absence of any provision requiring the Court to issue a commitment warrant in respect of awards made by it. The terms custody, confinement, and detention are at present used in a manner likely to cause misunderstanding among militia and area officers. The proposed draft amendments also cover a number of minor points in which difficulty was previously experienced. The old maxima of punishment have not been altered except that in the case of offences of absence from continuous training, and failing to perform the whole annual training, the penalty, instead of &#34; not exceeding twenty days &#34;or &#34; for a time corresponding in duration to the time which in the opinion of the Court would be taken up in rendering the personal service required &#34; is now the equivalent &#171;f the training which has been missed, and such additional terms, if any, not exceeding twenty days, as the Court thinks fit. It is to be remembered that the annual training for some units is twenty-five days. It is thought that the new wording will tend, if anything, towards magistrates awarding less punishment than they have done hitherto. Further, the provisions of sub-section 2 of the proposed section 135b entail a deduction from the penalty for failing to perform the annual training of the number of days equivalent to any number of days he may have served in detention during the year as a result of missing compulsory parades. Absence from continuous training is made a separate offence from that of absence from the compulsory parade. The draft includes an alteration that an award of custody where a person is ordered to report from time to time to a prescribed authority shall be confined to offences by senior cadets only. That is a general explanation of this long clause. I can assure the Committee that the separate proposed sections have been carefully considered, keeping in mind the general principles laid down in the existing Act. The proposed new sections contain no departure from those principles. The purpose has been to draft the existing provisions in better form to enable magistrates to more clearly understand the intention&#39; of the Act. </para>

                        <para>- I could get the information for the honorable senator, but I am not able to answer him offhand. I am gratified to be able to say that since the inauguration of the encouragement of sport amongst the Senior Cadets, and the formation of Citizen Committees, the number of prosecutions for non-attendance at parades has fallen off immensely and the attendance at parades has increased. Many of the areas now show an average attendance of 97 per cent. The prosecutions for non-attendance at parades has fallen off to such an extent that in the present year we are reducing the Provost Staff employed in hunting up absentees from parades. </para>

                    <para>. - I consider that it is not fair to the Committee that amendments of the existing Act should be put before-  them in clauses that are as long as the Bill ought to be. I think that clauses should be drafted in the concise form to which we have been accustomed in the Senate. I was struck by the Minister&#39;s reference to the increased attendances st parade. I was glad to hear the honorable senator say .that an improvement is  shown, but I wish to utter the warning that the figures should be examined with very great care. If the officer in charge of an area is one who is aiming at satisfactory results for himself, he may not correctly state the number attending a parade. Another .area officer, in the conscientious performance- of his duty, may mark. as absent every cadet who is absent from a parade. In two adjacent areas, we may find that one shows an attendance of 80 per cent., and the officer who has carried out his work conscientiously may be reprimanded because he cannot show an attendance of 97 per cent, shown on the books of his neighbour, who might never really have had anything like that attendance. </para>

In answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> this afternoon, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> said that the proposal had been postponed pending the return of. the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> from the Imperial Conference. I understand that the proposed new sections contained in the clause before the Committee largely deal with penalties for non-attendance of trainees at parades, and they are submitted as the result of the experience of the last few years in dealing with cadets. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion, that is badly required. I have hitherto supported compulsory military training, but, for the life- of me, I cannot see the good of much that goes on in connexion with cadet training. There is a growing opinion that unless our system of compulsory training can be tightened up, so as to reduce the waste of time in roll call and unnecessary marching and tramping, and to provide for more practical work, the discontent with the whole system will be increased, and may be reflected here, perhaps at no distant date, by the scrapping of the whole system. I heard only to-day that a cadet had .complained that he had just finished his last year&#39;s training. He was twenty-two years of age, and, although he had had training for some years, he had never had a uniform, and had never fired a gun. The youths of Australia are probably more keenly intelligent than are the youths of any other country, and I urge upon the Minister for Defence that if those who have hitherto supported compulsory military training are to continue to do so, the system adopted must be of a practical nature, and not merely a time-wasting device. </para>

                    <para>. - This proposed new section refers only to persons who have been committed by a magistrate to the custody of the military authorities. The magistrate should, after committing an offender to the custody of the military authorities, issue a warrant authorizing them to detain the offender. Hitherto, magistrates have not been required to issue warrants. The proposed section is considered necessary because these cases are very often dealt with by the unpaid magistracy, which, consists, no doubt, of a splendid body of men, but all of whom are not learned in the law. When a conviction, is . recorded, the magistrate commits the trainee to. the custody of the military authorities to undergo the period of detention he has imposed. The new section provides that, in addition, he shall issue a  warrant to the authorities to hold the cadet committed to their custody. If a magistrate does not issue a warrant, we still require authority to hold the trainee until the omission is rectified. The warrant is required for the protection of the Department in case of legal proceedings. If any one suffers because a warrant is not issued it will be the Defence Department. In practically all cases warrants will be issued, but if any magistrate has overlooked the necessity for issuing a warrant, we shall still want to be able to hold the trainee. </para>

If the law thinks that we are interfering with him illegally let it say so.&#34; If we take the view which has been expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> that a man is to be adjudged guilty and punished without a trial, we shall only hasten the day when we shall have no law, but simply anarchy.

                <para>The reading of the entire clause has simply strengthened my argument, because, notwithstanding anything contained in it, the military authorities may say that the warrant of the magistrate is unnecessary. Knowing that a person must be legally detained without a warrant being signed, if the military authorities claim the right to detain a trainee in such circumstances, what may happen ? The person may be convicted. </para>

                        <para>- We cannot legally hold a man except upon a properly signed warrant. But if it comes to a question of the illegal detention of any person, the military authorities will get out of the trouble by blaming the magistrate, and the magistrate in turn will blame the military authorities, so that the person who is really in the wrong will not be brought to book. It may be a short cut to detention for the military authorities to say &#34;If a magistrate makes the mistake we should detain the offender.&#34; I have not any confidence in the Defence Department in its dealings with civil liberty. The very training of the military authorities prompts them to ride roughshod over civil liberty. All the safeguards of such liberty - the issue of the warrant before arrest, the signing of the warrant, and other matters, which are frequently regarded as mere forms - become very important when we are dealing with human life and freedom. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to support the amendment. Of course, recognise what the Government had in view in proposing the insertion of the proviso. But the fact that the word &#39;&#34;is&#34; in the first portion of the proposed new section has been omitted does not affect the situation at all. No doubt they had in mind the necessity for preventing the invalidity of a conviction as the result of any informality in the issue of the warrant. For instance, the warrant may not be in the prescribed form, and hence the Defence Department wishes to rid itself of the onus which it ought to accept, because the liberty of the subject is a principle which is very dear to every one of us.

                        <para>- But the Court may consist of honorary justices, and we cannot get at them. The Defence Department ought to accept responsibility in this matter. It has its own trained officers, and it is only right that it should accept responsibility for any technical objection which may be urged against the warrant under which a trainee has been convicted and detained. </para>

                        <para>- It says so quite clearly. The ordinary procedure is for an order of the Court to be made. That order is written in the records of the Court, and is signed by the presiding magistrate who makes it. Such an order will be a sufficient authority for the military officers to take the defendant into their custody. If the magistrate fails to issue the warrant in the prescribed form, that will not affect the holding in custody of the defendant. </para>

                        <para>- The only authority under which an officer could detain them would be an order of the Court. Occasionally, of course, there may be neglect to issue the warrant in the prescribed form. If the order of the Court is made in the ordinary way, and appears over the signature of the magistrate in the Police Court records, that ought to be quite sufficient. </para>

                    <para>- Then I suppose that has been the experience of other prosecutors also, but in their case there is no provision which enables them to get the. benefit of the conviction if the Court does .not issue the necessary warrant. If Courts have been in the habit of ordering a person&#39;s detention, and not issuing the necessary warrant to authorize it, it is very regrettable. If the Department is to say that although the Court, has failed to. issue the warrant the person convicted and ordered to be detained shall still be liable to detention, that is a very wrong principle, and the remedy is worse than the evil. </para>

                    <para>. - Three different matters are dealt with by this clause. In the past we have had a medical examination of the boys of fourteen years of age. They are required- to be certified as fit for military training. It often happens that a boy is unable to pass the standard, but experience -has shown that it would be of benefit to him, and consequently to the nation, to require him to do the physical training. It would overcome&#39; the actual defect for which he has been ..rejected. We are, therefore, amending the Act to enable us to accept such a lad fox physical training. &#39; A number of men were unable to pass the medical test during the war, but were put into camps of physical training, and in a few weeks were able to reach the medical standard. As the result of that experience, we are now. extending the principle to the Cadet Force, and this will- no doubt be of great benefit to many of our boys. </para>

Special qualifications&#39; in regard to horsemanship are required in officers of the remount unit, and college graduates are not suitable for the position.&#39; As the law at present stands, before we could appoint officers to this branch they would have to go through the.

The draftsman informs me that this clause is&#39; not affected by .the rejection by the Committee of the clause applying, the Army Act in time of peace, and that, therefore, no consequential amendments are needed in it. . </para>

                        <para>-I am not yet convinced that the Imperial Air Force Act should be applied in time of war, because Australia is a continent, and the United Kingdom, geographically, is only a small country. So far as I am concerned, the matter needs discussion. It does not require much imagination to foresee that an Air Force Act for the defence of a continent like Australia, ringed by an ocean, will need to be different in many essential details from an Act which is required only for the defence of a country of 100,000 or 125,000 square miles in extent. We have to deal with 3,000,000 square miles in our aerial defence. I take it that the Minister will so frame this definition clause as to make it consistent with whatever&#39; the Senate does with the Air. Defence Bill: </para>

                    <para>. -  It is obvious that the honorable senator was not present this afternoon when I replied to a similar question from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.</inline> We have legislated to control civil aviation by means of the Air Navigation Act 1920, and the regulations made thereunder. We have introduced an Air Defence Bill, which will regulate naval and military aviation, but the Defence Act, although in certain of its general provisions it provides both for&#39; the Army and Navy, will also require to provide for the Air Force. It will no doubt be essential to pass a military regulation forbidding the flying of aeroplanes over a magazine or fort. It is, therefore necessary to have in the Defence Act certain general provisions&#39; enabling that to be  done. Only to that limited extent would that Act interfere with civil aviation. </para>

                        <para>- I propose to deal with it now, because we should realize the importance, and even the urgency of allAustralian legislation being restricted to Australian affairs. Only in this evening&#39;s newspaper there is a report of a statement made by a Minister in Britain which compares the situation in that country at the present time with the year 1914, and suggests that we should all act together to save the Empire. Let us consider the serious position which might arise if our Acts of Parliament were to be dependent upon Imperial Acts, which may, sooner or later, be administered by a Republican form of government. In such circumstances, we should have to begin all over again, and legislate on new lines, Australia is a great continent, to all practical purposes a nation, and in most instances acting in an independent manner. Is it reasonable to expect that  we should hang on to our mother&#39;s apron-strings and incorporate in our Bills legislation that is good, bad, or indifferent, merely because it has been adopted by Great Britain? </para>

                        <para>- That is the suggestion embodied in the definition clause, and it is useless to say that we are not dependent, not on what we are passing now, but on some amendments which may be made hereafter in British legislation. If there are any desirable provisions in British Statutes that could be incorporated in our Acts of Parliament, it would be an easy matter for the draftsmen to submit proposals to the Government for their incorporation. This continual reference to British Acts is very undesirable, and working as hard, I believe, as other honorable senators do, I find it quite impossible to become acquainted with the provisions of the measures we are including in our Acts. I trust the Minister, before the Bill reaches the third-reading stage, will realize the necessity of having at least a purely Australian Defence Act. </para>

                    <para>. - It is very difficult for honorable senators at this late hour to do justice to an important amendment of this character, and I desire to protest against the Bill being rushed through when honorable senators are so fatigued that they are not able to effectively deal with a proposition which may affect the life and liberty of the subject. It is &#39; proposed to import into our Defence Act sections 42 and 43 of the British Army Act to which I have previously referred. The only difference between my amendment and that of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> is that I am anxious to place the soldier and officer on equal terms. Under the British Army Act a soldier&#39;s right of appeal ceases at the General Officer Commanding, whereas an officer can appeal to the Eng. I want by the amendment of which I have given notice to place them on the saint! footing. I may, perhaps, again remind honorable senators that the British soldier is a volunteer, who deliver.ately submits, by enlistment, to the Army Act; but in Australia men are compelled to serve, and, with a view to making- this compulsory provision in some way palatable to the free and independent citizens of Australia,, I am moving my amendments. Wo should not endeavour to make any class distinctions in this connexion between soldiers and officers. There is a strong tendency for officers, and even the Minister to &#34; rubber stamp &#34; the acts of their subordinates, and, whether from mental inertia or for some other reason, they seem to think that everything suggested by others is in order. I urge honorable senators to consider the reasonableness and the necessity of providing that if an officer or a soldier rightly or wrongly imagines that he has a grievance he should have the right to appeal right up to the Governor-General. It will be quite open for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> who, I think, made the suggestion, or some other honorable senators, to move that, in place of an appeal being made to the Governor-General, it shall be made to some special tribunal, such as a Committee of this Senate, which would have associated with it one or more Judges of the Supreme Court. The difficulty, I feel,  that would arise in establishing such a tribunal would be the possibility of the voting being on party lines. Owing to that possibility 1 am merely following the Army Act so that officers and soldiers may finally appeal to the Governor-General. </para>

                    <para>. - Before the dinner adjournment I was inclined to oppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> amendments, because I thought the soldier had sufficient channels through which to appeal. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> has just handed me a copy of the British Army Act, and, after hurriedly reading some of its sections, it occurs to me that any one with a grievance cannot be prevented from approaching the King or his representative. If a subject has the right of appeal to the King, why should we endeavour to curtail that right by Act of Parliament ? Realizing that the appeals that would be made would be few, and that the Executive Council really means in this case the Minister for Defence, I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> amendments should be accepted. The right of a person to appeal to the King&#39;s representative holds good here, as does the right of a person to appeal to the King still hold good in Great Britain. I support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall be very brief, as I have already stated my objection to the proposed amendments. There is only one instance where a soldier should have the right to appeal to the Governor-General. He has not the right of appeal to the King under the Army Act. My amendment provides for a soldier four Courts of appeal up to the Military Board, or in time of war to the General Officer Commanding, whereas an officer has only two Courts of appeal. For the soldier there is an appeal from his captain to his colonel, then to his brigadier, and then to the General Officer Commanding, and finally to the Military Board. The two cases are not analogous at all. In the case of a soldier, there is no question of supersession in the ranks, and that, generally speaking, is where wrong is done. An officer gets promotion up to a certain stage as the result of examination, and afterwards by selection. For these reasons, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment. We have fairly met the desire of the Committee to provide an effective means for the redress of wrongs, both to officers and soldiers. </para>

                <para class="block">These amendments represent an attempt on my part to codify and perfect what I imagine to be the common law on the subject, and they set out clearly to the lay mind and the ordinary soldier exactly what his rights are. Proposed new section 123i provides, in sub-clause 1, that an officer or a soldier, before making any complaint, shall bc entitled to  inspect  any books, documents, or papers relating to the matter in respect of which, he thinks he has been wronged, and may state whether or not he agrees with any statement that may be set out in any such book, document, or paper. Sub-clause 2 of the proposed new section states that if the complainant denies: or contradicts any such statement, or alleges that the documents have not been produced for hi3 inspection, the Minister, before submitting his complaint to the Governor-General, shall direct an inquiry to be held before a Justice of the High Court or a Judge of the Supreme Court of the State. In sub-clause 3 there is provision, that the complainant may, if he so desires, be represented by counsel, and shall have an opportunity of giving evidence and of cross-examining any witness. This is a reasonable provision. Sub-clause 4 states that the finding of the Judge shall be- conclusive, and in subclause 5 there is provision that the Minister may, if he thinks proper, decline- to proceed with an inquiry until the close of the war. It was pointed out during the debate that a soldier, might institute inquiries merely to get away from the war. I presume the ordinary procedure would be for the Minister to direct an inquiry to be held on the spot, and for the preservation of the evidence, so that if any of the witnesses were killed subsequently their depositions could be referred to. In sub-clause 6 there is provision that if any officer whose duty it is to investigate a complaint shall wilfully and knowingly disregard the provision of the Act for the redress of wrong, he shall, upon proof thereof, be deemed unfitted to serve  His  Majesty in any capacity whatsoever. This may seem drastic punishment, but surely, if an officer wilfully neglects his duty in such an important particular, he ought to be put out of the Service. There would be no danger, then, of an officer attempting to neglect his obvious duty. </para>
                <para>In proposed new section 123j there is right of action, against an. officer failing to redress wrongs. That is to say, if he induces or persuades, by means of any promise, threat, or representation, any complainant not to proceed with a complaint or appeal, he shall be liable in an action for damages in the High Court of Australia or the Supreme Court of the State. This is merely a codification of the common law. I am satisfied that at present an action for damages may lie against an officer who does this, and it is advisable that the law should be codified so that any soldier may ascertain his rights in this matter. Subclause 2 of this proposed new section refers to two or more officers who may be jointly concerned in any such promise or threat, and sub-clause 3 provides some measure of damage, for the wrong which a complainant may have suffered. If by the illegal action of his officer he h&#39;als been deprived of promotion and if the Judge or jury consider him entitled to recover damages, this sub-clause supplies the necessary&#39; machinery. Sub-clause 4 contains provision to the effect that if a complainant is unable to recover from an officer the amount of a judgment, he shall be entitled to recover it against the Commonwealth, but there is the proviso that he shall not recover from the Commonwealth any amount greater than the highest amount awarded to him in any one- of such actions; Suppose he proceeded against half-a-dozen officers,, and was awarded &#163;1,000 against each, he could only recover from the Commonwealth &#163;1,000, in the event of being unable to get anything out of the officers. Then, in order to prevent the Commonwealth being prejudiced by any combination or conspiracy for an officer to do a wrong to another, and then for the injured man to bring an action against him with the object, eventually, of claiming  against the Commonwealth, there is provision for the Attorney-General to intervene and be heard. Any such action may be stayed, on application, until the termination of hostilities. In subclause 7 of this proposed new section there is a limitation provision to the effect that any action (except in time of war) must be commenced within twelve months from the time the act complained of occurred; but if the complainant is prevented by any threat or misrepresentation from bringing the action, the time shall run from the cessation of such threat or misrepresentation. Sub-clause 8 states that in time of war, an action may be brought at any time within twelve months of the issue of the proclamation that the war no longer exists, if the officer to be sued is then within jurisdiction, and if not, then it may be brought within twelve months&#39; from the time at which he first comes within the jurisdiction, and after the issue of the proclamation. These provisions are inserted so that there may be no unnecessary delay in bringing an action. It might so happen that a man is hard up, and so in sub-clause 9 it is provided, in strict accordance with civil process now, that a man may sue <inline font-style="italic">in forma pauperis:</inline> that is -to say, if he is not worth &#163;25, which is the usual amount, he may get a solicitor assigned to him by the Judge. Subclause 10 states that the right of any officer or soldier to bring an action for damages shall not be limited by the fact that he has been injured solely in his military character or reputation by reason of the act complained of. These provisions extend the common law right, as far as I can make out, to a number of cases. If a man suffers wrong to his person or property, that is to say, if he has been sentenced by court martial to imprisonment for fifteen years, when he ought to have been sentenced only to two years, every member- of the court martial is liable to heavy damages. Likewise, if the court martial illegally sentences a man to be flogged, by the common law every member of&#39; the court martial participating in the illegal sentence is guilty of an offence and liable for damages; but where such sentence by. court martial means his reduction in. rank-, or* dismissal  from  office, the Courts have held that he has no right to damages. There is a distinction between wrong to property or person and wrong to a man&#39;s military reputation. A man having submitted himself voluntarily to military discipline, ought not to complain of anything done to him in his military capacity. I submit that that principle ought not to apply to Australia, where every person is compelled to serve, and anything that affects his military reputation is bound to re-act on him in his civil capacity. There is no reason, in these circumstances, for such a distinction. It is useless to give the valuable rights conferred by the clause just passed unless we surround them with some sort of legal sanction which- will keep officers administering the Act &#34; on the rails.&#34; With the exception of the last. I believe that the provisions I propose represent a codification of the common law as it now exists. </para>

I ask honorable senators to read the provisions which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Eliott</inline> has submitted, and say whether they would be fools enough to put themselves in such a position- that they might be prosecuted and mulct in damages as the honorable senator proposes. There is a fundamental, objection which I wish to take to the amendments. They propose, in the first place, to mix up military and civil law. A Committee was appointed in the United Kingdom&#39; after the close of the war. It consisted of a number of legal men and included a number of members of the House of Com-: mons, amongst them being <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Horatio</inline> Bottomley and Lord Hugh- Cecil, two men of very independent minds. After going through the question of military law and civil rights they made, amongst others, the following recommendation in July, 1919:- </para>

                        <para>- That is the common law, and its scope is far wider, and therefore of greater benefit to the individual, than is the scope of the provisions which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> asks the Committee to adopt. The honorable senator has said that officers may do all sorts of extraordinary things, and he mentioned a number of things which they might do. I point out that if an officer did the things for which he would be liable under the provisions proposed by the honorable senator, that officer would be liable to be court martialled himself. If, for instance, an officer interfered with or obstructed the production of books or documents for the purpose of substantiating his case he would commit an offence which would render him liable to be tried by a court martial. I take the case of the removal of an officer from command by the General Officer Commanding. Surely in time of war we must leave to the General Officer Commanding, untrammelled by fear of subsequent civil damages, the exercise of his discretion in that regard. The General Officer Commanding is intrusted with the duty of winning a battle or winning a war. If, in the exercise of his discretion, he removes an officer from a command, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> amendments, the officer removed is to have the power of hanging over the General Officer Commanding, it may be for years, the possibility of a prosecution. If such a removal took place in Gallipoli the General Officer Commanding concerned might have had hanging over his head for five years, until he returned to Australia, and perhaps for twelve months after he returned, the possibility of having to meet an action for civil damages when the witnesses essential to support the correctness of his judgment might have been removed by death. </para>

                    gardiner  (New South Wales)  &#91;10.25&#93;.-  I think that the Minister for Defence
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline>
                    has unduly exaggerated the danger which might arise from the acceptance of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline>
                    amendments. I have read them very carefully, and I consider that they have been rendered almost necessary by the amendment which the Committee has accepted at the instance of the Minister himself. Take, for instance, the examination of documents which is provided for. Of what use is it to give me the right to appeal, if, at the same time, I am refused the right to see the grounds on which my complaint was turned down? The Minister has himself widened the scope of the Bill at the request of the Committee. As far as the danger of damages is concerned, any officer who injures a person by exceeding his duty has always . been liable to damages. We assume, however, that our officers are carefully selected, and that the danger in question never troubles a man who does not act in excess of his powers. If you, sir, had me ejected from this chamber without justification, you would be liable to damages. In New South Wales one  Speaker  of the Legislative Assembly had a member of it forcibly removed from that branch of the Parliament. He was sued for damages and he won his case in the Supreme Court, but upon appeal to the Privy Council the position was reversed, and the private member proved victorious. I repeat that any officer who exceeds the powers conferred upon him has always been liable to damages. There is no provision in the amendments of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline>
                    which would render an officer liable to damages if he had not done wrong. In regard to the question of officers conspiring, I am inclined to think that that is a contingency which is not likely to arise. Nevertheless there have been one or two cases in which a couple of officers have beaten the Commonwealth for many thousands of pounds. The danger of fraud, therefore, is just as great, though no greater, in the Military Department than it is outside of it. Most of the amendments submitted by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline>
                    are essential, by reason of the amendments which we have already carried.

                    amendments, and I am not entirely in favour of them, is because he does not think we ought to mix up civil and military law. Yet there are cases cited in the Army Act in which the aid of the civil Courts has been invoked to override the decisions of military Courts.

                        <para>- The records show that in some cases the members of a court martial have been held to be liable for damages, just as magistrates are liable for any illegal acts upon the Bench. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> goes farther than does the common&#39; law as between man and man. Take the case of a court martial which should be constituted of seven members. Suppose that only five members sat upon that tribunal and awarded the prisoner a certain sentence. In such circumstances they would be liable, because the court martial did not consist of the number of members for which the regulations provide. But under the common law an individual officer would also be held responsible. If there be any need for the introduction of clauses of this character into our Defence Act, I am more concerned with the action of an individual officer than I am with the action of a court martial, because, from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> told us the other night, the actions of the latter tribunals are always reviewed by the legal gentlemen who are attached to the various head-quarters and by the Judge Advocate- General. But very often the action of an individual officer - he may be a company officer or an officer commanding a battalion - is not criticised or reviewed by anybody above him. I have never known of a case in which a senior officer who dealt with a junior officer or a private has had his decision reviewed by any officer above him. </para>

I am not going to say that the officer above him ought to be liable to an action for damages, but I am more concerned with the chance that a man ought to have against an individual officer than I am with the chance he ought to have against a court martial. If the findings of the latter tribunal are properly investigated before the sentence is promulgated, the individual has a better opportunity than he has where he is dependent entirely upon the say-so of an officer. </para>

                        <para>- I am not dealing with promotions at all. The other night I made it quite clear that up to a certain rank promotions are almost automatic, but beyond that rank they are not promotions at all, but selections. The point I was making when the honorable senator interjected was that an officer may feel that certain military action taken against him has prejudiced him, not merely in his military career, but also in his civil life. At present he has no opportunity whatever of righting himself, beyond getting a military investigation under the clause which we have passed to- . night. He has no opportunity of recovering damages from the individual who may have wilfully damaged him. Our own experience must lead us to believe that there have been cases in which, perhaps because of jealousy or of some pre-existing bitterness between two men in the Army, the under-dog has been made to suffer in such a severe and uncalled-for way as to do him material injury in the Army and outside of it. I desire to take away from the individual officer the power to do wrong to another officer or a private without the injured one having an opportunity to obtain redress by law. If the Minister can assure me that in such cases the injured person has an opportunity of succeeding at common law, I would like to know more about it. I can understand the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Stopford, who instituted an action for damages against <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ian</inline> Hamilton because of the statement by the latter that the failure of the British Army in Gallipoli was due to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Stopford shillyshallying on the beach instead of getting to the front line. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Stopford brought a suit for libel against <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ian</inline> Hamilton upon the ground that the statement in question had not merely affected him as a military officer, but also in his civil capacity, because it had made him appear to be inefficient. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator, as a senior officer, would be entitled to his opinion, but if what he said was carried back to the officer referred to, does the honorable senator think that officer should be able to go for him for damages, seeing that he was only spoken about in a military sense? In the same way the honorable senator may have said about another officer that he was a &#34;  shickerer,&#34;  when he was not. If that officer could come at the honorable senator for something said in private conversation to another officer of equal rank, how would the honorable senator like it? I do not think that man should have a claim against him. </para>

                        <para>- Even then, before that officer would have an action for damages against you he would have to show that he had suffered damage as the result of those words, and it would be very difficult to do that in the case the honorable senator suggests. An officer cannot have an action for damages unless he can connect the derogatory words, or writing, with some loss. These provisions&#39; in no wise attempt to extend that provision of the law of libel. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> will point to any one provision which even bends in that direction I shall be glad to amend it. My proposal seems to have struck a species of panic into the heart of the Minister, but I ask him, and other honorable senators, to consider calmly each of my proposals separately, and see whether persons guilty of the acts which are aimed at deserve to be protected at all. Every one of these provisions is aimed at a distinctly wrong act. Every act which these provisions forbid, or prohibit, is not the act of an officer and a gentleman, and any officer who commits an act which is not the act of an officer and a gentleman should be punished as he deserves. Every single act referred to in my proposal deserves condemnation. </para>

                    <para>. - These proposals will cause a great deal of discussion amongst soldiers&#39; organizations, and for that reason, particularly as they are put forward by an officer of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> experience and reputation, we should give them the fullest consideration. I am particularly against sub-clause 2 of the proposed new section. It does not say the Minister &#34; may &#34; take action indicated; it says he. &#34;shall&#34; do so. It directs the Minister to invoke the aid of a High Court Judge or Judge of the Supreme Court of a State iu a matter which it should not be necessary to submit to a judge at all. </para>

                        <para>- Then the honorable senator is asking that the Minister should appoint a Royal Commission in every case to inquire whether an officer&#39;s complaint that certain documents were not forthcoming was justified or not. The whole thing is too frivolous. It would be different if the honorable senator proposed that a Royal Commission should be appointed only where an officer made a complaint to the Minister, and asked for a Royal Commission to ascertain whether certain allegations made against him were justified or not, seeing that they had been detrimental to his character either as an officer or as a man.&#39; We should not ask a Judge to do work which could be done by a junior clerk who searches the records. </para>

An inquiry can be directed by the Minister, and such inquiry is usually conducted before a Military Board. I contend, however, that the investigations should be made by a Judge who is accustomed to weigh evidence. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister for Defence introduced an important amendment to-day which may certainly be said to be the outcome of representations made in the course of the discussion of this measure. Obviously the Department and the Minister were sufficiently impressed to bring forward the amendment which has been accepted. I point out that sub-clause 1 of the proposed new section 12 3i really forms a corollary to the Minister&#39;s amendment; for what is the use of giving the right of appeal unless at the same time the individual concerned is afforded an opportunity to procure the evidence which will justify it? That is one reason, first, why <inline font-style="italic">\hi</inline> Committee should accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> proposals, and, secondly, why  it should deal with them piecemeal, and not reject the whole because certain portions may not be convincing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> logically attacked sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">i,</inline> but I differ from him. When the Bill waa introduced no right of appeal was provided. The lack of  such  right is a long-standing grievance. When this very matter was first debated in the Senate I advanced what I considered a proper suggestion, namely, that a Committee appointed by this Chamber should represent a final Court of appeal. Had honorable senators possessed <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> proper estimate of their own importance my proposal would have been adopted. I did not press it in the form of an amendment,, however, because I perceived a spirit of hostility thereto. A practical suggestion lias been submitted to the Committee by an honorable senator whose services, particularly in connexion with this Bill, have been of such assistance to the Military Department particularly that a clause has been introduced by the Minister which, to some extent, gives effect to his suggestion. A little while ago a provision similar to this was turned down by the Minister for Defence, who lightly brushed it aside; but when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> took up the cudgels on the question of the right to appeal in some form, and one honorable senator after another, including the military members of the Senate, brought their sense of sweet reasonableness to bear, the Minister gave way. This is a reasonable proposition, not only as to appeals, but to give the individual concerned the right to peruse official documents or evidence concerning his case. It does not give a soldier the right to peruse private diaries or documents that have no bearing on the appeal which he has lodged; it is only to allow a soldier who considers that he has been wrongfully treated to have access to the necessary documents to prove his case. An officer or soldier submits his complaint in accordance with the regulations, and makes out an unanswerable case only to find out that the officer has either turned it down, or has reported it to his- superior officer, where the matter drops. These amendments provide that the individual shall have the right to ascertain the nature of the report. </para>

                        <para>- The machinery is altogether too weighty. Our High Court Judges are too fully employed with other important work to be called upon to deal with the supersession of officers. We have passed an amendment to give officers,, non-commissioned officers and men the right to appeal through different channels, and we cannot legislate for all the details that may arise. We have to recognise that in endeavouring to legislate for exceptional cases we may weaken the Act, and it would be very difficult to insert a provision dealing with untruthful evidence, which could be regarded as an exceptional case. I am in accord with the intention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> who wants only a fair deal, but the suggestion embodied in his amendment, that an inquiry on oath should be held before a Justice of the High Court or a Judge of the Supreme Court of the State as to the truth of the denial, contradiction, or allegation, as the case may be, or to any other matter relevant to the complaint, is getting somewhat wide of the mark. Tonight we have passed an amendment to give the soldiers the right of appeal through different channels, and I think we should allow this measure to be in operation for a few years and then see by experience if this particular amendment is necessary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> must realize after his close contact with military operations that there is a good deal of petty jealousy even among the high officers, and it is quite possible for injustice to be done. I do not think, however, that he is right in anticipating that he can bind them down by an amendment of this character. He is anxious to provide that by the time the case reaches the Governor-General there shall not be any possibility of an untruthful statement being used against a man. </para>

                    <para>. - It will be remembered that when this Bill was in its second-reading stage, I agreed with my gallant and distinguished friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> that some provision should be made for a Court of appeal or for some final appeal, having regard to the altered circumstances of our Forces to-day. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> . agreed that something should be done, and he was courteous enough to submit to me the proposal he intended to bring before the Committee. I agreed with his proposition, and, therefore, I am not going back on my undertaking to the Minister by supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> amendments, although I agree that some are commendable. We have already provided in &#62; the Bill for sufficient protection against injustice, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> is endeavouring to supplement the common law rights that we already possess. Personally, I think those rights are quite sufficient to protect members of the Military Forces. </para>

                    <para>. - An officer who was a member of the Permanent Forces has told me that during the war a complaint was made against him and he was allowed to inspect the official reports and confidential documents relating to the matter, but as certain of the complaints were made by civilians - and it was upon these he considered he was harshly dealt with - they were regarded by the Department as not being official documents and he was not permitted to inspect them. In order, to get justice he appealed to the Supreme Court, whereupon all those concerned climbed down and paid him damages. </para>

                        <para>- I had no intention, sir, of transgressing your ruling; but it is difficult to avoid going into details in stating the reasons why I think the clause should be recommitted. I shall, however, content myself with the general statement that the clause should be recommitted because its effect, combined with that of section 14, is to give to Imperial and other outside officers a preference over Australian officers. Imperial and other outside officers will be exempt from examination,&#34; and will depend for their promotion merely upon a recommendation of the Military Board, whereas Australian officers will have to pass an examination. </para>

I dissent from the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> that it was not discussed in Committee. If my memory serves me rightly, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockmanraised</inline> a question as to its effect, and I gave at some length the reasons for it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has altogether misstated the facts regarding the clause. It does not differentiate between Australian and other officers. That, however, is a question which I may riot debate at this stage. I remind the Senate that I moved the recommittal of certain clauses only to make amendments which were consequential upon those made in Committee at the instance, not of the Government, but of private senators. I had to move for the recommittal in order to give effect to the  will  of the Committee. This clause was fully debated, perhaps not by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> but by others in Committee. The records show that it was &#34; debated and agreed to.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. - Even if the clause was debated at length, I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> is justified in moving for its recommittal if he thinks that it may be further improved. I should very much like to hear his views as to the combined effect of the two provisions he has mentioned, and I do not think the Minister will lose anything by agreeing to the recommittal of this clause. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> asks that an aspect of it, which he thinks has not been sufficiently discussed, should be reconsidered.  His  position to-day may be that of any other honorable senator to-morrow, and on the general ground that he should be given an opportunity to state his case, I am prepared to support his request. The Senate should always be ready to protect the rights of individual senators. I shall stand solidly for the principle of free discussion, which, in this case, can be secured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> only by the recommittal of the clause. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> reasons for proposing an amendment of the clause are not acceptable, we shall not debate them in Committee, so that very little time will be lost. </para>

                        <para>- I oppose the amendment, on the ground of its injustice. We are considering a Bill which will be the Air Defence Act of Australia for many years to come. There are a great many young men in Australia who were not sufficiently old to have the opportunity of going to the Front during the war, and, in my view, it is an absolute injustice to give a preference to any one against those young men. If it were a question of preference as between two men who had equal opportunities, it should certainly be given to the man who went to the Front. But what is proposed is that a preference shall be given to a man who had the opportunity of going to the Front and went, against men who had no opportunity of going to the Front, but who would have gone if they had  had the  opportunity. That is an injustice. I am not prepared to do that.&#34; I consider  the  proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> from  two  points of view - justice to the general community and the efficiency of the  Air  Force. If, of two men who apply  for  a position in the Air Force, one is  more  fitted for the position than the other,  he  should have it. I direct attention  to the  fact that our Constitution almost compels us in our legislation to see that there  shall  be no preference given to any one or  any  section in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. The danger anticipated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> of the impairment of the efficiency of the Air Force as a result of the clause does not therefore arise. We have indorsed the policy of preference to returned soldiers, all things being equal, for many positions in Australia. No one will suggest for a moment that because a man participated in. the great war he should be given preference to an applicant for the same position possessing superior qualifications. </para>

                        <para>- That is not preference to returned soldiers and why should we say. that it is. I believe that the returned soldier&#39;s view of the matter is that if he can do the job he should have it without any question of his equality with any one else. In our Commonwealth legislation we are prevented by the Constitution from discriminating between different parts of the Commonwealth, and the same principle should prevent us from discriminating between individuals or different sections of the community. That aspect of our legislation has not so far been given much attention, but it will yet have to be thoughtfully considered. I realize that the debt of Australia to the returned men can never be paid, and compensation in the way of preference in employment is only a pretence of paying it. </para>

                        <para>- The difference between preference to unionists and returned soldiers is that the unionist in a particular occupation spends his time and money in improving the wages, hours, and. conditions of his occupation. Any one who desires to engage in the occupation may enjoy the advantages secured by the labour and money of the unionist. We do not legislate against any one section or any one man, because all can enjoy those advantages simply by joining the union. If, however, we select a particular section of the community and propose to reward them for what they have done - and I doubt whether any one appreciates more than I do what was done by our. soldiers - by giving them advantage or preference in employment, we violate the principle of the Constitution, which is opposed to preference for the benefit of one section which is at the same time an injustice to another section of the community. For that reason I am against the amendment. The remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> almost convince me that I am not altogether on the right track, and I should like to know from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> whether the view I take of his proposal is a correct one. </para>

                    <para>. - The view I take of the incidence of this amendment is that it will give preference to those airmen already in Australia who have had practical experience at the Front. Those employed at the inauguration of this scheme of air defence will not only be the most efficient that can be obtained, but, from the standpoint of economy, will cost the Air Force less than will the men who have to learn. I take it that the intention of the amendment is to endeavour to lay down a principle by which the chiefs of the Air Service shall be instructed that if there is an airman of experience in the war available, he shall have preference over a man who has not had that experience, and that, I think, is quite right. I do not think it will be long before a good many accidents will occur if amateurs are put in charge of the flying portion of our defence. We hear of machines crashing; and of other accidents, and, for the longevity of the aeroplanes we have, it will be much better to employ pilots with actual war experience than those who have to gain their experience at the country&#39;s expense, and probably at their own. </para>

Practically the three Services are concerned in the matter, and at the present time negotiations are proceeding between the Naval and Military Board, and the Air Council as to safeguarding of the rights of the respective Services. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> may rest assured that both the Navy and the Army are quite qualified to see that the rights of their respective members, when temporarily loaned to the Air Service, are safeguarded; otherwise, transfer will be extremely unpopular. Both Boards are quite keen in this matter; and, as a result, regulations will be drawn up probably on the lines which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> proposes. The Attorney-General&#39;s Department advises me that it is better to have this matter dealt with by regulation than in the Bill, and I promise the honorable senator to see that the interest of the two other Services are safeguarded  in the way he suggests. </para>

The point I have in view is that the Air, Service is a new Service, and an officer may transfer, and, naturally, as the Force develops, get rapid promotion. He may lose his nerve, but he may become a colonel, or whatever the office may be termed, and re-transfer with his new rank. That I wish to guard against ; but, as the sister Forces are alive to the danger which is to be provided against by regulation, I am satisfied to let the amendment go. </para>

                        <para>- I know all about that. Let us take the man who, for actual practical work- in handling a machine, has all the qualifications, but for being a commissioned officer has- very few; there is then a&#39; distinct loss to the community, for he simply cannot get a commission. I realize, of course, that mechanics have to be taken up; otherwise, if something goes wrong&#39;, a commissioned officer, though very highly trained, is not so expert as a mechanic in, repairing work. My own opinion is that a non-commissioned officer or private may fly a machine just as well as a general or any other officer. The idea that a clause in the Bill, or a custom in a Department, shall permit only certain people to take control is altogether wrong. We have to realize that flying machines are not like military companies. If only commissioned  officers are to have charge  when we have  hundreds, or it may he thousands,  of  machines, there will be thousands of commissioned officers, and that point is worth considering. We shall be using  flying  machines much as we have used cavalry  in the  field; there will be  air  squadrons,  and to  contend that every  man  in charge  of  a machine shall be a commissioned officer is almost unthinkable. It is in  my mind  that that is the condition that  obtains  at the present  time,  and it is unwise  and  detrimental to the Service. When  these  flying machines become as plentiful,  as we  hope they will,  if  the preparation  for war  is to continue, we shall be in the absurd position of having  more commissioned  officers in  the  Air Service  than in all  the other Services put together. </para>

Quite a number of excellent men  have  never had a chance of advancement;  they  have never had a chance of developing their ability in charge of a machine.  I do  not say there has been no chance of promotion to the rank of officer, but such chances are very rare; and it is an absurd proposition that only officers shall be allowed to take charge of machines. </para>

                        <para>- As to the permanent officers in the Military Service, there is only one gateway, and that is through the Military College. In regard to the Air Service, however, there is no such provision. Officers may be provisionally appointed, but before their appointment can be confirmed, which must be within six months, they have to pass the prescribed examination. In that prescribed examination they must, amongst other things, show their ability to fly a machine. The analogy with the Military Service is not a correct one; it should be rather with the Mercantile Marine Service. That is to say, a man may commence as a fireman, become a greaser, and eventually, by stages, chief engineer. But the difference between the engineer and the fireman or greaser is that the engineer, of whatever grade, has charge of the engines and the direction of the propulsion of the ship. A man may become a mechanic, but, if he wishes to become an aviator and drive a machine, he must pass the necessary examination, and on passing, he becomes a commissioned officer. It is not that the commissioned officer gets the right to fly the machine, but the fact that he can fly it confers upon him the right to become a commissioned officer. </para>

                        <para>- No, because the clergy also are required to go through the University. I see no objection to dispensing with an examination in the case of persons who are officers of His Majesty&#39;s regular Air Force, and who  have passed an examination for the corresponding rank. Suppose, for example, that an officer of His Majesty&#39;s Air Force has passed the examination for captain, there is no reason why he should be re-examined here for the rank of captain. But I strongly object to the proposal to allow the Military Board to dispense with all examinations in the  case  say, of a regular second lieutenant who may come out here and get an appointment. I suggest to the Minister that the clause should be limited to the extent of dispensing with examinations only where the appointments are to positions of corresponding rank. If before he comes out here a captain has passed his examination for the next rank, there should be no objection to admitting him to that rank without further examination. But beyond that I absolutely decline to </para>

                    <para>The point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has overlooked is that our Air Force is not merely a military Air Force; it is ako a Naval Air Force. It is true that during the late war we had an Australian Air Force as a military wing, and that its members did exceedingly well, and greatly distinguished themselves. But we had absolutely no Naval Air Force whatever. Now it is proposed that our Air Force shall provide for both the military and naval sections of our defence. It- is obvious that at its inception we shall require to obtain officers from the British regular Air Force. There is one such officer here upon the Air Board - I refer to Wing-Commander Goble. &#34; He is an Australian by birth, but he is a member of the British regular Air Force. </para>

                        <para>- Not for the rank which he holds at present. For a period at least, we shall need to obtain other British regular officers for .our Air Force upon the. naval side. We do not anticipate that we shall require to secure any such officers upon the military side. What .is the position to-day? We go to England and ask an officer to come out here. Let us suppose that he holds the rank of captain. Our rate of pay for a captain is no higher than is the rate  of pay in England. Yet we ask him to cut himself adrift from the .Forces there, to lose his opportunities of advancement, to come out here for two or three years in order to suit our convenience, and then to return to the Old Country and take his chance. In the early stages of our military training we found that if we wished to obtain- efficient British officers who were worth having we must give them one step, and sometimes two steps, up in rank to compensate them in some degree for&#39; the sacrifice they made in coming here for a few years to suit our convenience; This provision has- been inserted solely for that purpose- to enable us to give an officer who is a, member of the British Air Force one or two steps up in rank. </para>

He holds in our Force a higher rank than he held in the British -Force. We are endeavouring to obtain one or two other British officers in the same way.

It is true that he has cited a number of other sections, upon which I have obtained the opinion of counsel. The only one of those provisions which will hold water is the one which corresponds to this proposal. According to that precedent, the operation of the clause will not necessarily be confined to members of the active force in England, so that reserve British officers coming out here may be appointed to a higher rank, thus superseding our own officers. In the case which I have quoted the officer is a captain in the British Reserve, and the Minister relied upon a similar section in our Defence Act to appoint him to a higher rank here. </para>

                        <para>. - Here again there seems to be an intention to discriminate in some way. Under clause 15 all officers, whether they have served in the Australian Imperial Force or not, must pass an examination, therefore the clause cannot refer to such officers, and this clause, like section 21ab which is to be inserted in the Defence Bill, must refer to officers from other Services. It would scorn that special provision is to be made by regulation to promote them without examination. I shall vote against the clause. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable senator misconceives the intention of the clause. Clause 15 applies to persons who have not seen active service, and requires them to start at the foot of the ladder, but this clause says that those who have been on active service abroad may be appointed or promoted under such conditions as may be prescribed. Without such a provision, a man who had obtained the rank of a squadron leader in Palestine would have to start all over again. </para>

                <para class="block">The Minister, I think inadvertently, gave a wrong answer to a question which I put to him to-day, assuming that a rule of the Australian Imperial&#39; Force regarding promotion from the rank of major to that of lieutenant-colonel applies to promotion to all ranks above that of major. As a matter of fact, it is the only exception to the rule which entitles an officer who is superseded to notification. I propose to again give the Committee an opportunity to realize that supersession means practically the cancelling of a commission, being almost the same in effect. It naturally disheartens an officer, so that the same good work cannot be expected of him afterwards. Officers may often have to be superseded, but  they  should be told the reason, and thus given a chance to amend, and to please those above them. </para>

A man may be a game and efficient flying officer, and yet useless as a squadron commander; but should promotion go by seniority, men might be promoted who might have no qualifications for the positions to which they were appointed. If the amendment were carried, a man could not be superseded until after notice had been given to him of the cause, and he had been given an opportunity to make such statements as he thought fit regarding the cause. The amendment recognises, not merit, but seniority. </para>

                    <para>.- I strongly dissent from what has been said. The amendment would not in any way curtail the right to promote officers according to merit, but it would give to the officer who was superseded the right to be told exactly what his shortcomings were, or wherein he was deemed deficient. He would then have a chance to appeal should he feel that the statements made about him were not correct. This would not, in any way affect the right to promote according to merit. </para>

                        <para>- He may, but this would define his . rights in a better manner. He would be able to point to a definite wrong, whereas in the other case, he might be side-stepped with the statement, &#34;We have the right by the custom of the Service to select for promotion, and you therefore have no grievance.&#34; No new principle is recognised by the amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> makes pleading his speciality, and on occasions I, myself, employ him in his special professional <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> of an advocate to have him represent a client&#39;s case in Court. He has undertaken to advocate the cause of the Minister in this case, and in his zeal for that cause has suppressed the fact that under our own Defence regulations how in existence for years and years no officer in a battalion could be superseded unless he was notified, the idea being that he could state and show cause against it. The only new principle I am advocating is that this should be put in the Act instead of the regulations. </para>

There is a difficulty in making it a hard-and-fast section of the Act. It is intended to recognise war service. We may appoint in the first commissioned rank two officers, one of whom may have had active service and the other may not and the one who has not. had active service may happen to be appointed a few days before the other. That would make him senior to the other. </para>

                        <para>- We could, but we prefer to ask Parliament to give us latitude to make regulations, recognising the conditions we have to deal with. At first we shall probably have an adequate staff of officers who have had active service, but as time goes on we shall have a lessened supply of them, and a greater supply of persons who have not had active service. In the circumstances, fairly flexible regulations will be needed to enable us to give effect to the spirit of the Act, which is&#39; that active service shall be recognised. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> to accept my assurance that the regulations in the main will follow the lines which he has set out in his amendment, but we feel that his proposal is too inelastic. It does not give us as much freedom as we should have if we were free to make regulations to meet the kind of case I have put. </para>

It may happen that the Military Board, for various reasons, prefer to make the appointment the other way round, and under the regulations they may have power to do so. </para>

                    <para>. - In conversation with certain former Air Force officers, who are now engaged in civilian flying, several suggestions were made, which I considered sensible and valuable.  Thi3  clause, as the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> pointed out in his second-reading speech, has to do with the formation of a Citizen Air Force made up particularly of trainees transferred from other technical units. During the second-reading stage I expressed the opinion that much good might be accomplished by the introduction of men who have been trained in piloting aeroplanes under war conditions, and who were now daily engaged in civilian aviation; that is, if they could be brought within the scope of the Air Force scheme, so that their services might be immediately availed of in the event of war. There are numbers of returned officers, experienced air -pilots, who are now engaged in making regular flights, so that they are still closely in touch with active aviation. Will it not be possible to enrol these men in the terms of their own suggestion? They pointed out to me that the great difficulty with a Citizen Air Force composed of trainees entirely would be owing to their lack of actual and continuous training in the air. I was given to understand that even -the most skilful war-time pilots are not likely to be of much immediate&#39; use unless they have remained in continuous touch with flying. It has been said that some of the accidents which have recently occurred were duc to the fact that the pilots had not maintained their active experience. The majority of former Air- Force pilots now actively engaged in civil flying would be available .and willing to give their services during a continuous period of training, for a month or a little more, during each year. </para>

This clause has been carefully drafted to enable such men to become associated with that branch. They will be looked to to constitute the officers who will, actively assist in training. </para>

                    <para>.-As the Minister says, the provision in the Naval Defence Act, of which  this clause is a copy, refers to the disbandment of a unit, but I know of no provision in that Act whereby a member of the Forces may be summarily dismissed by the Naval Board without trial. It is a one-sided arrangement that a man who enlists in the Air Force, and serves until he is thirty years of age may be discharged without trial or without any charge being levelled against him. </para>

                    <para>. - An air pilot has to take care of not only his own life, but also that of his mechanic, and possibly that of an observer. It is essential to have the power given in the clause. A man&#39;s discharge might be perfectly justifiable for medical or temperamental reasons. However, this power will only be used in extreme cases. </para>

                    <para>. - There are some points of essential difference between the Air Force of Australia and our Military and Naval Forces. It seems to me that under certain conditions the commander of an Air Force retained in Australia for Australian defence may be superseded by some one coming from the Imperial Service, possibly without the same experience or qualifications to deal with the internal defence of the Commonwealth. </para>

I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> would be the last to say that we should not have the power to place our Air Force under the commander of the British Air Force. Under the exercise of a similar power, we placed our Navy, at the beginning of the recent war, under the orders of the British Admiralty. We must have this power, but it will be used at the discretion of the Government of the day, which is responsible to this Parliament and to the people. </para>

If there is one arm of defence that must be independently built up in connexion with the defence of the Commonwealth, it is our Air Force, and no precedent made by the Military or Naval Forces must necessarily govern it. </para>

                    <para>.This clause applies, among other provisions, the Air Force Act to the Air Force in the same way as a similar clause in the Defence Bill applies the Army Act in peace time to the Defence Act. The Committee was against me on that principle in the Defence Bill, and so, in conformity with that decision I have had amendments drafted to this clause providing that the Air Force Act shall not apply to the Air. Force in peace time, though it will apply in war time. If these amendments are agreed to the Air Force will be in exactly the same position, with regard to the Air Force Act, which embodies the Army Act, as the Defence Forces are with regard to the Army Act. I wish to say a few words concerning the principle. First of all the Air Force Act can never apply except in wartime. Therefore it can never apply in Australia in peace. It can only apply when war actually comes here and is being fought on. our soil, because in the late war, although we applied the Army Act to the Australian Imperial Force, our Forces were not brought under it in Australia. The Act did not apply until members of the Australian Imperial Force went outside the three-mile, limit, so it really did not apply in Australia, even in war-time. Nor could the Air Force Act apply in Australia unless there was war on Australian soil. As to the necessity for affirming the principle, the same arguments apply as in relation to the Army Act. Only a just war will gather together all the resources of the Empire, and then of course we shall hope, for the sake of the Empire, that the Australian Forces will be fighting alongside Forces from all the other Dominions, fighting as a British Force, under similar conditions and regulated by a similar Act. If there is to be fighting on Australian soil, we shall hope for the assistance of the Air Forces from the other Dominions,, as well as the British Air Force, and the same restrictions regarding the application of the Army Act to the Australian Imperial Force in war-time will apply to the Air </para>

                        <para>- Yes. But this clause refers to the Imperial Air Force Act, which also incorporates the British Army Act. The first intention of the Bill was to apply the Imperial Air Force Act, which, as I have stated, incorporates the British Army Act, in time of peace as well as in time of war, but the Minister has now submitted an amendment which removes the Imperial Air Force Act from the ambit of this Bill in. time of peace. I should like him to go just a little further. I see no reason why our Defence legislation should incorporate legislation of the Imperial Parliament for the Air Forces in the United Kingdom. The air defence of Australia, so far as I can see, has very little relation to Air Force legislation suitable for the United Kingdom. The Mother Countries comprise  an  area of, say, 125,000 square miles, and so air defence must necessarily be based on strategy relating  to a  circle with a radius of about 500 miles. I do not believe British  air  authorities think it necessary to  provide  aeroplanes with a greater circle of destructiveness than is measured by the distance from London to Berlin, which, I believe, is about 500 miles. To the west there are the illimitable waters of the Atlantic. We also know that the United Kingdom is very densely populated, so  a  good many regulations would be required in an Imperial Air Force Act. On that  account  alone they would  not  be  necessary  in Australia. In contradistinction &#34;to the  position  of the United Kingdom, we  in   the Antipodes are  setting  out to build up an air defence scheme under conditions that are totally different. This is a continent of magnificent distances, and I, as a layman, assume that any air defence proposal to be effective must aim at meeting the enemy before he reaches our big cities. We also have an area of 3,000,000 square miles, sparsely populated, to cover. Therefore, I do not want to see a wrong start made in connexion with our air defence scheme. The clauses of the Bill that have brought in the Imperial Air Defence Act - I am saying nothing about the Army Act - give me the impression that it is the intention of the military, authorities, who will administer this Act, to, as far as possible, build up an Air Force that will enable them to work in double harness with the British authorities, irrespective of its suitability to the air defence of Australia. I make these observations because I regard this branch of Australia&#39;s defence as being, <inline font-style="italic">pro rat&#226;.</inline> to the money that is going to be spent upon it, of more practical importance than the Navy. </para>

                        <para>-I do not altogether share that view. The British Air Force Act establishes an Air Council, and has provisions relating to the Territorial and Naval Forces, but at this hour of the morning I shall not weary the Committee by going into details in. regard to it. I wish to impress upon the Minister the point that it would be better for us to have nothing to do with the Imperial Air Force Act. I should like to see an untrammelled and unrestricted field for the development of our aerial defence. In that event, the excuse could not be made&#39; by the responsible authorities that they had to do this, that, or the other thing, because in time of war they would have to&#34; conform to the British Air Force Act. After all that has been said, I do not think any of us will object tq the application of the British Army Act in certain circumstances when we are at war. The Minister&#39;s explanation is satisfactory, so far as it goes. My one fear, however, is that if there is the slightest linking-up of our Air Defence, development with the Imperial Air Force Act, excuses, sooner or later, will be made, if  the  system does not develop satisfactorily,  that  this or that has been done because in time of war we have to conform to. the Imperial Act. That would hamstring and leg-rope to some extent the development of our own air defence, which must follow absolutely independent lines, since our geographical and topographical conditions are altogether different from those  of  the United Kingdom. It would be a mistake if we had anything to do with the air legislation of any other country. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable senator who has just resumed his seat seems to fear that by applying to our Air Force during a time of war the Imperial Act, we may possibly link up the. limitations that are naturally imposed on an air force in Great Britain - where the conditions are so much more restricted than they are here - with our own Forces, which we expect to develop and build up under the freer conditions that obtain  in  Australia. I have no such fear. During peace time the limitations that  may  exist under the Imperial Act will  in  no way affect us here in Australia.  It  is only when a period of war obtains  that  we shall come under that  Act.  I  am  inclined to think, consequently, that  my  honorable friend&#39;s fears in this regard are not founded on any fact concerning which we need worry ourselves to any extent. I agree with him that it is necessary that our Air Force should be built up and developed to meet the conditions  that  exist in Australia, and that it should not be retarded or restricted by an Act  that  does not have particular regard for those conditions. But since it is necessary in time: of war that our Air Force and those of other parts of the Empire should co-operate for- the purposes of defeating a common enemy, it is advisable that in time of war we should work under  a  common Act so as to have uniformity of effort. -Inasmuch as we shall have this limitation applying only during a period  of  war, I think the fears which the honorable senator has so lucidly expressed, despite the Hour of the morning, are more  or  less groundless. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> should feel flattered at the way in which the Committee has received his explanation of the position but, since the matter may be referred to hereafter, there is one point that I particularly desire to stress. There, is a very strong impression that the powers that will administer this measure will administer it along the lines of the Imperial Air Force Act. I am not suggesting that that would be altogether bad, but I do say that unless the extended view of a continent is taken, we shall not have a successful Air Force. We shall not have success if the development of our Air Force is so restricted. There is also abroad a very strong impression that the development of our Air Force will be along those comparatively narrow lines, because of the desire of the military here- </para>

                        <para>- They have worried . me at times; but it is the province of honorable senators to pass legislation, and not to be - bluffed by the military. I repeat that there is an impression that those upon whom the responsibility of building up our Air Force will devolve will follow British lines, irrespective of the requirements of Australia. I hope that the remarks which have been- made in this regard will be noted. I had been promised some very definite information on this point, but, owing to the Bill being brought on&#39; unexpectedly this morning, I  am unable to make that information available to the Committee. Should the matter again crop up and the information on which I am now basing my remarks be available, and of such a nature as to be of service&#39; to the Minister, I shall let him have it. </para>

I move the amendment on this Bill to direct attention to the matter in another place, where I believe the words &#34;within the limits of the Commonwealth&#34; will be struck out of the similar provision in the Defence Bill, to the fact that this clause also requires attention. </para>

I must again raise my protest against the proposal embodied in this clause. I hope that on this occasion the Committee will agree that it is not right at any time or place that sentence of death should be carried out on an Australian soldier until it has been confirmed by the Executive of the Commonwealth. </para>

We shall then be able to review the matter, when less fatigued and better able to complete our work of making this Bill a better one. I must say that I think the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has been most courteous and gentlemanly through, what must have been a trying time to him. </para>

                    <para>. - After the confessions of addled brains at this early hour I shall try to make the meaning of this clause clear. Assuming that my brains are not also addled, the clause means that a court martial shall not be hampered by undue technicalities. Court martials are so constituted that there shall be as few technicalities as possible about their composition and procedure, and the clause is intended to avoid the introduction of those technicalities and difficulties, which legal gentlemen are only too ready to raise. </para>

                        <para>- It is advisable, for the benefit of practitioners and others, to define those bodies in the interpretation clause. I would put in the definition of Military Board after the definition of &#34;Airman,&#34; or perhaps after the definition of .  &#34; the Defence Act.&#34; There should also be a definition of &#34; Commanding officer.&#34; Various powers are given to the commanding officer, but there is no definition. We could put in after, the definition of- &#34; Airman &#34; the words &#34; Commanding officer, means the commanding officer of any unit.&#34; . I have circulated amendments to define &#34; Member &#34; and &#34; Minister,&#34; but it may not be necessary to press them. </para>

                    <para>.  - This is entirely a question of draftsmanship. Is the Committee to be guided by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> who apparently thought out several of his suggestions while he was on his feet, or by the Crown Lav? authorities? The Bill has been carefully drafted by the Commonwealth draftsman and submitted to the Crown Solicitor. It is a complete whole. I could understand members not agreeing . with some of the principles of the Bill, but in the matter of draftsmanship we must give the benefit of the doubt to those who have had the preparation of the Bill as a whole, and have had before them the Acts Interpretation Act and other measures. Some of the amendments <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has circulated show that he has not read the Acts Interpretation Act. </para>
