                            <para>- I am as deeply interested in the subject of his question as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> himself. I feel sure that no one has received a permit from the Department to carry out prospecting work in New Guinea. I hope that the Territory will be open to prospecting by all Britishers within a very short time. I have sent for the newspaper, in order to acquaint myself with the terms of the paragraph referred to, and I shall follow it up by ascertaining what has been done in the matter. It will take a few days to find out whether such a company as is referred to is in existence, and is working in New Guinea, as it will be necessary to send a wireless message to the Administrator. The settlement of the matter will not be delayed a moment longer than can be avoided. </para>

                        <para> - I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether he is aware of the fact that a number of returned soldier settlers in Queensland have recently had to abandon their farms; or are talking of doing so, because they are unable to make a living on them? Does the honorable senator know that the Queensland Minister of Lands has made an announcement that no further applications for land will be received from returned soldiers ? Is this in accordance' with the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Queensland ? Will the Commonwealth Government endeavour, by some means or other, before making money available to the State Governments, to see that lands allotted to returned soldiers are more suitable for soldier settlement than some of the land thrown open to them in the past? </para>

                        <para>- I believe that at the recent Premiers' Conference some modifications of the original agreement with the State Governments were made, but I am not in a position to say what they were. If the honorable senator will give notice of his question, I will see whether it is possible to supply an official statement showing what are the terms of the present contract between the Commonwealth and State Governments in connexion with the land settlement of returned soldiers. </para>

                    <para>. -  Honorable senators will remember that this clause was postponed because there was some doubt as to whether  it  made it quite clear that preference was to be given to naval men who had seen active service, and not to men who bad served only in the naval depots and had never left Australia. That is the intention, and I have an amendment to submit which will extend the operation of the clause to the Health Department. I believe that this will be in accordance with the desire of honorable senators. </para>

As I understand it, clause 38 simply means that certain persons who have served in the Permanent Naval Forces for a stated period will be eligible for appointment without examination  to  any office in the Fourth Division of the Department of Trade and Customs. Why this limitation? In the Post Office, for instance, sailors who are sail makers may be employed on the mail bags. They may have served their full time in the Navy, 'and whilst they would be eligible for appointment without examination  to  the Fourth Division of the Department of Trade and Customs under this clause, they would not be eligible without examination for appointment to the Fourth Division of the Post and Telegraph Department. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but an officer may be compelled to remain in a position until he persuades some one to recommend his promotion. It is only bv examination that the capabilities of officers can be ascertained. An engineer connected with the Post and Telegraph Department may possess considerable practical experience, and if tested by examination could prove his worth, whilst another man who has had little experience might be placed over his head-. Should there not be an examination to test the capabilities of such officers? If the clause is amended in the manner suggested it will enable preference to be shown, and, although in this instance I shall be acting contrary to my usual practice, I intend to vote for the retention of the words. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> seems to have misunderstood the position. The object of the preceding clause is to give absolute preference to members of the Naval Forces who have seen active service during the war, and is limited to the Fourth Division. It refers solely to new appointments, and has nothing whatever to do with promotions. It would be unreasonable to suggest that a man of forty-eight or forty-nine years of age should sit for an. examination before being appointed as a warder, or a watchman in the Quarantine Department. A man may have lost his fingers when on active service, and, although unsuited for certain classes of work, would be quite capable of acting as a watchman. </para>

                    <para>. -  Turning to clause 2-2, we find that the Fourth Division includes all officers who are not included in the First, Second, or Third Divisions. It embraces nearly all the postal sorters, a large number of officers in the Customs Department, and men who in status are just below the clerical staff. Able men may be in the Service for forty years, and still be in the Fourth Division. Clause 39 makes no mention of naval men or returned soldiers, but says that any person may be appointed to the Fourth. Division without examination. I object to the door to the Civil Service being opened so wide that anybody may be appointed to it, irrespective of his suitability, whereas in ordinary cases an examination has to be passed. </para>

The clause does not limit the choice to returned soldiers, sailors and nurses, but it says that the Fourth Division can be filled anyhow and from anywhere.

Are we going to compel them to pay 10 per cent. or 15 per cent, extra?

                        <para>. -When  the war broke out the aerial service was transferred to the Navy Department. The employees who were transferred with it from the Postal Department were permanent men, and they retained their permanency. When the Navy took over the business they were enlisted under the  Navy  Act. The proposal provides that their service with the Navy Department shall count as part of their period of Commonwealth service. I think that is fair, because a man could not be better employed than as a wireless operator during the war. These men will probably all pass back to the Postal service now that that Department has taken over the aerialservices. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret that there was a misunderstanding in reference to this clause. Some members who raised an objection . have since changed their minds. Some of the men engaged in the Defence Department during the war dug themselves into snug positions as permanent hands, sometimes at an increased rate of pay. The proposal is that the longest period of local leave that can be granted to them shall be twelve months. They are not to transfer from one Department to another for the purpose of getting an increase in salary. This does not affect members of the Australian Imperial Force. They get leave for war service, but the home service men can only get leave from the Department when an acting man has been called in for a period of twelve months. Exceptions may be made by the Board. A man like the Secretary of the Defence Department, who may be an ex-military man liable to be called up, may be exempted and given an extension. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> wanted to know why the leave was restricted to twelve months. He was under a wrong impression as to the way in which the clause would affect officers of an Expeditionary Force serving overseas. </para>

                    <para>. -  I desire to move for the insertion of a Fifth Schedule. Originally it was proposed in the Bill to appoint a civil servant as  chairman  of the Appeal Board. There was a little confusion in the minds of honorable senators, and a feeling that he might be subject to the control of the head of a Department. The civil servants appealed to the Senate to appoint an outsider as  chairman.  The determination of the Appeal Board is final, and, therefore, it is not under the control of anybody. In order to leave no possibility of doubt on this point, the insertion of a Fifth Schedule is proposed in order to require an oath from members of the Board that they will give their decision free of bias. This will protect them from interference by heads of Departments. I move - </para>

The effect of the amendment will be that permanent officers and also temporary officers employed under or by virtue of any Act repealed by this measure will remain in office as if it had been in force at the time they were appointed. The idea is to give permanancy to temporary officers. </para>

                        <para>- It is the desire of a majority of public servants that this Bill shall apply to the  chairman  of an Appeal Board. It is unlikely that there will be more than, say, twenty appeals during a year, and,- under the clause as previously amended, it would have been impossible to appoint officers from the Attorney-General's Department, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knowles</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonniwell,</inline> who have a thorough knowledge of the Service, to the position of  chairman  of an Appeal Board. When the representatives of the Public Service were informed that such officers could not be appointed, they were anxious that an amendment in this direction should be made. They expressed their willingness for the clause to be amended, so that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knowles</inline> could be appointed, because he is an officer in  whom they have every confidence. An officer in the Attorney-General's Department could, without difficulty, obtain the necessary leave to act as  chairman  of an Appeal Board. I think he would be a more suitable man, because he would have qualifications equal or superior to those of a police magistrate. </para>

                <para>My object in moving the insertion of this new clause is to meet what I believe to be the almost unanimous desire of the Senate, and of Parliament generally, that Parliament should have control of its own officers. It is my belief that that is a correct and proper thing. I have consulted with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> in the matter, and the clause has been prepared by the Parliamentary Draftsman for the purpose of giving effect to what is believed to be the express wish of Parliament. Of course it is for Parliament to say whether the clause meets with its approval or not. It largely follows the provisions of the old Act, except as to one or two matters where experience has shown that some alterations are necessary, but these alterations are of a very minor character. As the clause is a very long one, and somewhat complicated, I suggest that discussion would be facilitated, and the Committee would be enabled to arrive at a more accurate decision, if the various parts of it were put separately. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to give notice of an, amendment ta this clause. At present the officers of Parliament are controlled by the  President  of the Senate, so far as Senate officers are concerned, by the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, so far as officers in that branch of the Legislature are concerned, and in some cases officers are under the joint control of the  President  and the  Speaker.  I propose to include with the  President  and the  Speaker  the members of the House Committee, so far as that Committee controls officers, and also the Library Committee, so far as it exercises similar powers. I think my reasons for this action are fairly well known to honorable senators, because the matter has been discussed before. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has just informed the Committee that it is his opinion that Parliament should have authority over its own officers. There can scarcely be two opinions on that point. All Parliaments retain control over their own officers, for obvious reasons. There should be no power higher than the Parliament. If we allowed our officers to be under an outside authority, we should practically lose the control of Parliament. If the House and Library Committees are brought in to work in, conjunction with the  President  and the  Speaker,  we shall be reverting to the position which existed when the Commonwealth was established. Very many honorable senators who have sat on the House Committee have wondered why it is in existence. It is practically without authority. When a meeting is called - and that only happens at very wide intervals - there is really no -work to do. Anything of consequence that the House Committee controlled in former years has been taken away from it. If the Committee had some power and authority, honorable senators would be proud to be members of it; but what satisfaction is there in being a member of a Committee that has no power? </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear that; but as far as the officers of the Senate are concerned, I hold that the House Committee has no power whatever. There is a Public Service Act which places the control of public servants generally in the hands of several Boards. If breaches of the regulations are committed, or if officers desire to appeal against injustices, the Boards come into operation. "We have safeguarded the interests of the public servants outside Parliament - in the Post Office, the Customs Department, and other Departments. Public servants have many ways in. which they may ventilate their grievances and get their case heard, but officers of the Senate have no means of being heard. They have no Appeal Board, or Board of Inquiry. Members of Parliament know very little of what goes on in connexion with the control of officers. No report is published, such as is issued in relation to the Post Office and the Customs Department. Still, honorable senators keep representing that Parliament ought to control its own officers. Parliament does not control its officers, and it is in order to give some control into the hands of the Committee that I move my amendment. I hope honorable senators will see the reason and necessity for it. Unless the amendment is carried officers of the Senate can have no protection, and Parliament can have no effective control over them. It is an absolute necessity that the House Committee should be given that power. I move - </para>

                    <para>. -The sub-clause with which the Committee is now dealing is on all-fours with the provisions of the present Act. Practically no alteration is proposed in the law as is stands at present. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie proposes to make a very drastic alteration, and I submit that the reasons he has put forward in support of his proposal are entirely inadequate. He says it has been demonstrated in the past that Parliament has had no control of its officers, and he asserts that it will have no control in the future unless the Joint House Committee act with the  Speaker  or  President,  as the case may be. I want to point out that if the amendment is carried Parliament will not have any more control over its officers than it -has now. It has absolute control of the  President  and the Speaker; both are responsible to Parliament, and can be removed by a simple vote of either House. Parliament would not have any more control if it brought in a Committee, because the Committee would be no more responsible to Parliament than is the <inline font-weight="bold">President. Senator de</inline> Largie contended that this thing was not done until recently. It never has been done by this Parliament, or by any Presiding Officer of it. It would be utterly impracticable to do it, because Parliament does not usually sit for more than five months in the year. For the remaining seven months of the year the Committee could not be got together, and there would be no one available capable of dealing with any matter that might arise. I think it is generally conceded, and it has been embodied in all the Public Service Acts, that officers of the Public Service should not have recourse to political influence or be subjected to political control. I venture to say that if we had a  Committee acting in conjunction with the  President  there would be nothing but political wire-pulling from end to end of the Service in the Senate. </para>

In addition to the difficulty that would arise owing to the Committee not being available for two-thirds of the year, there is the further difficulty that there is no Committee constituted to deal with the Senate, and no Committee constituted to deal with the House of Representatives. There is a Joint House Committee, which was created to deal with matters that do not come under the separate jurisdiction, of either House. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie says that the House Committee is of no importance. I say that many important things come before that Committee, and many important decisions are registered by the Committee. As far as I am concerned, every opportunity has been given to the Committee to deal with all the matters that properly come before it, and, as far as I have been able to ascertain, it has exercised as much influence during the last few years as ever it did. Even if the amendment is incorporated in the clause, there will still be a Department which will be outside the control of the Committee, namely, <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The position will then be anomalous. Personally, I think any President would like to be relieved of the duty, and of the abuse that is poured upon him when he acts independently in carrying out his duties. </para>

                        <para>- It is a responsibility that properly belongs to the  President's  position. I say that emphatically. No  President  would have any control over a staff if members of the staff could go to a Committee .which had power to override his decisions. If it is desired to maintain discipline and good order, the law, which has acted so well in the past, should be continued in the future. It is a question whether we should have one head of a Department or a dozen. Good service is not likely to be obtained if there are a dozen bosses on the same job. As for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's contention that members of the staff have no means of appealing against the President's decisions, honorable senators will remember that in this session very much has been heard of the grievances of servants of the Senate. Officers always have a right <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> appeal through senators, who can shoulder the responsibility upon one man. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator, I think, is introducing a matter which, does not belong properly to this discussion. I ask honorable senators to judge this amendment, not from my stand-point or that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> or any other individual, but from the standpoint of the good of the Service generally. I may pass away to-morrow ; another  President  may be here. Probably there will be another  President  in a very short time, and then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> may be more satisfied. I ask honorable senators to come to a decision entirely irrespective of any individual, and with regard only to what is best for the Service. Unless the responsibility is placed upon one person, good service will not be obtained, and discipline will be destroyed. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment, and to pass the clause as it stands. The sub-clause is an exact copy of the law which has proved satisfactory in the past, and has, I maintain, fulfilled every requirement of the Service to the full satisfaction of Parliament and its officers. </para>

I got that statement from the honorable senator in evidence given before the Select Committee of which. I was  Chairman.  The honorable senator evidently expected that it would be given greater publicity than it can receive from the publication of the minutes of evidence taken before the Select Committee, and consequently he desired today to get it out first.

He told the Committee that twenty members had come to him and had tried to use political influence to have a fourth class clerk appointed.

                    said in reply to me waa wrong. I had to go on questioning the honorable senator. I had to ask nine questions to drag out of him what he was privately circulating about me amongst members of this Parliament. I had to " fossick it " out by asking question after question. If I had been ashamed of anything I had done, I should not have tried to drag out of the honorable senator what I knew he was privately circulating about me. This is the manly person who is able to withstand political influence. When, it came to a question of how long ago the matter to which the honorable senator referred had occurred, he said it was six or seven years ago. This will show honorable senators how long

It should be a warning to honorable senators who go to his private room, as to how guarded and careful they should be in their attitude towards a man of that kind. So far as political influence is concerned, we have it in the words of

                        <para>- I am surprised at the trivial nature of the point of order which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has raised. I should have thought that a gentleman who had studied the Standing Orders and professed to be conversant with them would not have raised a point of order with so little in it. I was referring to a memorandum concerning the officers of Parliament; and, if this matter is to be intelligently discussed, that memorandum should not be left out of our consideration. We are now dealing with the control of officers of the Parliament, and the memorandum to which I have referred embodies a proposition which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> made without consulting Parliament, without consulting the House Committee, and apparently without consulting any one but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and I question if he even consulted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> He certainly did not consult Parliament, as he should have -done, because this is not a Government matter. Why should the honorable senator have sent his memorandum to the Government? The Government have no right to control the officers of Parliament. It is Parliament that should have been consulted. By all its legislation, and by the precedents laid down by practice, Parliament has always asserted its right to control its own officers. Why should <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> go behind the back of Parliament to give away a right which Parliament has in its own hands, and without even consulting it? There was a bit of funny work connected with that action which ought to be revealed, and I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> will be sufficiently candid to let us know what was behind it all. The honorable senator swallowed that proposition, and he now comes along with an other. He now proposes that Parliament should exercise control, whereas before he contended that it should not. He gives as one of his reasons that political influence is exercised. </para>

I suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> like myself, occasionally makes convincing speeches. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has contended that Parliament would be given no greater control of its officers by the adoption of my amendment. I hold that if the House Committee were included as I propose, consisting as it does of a number of members of this Parliament, it would provide, a wider control over the officers of Parliament than the one-man control that we have at the present time. This has broken down in the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> I am sure that any one who examines impartially cases that were recently before Parliament will admit that there should be a change, and that the control of the officers of Parliament should be vested in more than one man. I hold that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is not a man who can be left coldly in control of any one else. He has not the necessary temperament. </para>

The Committee is dealing with paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of sub -clause 1 of the proposed new clause and the amendment, which the honorable senator has moved, is to add to it the words " and House Committee." The Presidency of the Senate is, as every honorable senator knows, a dignified position, and should, I think, be discussed impersonally. </para>

                        <para>- We have to remember that there may be many changes in 4he occupancy of the position of President of the Senate. Future Presidents may go wrong, and act in the same way as the present President has done, and then the Senate will be in the same unhappy position that we find ourselves in to-day. Under the Bill we have given the right to members of the Public Service to appeal to a Board, and I say that officers of Parliament should have <inline font-style="italic">same</inline> Committee to whom they may appeal. I am, suggesting that the House Committee should take the place of the Appeal Board or Board of Inquiry provided for public servants generally. I hold that the House Committee is the proper body to take up this work. Sena- 1 tor Givens has said that the House Committee has never done the work I propose to hand over to it. The honorable senator is speaking of things concerning which he has had no opportunity to obtain, an inside knowledge. I was a member of the first Library Committee of this Parliament. There are members still in the House of Representatives who were on that Committee. There is a member in this chamber at the present time who was on that Committee. I was a member of the second House Committee appointed, and I can speak with authority of the work which was done by those two Committees. I can say that during the first and second Parliaments those Committees were consulted in every instance by the  President  or the  Speaker,  as the case might be, when amy staff matter came forward. I quite well remember <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker, the first  President  of the Senate, making a statement to the House Committee after the first Public Service Act was passed. He said that now that the Act was passed it was necessary to recognise it in some way or another. He said that he saw very great difficulty in the way of administering his Department and. at the same time applying the provisions of the Public Service Act. He further said that, consequently, he intended to exercise control through the House Committee. He said, " This House Committee will take the place of the Appeal Board, <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> the Board of Inquiry, as the case may be, and we shall go on in the future as we have done in the past." These are things on. which I can. speak from personal knowledge. I can say, further, that only very recently, when the matter was brought up in the Library, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDonald,</inline> a member of another place, practically substantiated what I am saying here to-day. Now, as to the statement that officers may bring any grievances they have before the Senate, let me say that that may be a very unpleasant task. Honorable senators will not desire to challenge the Presiding Officer in that way when they could have things put right before a Committee. Time and again I have gone to tha  President  in connexion with staff  matters of which I was informed to have grievances put right. Sometimes I succeeded, and sometimes I did not. I say that honorable senators should not have to do that sort of thing. The House Committee should be the body to deal with staff grievances. I do not think it right that an honorable' senator should have to appeal to the  President  to do something out of compliment to him, for this or that officer. These things must be taken in hand by some one. If they are ignored the result will be that what ia every one's business will become nobody's business. Looked at from every point of view, it will he seen that there will be an advantage in giving the House Committee the 'power I propose. I am surprised that politicians should repeat the dirty insinuations of the press with regard to the exercise of political influence'. I am surprised that a gentleman holding the dignified office of  President  of the Senate should be a party to passing on such wretched, untruthful suggestions about political influence. . </para>

                    <para>. - I have no desire, by reason of my official position, to deprive any honorable senator of his right in a discussion in Committee. The statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is not in accordance with facts. He said that I went behind the back of Parliament to make this recommendation with regard to the officers pf Parliament, and that I went behind the  Speaker  also. Either that is true or it is not true. The facts may be simply stated: It was within the knowledge of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and myself that after a very full inquiry into the Public Service, the late Public Service Commissioner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McLachlan)</inline> recommended to the Government certain lines upon which the Public Service should be organized, and expressed the view that there was no reason why officers of the Parliament should be treated as distinct and separate from, other members of the Public Service. That came within the knowledge of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and myself. We had a consultation about the matter, and deemed it our duty to report to the Government that the classification of officers in both Houses, of all parliamentary officers in fact, should be made by the Public Service Commissioner or the Board, and that the appropriate salaries belonging to their classification should be determined thus, but that Parliament should, as hitherto, retain the sole control over its employees. That is what I am now proposing. I am prepared to defend my action anywhere. Instead of going behind the back of Parliament we took Parliament into our confidence. </para>

                        <para>- On the contrary, my amendment is intended to rectify what I consider is a mistake. All this discussion has arisen simply because I am trying to improve the Bill in the direction I have indicated, and restore to Parliament that control over its parliamentary officers which the Government propose to take away from Parliament. I may say that after our representations had been made, the Government consented to my moving these amendments in Committee. I have no desire to labour the question. I have nut the facts before the Committee, and I am content to leave the matter in honorable senators' hands. </para>

                        <para>- Well, that is the kind of administration we want in regard to our parliamentary officers. At present there is too, much duplication altogether. It cannot be said that there is contentment throughout' this building, because there is not. That, at all events, is my experience. The  President  of to-morrow may be a man who would not treat men exactly as they should be treated and I contend that the House Committee should have authority and be held responsible. I can give honorable senators a case in point. I have had two or three letters, and several officers of the Parliament have seen me, asking why the House Committee fail to do certain things. So far as I am concerned, there was no political influence about that. The House Committee, in my opinion, is wrongly named. Its powers are too circumscribed, and should be extended. The  President  will admit that practically little interest is taken in the work submitted to the meetings of the House Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment appears to be somewhat irrelevant to the Bill. It is the duty of Parliament to control its officers; but it must be remembered that parliamentary authority is quite distinct from Government authority. In this instance the power is in the hands of Parliament and not of the Government. Interference on the part of the Government in matters which should be controlled absolutely by Parliament would never be tolerated. I have endeavoured to ascertain the wishes of honorable senators in regard to the provisions of this measure, which apply to the officers of Parliament, and I am determined not to assist in handing over to the Government, or to any other authority, the powers and privileges which should be in the hands of Parliament. This House  has a right to control its own business. Some honorable senators have said that they do not know the functions of the different Committees, and have suggested extended powers, but I do not think it is the duty of honorable senators to become members of an appeal board to consider the grievances of parliamentary employees. </para>

                        <para>- The real trouble seems to be that the members of the Committees do not know what their duties are. There are five Committees, excluding the two joint Committees, appointed by the Senate, and if the Government were to introduce a measure defining the powers of the Committees there would be justifiable opposition because that is the duty of the Parliament. I have no power as a Minister, apart from my right as a senator, to suggest alterations in the method of conducting the Library, but I naturally wish to exercise my rights as a senator in common with other honorable senators when the occasion arises. I do not think the amendment submitted is relevant to the Bill, and I am, therefore, not prepared to accept it. One of the last duties I would desire to perform would be that of fixing wages and hours. I am in favour of arbitration for the settlement of disputes but if a Minister were called upon to settle them, his task would be an unenviable one. </para>

                    <para>. -  In the early stages  of the  debate on this amendment, I endeavoured to secure the call, and, after unsuccessful attempts, I was assured by one honorable senator that this was not any business  of  mine, as it concerned only <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and the  President.  When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> said that at least twenty honorable senators had endeavoured to influence him, I interjected that that ought not  to  have been said, because the manner  in  which the statement was uttered would lead to the belief that Ministers or honorable senators had been endeavouring  to  use undue influence. I do not think  that  could be said of any honorable senator. I can quite understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is unaccustomed to speaking  on  the floor of the Senate and may have said more than he intended, or unintentionally conveyed a wrong impression. But the point is clear, and, in my mind, no honorable senator has the right to make charges by imputation or innuendo. If an endeavour has been made to use undue influence, let the names be mentioned, and those responsible answer for themselves. At present, the charge rests upon every one, because we cannot divorce the utterances of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> from those of the  President. </para>

                        <para>- Let us get away from that aspect of the question. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> considers the position, and 'reads his utterances in cold type, he will .find that his remarks have left a nasty impression in the minds of honorable senators. I am quite satisfied that I am putting the case fairly in saying that honorable senators will never go to the extent of endeavouring to use undue influence. One of my interjections was to this effect, " I pitied the officers of this House under the despotic dictatorship cf the  President,  judging by my own experience." I feel, however, .that in pursuing this course I am joining in the scandal which' has been the means of lowering the dignity of the Senate. I also said that despotic powers had been used despotically by the  President.  If the  President  carried out his duties' in the way his conscience dictates, he is guilty; but that is for others to judge. My conscience is clear on everything I have done. I shall give a few illustrations to show that 1 have been treated in a drastically despotic manner1. I have been subjected to indignities to which I would not ask anybody to submit. On one occasion I was called upon to withdraw a statement. Our Standing Orders provide that, before an honorable senator is removed, he should be given an opportunity to make a statement or to offer an apology. I rose a dozen times to make a statement, and I was ordered by the  President  to sit down. If I live to be a hundred years old, the indignity to which I was submitted by this gentleman will never be forgotten. </para>

                        <para>- I think I am perfectly in order in showing the type of man to whom it is proposed to give these powers. i The  CHAIRMAN.  - I am very loath at any time to impose any restriction upon debate, but the honorable senator is referring to something which took place in this chamber, and, he is criticising a decision of the Senate in connexion wilh its ordinary legislative proceedings. I can see no relation whatever between that matter and the question now under consideration. If the honorable senator will pardon me, may I delicately suggest that he abandon that argument for the time being, and reserve it for some other occasion ? </para>
