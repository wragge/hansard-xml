        <para>Prior to Federation, the State authorities had control of both the Post Office and ' the railways, and consequently' the cost of carrying the mails by train was only a book debit against the Post Office; but, when the States federated, the control of the Post Office became a Federal matter, while the State authorities continued to control the railways, and an arrangement was come to whereby the Commonwealth was to pay the States for the actual cost of the service they rendered to it in the carriage of mails. That arrangement continued for a number of years, the Commonwealth agreeing to several increases in the charges, which brought the total cost up to £276,000 a year, and then, although the ' authorities were in agreement about the conditions under which the mails should be carried, they could not agree as to a fair . price for the service. The matter was, therefore, referred to arbitration, and by a majority vote it was determined that the mails should be charged for at half the ordinary commercial parcel rates. Actually, however, that was equivalent to charging for them at the full parcel rates, because the transport of parcels devolves upon the railway staffs a good deal of clerical work, whereas there is no such work in connexion with the handling of the mails. That - arrangement terminated with last year, and a mere makeshift arrangement obtains at the present moment. Section 18 of the Post, and Telegraph Act 1901-1910, which . provides for payment  for the carriage of mails by rail, is to be amended by the Bil] so that it. shall  read - </para>

          <para>The Postmaster-General shall pay to the principal railway official of each State, or to the owner controller or manager of any railway or tram-way in any State as the case may be such annual Bum for rendering any service required in pursuance of the last preceding section as may be agreed upon and in default of agreement as may be settled by arbitration Provided that no payment shall be made to any owner controller or manager of any - private railway or tramway who in accordance with the law of a State has agreed to carry His Majesty's mails free of charge. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>Under this Bill, no attempt is made to prevent an arrangement being arrived at, but rather are facilities offered to enable it to be brought about. Unfortunately, under the existing system there has been no clear-cut definition of the functions of the arbitrators, who have been at liberty to take almost anything as the basis of allotment. Generally, they have taken the parcels rates as that basis, and the alternative has been suggested of a per ton per mile rate. The practice has been to include in their calculation the whole of the goods trains running, irrespective of whether they carried mails or not. Upon the other hand, the Postal Department contends that it should pay for all mails carried a reasonable rate, which would suffice to cover all the costs incurred by the States. </para>

              <para>- Let me point out what has been the practice under the existing system. Prior to Federation, it appears that the fixing of the amount debited to the Post Office by the Railways for the carriage of mails was upon a purely arbitrary basis. The fact that both concerns were under the same Government control did not render the question of equitable payment by the one Department for services rendered by the other  Department one of any moment. Both services belonged to the States. </para>

              <para>- In 1900, the railways in New South ' Wales were credited with £79,894 per annum for the conveyance of mails; in Victoria, they were credited -with £57,834; in Queensland, with £50,000; in South Australia, with £18,181 ; in Western Australia, with £17,121; and in Tasmania with £10,981. The amounts of payment were npt computed upon a uniform basis- throughout the States. In New South Wales and Tasmania the payments were computed at so much per mile on lines upon which mail vans were provided, whilst upon other lines they were computed by weight. In Victoria and Western Australia the payments were based upon mileage, according to the number of trains run. In Queensland, a lump sum was paid; and in South Australia the payment was computed upon a per-mile ' basis, according to service. The total payments to the whole of the railways was £234,011 per annum. Between 1901 and 1907 the Railways pressed for increased payment for the carriage of mails, but their requests were not based upon any evidence of cost ' of Service, and the Postal Department strongly resisted their demands. In 1907, however, as the result of a conference between the parties, it was' agreed that the Post Office should make payment of a lump sum of £275,000 per annum, for the conveyance of mails by railways. </para>

          </continue>
          <para class="block">The Railway authorities were empowered to devise a scale which would apportion this £275,000 between the States in about the proportion which each State had received of the original £234,000. The apportionment was upon a line-mileage basis. In 1908, an agreement was entered into for a period of eight years, under which payment was to be computed upon the scale to which I have referred.' That agreement terminated in 1916. A conference was then held between the Railway authorities and the Postmaster-General, with a view to the drawing up of a fresh agreement. Agreement was reached upon practically' all the points at issue, except the rate of payment. In regard to that the railways insisted that in any negotiations the amount then paid should be taken as .a minimum basis. The Postal Department, however, contended that the then existing rate was excessive. Failing agreement, the matter was submitted to arbitration, under section 18 of the Post and Telegraph Act, and it was mutually agreed that the InterState Commission should act as arbitrator. The Department contended before the Commission that payment for the carriage of mails should be in relation to cost of service. The Commission, in a majority report, decided that the annual sum to be paid by the ,Postmaster-General to the principal railway official in each State should be 50 per cent, of the scheduled State railway rates for parcels, Intra and. Inter State, in force on 1st January, 1917. The Commission classified mails as parcels. In other words, it was decided that "the highest rate for the carriage of goods by the Railway Department should be adopted. The reason why 50 per cent, of the rate was fixed upon was that, in handling parcels, the railways were involved in services1 such as booking, &amp;c, which did not apply to mails. This award was made binding for only one year. The principle upon which parcels rates were fixed was the ability of the consignor to pay, because the Railways Commissioners had a fixed parcels tariff which would enable the greatest revenue possible to be secured without diverting or discouraging traffic. The  chairman  of the Inter-State Commission, in a minority report, disagreed with this finding, contending that the payment to the railways should represent the amount incurred in -giving the services. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> concluded his finding as follows: - </para>

              <para>- I cannot say offhand. In order to determine the amount of payment to be made to the Railway Department in accordance with the award, the weights of mails consigned by rail were taken in March, 1918. Upon these weights, payment was computed at the rate of £184,296 per annum. The State railways were paid a,t this rate from 1st January, 1917, to 31st December, 1920, plus £7,500 per annum for the conveyance of second-class overseas mail matter. In October, 1920, the mails were again weighed. The weights taken, computed at half the parcels rates' operating on 1st January, 1917, would involve payment at the rate of £230,683 per annum, an increase of £46,387 per annum. </para>

              <para>- The railways declined to accept payment, as from 1st January, 1921, on the basis of the parcels rates operating on the 1st January, 1917, demanding that it should be computed on the parcels rates operating on 1st January last. If payment were so made, on the weighings of October, 1920, an amount of £352,956 per annum would be involved. The Postal Department would thus have to pay £168,660 per annum more than the amount determined under the award - an- increase of, approximately, 91 per cent. That is a point that I desire to emphasize. If payments were made on the parcels rates operating on 1st January, 1921, instead of on the rates operating on 1st January, 1917, as provided for in the award, the increase would amount, approximately, to 91 per cent. </para>

If I were acting in his position, I should allow the interest charge for the month, and take a general view of the railway tonnage on all transportation. All we are seeking is  a  fair method of arbitrating in order to settle the problem which is now holding up the Postal Department. I therefore ask the Senate to pass the Bill, so that we may reach finality. </para>

        <para class="block">I move this amendment, believing that, if the Board is to be created, it should be made as effective as possible.. On a previous occasion I voiced my disapproval of Boards generally, but if there is any question upon which a Board may be justified, it is the Tariff. Jocular reference has been made to the question of whether the Tariff before us is scientific or not. I submit, in view of the problems with which the Tariff is immediately and intimately bound up, that it would not be a great stretch of the imagination to say that the framing of a Tariff could almost be called an exact science. </para>

            <para>- No. I mean a desirable kind of Tariff. Honorable senators arc at a great disadvantage in discussing the Tariff, and it is necessary, in order to do justice to the subject, for them to be in possession of -all the information that can possibly be obtained about the hundreds of items that have to be considered. It is not to be expected that members of this or another place can make themselves familiar with all the facts relating to every item in the schedule. One of the moat important duties of the proposed Board will be to acquire. about all these matters, facts from which members of Parliament can draw their own deductions. There are only two ways of doing this thing - the right way and the wrong way, and I am sure all honorable senators want to do it the right way. It has been argued that the appointment of two business gentlemen, to assist the  Chairman  of the Board, would give greater confidence to the public. I do not know that that necessarily follows. I am credibly informed by those in a position to form an opinion, that a man may be an expert on hardware items in the Tariff schedule, but may not know anything about any other subject in it. Another business man may be an expert on groceries, but may know absolutely nothing about the' .many other items with which we shall have to deal. It, therefore,  does not follow that we shall receive any advantage from the appointment of two business men to the Board. Rather it might be argued that if a permanent Board were appointed, consisting of three men who had been accustomed to deal with Tariff questions in the Customs Department, there would be much more likelihood of the true facts being placed before honorable senators for their information. It has also been said that two business men, if appointed to the Board, would necessarily be more independent in framing their reports. I do not think that necessarily follows, either. It implies that three permanent officials on a Board under the control of the Minister would naturally be influenced by the Minister, and that the Minister's opinion would have some influence on their reports. I think the chances are the other way round. In all human probability, the average man acting as. Minister would decide that three men who had devoted so much time and trouble to arriving at a certain conclusion must know a great deal more about the subject than he does, and I should say that, humanly speaking, the opinion of the Board would invariably receive the support of the Minister, except where matters of policy were concerned. A Board of three permanent officials would give greater confidence to the public, and would certainly furnish Parliament with better all-round information than would a Board consisting of one official and two business gentlemen. I have been simply flooded with correspondence from all kinds and classes of people and businesses, for or against duties in the Tariff schedule. </para>

            <para>- However, the result, so far as I am concerned, is that after wading through a great deal of 4he correspondence I find " confusion worse confounded " - I am worse off than before. I recognise, therefore, that it is necessary to have a Board which can put reliable information before Parliament in order to enable it to come to a decision in these matters. For that reason, I submit the amendment.  </para>

          <para>. -  I should like some further information as to what are the functions. * of this Board, and how these can be brought into action. I recognise that  clause 15, which, deals with the reference of certain matters to the Board, is not now before the Committee; but the point I wish to raise has some bearing on clause 8. I wish to know, first, who may move the Minister. I take -it that, at any time, if the Minister's own officials point out certain anomalies and advise that certain alterations ought to be made, he may at once refer a matter to the Board, and that it is open to him to take the same course on the application of manufacturers. But is it possible for the unfortunate and unhappy consumer to have the Board put into action in the same way ? In New South Wales some time ago there was a Profiteering Board, and any citizen who thought he was being charged too much for certain articles could demand inquiry. Under this Bill, could an ordinary citizen and taxpayer move the Board in the same way? If an ordinary citizen have that power, it is quite possible that the Board will have a good deal of work to do in the twelve months ; on the other hand, if the Minister is the only person who can refer questions, he may be quite satisfied with the " scientific " Tariff, and initiate no inquiries. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator will remember that I ruled him out of order when he submitted the amendment to which he alludes. The Presiding Officer is bound as much as any other senator by the Standing Orders, and in this case the standing order states very definitely that no amendment can be proposed to any words which the Senate has resolved shall be left standing. It will be remembered that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> when this clause was last before the Committee, moved to strike out the words "which, together with his salary, shall not exceed £1,400 a year." The word that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> desires to strike out is one of the words which the Senate has decided shall remain part of the clause, and, therefore, under the Standing Orders, the honorable senator's amendment cannot be received. . </para>

            <para>- That does not affect the point. If the honorable senator had desired the insertion of any words other than those proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> it was open to him to move an amendment upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle's</inline> amendment. He omitted to do so, and upon the question being put to the Committee " That the words proposed to be left out be left out," the Committee decided that they should remain; therefore, those words must stand part of the clause unless the Senate agrees on motion at the report stage to recommit the clause. The Acting Chairman's ruling is in conformity with the invariable practice of the Senate. The procedure would be interminable if, it having been decided that certain words in the clause of a Bill should remain, honorable senators could thereafter get up, one after another, and move fresh amendments to those words. The position is clear. If the honorable senator desires to move as he has indicated, the course open to him will be, at the report stage, to move that the clause be recommitted. </para>

          <para>. -  I strongly support the amendment, although I hold that, if it is agreed to in the form submitted, the Government will not be bound to appoint Customs officials as members of the Board. It will still be open  for  them, having appointed a Customs official as  chairman,  to select whomsoever they may consider best fitted to fill the remaining positions, regardless of whether the persons concerned are within or outside of the Service. I am stoutly opposed to payment by sittings and to the appointment of persons who are actively engaged in business. If such appointments were  made,  it would almost necessarily  follow  that the two non-official members of the Board would be Melbourne business men. It is my  view,  rightly or  wrongly held,  that  there  is already too  much Melbourne  influence in Commonwealth government and administration. Obviously, it would not be possible for business men in any of the other capital cities to accept appointment to the Board, since their responsibilities would' entail constant  visits  to Melbourne to- attend sittings. Melbourne men would,  in  all probability, be given the positions, and the outcome would be that their own business interests would frequently clash with their duties as members of the Board.' Very often, no doubt, their attendance would be required  ju6t  at a time when their own business affairs were demanding  close  attention ; and I fear that these members would frequently attend sittings  of  the Board merely to  Confirm  whatever the  chairman  had already decided. I know of no Board created by the Commonwealth which will have had more important affairs to deal with. It will be necessary for its members to travel both to obtain the evidence of witnesses and to secure the evidence of their own observation. They will be called upon to examine the conditions under which industries are carried on in all the States before they may consider themselves qualified to make a fair and comprehensive recommendation. There are some industries which, although common to all the States, arc not carried on in precisely the same fashion and under exactly the same conditions' in each; while there are other industries which exist in only one or two of the States. Thus it will be necessary for the Board to cover the whole field  of  industrial activity, which will entail the concentration of all their time and energies. Seeing that the Government have inserted in the Bill specific reference to a salary not exceeding £1,250- </para>

          <para>.- The Minister has told us that the proposal to appoint to the Board two business men, who would be remunerated with a fee of £5 5s. a sitting, was put forward by the Government as likely to give the public confidence in the Board; but I do not think that it would have that effect. He said that if the Board were constituted of permanent officers the public would regard it as a bureaucratic affair, the mysteries and secrets of whose administration could not be penetrated. I do not think that the public regard the branches of the Government Service in that way. On the contrary, they consider that they get good service from the Government officials. If the Board is to give the results expected of it, its members must devote the whole of their time to its business, and be responsible to the Government for the proper performance of their duty. </para>

          <para>. -  I am in favour of paying a fixed salary to the members of the proposed Board. The Minister has interjected that one of the chief reasons for constituting the Board in the manner proposed- in the Bill is that the public may have more confidence in it than it would have in a purely departmental Board. But the Board is to be created chiefly for the protection of the public against protected manufacturers who seek to charge unreasonable prices for their goods. Thus the class from, which the public need protection is the business community, and yet it is from the business community that the Government proposes to select two members of- the Board;. </para>

            <para>- Quite so. That is. the only reason, that: would actuate me in voting for the, appointment of-  a  Board. But if- the consumer is. to be protected, two members of the Board should not be chosen from those from whom -the consumers need protection. It would be better to have a purely, departmental Board, men possessed of ability and knowledge, such as many of the officers of the Department have. Such men would have no interest in business affairs, or' organizations. But a business man who was a member of the Board might be affected, if not directly by some matter under consideration, at least indirectly, in that his friends and business associates,, those on whom he might be depending to bring some business deal to a successful conclusion, might be affected. </para>

            <para>- The departmental officer, who had had years of training, could give the public the protection that it needs, and the public would have confidence in a Board constituted of public officials. I think that the fixing of annual salaries for members of the Board' would lead to greater efficiency than the payment of the members at so much a. sitting, which might mean a great deal ia the course of a year, or very little. The payment of salaries would permit of the appointment of permanent officials to the Board who could devote the whole of their time and abilities to the service of the public, without regard to particular interests. </para>

Now, the matter under discussion is not one of principle.

        <para class="block">The matter, however, is not one whose discussion should occupy many hours. I indorse what has been said about the ability of public officials; but were the proposed Board constituted entirely of officials, the public would believe it to be under the control and influence of the Minister, and thus it would not command the respect which we desire for it. There are, of course, very few propositions which are without their reverse side, and there may be weaknesses in this proposal ; but I ask honorable senators, instead of concentrating their gaze on these weaknesses, to carefully balance the pros and the cons. It has been objected that, under the Government proposal, the unofficial members of the Board will probably be selected in Melbourne, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> drew some comfort in this matter from the hope that Parliament might remove to Canberra. </para>

            <para>- Or in Brisbane, perhaps. Let me give the argument against the alternative proposal. Laud public servants as you will, it is an accepted saying outside that they are bound by red-tape, and echo the Ministerial policy. Whether that be true or not, the fact that that belief is entertained of public servants would largely destroy the value of a purely departmental Board. Of late years the cry has been, "Why not take advantage of the. brains of the community; why employ only the services of paid and hide-bound officials?" The Government has sought -to establish a nexus between the proposed Board and the Department by placing at the head of it an official who would know where to lay his hands on all the information needed, and would understand the departmental routine, and, in addition to him, there would be on the Board two capable men, not in the Public Service, well versed in business, and having a general knowledge of trade matters throughout Australia. Honorable senators have, therefore, to make up their minds whether the advantages of one Board with its disadvantages would outweigh the benefits that would accrue from the creation of the other Board. The Government pub forward their proposal believing that a Board constituted in the manner provided for in the Bill, will do the most effective work and will command the largest degree of public confidence. I urge honorable senators to devote some thought to the view which I have endeavoured to express, and to -help us to arrive at a decision upon the matter. </para>

            <para>- A certain line of criticism which was indulged in here by honorable senators appeared to indicate that their desire was to prevent too many fees of £5 5s. accumulating throughout the year. In the hope of meeting that objection, it was suggested that two of the members of the proposed Board should be paid a maximum sum. But I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> is not out on the economy "stunt" just now, and that the matter of the cost of the proposed Board is not being considered. In that case the suggestion made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> will fall to the ground. It was simply made with the object of preventing an unlimited expense being incurred. </para>

            <para>- That question has been already answered by the vote of the Senate. Even to those honorable senators who are out for economy, the Government proposal is the safer one. Under it, if there be much work for the Board to do, its members will be paid for that work. But if the Committee is of opinion that a limit should be imposed upon the amount to be paid in fees to two of the members of the Board, there is no objection to that limit being specified. Upon the other hand, should it be found as the result of experience that members of the Board have to devote the whole, of their time to the discharge of their duties, permanent appointments could then be made. The principle involved in the clause is not a vital one to the Bill, and I suggest that too much time should not be consumed in discussing it. </para>

          <para>. - I regret that I cannot support the amendment of' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton.</inline> Under other provisions of the Bill quite a number of duties are prescribed as having to be discharged by the Board. I do ' not know whether those duties were put in as a sop to the gentlemen who wish to deal with the profiteer or whether they merely represent political " eye-wash." But I am quite sure that the law officers who advised the Government" upon this measure are well aware that many of the functions allocated to the Board cannot be performed by it, because they are entirely <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the Constitution, and have been so held by the Privy Council. I shall deal more fully with the clauses in which they are enumerated when we come to them. But because the facts are as I have stated, this Board will not have anything like one-third of the work which honorable senators think it will. Of that I am convinced. A good deal more than two-thirds of the work which its members would have to perform if the Bill were effective cannot be undertaken if the measure proves to be defective from a constitutional stand-point. Consequently, I am of opinion that a salary of £1,250 per annum paid to permanent officials will be far more than adequate for the services which they will render. Payment for the actual work performed from time to time, at the rate of £5 5s. per sitting, would prove a much more satisfactory arrangement than would that proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton.</inline></para>

          <para>.- I desire to discuss the amendment from the stand-point of economy and efficiency. I listened very carefully to the arguments advanced in favour of the amendment from the point of view of efficiency, and I am not convinced that those arguments  were sound ones. I believe that we should get more efficiency from a Board constituted in the manner proposed by the Bill than we should from a Board created upon the lines laid down in the amendment. I am strongly opposed to the suggestion that the Board should be purely a departmental Board. At the same time, there is very little ground for the suggestion that if the clause be carried in its present form, two Melbourne gentlemen may be appointed to act with the  chairman,  and that that circumstance would prove prejudicial to the efficiency of the Board. I hold no such opinion.. I hold no brief for Melbourne;  but it is quite possible that this city is able to supply two of the best men who could be selected for the positions. From the point of view of economy, too, I am obliged to oppose the amendment, because I am sure that under its operation the work of the Board would prove much more costly than it would under the clause in its present form. I dp not anticipate that the Board will sit every day in the year or even half that time. </para>

          <para>. - I sincerely hope that honorable senators will give earnest consideration to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton's</inline> amendment before they proceed to a vote upon it. If the clause bc passed as it stands, the Board will be regarded as a Tribunal consisting of the  chairman  alone. If two business men are to be appointed to the Board, and are to be asked to attend only occasional meetings, for which they will be paid £5 5s. a sitting, they will not be able to give to the very important matters which it will have to consider the close attention that might be reasonably expected of them. In order to save a few hundred pounds a year it is proposed to set up a Board under conditions which will lead to its failing largely to achieve the object for which it is being constituted. I am not prepared te set my opinion on legal questions against that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> Brockman, but it seems to me that the  subsequent clause to which, he referred provides chiefly for inquiry and. advice. I know of no constitutional difficulties in the way of a Commonwealth Tribunal making inquiry into any matter of public interest. There is, of course, a limitation as to the evidence which a witness may be compelled to give, but the members of the Board may inform themselves in many ways, apart from the taking of direct evidence. In many cases the whole of the evidence may be given quite voluntarily. I am aware that there is a constitutional difficulty in the . way of compelling a witness to give certain evidence, but it does not necessarily follow that, because of that, a Board- of thes character must fail. I do not agree with the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> that this Board, if constituted as proposed in the amendment, would be regarded by the public as a purely departmental Tribunal, and that they would not have in it the confidence they would repose in a Board constituted as proposed in the clause as it stands. </para>

            <para>- I do not think the Government would make any such foolish appointments. The field of selection is so wide that I do not think they would select two junior Customs officers for appointment as members of the Board. May I ask the honorable senator how many junior officers of the Department of Trade and Customs are in receipt of a salary of £1,250 per year? Such a salary would be regarded as being among the plums of the Service, so that if the Government desired to make appointments from within the Public Service of the Commonwealth they would be able to draw upon all Departments. </para>

            <para>- Quite - so. For" such a salary, they would be able to obtain two very capable men from 'outside" the Commonwealth Public Service. If men who are actively engaged in business are to be appointed to these two positions, their duties as members of the Board' will so clash with their business that they will be performed in a very perfunctory manner, and the  chairman,  having far more information than either of them on the subject under consideration, will dominate them to a greater extent than he would dominate even two junior officers of his Department. </para>

            <para>- No, it is ,to include salaries and all expenses. With many other honorable senators I am anxious that we should curtail the growth of Commonwealth Departments. I remind the Committee that this Board is to he of a purely advisory character. It is not to have any administrative duties; it is merely to advise the Minister. Much has been said about the desirableness of "keeping politics out df this proposal, and of refraining from appointing public servants as members of the Board, yet it is the politician who is to determine what action shall be taken concerning every matter on which the Board has made inquiry and has reported. The report of the Board in every case is to proceed through the medium of the Minister to the Parliament, which is to have the final determination of the matter. Yet some honorable senators are anxious under this Bill to build up another Department which will be a huge expense to the taxpayers. Many honorable senators have said that they are prepared to accept their share of the responsibility of making inquiries and discharging duties of a purely advisory character such as would fall to the lot of this Board. The Minister has stated that the Board will sit only when required, but clause  17  provides that it shall have the right to sit when it likes. In due course, I think the Committee will have something to say in favour of the Board being allowed to sit only when directed by the Minister so to do, in order that it may be directly answerable to Parliament, and that Parliament may keep control of expenditure in matters of this sort. _ Viewing the Board as an advisory one, it is the duty of honorable senators at this juncture to curtail and keep control of the expenditures of the Departments, and until we do this we shall not have fulfilled the functions for which we are sent here. </para>

We are justified in going almost to any length to prevent the reckless extravagance of which the Government are guilty in connexion with this measure. There is no doubt that .the Board is only an advisory body. All it has to do is to take evidence, and report to the Minister, yet the Government are forming it on <inline font-style="italic">de luxe</inline> lines - lines of luxurious extravagance. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> suggests, it is to be a very luxurious Board. When the time arrives, I intend to move for the recommittal of clause  5,  so that we may constitute the Board of members of Parliament, who will do the work for their  £1,1300  a year, as they are quite willing to do. We know that there are members of this Parliament who are willing to- sit and exercise the functions of the proposed Board. </para>

He might have gone a little further. I am not like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benny</inline> in this regard, because I do not desire to ' ' curb the extravagance of the Government," since I believe the desire of the Government in these days is to be very economical. What I wish to do is to curb the possible extravagance of the Board itself, because clause  17  provides that the Board may meet when and as often as it likes. We shall be very wise to clip its wings in advance by limiting under this Bill, the amount that may be expended on it. The reasons I gave when dealing with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton's</inline> amendment are most applicable to this case. I then pointed out the constitutional limitations on the activities of the Board, which will very much reduce the amount of work that will be actually done by it. It oer.tainly will not be able to do as much as was evidently contemplated by the Government when they brought this proposal to Parliament. Consequently, I incline to the- opinion that probably £3,000 will be somewhere in the vicinity of what is required. </para>

            <para>- Looking at the honorable senator, I do not expect to do so.  His  proposal is to limit the expenditure of the Board to £3,000 a year. Following that, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benny,</inline> who is also from South Australia, spoke of the Board as being constituted on a luxurious basis. I have heard honorable senators declare to-day that £5 5s. a sitting is not enough, and that we shall not get the right stamp of men for it. If that is true, this is not luxury, but parsimony. </para>

            <para>- Probably some are not worth it. The Committee has. approved of the payment of £55s. per sitting to two members of the Board. Although it is not possible to say whether the work will require their attendance one or three days a week, I ask the Committee to consider the extreme possibility of there being three meetings a week. That is £15 15s. per week per member, or £1,800 a year for the' two, which, plus the £1,400 agreed to by the Committee for the  chairman,  will make a total of £3,200 for the year. Therefore, if the amendment is adopted, the Board will be bankrupt before it starts. </para>

            <para>- The Minister could and would help it,, and I decline to believe that the gentlemen appointed to the Board would meet merely to twiddle their thumbs and draw their fees. I am encouraged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman's</inline> remark, that he thought the amount was a little on the low side, to emphasize this point. Three meetings . a week until the Board can find its feet is not an exaggeration. There is a probability of it, so that £3,200 a year would go in salaries and fees, leaving nothing for a typist, or postage, or other ordinary expenditure. If the Committee thinks that a limit should be placed on the expenditure, it should leave a margin, not on the wrong side as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> but on the right side. </para>

            <para>- Then I will say that I prefer my own view to his. We must have some measure of faith in any institution or Government. We must give them some latitude. We cannot tie them down by dotting every " i" and crossing every " t." The question is whether the Committee, in view of the statements which have been made as to the purposes of the Board, is going to let it work effectively. If we limit unduly the amount to be spent on- it, we possibly curb it in some way or other. On the other hand, if we allowed it twelve months or two years, the amount it spent would not be likely to be very alarming, while the Minister would be given an opportunity to try the Board out thoroughly. Parliament would then know what work the Board had done, and what it was costing. When the Bill evaporated at the end of the time limit, and Parliament was approached to continue the existence of the Board or to substitute another method, Parliament would know exactly what the Board had done, and whether or not its work justified the continuance of the expenditure. The Government will be quite willing to accept a limit as to time, and I ask the Committee to be content with that. </para>

            <para>- The effect of carrying the amendment would be to tell a Board, which should sit three days a week, that Parliament had voted only enough money to allow it to sit twice or even once a week, and that, if the Board wanted the assistance of a typist, it could not have it, because Parliament had not made sufficient money available. I submit that it is much better that Parliament should be informed from time to time as to what is being expended; and, with a time limit; the Board could not possibly get out of hand before the Senate had a further opportunity of considering its constitution, expenditure, and efficiency. </para>

          <para>. -  I have listened to both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> and the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D.. Millen),</inline> and I agree with  both. I agree that there should be a limit to the expenditure, and also a time limit. We have to look for a precedent; and we find that in the conditions imposed on the Public Works Committee and the Public Accounts Committee, in regard to both of which Parliament has placed a limit on the expenditure. I say definitely that I am absolutely opposed to the proposed Board - :let there be no misunderstanding as to that-4-and if I had an opportunity I should kill it. If we do not place a limit to the expenditure we shall have an experience similar to that of the Inter-State Commission, which had all the functions of this Board, and which, £ am informed, cost about £100 a day to run. If we leave the matter perfectly open, so that the expenditure may be what the Board or the Minister desires, over a period of, say, two years, we shall have to face something that we shall not like. I think, in common with others, that there are far too many Boards for economy and for the good of this Parliament. We must shoulder our responsibilities as a Parliament, and the more Boards there are - many of which are beyond our control - the more responsibilities we shall have as the representatives of the electors. As I say, I am totally opposed to the Board, and I shall support the amendment. </para>

          <para>. - I feel that the psychology of the determined opposition to this Bill is, first of all, to be found in the necessity to bring up the Government with a " round turn," as it were, in connexion with the appointment of Boards which very largely function outside parliamentary control. A further opposition to the Bill has developed on the grounds of economy and of previous experience, which has shown us that the constitution of a Board or a new Department invariably brings in its train somewhat unnecessary expenditure. As an . illustration of what goes on, I have taken the trouble to ascertain some official figures in regard to the Quarantine Department, with which is now incorporated, or which is incorporated in, the new Health Board. It is obvious that the work of the Quarantine Department is somewhat spasmodic, and it cannot be said to be increasing, its work is entirely controlled by the incoming of certain diseases and the examination of all ships. In 1909-10, when this Department was first taken over by the Commonwealth, there was one permanent officer; in 1915- 16 the permanent officers had increased to sixty-nine; and in 1920-21 to 129. These, it must be remembered, constitute the permanent staff, and any extra work is done by calling in temporary assistance from outside. </para>

            <para>- Certainly not. I am merely pointing out, by way of illustration, how Departments grow, and how this particular Department has grown. In fairness, I ought to say that the growth of the permanent staff of this Department from sixty-nine in 1916 to 129- in 1920-21 is partly accounted for by the activities of the Commonwealth serum laboratories, which were established in 1916. Now, let us take the money side of this illustration. In 1909-10, when the Department was first established, the expenditure was £23,355, and the revenue was £4,724, showing  a net expenditure of under £20,000, and I understand that in 1909-10 the Department had to examine every ship and every passenger, apparently, coming to Australia, just as it does now in 1920-21. Now, so as to° get a .fair comparison, let us take the period 1915-16, when the Commonwealth serum laboratories were established. </para>

            <para>- No ; I am merely showing how the Department has grown, and I am taking these .periods so as to give a fair comparison. Li 1915-16 the expenditure by the Department was £103,112, and the revenue £19,242, showing a net expenditure of over £80,000, as compared with under £20,000 six years before. Now, take this year, when the necessity for economy is very much more vital, serious, and urgent than it was in either of the other periods. The estimated expenditure is £155,971, and the estimated revenue £35,000, showing an excess expenditure of £120,000. </para>

            <para>- My honorable friend will remember that the States were burdened with most of the expenditure on that account. In any case, the Quarantine Department, outside the laboratories, had the same work to do ten years ago as it has this year ; and yet there is nearly six' times the excess expenditure. That illustrates the point to which I am coming. Whenever Boards or new Departments are created, expenditure goes on, and cannot be controlled by this Parliament, because- very often the money is spent before it is voted. We are told the Bureau of Commerce and Industry costs about £10,000 a year. I do not know what the Institute of Science and Industry will cost, though, perhaps, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> may give us some idea of what we are committed to in that regard. </para>

            <para>- I think that some control should be placed on the expenditure of this proposed new Board, if we are to have one, and I admit that there is something to be said with regard to the desirability of it, at least for a time. I am glad to hear, for the first time, from the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> that the Government are now prepared to impose a time limit on the- operations of the Board. I believe it is as a result of the debates in this chamber last week that the Government now see the obvious, which is to consolidate all the varied activities under one strong Board of Trade, or, if honorable senators choose, one Trade and Tariff Board, and thus remove all those little "pin-pricks" now inflicted on the commercial community. Who knows, for instance, what is going on in connexion with the Coal Board? What money is expended on it? Who knows whether or not it is offering one section of coal consumers an advantage and placing a handicap on another? I confess I do not. I do see that some restriction should be placed on the expenditure of the proposed Board; and I shall support the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson.</inline> But, so far as the arguments of the Minister for Repatriation are concerned, I see that there is something in the proposal for a little higher limitation; but some limitation, there should be. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Major Oakley</inline>is deeply versed in all Tariff intricacies, and his experience during the last two years in connexion with the pros and cons of the present Tariff is absolutely unique in Australia. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Oakley</inline> is a good man, and I like to see a good man properly remunerated. That is my reason for desiring the salary to be at least £1,500 a year. In the past, some of the high officials in the Commonwealth Service have been inadequately paid; their salaries have been miserable compared with tha responsibilities of their positions. Surely to Heaven, this is just as important a position as that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stirling</inline> Taylor! </para>

Instead of taking, as it were, so many bites out of one problem, the Government ought to take the responsibility of introducing such a measure. </para>

          <para>.- I intend to support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> because this is the first opportunity we have had of definitely dealing with the expenditure of any Department. I believe the time has arrived when Parliament, if it has the opportunity, should say definitely how far it will go in the expenditure of any Depart- ' ment. I have given this matter very careful consideration, and I am not prepared to support a proposal which would affect efficiency or interfere with any effort to satisfactorily carry out important work. I remember the attitude adopted by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> and of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> in introducing the Bill, and in each case the members of each House were impressed with the statements made that the proposed Board would not be an expensive body, as the work would not be continuous. We were informed, that, in committing ourselves to a measure of this description we were not incurring the possible expenditure of a large sum of money. I intend to support the amendment because I think it preferable to" giving the Government an open cheque. </para>

          <para>. -  I am strongly opposed  to the  limitation which this amendment places upon the expenditure to be incurred by the proposed Tariff Board. As I have previously stated, the industrial and commercial activities of the Commonwealth are not confined to the city of Melbourne, or even to the whole of the State of Victoria, and I do not think a thorough investigation could be made by any Board sitting in this city. If the total expenditure is to be limited to £3,000 it will not be possible for the Board to conduct investigations outside what may be termed the inner circle of States. It would not be practicable, for it to visit the more remote States of Western Australia and Queensland, and investigations which did not include the activities of those States could not be regarded as complete or satisfactory. If this narrow limitation is imposed the Board will completely fail in the purpose for which it is to be created, and it will not be in a position to advise Parliament on the very many matters upon which information is desired. </para>

          <para>. -  I have listened attentively to the discussion, and I am sure that the Committee do not want to hamper the inquiries by the Board. I do not agree with a great deal that has been said concerning the need for granting extra money, and I am not in favour of the appointment of three permanent men. I do not see why' two business men, each receiving £1,250 a year, should be appointed when the Minister,' who should be well-informed, said that the members of the Board would not be required to sit more than two or three times a week. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D". Millen)</inline> has said that the Board may be required to sit three times a week at the outset, when the work is being organized. That may be so, but I direct  the attention of the Committee to the fact that the Tariff has been in operation for about eighteen months, and there have been no suggestions in this direction. Everything seems to be proceeding satisfactorily ^ without this extra expenditure. </para>

            <para>- Yes. I have not received any correspondence advocating the appointment of a Tariff Board. The commercial men of the  community  are not asking for the appointment of such a body, and I believe that they desire freedom of action as far as possible. I rose merely in response to the persuasive powers of the Minister for Repatriation who is, I believe, prepared to accept my amendment if the amount is increased to £4,000. </para>

The margin now allowed seems reasonably sufficient, and it cannot be said that by limiting the expenditure to £4,000 we will be paralyzing the Board before it commences. If it is found that the amount is exceeded, and that more money is required, say, for travelling expenses, the Government will have to consider whether they will approach Parliament  for a special travelling allowance, or compel the Board to stay at home. If it is the wish of the Committee, the Government will accept the amendment as amended. </para>

It will have a great deal to do. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> has said that he had not received any requests, from manufacturers or importers for such a Board; but the honorable senator must remember that the Board is to work in the interests of the people generally, and not only on behalf of one section of the community. The consumers of this country are clamouring for investigations concerning the prices charged for goods on which heavy duties have been imposed, and the object of the Board is to see that the people arc treated fairly. I can quite understand that the people to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> refers do not want any investigations. " </para>

If we desire an inquiry into the conduct of the different protected enterprises, and to protect the people against imposition, we should create a Board and hold the Government responsible for the expenditure in connexion with it. Honorable senators, ask the Government to accept responsibility for governing the country and then say that they shall not expend more than a certain amount. </para>

Unless the benefits conferred by the Tariff can be properly controlled Protection will be no good to the people of Australia. In order that the Protectionist policy may be a success there must be some tribunal, such as the proposed Board, to see that the people are not imposed upon, and that tribunal muss be allowed sufficient money for the purposes of its work. However, as the Minister has agreed to accept the amendment, I suppose I am only beating the wind by opposing it. </para>

The Board is to comprise three members who, no doubt, will be men enjoying the confidence of the Minister, the Parliament, and the country, and with such a Board the  chairman  should not be given a casting vote. According to the clause, he is to have a deliberative as well as a casting vote when only he and another member are present. I do not think that the vote of the  chairman  should dominate the other member in the absence of the third member. I see no necessity for giving a  chairman  of " a Board of three' a casting vote, and I shall vote for- the amendment in the hope that lie Government will see their way clear to strike out the whole of sub-clause 3. </para>

            <para>- Yes, so far as the Government can conceivably provide. Naturally, no man would be appointed who could not give satisfactory proof of his ability and assurance respecting his intention faithfully to perform his duties. The Board will be only advisory. A recommendation by the Board, whether unanimous' or reached upon the casting vote of the  chairman,  will not of itself do anything. Moreover, I take it that the Minister, upon receipt of a report, would require to be informed whether the recommendation submitted by the Board carried the indorsement of the whole of its members. If he were informed that a decision had been arrived at upon the casting vote of the  chairman  in the absence of the third member, and if he considered the' matter of great importance, he would surely require that it should be dealt with by the full Board. </para>

          <para>. - I had somewhat similar thoughts in mind when I discussed this measure with the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene).</inline> I would point out that this, the crucial clause of the Bill, has been divided, so far as concerns reference of matters by the Minister to the Board, into two portions; and that sub-clause 1 begins with the expression " The Minister shall refer to the Board," while sub-clause 2 begins " The Minister may refer to the Board." The difference - namely, the use of the word " shall " in one instance and of the word " may " in the other - is specifically provided at the desire of the Minister for Trade and Customs. The Minister is of opinion, so far as the matters dealt with in. sub-clause 1 are concerned, that the receipt of a report from the Board should precede Ministerial action. "With respect to those dealt with under subclause 2. however, the desire is that the Minister shall have discretion. Since the Minister knows the circumstances, and is familiar with the widely embracing and very technical work of his Department, I suggest that honorable senators defer in this instance to his expressed wishes. </para>

          <para>.- If it is not to be mandatory for the Minister to refer certain matters to the Board for inquiry, what is the necessity for this Bill ? I would not have supported it but that it  embraced  provision whereby the Minister should submit certain matters to the Board for inquiry and report. There is nothing in this clause which can take away from Parliament the right to move in any direction desired, either in regard to the operations of the Board or the actions of the Minister. Why should the Board be appointed and a specific range of matters set forth for reference by the Minister to it, if the Minister may act independently of the Board ? If the clause were to read, " the Minister may, in his discretion, refer to the Board " certain matters, the Bill would be Worthless. </para>

Under such procedure the Board would be higher than Parliament. </para>

            <para>- I cannot see that. In this clause, there is distinct discrimination with respect to the subjects to be referred to the Board. The matters covered . by sub-clause 2 are of a totally different character from those provided for in sub-clause 1. On the introduction of the Tariff, a measure of this kind was promised, in the hope that the Tariff would thus be made more acceptable to the Parliament. We were- told definitely that certain matters would be referred to the Board for inquiry, and not at the discretion of the Minister. I am glad that so many matters are set out in the mandatory portion' of the clause. In my opinion, the instruction should be direct to the Minister from Parliament to refer certain specified matters to the Board for inquiry and report. </para>

            <para>- No. The proposal to which it refers, and other matters, may legitimately, in certain circumstances, be referred to the Board; but, on the other hand, it may not be advisable to refer them to it. A proposal for the application of the British preferential Tariff or the intermediate Tariff to any part of the British Dominions, or any foreign country, might be the subject of negotiation between the Commonwealth and another Government, and it might be inexpedient to refer it to the Board; yet, as the clause stands, it would have to be referred. I- think that the referring of that matter, and of some of the others mentioned in the clause, should be at the discretion of the Minister. </para>

            <para>- I think that he can. If the dealings of a manufacturer . with his agents were open to inquiry by the Board, he would necessarily include in his contract of sale a provision that the goods purchased from him should be sold by the middleman at a reasonable profit upon the price which the latter had paid for them. We can just as easily insure that result as we can insist upon the manufacturer selling at a reasonable profit in the first instance. In the absence of such a provision, the entire object of the Bill will be defeated. Laws are passed for the purpose of controlling the dishonest citizen, not for the purpose of controlling, the honest one. If everybody would do the right thing, there would be no need for Acts of Parliament. The latter are intended to act as a deterrent to people who are prone to wrongdoing. If the manufacturers' responsibility is to cease the moment his goods leave his own factory,' what virtue is there in the Bill ? </para>

            <para>- I do not suggest that it will be possible to give effect to my amendment in cases in which only small quantities of goods are sold by the manufacturer. But merchants usually purchase in large quantities, and it will be quite easy for the manufacturer to insist that, in their distribution, the retailers shall be content with a reasonable profit. In. the absence of some such provision, what would be easier than for a manufacturer to sell his goods to a merchant at, say, a. profit of 10 per cent, upon the cost of production, and to agree to permit the merchant to make a profit of 50 per cent, or 100 per cent., which they should share between them? </para>

            <para>- Very largely. The Minister has power to instruct the Board to inquire into the question of whether a manufacturer is charging unnecessarily high prices for his goods. That presupposes that the purpose of the Bill is to prevent the public being exploited by the manufacturer, who- has been protected by the Tariff. In the absence of some such safeguard as that which I propose, the manufacturer would be able to charge exorbitant prices for his goods. I am aware that under our Constitution we cannot directly control the middleman. </para>

            <para>- The provision in the Bill is that the Board may be empowered to inquire into any instance in which a manufacturer refuses to sell to a particular individual. If my amendment be adopted, the manufacturer will not be : compelled to supply even £50 worth of goods to a retailer or merchant unless he has their assurance that they, in their turn, will sell those goods at a reasonable profit. I believe that tradespeople should be allowed to make a reasonable profit. But whilst affording every protection to the manufacturer against the competition of cheaper goods from the outside world, it is the duty of this Parliament to see that the general public are not robbed. </para>

            <para>- I cannot lay down any hard-and-fast rule. Considerable elasticity must be allowed. This Parliament cannot say what would be a reasonable price to charge for any article. -The question of the capital employed in the industry', the cost of the raw materials, and other factors, would require to be taken into consideration. Consequently the Board, in making its report, would have to exercise the widest discretion. I regard my amendment as a very important one, because if some effort be not made to. prevent the exploitation of the people, the Bill will prove ineffective. I recognise that if I were speaking in opposition to the amendment I could raise many objections to it. I could urge that it would be impossible to follow the goods into general consumption, inasmuch as they might change hands several times before they left Flinders-lane. Nevertheless, if protection is to be granted to the manufacturer, some endeavour should be made to protect the interests of the general consumer. </para>

In the first place, I think the retention of such a provision is of no use from a legal point of view, and that whatever pious hopes we may have that we shall be able to deal with the profiteer, we shall never really catch him; My second reason is that I object to the harassing of manufacturers and others by these methods. The best way to deal with the profiteer is to encourage competition. Where there is sufficient competition there is no profiteering.

            <para>- We all told the electors that we had not the power to deal with him, and yet with the object of destroying the profiteer we are proceeding in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> to set up machinery which must be entirely ineffective. We asked the electors to agree to an amendment of the Constitution giving us the necessary power to deal with the profiteer. We said that this foul fiend was rampaging over Australia, and that we desired to destroy him ; but that, in order that we might do so, the electors -themselves must agree to give us the necessary power. That is what the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> told the electors, and what we repeated all over Australia. Many people became very eloquent as they held up this bogy, which they then proceeded to knock down, and I think that in that way they got a lot of votes. The electors, in their wisdom, decided not to give the Parliament the power to deal with the profiteer, and we have not the power to-day to deal with him. In 1911, under the Royal Commissions Act, letters patent were issued to a Commission to inquire into the sugar industry. The Commission, acting under the powers conferred on it, called before it certain witnesses - directors and other officials of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. These officials refused to give the information that was demanded of them. It was in 1912 that the issue arose, and, after several appeals, the case went to the Privy Council, which decided that the Federal Parliament had not the authority to vest a Royal Commission with the powers of inquiry claimed in this case. We are now endeavouring to establish the same machinery for the same purpose, although the highest legal authority has already decided that no such power exists under  the Constitution of Australia. The original Royal Commissions Act, which, I think, was passed in 1902, purported to give certain powers of inquiry to Royal Commissions to whom letters patent were issued.' That original Act was not as wide in its terms as the Constitution permitted, and finally, in 1912, in order to get over the difficulty ;hat had arisen with the Colonial Sugar Defining Company, Parliament passed an amending Bill enabling Royal Commissions to make inquiry into and report upon matters specified in the letters patent, and which related to or were connected with " the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth," or any public purpose, or any power of the Commonwealth. There the exact wording of section 51 of the Constitution was followed. The powers vested in Royal Commissions under that Act were as wide as could possibly be granted under the Constitution, but the Privy Council decided that there was not the necessary authority under the Constitution to grant those powers of inquiry. In this case we are either  proposing to  give to this Board the whole power to make inquiries that is granted us under the Constitution or something less. We can grant no greater power than the Constitution itself gives. </para>

            <para>- I say deliberately that the power to inquire into profiteering still .remains with the States, and not with the Commonwealth. We must not forget that this is a Federation of sovereign States. Sovereign powers were vested in all the States, and they in turn surrendered a portion of their powers to the Commonwealth. Any power that is not set out in the Commonwealth Constitution is still retained by the States. The Commonwealth Constitution, as I understand it, does not give to the Federal Parliament the power to deal with profiteering. That position seemed to be clearly understood on the occasion of the last general election. If we had this power why did we ask the electors to amend the Constitution ? </para>

That being so,- he naturally desires to support any proposition purporting to deal with profiteering. Ministers may be honestly desirous of doing the same thing, but I do not believe in political " eyewash." Since" I do not consider that these powers will be effective, I do not believe in putting them in the Bill. There are many directions in which the Board within the limits imposed by this Committee can carry out very useful work. </para>

          <para>- BROCKMAN. - Under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> of sub-clause 1 as it stands, we have the Board armed with a big stick. It will shake it in the face of the little man who dare not fight it; but the moment it runs up against the big man - the man whom we want to get at - he will tell it to go elsewhere. If they endeavour to compel him, he will take them to the Court, and still refuse to answer, and fight them right up to the Privy Council. The clause will have the effect of harassing the little man and will be harmless to the big man. It will not effect the purpose for which it is designed. It will not enable effective inquiries to be made in order to ascertain if the big man is a profiteer or not. Let us therefore take it out of the Bill. Even if it were constitutional, I should still like to see it taken out, because I believe the best way to deal with the profiteer is by competition. </para>

            <para>- There may be no power to compel the manufacturer to give evidence ; but I take it that the Board will have no difficulty in obtaining all the evidence necessary to prove such a case if it exists. If it is found that unnecessarily high prices are being charged, simply because we, in our liberality, have highly protected the particular industry concerned, all that the Tariff Board can do is to report to the Minister. If the Minister recommends to Parliament an amendment of the Tariff so as to take away a portion of the protection which has been afforded to that industry, surely that is a reasonable, and, in fact, the only, course to pursue ? As regards action in restraint of trade, it may be possible for people who have, no scruples - probably they form a very small minority - so to act in restraint of trade as to prevent the necessary quantity of a particular commodity being distributed amongst the people in order to keep the price at a high level. </para>

            <para>- Is there a high Protective duty on wheat ? There may be many ways in which a manufacturer can operate to cause unnecessarily high prices to be charged to the consumer for his goods. The last sub-paragraph, regarding refusal to sell to any person goods to the value of £50 at current market rates, is most important. . It was included, I take it, with the object of insuring that the consumer should be able to obtain his goods at reasonable prices; that is, reasonable compared with the cost of manufacture. It is a wise provision; but I cannot agree to its present wording. Its only object must be to enable any person <inline font-style="italic">bonâ fide</inline> engaged in business to obtain his supplies direct from the manufacturer. In the majority of cases retailers are obtaining their supplies direct from the manufacturer in Australia to-day. In fact, in the great majority of cases any <inline font-style="italic">bonâ fide</inline> retailer can obtain from the majority of manufacturers the goods he requires if he will take them in wholesale quantities, but, unfortunately, there is a section of manufacturers who have barred and locked the door. </para>

            <para>- I draw attention to the fact that that is all the clause does; it does not follow that inquiries themselves will be 'followed by any action. All that is sought is authority to compel answers to questions put by the Board. Apart from his interpretation of the Constitution, I take it that the honorable senator is relying on the Privy Council decision in the case against the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. </para>

            <para>- I have no doubt that the honorable senator would have said much more but for the time limit. I desire to point out what appears to me to be the effect of the decision. As I read the decision, it does not say that all the inquiries were wrong ; but that the inquiry was wrong. It may be that out of a dozen questions, eleven may be within the competence of the person putting them, and the other one not. There are questions authorized in the Bill to which answers are required/ and which, I think, are undoubtedly within our constitutional rights. I do not suggest that there may not be hidden in the questions, here and there, some which might be held to be outside our power, and I am relying for support in that opinion .on the decision of our own High Court. Section 15b of the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906-1910, which I shall quote presently, seems to me to raise the whole point: Have we the power to press an inquiry to the extent of compelling an answer? The part of the Act which the section covers deals with monopolies, and the action taken, first, by inquiry, and ultimately by prosecution. It reads - 15b (1) If (l&gt;) the Comptroller-General believes that an offence lias been committed, against this part of  this  Act, or if a complaint has been made in writing to the Comptroller-General that an offence has been committed against this part of this Act, and the Comptroller-General believes that the offence lias been committed, he may, by writing under his hand, require any person (c) whom he believes to bo capable of giving any information in relation to the alleged offence to answer questions and to produce documents to Hum or to some person named by him in relation to the alleged offence. </para>

            <para>- In spite of the conflict between our own High Court and the Privy Council our Crown Law officers still regard the decision of our own High Court as sound law, and elect to stand by it. Putting that on one side, and recognising that the Privy Council is the highest authority, I still say there are certain questions which the Privy Council has not said we cannot ask. The Privy Council has said there are some questions we cannot ask, but there is still a wide field of questions on which neitherthePrivy Council nor any other Court has given any authoritative decision. We are giving a large . measure of Protection; and surely Parliament ought to have the right by inquiry to find out the  effect  of the operation of the Tariff? Parliament ought to be in a position to ascertain how far the purposes for which it imposed the Tariff are being achieved, or the contrary. To me it would seem a. violation of common sense to say that Parliament, having passed this Tariff, cannot collect the information necessary to enable it to ascertain whether or not it is achieving its purpose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> will admit that, at least, common sense is required. The honorable senator would be the last to say that Parliament should legislate, and, having legislated, should refrain from taking every opportunity to acquaint itself with the results of its action. Our own Law officers advise us definitely and clearly on the point. It may bo that some day a lawyer may arise and question the constitutionality of some Act, but in the meantime we have the assurance of our own Law officers; and, in view of the common-sense aspect I have presented, I trust honorable senators will retain in the Bill the provision which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> seeks to leave out. </para>

            <para>- I disagree with that interjection; Protection is for the purpose, primarily, of giving work to our own people by taking it out of the hands of foreigners. But I am not going to support or approve of any legislation in the direction of further price-fixing. The amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> in effect, seeks to follow the goods from the manufacturer to the wholesaler or distributer, and to do so from Cape York to the Leeuwin. I think the manufacturer may fairly say, if he is treating distributers in a reasonable way, " I am not my brother's keeper." Neither do I think it  legal or constitutional in any shape or form for this Parliament to interfere with the retail trade of the Commonwealth. It may be of interest to honorable senators to have an illustration of what may go on if we' approve of any grandmotherly legislation by means of this clause. </para>

            <para>- Yes ; I can give an illustration of what went on quite recently in the much-lauded but very ineffective State Profiteering Court of New South "Wales.. A little while ago that Court met, not for the first time, in nil the regalia at its disposal,  Avith  Judge, counsel, attendants, and so forth. On that particular morning the first case was one in which a firm was charged with having bought boots at 3s. 6d. a pair and resold them at 5s. lid., thereby allegedly making Sd. more profit that it was entitled to. These were children's boots, with white uppers, apparently, a fancy line. There was a solicitor and a leading barrister of the junior Bar retained for the defence, while the departmental officers, or so-called "Profiteering Inspectors," with another leading barrister of the junior Bar, appeared for the Crown - and all about boots which were alleged to have been sold at an extra profit of 8d. Toward? the end of the hearing a witness, who had been hurried over from Melbourne at the la3t minute, was called, and deposed that he sold these particular boots to the Sydney firm at 3s. 6d. a pair. In cross-examination, however, he went on to say that the boots formed part of an assigned estate, and that their value to the manufacturers at the time was 4s. 7d. On that evidence it immediately became apparent to the Court, and the learned counsel on both sides, that the Sydney firm had sold the boots at 5d. a pair under, instead of 8d. over the market price. The  President  of the Court, in the circumstances, decided that justice would be met by adjourning the case <inline font-style="italic">sine die,</inline> and the Department might, in view of the evidence disclosed, institute an inquiry into what was a fair profit for boot retailers to make. The result was that two barristers were engaged for two days, probably at £20 per day- that is £80 - and the solicitors' and other legal costs, which are usually approximate to those of the barristers, would be another £80, so that  it cost £160 to obtain the information that a retailer had sold boots at 5d. per pair below, instead of Sd. above, the proper price as was alleged. I may quote another illustration of what is going on in this much-boosted Labour Government Profiteering Court to show tha ludicrous position which legislation that some honorable senators support would lead to. An  inquiry  was held into a trade association which had already been twice inquired into, and in connexion with which no action had hitherto been taken. The  President  of the Court expressed the opinion that there was no charge against the trade association, but that the inquiry _ was merely to ascertain whether ils activities were contrary to the public interest. The association was originally represented by its honorary secretary, who was a business man engaged in the trade. The ' New South Wales Government secured the services of the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> with a junior barrister to assist him, and when the secretary of the trade association saw these legal luminaries arrayed against him he asked for an adjournment to obtain legal assistance, as he felt overawed by the talent confronting him. The case lasted three days, and the  President  of the Court then said that he would submit his report to the New South Wales Government. Although the inquiry was held several months ago, the report has not yet been made public, as presumably the  President  of the Court found that the operations of the association were quite legitimate. But this decision was arrived at only after three inquiries had been made into the operations of this organization. The cost to the Crown may be summarized approximately in this way : One King's Counsel, £50 for the first day, with two refreshers each at £30, making £110, and the juniors, who would receive, say, a total of £50. </para>

            <para>- I can agree with the honorable senator to some extent; but this Parliament has the power to conduct Tariff investigations, irrespective of decisions of the Privy Council and the High Court, or of the provisions of the Constitution. We can deal with Tariff duties up or down at our discretion, and Parliament should be informed if unfair advantage is being taken by those whom it is framed to protect. The clause may, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> suggests, be merely a pious aspiration; but we have the power to constitute a Board, or a Court of Inquiry, which will be effective. If the Board commenced an inquiry in connexion with the incidence of high Tariff rates, and those who are protected refused to answer questions submitted, they would incur the risk of Parliament reducing the duties, and thus effectively controlling their profits within Australia. That would, at all events, have a moral effect, and would assist in carrying out the intentions of the clause. </para>

          <para>. - I agree with the legal position submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> concerning our powers, or lack of powers, to compel witnesses to produce documents, or to give evidence before a Court of Inquiry. That was clearly proved in the case of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I also agree with the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen),</inline> who said that we should take a commonsense view, and for that reason I intend to vote against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman's</inline> amendment. Perhaps I may be able to submit a little additional information on the' matter by saying that, in the Sugar case, decided by the Privy Council, the whole industry was being inquired into, including the question of price-fixing. According to sub-paragraph i of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> of sub-cla.use  1,  the Minister shall refer to the Board for inquiry and report questions relating to the charging of unnecessarily high prices for goods. The object of that provision is not to punish the manufacturer for fixing unduly high _ prices, but to regulate the incidence of the Tariff, and if a manufacturer is guilty of charging unnecessarily high prices. Parliament can punish him by reducing the duties. That power is reserved to-' Parliament, because we can increase, re-. ellice, or repeal duties, and that is the chief intention in appointing a Tariff Board. We desire to give the Board power to see if injustice is being done to the consumers, and the duty then devolves upon Parliament of altering the* Tariff. </para>

          <para>. -  I am quite indifferent as to whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman's</inline> amendment is carried or not, because I believe that if the clause is amended as desired, it will have no practical effect. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of sub-clause 1 provides that the Minister shall refer to. the Board for inquiry and report matters relating to the necessity for new, ' increased, or reduced duties, and the deferment of existing or proposed deferred duties. We have already sufficient power in the preceding paragraph. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> contends that, although Parliament may find that the Tariff is being used for aiding and abetting the exploitation of consumers, we shall have no power to take, action. </para>

            <para>- Parliament will have the power, and duties can be amended, if desired. Parliament has the power to tenable the necessary information to be obtained upon which to come to a right decision. Quite a number of inquiries have been held in connexion with Tariff matters, and I know of only one instance in which there was a complete refusal to answer certain questions, or to pursue a certain course of action, and that was in connexion with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's case. What action did the Sugar Commission propose to take in that case? The company took exception to the proposal of the Commission to send an accountant - who, by the way, was a German - to the company's office with authority to go through the whole of the books and accounts, to make investigations, not only in connexion with its Australian trade, bub in regard to its operations outside Australia. The company, I think, very properly resisted. But in investigations such as this Board will be called upon to make, questions of that sort will not' be likely to Arise. It is my intention to vote against the amendment, although I hope that, later, the Committee will agree to strike out sub-paragraph" iv. of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">h,</inline> sub-clause 1. </para>

            <para>- After listening to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has said, I, as a lawyer, should welcome legislation of this kind; but I speak in this Chamber, not as a" lawyer, but as a senator, and in that capacity it is my duty to endeavour to protect the public, and not seek to profiteer at their expense. The Government appear to be attempting in this measure to deal with Combines. We were twitted by the Minister for Repatriation with the fact that we had supported a platform one plank in which was the protection of the consumer against exploitation, but I remind the Minister that the Constitution Alteration (Legislative Powers) Act of 1919, by which Ave sought  power  to effect that reform,  was  decisively rejected at a referendum of the people. Although it was provided that that Act should remain in force for only three years, the electors absolutely refused .to intrust to us the powers wc sought. I take their decision as a mandate to leave such matters strictly alone. This Bill is, in my opinion, an attempt to twist the power to impose  Customs duties into a power to deal Avith Combines in an underhand way. The electors having deliberately refused us permission to touch . such matters directly,  Ave  are  now  asked to flout their decision and carry out that portion of our platform in defiance of the people's wish. Having been refused by the people the enlarged" powers Ave sought, the Government now seek to establish control over the people who invest their capital in establishing manufactories while disregarding altogether the people who draw their business supplies from outside Australia. Had the proposed alterations of the Constitution been sanctioned by the people, Ave should have had power to treat every trader in the community on the same footing. Having been denied those powers, we can  now  deal only with the Australian manufacturers. </para>

            <para>- There may be power in another part of the clause to do that, but it cannot be done under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> of sub-clause 1. I do not know whether it is proposed under this Bill to have the Board question importers as to their business overseas, and the prices they pay for their goods in England. It seems to me that if that is so, then inasmuch as it has been held to be unconstitutional to question our own manufacturers, it must be even more unconstitutional to attempt to deal with outside  Combines.  The speeches of Senators Earle and Payne have indicated precisely the sort of difficulties into which we shall be forcing the manufacturers. Imagine compelling an unfortunate manufacturer, as soon as he starts in business, to make some special contract by which the purchaser shall not sell the goods, bought by him at more than a certain price. </para>

If the Board were investigating a report that a manufacturer had taken' certain action which bras considered to be prejudicial to the interests of the public, and if the manufacturer was asked what he had to say in rebuttal of the charge, and the latter said, " I refuse to give evidence," what would be the conclusion both of the Board and of the public? It could be no other than that the charge was justified. It would be in his own interest that a person undergoing examination should tender evidence, and he would do so. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">.- Senator Elliott</inline>is responsible for causing me to speak for the second time upon the amendment, in that he included <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> and myself as enemies of the manufacturers. I admit that he perceived his mistake in having said so, and that he partially withdrew the accusation. I am no enemy of the manufacturers. I have always been associated with the business section of the community, and I have always wished our manufacturing interests well. At the same time I recognise my public duty, not only to the manufacturing section, but also to the consumers. The honorable senator has evidently neglected to read the clause. He suggested that, immediately upon the passage of the Bill, a system of persecution would be launched against manufacturers by the Government, at the instigation of certain parties. This clause provides that the Minister shall refer to the Board for inquiry and report any complaint that a manufacturer is taking undue advantage-of the protection afforded ' him by the duties which Parliament has imposed. Before the Minister can act, complaint must be lodged. The Minister would not refer to the Board every paltry complaint. He must first be satisfied that the allegation is reasonable. </para>

            <para>- When the Bill becomes operative it will insure to consumers a fair deal. There will be no need to investigate the operations of a great majority of manufacturers. Parliament does not legislate for the majority. Laws are not passed to keep the majority of the people within bounds, but to cope with a minority which is not prepared to obey the law. Whether men are manufacturers or consumers, there are always those in the community who are prepared to take down their neighbours. Parliament must deal with persons of that class. If a manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the protection which has been given to him by the Tariff, it is right that the Minister should possess the power to institute inquiries about his conduct. The Tariff cannot be what we want it to be unless machinery is provided to make it beneficial to every section in the community. I hope that the amendment will be defeated. </para>

          <para>. - I support the amendment because I believe that all that is required is provided in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of sub-clause 1. I have listened with interest to the remarks of honorable senators about the constitutional aspect of the provision. Apart from that, however, the Bill would be more workable if paragraph <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> were deleted. No one need be afraid of the loss of any power, seeing that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> is inclusive of all that is necessary. I do not think that any section of the community should be held up as more sinful than another, and I cannot believe that the manufacturers are the only sinners in Australia. Therefore I shall support the elimination of this provision, by which we shall lose nothing and gain much. </para>

          <para>.- The Committee is indebted to its legal members for their speeches on this clause, though they have not done much to help us to protect the public. I shall vote against the amendment. Within the last few days it has come to my knowledge that an article which is sold by the manufacturer for 10s. 6d. is. retailed in the shops at 22s. 6d., an increase of 125 per cent, in price. I said to the manufacturer, "Why do you not sell your goods direct to the retail shops, so that the public may benefit by getting them more cheaply?" His reply was that he dared not do that, because a traveller from a wholesale house, on calling for orders at a shop, would be sure, on seeing his goods there, to ask where the retailer had bought them.. If the retailer said that he had got them straight from the manufacturer, the traveller would inform the wholesale house of the fact. Thereupon the wholesale merchant would tell the manufacturer that be  need not  send any more of his 'goods to him for sale at 10s. 6d., and would also tell the . retailer that he need not expect to -be supplied by the wholesaler, if he intended to continue buying direct from, the manufacturer. In this case there is practically a conspiracy against the manufacturer. </para>

          <para>. - I understand that the object of the amendment is to eliminate the whole of sub-paragraph iv, which was inserted by another place for a certain object. I could not support the retention of the sub-paragraph as printed, and for that reason I gave you notice, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that I intended to move an amendment. I recognise, however, that it is essential that some provision should . be made whereby a <inline font-style="italic">bonâ fide</inline> . retail trader -may have the right to purchase in wholesale quantities direct from the manufacturer the goods he requires for his business. In some cases he can do so. I know '.of many manufacturers from whom shopkeepers - some of them in a . small way of business - obtain their supplies direct in wholesale quantities. But there has grown up in Australia quite recently a practice under which manufacturers abso- ' lately refuse to trade directly with the retail distributers - the men to whom the general public have to go for their sup-' plies. The result, I am afraid, is that the consuming portion of the community have to pay higher prices than they would be called upon to pay if. the retail trader were able to buy direct from the manufacturer. That is the position in a nutshell. The sub-paragraph as it stands, however, would give any individual the right to -demand that a manufacturer should supply to him in -less than wholesale quantities the goods he wants. That would -be a foolish provision. We could not expect a manufacturer to supply to all and sundry the goods he manufactures in. the quantities required by individual consumers. Under such a provision a man might, require a manufacturer to sell him a half-dozen pounds of wire nails or a yard'- of flannel, </para>

My desire is to give the <inline font-style="italic">bonâ fide</inline> retailer the right to purchase direct from the manufacturer, ' so that- he maybe enabled, to distribute at reasonable rates, to the consumer,. I can- remember when, the merchants- of Melbourne- were quite fairly classed as importers, because- in those days they - particularly the softgoods merchants- dealt principally with imports. But the woollen mills of Australia now put all their, goods through, the wholesale warehouses.

Those much-talked of business ceatresYorkstreet, Sydney, and Flinders-lane,, Melbourne- deal principally with imported goods, and,, consequently, axe. largely outside, the ambit of the. manufacturer. Taking the whole of the manufacturing, trades of Australia,, most of their distributing is done direct as between the. manufacturer or. retailer, or through tha established State agencies of the manufacturer. When a manufacturer distributes through a wholesale house it is for one of several reasons. He is, perhaps, short of capital, and cannot send out  travellers, who can give the necessary credit "to the retailer, as is- done by the wholesale houses. - Another reason- may be that he gets a better net return by dealing with the wholesale houses; his working and' travelling expenses are less, and be can finance his- business on very much less capital than if he were doing a direct distributing business, </para>

            <para>-Yes, I had. much pleasure, as: a manufacturer, in. doing a satisfactory and friendly business with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> as a retailer twenty' years ago. There- has not been- the liaison between the merchant 'and the manufacturer so far as Australian- goods are concerned that the man in the street thinks there has been, because the wholesale merohantup to quite recently was primarily interested in imported goods, and the manufacturer was- struggling to displace them. Another feature of the incidence of the- sub-paragraph is- this-: Most  manufacturers now, to be successful;  must  do an Inter-State business. ' A manufacturer in New South Wales will have his agents in Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and, possibly; Tasmania. The same thing will  occur  with a manufacturer here; or in South Australia, and that Inter-State business as a Tula is carried on through accredited agents, who are given a small overriding commission on all the business; done through their States. In some cases they guarantee accounts, and inall cases they care for the business done within the State for the firm. The sub-paragraph is absolutely unworkable, and unfair to' the  manufacturer, and suggests what I most strongly resent - that ' the Australian manufacturer is not giving a fair deal to the retailer. As a matter of fact, he lives by the retailer. </para>
