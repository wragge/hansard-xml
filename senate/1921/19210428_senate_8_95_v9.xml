                <para class="block">I have not been able .to see all the members of the Senate in connexion with this proposed alteration of the order of Government business, or to speak to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> concerning it. My object in submitting the motion is to consult the convenience of honorable senators in the discussion of a very important principle, namely, the incorporation of the Army Act in the Defence Bill, and also in the Air Defence Bill. The Army Act is proposed to be incorporated directly in the Defence Bill and indirectly in the Air Defence Bill by the incorporation of the Imperial Air Force Act in that measure. It has occurred to me that as there is a difference of opinion on the application of the Army Act to our Forces, it would be better to have- the discussion on the Defence Bill, in which it is applied directly. If honorable senators, in considering the Defence Bill in Committee, indicate by their vote that they are against the direct incorporation of the Army Act in that Bill, the Government will be justified in assuming that they are also opposed to its incorporation indirectly in the Air Defence Bill. </para>

                    <para>.- I am not quite clear as to the meaning of paragraph (b). I should like to know whether "professional" qualification means a "military" qualification. If so, I intend to move to insert after the word "professional" the words "other than military." I have very great objection t o power being given to promote, as prescribed by regulations, whatever they may be, any officer who is said to possess professional qualifications, if by that is meant military qualifications, because officers may come from abroad and receive appointments to high rank in our Forces over the heads of our own men. </para>

In connexion with that it might be necessary to have a legal corps, so that officers appointed <inline font-style="italic">to it</inline> would receive their commissions because of their professional, not their military qualifications. Paragraph (a) deals with those who may possess civil professional qualifications such as would be necessary for appointment to a veterinary corps, a medical  corps, or similar corps. In appointments to the Army Medical Corps, for instance, a, doctor is given rank at once. He is not required to pass a military examination. These amendments are required te cover this class of cases. In order to understand their effect, honorable senators will do well to peruse the memorandum which I have had prepared and circulated. Some corps may be of a semi-military character, like the tunnelling or mining units established during the war. Officers appointed to that unit were given rank not because of military qualifications at all. For instance, Professor David, of the Sydney University, was given a commission. </para>

                        <para>- One could hardly describe Professor David's qualification as a civil qualification. In like manner, we have the Railways Commissioners as members of the Railway Council, and members of their staffs are given commissions in the railway unit, not because of their military qualifications, but because of their civil or professional knowledge. A civil qualification, I take it, is an occupational term, and so railway officers would be regarded as possessing civil or professional qualifications. </para>

                    <para>.- Undoubtedly the word " professional," as it stands in paragraph (6) might be taken to mean a military qualification, and, if so, the whole idea of making appointments by means of competitive examinations might be done away with. It is possible I am mistaken ;. but looking at it from the legal point of view, it seems to me that the paragraph is dangerous unless it is interpreted to mean a person with professional, apart from military, qualifications. </para>

                    <para>.- The only reason for the amendment of the principal Act, which is proposed in this clause, is that the recent war was really a war of machinery and science, and it has shown the necessity for the insertion of the words to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> has directed my -attention. A well-equipped modern army contains mining units, a geological section, a tunnelling force, railway units, and chemical units, the last named being employed in the manufacture of gas, though not the kind of gas to which we are accustomed here: For a man to be in charge of any of these corps it is not necessary that he should possess military qualifications, but it is essential that he should possess special scientific, professional, or civil professional qualifications. Take, for example, the head of the goods transport section  of the Railway Department, and a professional geologist. It may be correct to say that the railway officer is a civil professional officer, but one could hardly speak of a professional' geologist as a civil professional officer. </para>

The purely military class is dealt with in the first sub-clause, which defines how they may get their commissions. Then the Army Medical and the Army Veterinary Corps are' dealt with. These are provided for in the civil professional class. Then follows the non-commissioned officers, and in the fourth class there might be included a JudgeAdvoca'teGeneral or a legal officer, their qualifications being legal instead of military. </para>

                    <para>. - The clause, as it stands, seems to be entirely analogous to the preceding clause. Consequently, a man connected with the veterinary corps cannot be said to be a military man, because his work is not of a military character. But he may obtain his promotion because of his appointment to a position to which a civil professional qualification is attached. The danger with which we are confronted does not lie so much in the clause itself as in the provision for legislation by regulations. If we leave the position undefined in the Bill, we shall give a wider scope for the framing of regulations. </para>

The proviso, if adopted, will follow another proviso which distinctly deals with military appointments. Its meaning might be made quite clear by transposing it so that it would immediately follow the first proviso dealing with scientific appointments. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no objection to the adoption of the course which has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford.</inline> It would certainly make the clause clearer. Both provisos deal with the appointment of officers. I always hesitate to accept drafting amendments suggested hurriedly in the course of Committee discussion. The point under review is a matter of drafting. I suggest, therefore, that the clause be agreed to as it stands, whereupon I will ask the draftsman to give attention to the criticism now raised. There may be good reasons for the present sequence, although at first blush it would appear that a transposition would be advantageous. </para>

                <para class="block">My object is to give additional rights to officers serving in the Forces. I have already dealt at some length with the need for such a provision. In the section which I seek to amend, provision is made that an officer shall not be removed from the Force's without being given a chance to ascertain the nature of the charge against him, and he is provided with an opportunity to show cause why he should not be removed. I desire to confer ona superseded officer similar rights in every respect. If an officer is to be dismissed, it is reasonable and just that he should be told why. But a far greater evil is sometimes caused by an officer being superseded without explanation. He may be told, indeed, that it is the custom of the Service. He is sometimes told that there is nothing which can be brought against his capacity to command or his courage in the field. Yet he is superseded by men who are manifestly "wasters." I will give an instance of the kind of thing that happens under the Army Act. Albert Jacka, who won his Victoria Cross at Gallipoli, was the first to secure the distinction, which was followed shortly after by the granting of a commission. He was always foremost in the fights of his battalion on the peninsula. Later, he proceeded to France, where he repeatedly distinguished himself, and his name will be seen in despatches up to March or April,  1916.  After what was known as the first battle of Bullecourt there was a strange silence, as his name was not mentioned in the promotion or decoration lists or despatches, although he was constantly at the Front and participating in the fighting as before. He led dozens of desperate charges, he was worshipped by his men, and, notwithstanding this, officers were repeatedly placed over him. The position became so critical that men in Jacka's battalion refused to go into action unless under his command. Honorable senators may think that is an astonishing statement; but it is an, absolute fact, and one which has been substantiated by  Colonel Peck  of the Instructional Staff and by Jacka himself. What is the reason that such a cruel embargo has been placed on Jacka? He is known by men associated with the Australian Imperial Force as the bravest of the brave. He may be somewhat rough in his manners, because he was a fencer before the war; but I absolutely deny that there can be applied to him with any degree of truth the statement made by many British officer's, that ' ' Australians were good fighters, but that socially they were impossible." The facts are these : The result of the first battle of Bullecourt was cabled to Australia as a great victory, but as a matter of fact it was the most disastrous engagement in which the Australian Imperial Force took part.Honorable senators will doubtless recall that the British Tank Corps under the direction of General Monash proved a brilliant success, because it was scientifically and properly controlled. General Monash never sent tanks into action without protecting them with an artificial fog of phosphorescent smoke and shell-fire. The tanks went into action fully protected, and General Monash even had aeroplanes buzzing up and down above to confuse the enemy listeners. But the position was somewhat different when these operations were conducted by General Birdwood and General White, who, instead of providing an artificial fog, sent the tanks forward when the ground was white with snow, so that every tank stood out like a nigger on a whitewashed fence. Before General Monash assisted in re-organizing the corps it was manned and officered in a most amazing manner. When the tanks were first allotted to the Army, those who were to control them scratched their heads and said, " We have not seen these things. To  what branch of the Army- do 'they belong?" They ultimately discovered that motors were installed in the tanks, and that as the only other motors in use were in the Army Service Corps they classified the Tank Corps as a branch of the Army Service Corps, and detailed drivers of that corps to control them. The type of men who volunteered at a critical time in our Empire's history to drive motors in the Army Service Corps were looking for a good soft job, and it' was to their utter horror and amazement that they were transferred from a cosy billet into a most nerve-racking job. Those who understand the position realize that as a result of a single direct hit a person driving a tank would not be killed outright, but would be slowly burned to a cinder as a result of an explosion of petrol. When these officers and men of the Army Service Corps found' that they were detailed for this work without the protection of a smoke screen, and were showing up like niggers on a fence, they were absolutely panic-stricken. On this occasion thirteen tanks set off, but only one went into action ; and there was strong suspicion' that the men controlling some of the others had poured sand into the motors. One eventually got through  the  lines and cut the wires; and through that breach the devoted men of the Australian Imperial Force streamed and forced their way out like a fan until the Germans made the discovery, when they sent down a heavy barrage over the gap and attacked from both flanks. Reinforcements or ammunition could not be sent to their assistance, for, as I have said, only one tank did its job. One of them suddenly blundered into a sunken road in which the members of the 14th Victorian Battalion were waiting to attack. The man in charge was so utterly panic-stricken that he turned his guns on our own men, and at a range of 5 or 10 yards killed at least thirty. It was said at the time that if the men had had a tin-opener they would have murdered the man who was responsible; but he was inside the tank. Albert Jacka was the Intelligence Officer of that battalion, and as he is now in Melbourne he can be questioned. Jacka prepared a war diary which is absolutely sacred, because it gives the history of his unit. He recorded the details of the time and place, and a copy was sent to General Birdwood, who sent for Jacka and said, " You must destroy all your notes of this occurrence. You will destroy every copy of your report sent to Horseferry-road, so that every trace of the incident will disappear." General Birdwood assembled the battalion on parade, and congratulated the men on their magnificent bravery. He said, "You have fought like demigods. I am sure you will not be unwilling to share the glory with the magnificent men- of the Tank Corps." Colonel Peck said that it required a great effort to prevent those men from rushing General Birdwood and hooting  him off the' ground. </para>

                        <para>-  I rise to a point of order now that the honorable senator has come to a reference to the amendment he proposes. I should have done so before, but it might have been thought that I desired to prevent the honorable senator indulging in his reminiscences. He has given notice of a new clause to amend section 16 of the principal Act. The Bill before the Committee does not deal with section 16, and yet the honorable senator is seeking to tack on to clause 7 of the Bill, which deals with section 11a of the principal Act, an amendment of section 16 of the Act, which deals with an altogether different subject. I submit that the honorable senator's - proposal is an offence against the standing order, which says that amendments must be relevant to the subject-matter of the motion before the Chair. The Senate, through the Standing Orders Committee, has made provision <inline font-style="italic">lo</inline> enable honorable senators to do in the proper way what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> is trying to do in the wrong way, by giving an instruction to the Committee on a Bill. It is provided by standing orders 328 to 333 that if in an amending Bill it is desired to amend  sections of the principal Act which are not dealt with in the Bill, an honorable senator, after the second reading of "the measure, may move that it be an instruction to the Committee on the Bill to consider sections of the princi- ?al Act which are not dealt with by it. f <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> desired the amendment of section 16 of 'the principal Act, his proper course was to have availed himself of the standing orders provided for the purpose, and have an instruction given to the Committee to consider sections of the principal Act not dealt with by the Bill. Having failed to adopt that course, I contend that the honorable senator cannot now, by 'tacking an amendment on to a clause of this Bill, dealing with one section of the principal Act, amend a section of that Act which is not before the Committee, and which deals with a matter foreign to the section of the principal Act which is sought to be amended by the clause before the Committee. If my point of order is sustained <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott's</inline> amendment must be ruled out of order; otherwise it would be quite unnecessary for us to have standing orders enabling an instruction to be given to the Committee on a Bill. </para>

                        <para>-  My point of order is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott's</inline> amendment is not relevant to the Bill, and it is the Bill and not the principal Act that the Committee is considering. The section of the Act which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> is seeking to amend is not dealt with by the Bill. The section of the Act which it is proposed .to amend by the clause now before the Committee is section 11a. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> is seeking to introduce an amendment of section 16 of the principal Act, which is not brought under the consideration of the Committee by this Bill at all. I haVe pointed out that when an amending Bill is presented and an honorable senator desires to bring up for consideration sections of an Act which are not dealt with by that Bill, he must, under the Standing Orders, take the course of moving, after the second reading of the Bill, an instruction to the Committee on the measure to deal with the matters which in his opinion should be considered. The honorable senator should have adopted the course provided by the Standing Orders. </para>

If the section which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott's</inline> proposal will amend is not dealt' with in the Bill, that might be a good reason for the' introduction by the Minister for Defence of an amending Bill to deal with that section, but it is not a good reason for refusing to consider an amendment dealing with the question of promotion which is opened up by the clause now under consideration. </para>

I admit that I was quite unaware of standing orders which would prevent an honorable senator dealing with any section of an Act which a Bill has been introduced to amend. If there are standing orders which prevent honorable senators dealing with sections of an Act other than those which are dealt with in a Bill submitted to the Senate, I consider that the difficulty has been overcome by the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has had his amendment printed and circulated from the beginning of the consideration of this Bill, and before the passing of the second reading. </para>

                    <para>- I want honorable senators to clearly understand that my remarks this afternoon were based, in the main, on statements made to me by officers. I cannot, of course, vouch for their absolute accuracy, as I had no means of investigating . them. I only know that the statements made to me by  Colonel Peck  were confirmed by Jacka, and that the essential fact to be borne in mind is that, whereas Jacka, up to a certain stage in the history of the Australian Imperial Force, was marked out for rapid advancement and decoration, he suddenly disappeared from the ken of the military gazettes, although he was fighting all the time in the front line. The Minister may deny these statements, or say that even if they are correct they do not show that General Birdwood was responsible. If this is so, it is advisable that, if ever we send 'our men away again, the officer in command of them should have very wide powers to refuse to carry out any manifestly impossible orders.I have heard it stated that General Birdwood knew that the action to which I have referred was hopeless from the beginning, but, nevertheless, it had to be carried out. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to discuss General Birdwood's character on this measure. I say that an officer can and should protest if called on to attempt impossible attacks. I have done so on two occasions. I received orders to make an attack which was manifestly impossible. Being in the front line with the men, I could see it was impracticable, so I rang up my divisional commander, and said, " You are ordering me to do the impossible. If I am to carry out your orders, I want you to send them to me in writing, to relieve me from all responsibility, and also to relieve me from my command in the event of the. order having to be carried out." I know that time after time officers were damned because they were compelled to carry out orders that were utterly impossible, and I may point out that Marshal Foch has laid it down that no general should order his troops to attack until every battalion commander in the front line is satisfied that the attack will be successful. After all, the men who are the best judges are those who are on the spot, not men 25 and 30 miles back from the front lines in a magnificent chateau, and with the fat of the land available to them. As a rule, they know nothing about the position in the front line at all. However, I will leave this subject now, and confine myself to the amendment. </para>

                <para>This power to supersede disheartens and disgusts officers. Yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that two officers who were senior to me had also been superseded, but had raised no objection. . That statement was absolutely false. I do not say that the Minister knowingly made a false statement, but it was false, nevertheless. General McNicoll, one of the officers referred to by the Minister is my oldest friend in military and civil life. In fact, I selected General McNicoll to join the Australian Imperial Force. I knew what a magnificent officer he was. He was in the Reserves at Geelong and I said to him, " Look here, Mac, I have been appointed to a battalion command. Will you come as my second ? " He said " Certainly." And so we went away together. We both fell early in the war- I was shot at the landing, and he a few days later, only whereas my wound was comparatively slight, and I was able to get back into the field again within four weeks, he was shot through the stomach; and the bullet went into the thigh nailing his pelvis to his thigh joint. The result was that he had to face six very painful and difficult operations, and for months was at death's door. The King took such an interest in his case that he sent the Duke of Teck to present General McNicoll with the D.S.O., because it was believed then that the final operation would be fatal. However, he was tremendously tough, and after the operation had given him relief, he was soon on his feet again, though permanently lame, and was able to resume his duties. At about this time the 3rd Division was raised, and 'he was appointed to the command of a. brigade. By some accident - I do not know how H happened - McNicoll's promotion to a full colonel was dated one month antecedent to my own, although I started out as a colonel and he as a major, and, as I have shown, I had been fighting almost continuously whilst he was in hospital. When the orders came out I said to him, "Mac, this is not fair; I have to salute you now, and take your orders." In 'his reply he said, " Yes, it does seem funny, and if you care to make representations, I shall be satisfied to have the matter put light." I approached General Birdwood, but he absolutely refused to make any alteration, although it was easily within his power to have the date altered. </para>

                    yesterday said that General McNicoll raised no objection to supersession; and his statement is absolutely, false. By a strange coincidence, I found a letter from General McNicoll on my table last night, written from Goulburn, New South Wales, and the following is an extract : -

                <para class="block">The latter sentence is a reference bo our joint protest made at the -time, for, like myself, he felt it hard that he should have been superseded by  General Gellibrand. He saw General White, who said, " General Gellibrand has been in the field all the time, while you have been in hospital, so he. has very much more experience." General- White quite suppressed the fact that during the major portion of the time General Gellibrand was at Salisbury Plain, in England, though he fought at Pozieres and  Bullecourt,  and in several intermediate and minor engagements, while General McNicoll went through the great Messines1 Ridge engagement under General Monash, and fought through the bitter and successful battle of Polygon Wood, also at Passchendaele. As a matter of fact, it was his brigade that was chiefly responsible for checking the  Germans on the Somme in the first in. stance in March, 1918. Therefore he had all the latest information as to successful attacks ; but all this was brushed aside. After his unsuccessful interview, McNicoll came to me and said, "What can we do? Can we write a joint letter to the Minister?" Now, I am a lawyer, and so I said to him, "Look here, , you will have both of us court martialled if we do that. We are each at liberty to write a letter to the Minister, but if we write a joint letter to him we shall bo guilty of mutiny." </para>

                        <para>-  I think I can do that. In support of the amendment which has been submitted by my gallant and distinguished friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> an illustration has been drawn from the 'battle of Bullecourt which he has described as one of the greatest disasters in the war.. I happened to be in that battle, and his description of it may to a certain extent be justified, though other descriptions have been applied to it by very distinguished officers in the British Army. In that battle .1 was in command of the 16th Battalion, which was a portion  of  the 4th Brigade. The 14th Battalion, to which  Deference  has been made, was also a portion of that brigade. As a matter of fact, in this particular attack that battalion was on the left of my own. My battalion went into that action with a strength of 870 other ranks, and of twenty-three officers. We came out of it with a strength of three officers and eighty-seven of other ranks. I have very good cause, therefore, to remember moat of the incidents connected with that battle, which took place on the 11th April, 1917. It is true that the tanks and the Tanks <inline font-style="italic">Corps</inline> were so rottenly officered in those days' that they were a complete failure in that particular battle. It is true that a number of the officers in those tanks behaved in such a way as to call forth a very strong protest from Captain Jacka and other officers. When the operation was over, Captain Jacka, in his capacity as Intelligence Officer to his battalion, put in a report to his -Commanding Officer,  Colonel Peck.  Mv own Intelligence Officer, Captain Wadge, also put in a report which was upon very similar lines. These reports were pretty strong, and  Colonel Perk  and I' were engaged in drafting reports when we, received them. We did not follow the usual course of simply forwarding those intelligence reports to the higher authorities. The complaints and charges which they contained were so serious and far-reaching a character that we decided that it would not be a fair thing to allow two of our juniors to put their -names to them. Accordingly we drafted a report which we both signed. The .next day the Divisional Commander saw me, and said: " This is the strongest thing in the way of a military report that I have ever seen. I want you to consider most carefully whether it should go forward or not. Can you substantiate everything that is in ' it, because if you cannot it may mean very serious consequences to you officers who signed it?" We stuck to our guns, and asked that it should be forwarded. Upon the day after we had withdrawn from the line at Bullecourt General Birdwood came down, saw the 14th Battalion and my own battalion, and addressed .them. He also delivered a message which he had received from, the Army Commander. The Army Commander's message stated that what was accomplished upon the occasion in question by the 4th Australian Brigade was the* most wonderful feat of arms in the history of the war. He finished up by congratulating the Tanks Corps upon their success. All the High Command at that time believed that the tanks had been a success, because a report had been sent in by the Senior Tanks Commander claiming that they had done everything that they had been ordered to do. As a result, all the members of the Senior Command thought that the tanks had been successful in doing what they were set to do. It was not until the reports written by  Colonel Peck  and myself were received by General Birdwood that he realized that the report which he had received from the Tank Corps was incorrect. He had not received our report at the time that he addressed the troops. I happen to know that General Birdwood put up the most strenuous opposition to this particular battle, both to the Army Commander and the General HeadQuarters. </para>

                        <para>- BROCKMAN . - General Gough. A comparison has been drawn between the action of the' Tanks Corps when controlled by General Monash and its action when controlled by Generals Birdwood and White. However, this particular battle was . not, as suggested, designed by General Birdwood or General White. It was designed by the General Head-Quarters, and the orders were sent down through the usual channels to the 4th Division, and particularly to the 4th Brigade, to carry them out. After I had personally seen the situation I realized that it was pretty hopeless, and at the eleventh hour I sent a protest, which, with the assistance of General Birdwood, went right up to the General Head-Quarters. ' The reply was that the designed action had been most carefully thought out, and that we would do just what we were told to do. We did so, with the results which I have mentioned. It will be seen, therefore, that my gallant and distinguished friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Elliott,</inline> is not quite right' when he draws a comparison between ' the tank actions which were designed by General Monash - and which were wonderful, I admit-t-and the tank actions which were designed by General Birdwood. </para>

                        <para>- Precisely. I am sure that the honorable gentleman did not mean to be unfair, but he has certainly been misinformed. I do not doubt that Captain Jacka is under the impression that his report upon these operations was sent forward. But I can assure the Senate that it- was not, and that the report which did go forward was that which was signed by two com- ' manding officers of the brigade, which I have mentioned, because we did not think it fair to hide ourselves behind the skirts of our Intelligence Officers "when such serious allegations were being, made. We demanded that an inquiry should" be held .into the whole thing. But it was never held. The insinuation that Captain Jacka was penalized on account of this action is certainly based upon false premises. </para>

                <para>I wish to add that nobody has a greater admiration for Captain Jacka than myself, and I wish to say, further, that he is a personal friend of mine. It has been suggested that Captain Jacka, on account of this particular incident, was superseded in respect to the command of the 14th Battalion. I was very closely associated with the 14th Battalion and its history during the whole of its operations in France. I was either a battalion commander alongside it or was . commanding the brigade of which the 14th was one of the battalions. Captain Jacka was never superseded in my time; but what did happen was this: Senior officers from outside the battalion, who were available and fit for promotion, were brought in to command the 14th Battalion. I do not know whether honorable senators realize that it was only in the early stages of the war that strict regimental promotion was observed. It was thereafter found that on account of the rapid decrease of officers there would be left ' very often only a junior and inexperienced officer in a battalion. It was deemed necessary, therefore, to bring in officers from other units, who were experienced and, in other respects also, qualified to take command of the battalions in question. So the principle became established - and, I think, rightly so- that the whole of the officers of the Australian Imperial Force should be regarded as being upon one regimental list. </para>

                        <para>- No. I may be allowed to illustrate the facts from my own experience. I was away for' some months owing to a wound, and, while thus' compulsorily absent, fifty-six men. were promoted over my head. Incidentally, I would like to add, I subsequently superseded all but six of those officers; and, if the war had gone on long enough, I am conceited enough to think that I would have superseded those siz others also in due course. I am trying to show how the principle grew of appointing officers from outside, and to indicate - since the illustration has been specifically advanced - what happened in the case of Captain Jacka. That officer never got beyond the stage of a captain in his own battalion. And I think I am right in saying that at no time was he. superseded by any officer in his own battalion. If it can be said that he was superseded by  Colonel Peck  - a very distinguished and capable officer, who took over the command of the battalion - then Captain Jacka was indeed superseded. If it can be said that he was superseded by  Colonel Smyth,  similarly, then obviously such was the case. If it can be said that he was superseded by the appointment of  Colonel Crowther  to take the command of the battalion, then again it is self-evident that Captain Jacka was superseded. But all these three were senior officers, and two of them, to my own knowledge, were experienced, and wholly capable to command. Captain Jacka was at best a company commander. The other officers were majors or colonels, and were specifically appointed to command the 14th Battalion. Such appointments were in the nature of a universal practice throughout the Australian Imperial' Force, and it was a procedure which was in every way proper. Why should a man in the " X " battalion find himself promoted in a few months from the rank of second lieutenant to that of colonel because the officers above him happened to have been killed, while a major in the "T " battalion should be compelled to continue in that Tank during the whole war merely because his colonel did not chance to have been killed ? </para>

It has been suggested that he was penalized because he had the courage - and it will be admitted by every one that he had a superabundance of that quality - to set down  on paper what he observed on the 11th April, 1917. But he had for his battalion commanding officer  Colonel Peek,,  one of the officers -who had been brought in over his head, and who possessed enough backbone to say; " I will not hide behind Captain .Jacka, but -will take the responsibility for this report myself."

The section of the Act which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> proposes to amend is not brought within the scope of the Bill as it stands.

                    is now proposing the insertion of words therein which will introduce a subject entirely foreign to the section. That is to say, he desires to include, in a reference to the cancellation of commissions, the matter of supersession. It may be desirable from his view-point; but, if he were to succeed, hopeless confusion would result, and a state of affairs would be brought about in our legislation for -which no Government could be responsible.
                </para>
                <para>I now come to the question whether the Committee should deal, in the manner suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> with the subject of supersession. First, that matter is determined not by seniority, because all promotions above those on the regimental list - as indicated in the cases quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> - are determined by selection. If the amendment is agreed to, the effect will he  that in a section of our Defence legislation dealing with cancellation of commissions, there will -be a- provision that, before any. supersession can be given effect to, any officer and all officers who are to be superseded shall have the right of -having their cases gone into in writing, so that no supersession can take place until their complaints have been dealt with. I ask honorable senators to imagine what it would mean in the cases of those fifty officers among the fifty-six who superseded General Drake-Brockman, and whom, again, he subsequently superseded. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, an armistice, or even a prolonged postponement of the  conflict, until we had settled the quarrels which, apparently, are plentiful even on the field of battle. I do not know whether the cases which have just been quoted are correct or otherwise; but I can imagine the distraction of commanding' officers who may be carrying on operations attended with frightful loss of life. Honorable senators should try to picture these commanders turning aside from their efforts to conquer the enemy in order to inquire into the circumstances of officers who complain of having been superseded. Let us take the very instance quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> and substantiated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> namely, the incident having to do with the mismanagement of the tanks at Bullecourt. Let us suppose that the officer commanding said, in the very midst of the battle, "  Colonel Jones  is to take the place of  Colonel Smith  owing to this muddle over the tanks. You,  Colonel Smith,  are to be superseded because of your mismanagement; and  Colonel Jones  is to carry on and finish the action." But  Colonel Smith  would say, " <inline font-style="italic">~No,</inline> you don't. Please remember the Defence Act as amended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott.</inline> Before you can supersede me I have the right to protest - and you must give me notice in writing - against such supersession. You must first hold an inquiry and hear my side of the case." So  Colonel Smith  continues to carry on, and to lose more lives, until General Elliott, or whoever may be the brigadier involved, can find time in the middle of his harrowing responsibilities to inaugurate an inquiry. </para>

                <para class="block">I appeal <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> honorable senators to seriously consider if they are prepared to support such an amendment as that moved by the honorable senator, knowing that it must lead to hopeless confusion if the illustration which he has himself given the Senate is true. In giving the illustration, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> seemed quite unable to realize that it was the best justification we could have for' the right of, immediate supersession without the formalities of the giving notice and the hearing of evidence. The amendment is not in the interests of the Army, and in conclusion I warn the Senate that ° if it is  carried a principle that is absolutely foreign to any Army Act in the world would be established, because the logical consequence of it would be that promotion would not be by selection on the ground of ability, but on seniority alone. </para>

                        <para>- I can prove that during the whole period of the war those rights which I desire to see embodied in  the Bill were given to officers by regulation, and none of the disasters to which the Minister has referred ever occurred. The Minister taunted me the other day, during a similar discussion, by saying, "You had a 'dud' staff officer, of whom you told us,  and  he made a shocking blunder; with such a provision as. this in the Act you would have to keep him there until an inquiry had been held." The Minister knows very well that an officer can be placed under suspension at any moment, when his place is taken by another officer whose, duty it is to carry on the work. In the very case mentioned by the Minister during the war I suspended the officer and placed the next Senior officer in charge, and having done that, could ask him to write out the history of what occurred, and place it before the suspended officer with a request to state if the facts were correct or otherwise. This report was sent to the Divisional Commander for investigation, after which it would be transmitted to General Birdwood, during all which time the officer remained suspended. In the meantime another officer was carrying on, and . I am amazed to think that a responsible Minister should suggest the possibility of the catastrophes he has mentioned, because he must know he is merely fighting shadows. </para>

                        <para>- There is nothing whatever to prevent it, and it was frequently done by reasonable officers. To suspend an officer until an inquiry was held would not be regarded as an unfair supersession of an officer who had absolutely no charges against him. In the letter which the Military Board forwarded to me, it was stated, "Suppose there are three or four officers with an absolutely unblemished reputation and promotion comes along for some one. If one is chosen, the others have no cause of complaint." But a junior may be placed in , command. The decision rests with some irresponsible person, and this frequently happens, because some officers have their favorites. A very able man -in England dealt very drastically with this question, and pointed out that the practice was ruinous to the discipline of the Army. These were his words - </para>

In France, one of the biggest "duds" I know of commanded a regiment of Light Horse, and he was stationed in a village behind the lines for the whole period of the war. During practically the whole of the time he was there he was intoxicated, and the villagers, in pity and contempt, named him <inline font-style="italic">Le Toujours Zig-Zag,</inline> by which they meant that he was always drunk. Notwithstanding this he was placed in command of a regiment of cavalry. </para>

                        <para>- By the Officer Commanding the Australian Imperial Force. He returned to Australia and is now in command of the troops in Tasmania. Tasmanian senators should watch this very carefully; because this officer was never with the Light Horse in Palestine, and his experience, such as it was, was confined to service in a village in France. Such officers as the honorable member for Darwin,  Colonel George  Bell, have to take their instructions from a man who, so far as I know, never commanded his regiment in action. If we do not include some provision such as I have outlined, promotion will continue to be made by selection, as is the custom in the Army. </para>

                </continue><para>It is not my desire to embarrass the Government, but an amendment such as I have moved must be embodied in the Bill if officers are to receive fair treatment. In the event of an officer with a good record being superseded he would naturally want to state his case. In the instance I have quoted, he would say, " This officer was intoxicated all the time he was in France, and he should not be placed over me." Supposing General Birdwood had come to me in a fair manner, and said that in a particular battle I did certain things, or that my hair was not curled to suit him, trouble would not arise. At Gallipoli I was superseded by General Forsyth, who was my junior. General White approached me, and said : " We propose placing General Smyth, of the British Army, over you." I replied, " I object. I do not see why a British officer should be brought here, as it implies that I do not understand my job." He followed that up by saying, " The only alternative is to place General Forsyth over you." To that I replied, " If Jack Forsyth comes along I will help to carry him up to the front line." </para><interjection>

                        <para>- Very well; I shall say that an officer who joined the British Army did not reach a higher rank than that of captain after twenty years' service. He then retired and undertook farming, and, though he was a civilian at the outbreak of war, he was given the rank of major. He came to the Peninsula, and during the whole of the time he was there he remained on the Staff, and did not command a company in the field. At the same time, there were other officers senior to him fighting in the line day after day. He was promoted colonel, and that made him of the same rank as officers who had commanded their battalions for six months in actual battle fighting. Three weeks later he was promoted brigadier over the heads of other officers, and I ask honorable senators to say whether they consider that a fair thing. </para>

                        <para>- The officer from whose letter I quote is very much senior to them. The Minister for Defence has himself stamped General McNicoll as a magnificent soldier, yet men junior to him have been selected for these positions. The only inference he can draw is that the protest he made jointly with me in France is now proving a bar to his employment. </para>

                        <para>- No. I refer to the protest against being, superseded. If, in view of what I have said, honorable senators still believe that absolute power should be given to any officer in high command to favour his relatives or any one else, and that no protest should bo permitted, I am 'at a loss to know what their ideas of a Defence Force can be. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has pointed out, we preserve a man's right to promotion in the Public Service, and in the management of the Defence Force, a vitally more important organization, we should strive to secure justice for our fellow men and fellow comrades. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> in the course of his last remarks, made one very serious statement, which should certainly be given further consideration, if not by the Committee, then by the Government. The honorable senator has made a deliberate charge against a high officer who has been placed in command of the Commonwealth Military Forces in one of the States. I submit .that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has said too little or too much. A statement has been made in this chamber where the officer charged is not in a position to defend himself, and in view of the fact that he is a gentleman occupying a high position in a certain State carrying with it great responsibility, it is up to the Committee to see to it that he is given a fair opportunity to defend himself if he is in the right. </para>

                        <para>- I submit that the charge is a very serious one. If the Government has been guilty of placing a man of that calibre in charge of the Commonwealth Military Forces of Tasmania they are deserving of censure. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> makes such a charge without being able to prove it, he is deserving of censure. In either case, honorable senators should determine that a charge of that sort shall be fully investigated. I should like to hear something from the Minister for Defence in reply to the charge made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott.</inline> Surely he knows the records of the officers whom he has placed in command of the Commonwealth Military Forces in the various States. If he does not, then he ought to know them. If the officer given the command in Tasmania is a person of the calibre suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> it is entirely in ' the best interests of Australia that he. for one, should be immediately superseded. If the charge made against him is false, honorable senators should  see that something further is done, because, as I have previously said, it is grossly unfair to attack any man, not only in his absence, but in a place like this Chamber, -where it is not possible for him to defend himself. </para>

What is the amendment we are asked to consider? We know that from one end of the Military Service to the other there are grievances m connexion with supersessions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> with a good deal of courage, has made use of his own case, not with a view to " pushing his own barrow," but to give facts which show what may happen in the Service. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to give my reasons for 'registering a vote 'against the amendment, as I intend to do. My -first objection to it is that it applies only to senior officers. I consider that supersession and promotion should be grouped under one heading; and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott's</inline> idea is a good one, it should apply to other than senior officers. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has admitted that in the case of ordinary regimental promotion the men of a regiment receive promotion up to the rank of major, in due course, by virtue of seniority. If, in the case of ordinary regimental promotion, a man believes that he has been superseded for two or three stripes, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> is not prepared to give him a chance to make and ' defend his complaint. My experience abroad was that such men did not get very much of a hearing if they complained that they had not received one or two stripes which they considered they were entitled to. "When we were on Gallipoli, I remember hearing the statement made that there was more row amongst the " heads " over an extra star than there was amongst the "diggers" over one stripe. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I am not prepared to support- such a proposal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> referred to some anonymous " war lord " in England who expressed the opinion that supersession in the Army was as common, I think he said, as prostitution, and a number of other things which he placed in the same category. It is very difficult for us to judge the merits of any case of alleged supersession such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has referred to. I think it is unfortunate that men in the position of General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Gellibrand, and' others similarly highly placed, should have been mentioned by name in this debate when they are not in a position to reply to what has been said concerning them. I do not believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> would have us consider that, in his opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Gellibrand is a " dud " officer. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. And I take it that when objection is taken to the supersession of an officer, it is not suggested that the officer who is given the job to which the superseded officer thinks he was entitled is a " dud " and should not have received it. After all, then, whether a supersession is right or wrong, is a matter depending on the judgment of the senior command. I am inclined to think that just as a great many of us in the lower ranks of the Service were talked to very freely by those who occupied higher positions, so even men in command of brigades must be content to be judged by their senior commanders. What would be the position if these Boards were set up and every officer who felt he was not receiving due recognition of his merits could go before a Board and say He was 6 ft. 6 in. in height and his fighting weight 12 st. 7 lbs." ? </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that on many occasions during his military career General Elliott has had to determine questions as to the relative merits of men under his command, and say whether a man was to have one stripe or two stripes ; and I have no doubt that his judgment has not always been indorsed by the men concerned. In the Army, I found that when a man squealed most about what he did not get, he was usually properly adjudged by his senior officers as being in his right place. Because it is not suggested to apply this remedy from the private upwards, I propose to leave the matter as it is. </para>

It seems to me that some compromise may be made with regard to the clause under discus. sion. Undoubtedly it is a tradition - indeed, it is a truth - that in the Army "kissing goes by favour," and, as I understand it, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott's</inline> amendment proposes to do away with this system, and to provide for appointments and promotions on well-defined lines, so as to prevent a continuance of that favoritism which, he asserts, exists at present. During the second-reading debate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> made a suggestion that senior officers might have the right of appeal to some other tribunal than the Board, and I understand his suggestion was favorably received by the Minister. It has occurred to me that a new clause might be drafted to give effect to this suggestion. </para>

                <para class="block">General Bridges, the man selected for the post by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen, would not have 'been intrusted with that responsibility, because he was not the senior officer. There were senior to him seven Citizen Force officers, as well as several permanent officers, but yet not a solitary voice was raised in protest when they were passed over and the choice, fell upon General Bridges. Honorable senators surely will realize how important it is that there should be freedom in selection in such circumstances, and how inadvisable it is to hamper a commanding officer by the authorization of inquiries in regard to his selection of his senior officers. No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> himself has many times exercised  hi3  untrammelled choice in regard to the men under his command, and, as we all like to think well of ourselves, it is natural that some of the men who were passed over .by him would not agree that his selection was the wisest that could have been made. It is not in 'human nature to be so. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> has pointed out, this matter goes right down through the ranks. I trust <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> will not press his amendment. He will see, from the general expression of opinion, that it is not palatable to the Committee. I trust, therefore, he will rest satisfied with my assurance that I shall endeavour to provide a satisfactory form of appeal for the military officers. </para>

                        <para>- Well, if the principle is applicable to those officers, why not give the officers a little higher up a chance too? Surely this is a democratic principle. I may add that in the Australian Imperial Force there were Australian Imperial Force regulations as well as Commonwealth Military Force regulations, and the Minister must know there was no limitation in those regulations to junior or senior commanders. I knew that, but General White tried to bluff me that the regulations only applied to officers in the regimental list, when, as a matter of fact, they are absolutely definite that no officer shall be superseded unless he is informed. </para>

                        <para>- When the sitting was suspended I was addressing myself to a point upon which there seems to be considerable misunderstanding amongst honorable senators regarding the object which I have in view. This amendment might well be termed a provision to prevent favoritism in the Army. Honorable senators have frequently interjected during the course of the debate that the amendment, if adopted, would result in promotion by seniority. But if it be viewed critically it will be seen, that it will accomplish no such thing. It merely provides that if it be desired to supersede an officer by the promotion of a junior over his head, the officer to be superseded shall be told in what respect he has failed to gain the confidence of those who are above him. This disclosure should be in writing, so that he may know that there is a definite charge against him instead of merely possessing the consciousness that he is being superseded from personal spite, or because the man who has been promoted has a wife who is making things sweet with the head. </para>

Even during the late war, the headquarters of General French were the rendezvous of thousands of fashionable women who resorted  there  in order to bring their personal influence to bear upon the Commander-in-Chief with a view to getting their favorites pushed forward. </para>

                        <para>- This system of promoting a junior out of a group of good officers, none of whom is visibly better than the other, is justified by the fact that it is the custom of the Service. If I were in the position of the Military Board to-day I could, by searching the precedents of the British Army from which the customs of the Service are drawn, discover cases which show that officers in the Navy were promoted on the nomination of a pandar - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir "William</inline> Hamilton, and countersigned by a harlot, his wife. That appears here in the correspondence. The letter which I desire to quote reads: - </para>

This lady is not only literally Admiral of the British Fleet (for she absolutely governs the Admiral, who is infatuated with her), but she, in conjunction with the Queen, governs the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies - this I know from those whose authority cannot be doubted. She is consequently the fountain-head of all interest - I myself know two captains who have been promoted by her means. One of these is an old shipmate. You will probably doubt some part of this account and think I exaggerate, but I assure my dear aunt that it is strictly and literally true. </para>

                        <para>- The custom of the Service is based upon precedent, and if sufficient precedent were obtainable, the Military Board, under this Bill. could adopt any system that it chose. Thus there is a strong probability that we shall have the same kind of influence creeping in to the detriment of eur own Service. This Bill, which some honorable senators appear to regard merely as a means to enable me to voice my own personal grievances, has far deeper roots than that. It is not a new principle that I am endeavouring to establish. The Minister himself has admitted that there are in existence regulations which are designed to accomplish my aim. But that is a very different thing from inserting the requisite provisions in 'this Bill. At the present time, if a senior officer disregards the regulations, there is no means of bringing him to book except by voicing the matter in this Parliament. The Minister can then deal with it. </para>

                        <para>- I can see no effective method whereby observance of such regulations can be enforced. During the late war they were repeatedly disregarded by those who were powerful enough to escape the consequence of their acts. During the whole term of my association with the Australian Imperial Force I never failed to observe' the regulations with the utmost strictness, and I had none of the advantages which honorable senators imagine that I possessed. Upon one occasion I considered that an officer, who was the senior subaltern of the battalion was not fit to be promoted to the position of captain. I told him so, whereupon he appealed to my Divisional Commander, General Hobbs. The latter said, " This man has something to say in his defence. He admits that for the  moment  he is inefficient, because he has been absent from the division) for a long time, and consequently has not had  a chance of familiarizing himself with the present conditions of warfare. Suspend the promotion you. are going to make for three  months.  Give the man in whom you have confidence the promotion temporarily, but do not make it permanent for three months. If, in the meantime, the senior subaltern justifies himself, drop the . temporary appointee, and give him his fair due." That course was followed. In point of fact, in the British Army it had to be followed, because, when the war started, that Army was a tiny one, though it subsequently expanded into a huge force. Assuming that it was desirable to appoint one of a group of brigade commanders to the command of a division, and there was an. argument as to who should be appointed, the commander of the force would notify each of the senior officers, " You will be superseded because of such and such." </para>

I cannot quite follow all the arguments which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has advanced in favour of it. As far as I can understand, it is merely intended to prevent the supersession of officers. It has nothing whatever to do with appointments.

                        <para>- I am not a military man, but I imagine that it would be absolutely impossible for a general charged with the conduct of a. war to conduct it upon those lines. If he had not the power to supersede an officer whom he thought was inefficient for reasons which probably he could not put in black and white, he might lose a whole battalion. A whole battalion might be sacrificed simply because of the inefficiency of an officer whom he could not supersede without a trial. During the late war one of the achievements which led to the triumph of the Allied arms was the centralization of the control of the Allied Forces. The appointment of General Foch as- Generalissimo, was the beginning of the Allied successes. </para>

                        <para>- With all the honorable senator's military knowledge, .he cannot tell me that. I cannot quote instances to specifically disprove his assertion, but I know .that Foch had the power to remove any officer under his command if he deemed him inefficient. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> in support of his argument, went so far as to say that an officer commanding a battalion should have the right to give his own decision concerning whether a movement should be carried out or not. How could any general hope to successfully conduct a campaign in such circumstances ? He might make mistakes. He might appear, to the battalion commander immediately concerned, to be committing- a blunder in ordering that battalion into a position which courted disaster ; but' if the general, in the conduct of his campaign, were subject <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the will of his battalion commanders, there would certainly be disaster and chaos. It may be that the' general would see fit to risk the sacrifice of a' battalion in order to achieve success all along his line. Such a sacrifice might appear to the battalion commander, from his restricted view-point, to be unwarrantable. Yet, if he were to disobey orders, and to refrain from taking up the hazardous position to which  his command  was allotted, the result might entail the obliteration of half-a-dozen battalions. And, if a battalion commander were permitted to question an order, why should not the officer commanding a company be similarly privileged, and also the lieutenant in command of a platoon, and so on, right down to the unit? What an impossible situation there would be ! What chance would there be of achieving victory ? </para>

                        <para>- The appointment of Foch as Generalissimo was purely an arrangement for the most efficient consolidation and co-ordination of the Allied Armies. While that move was a wise one, there is no question that the authority given to Foch was such as to hand over to him- the control of the British Forces, right down to the matter of individual discipline. The successes gained by the Allies during the closing months of the war, under the supreme command of Foch, were but the outcome and climax of the retreat of the Germans to the Marne in 1914, followed, as that was, by our constant hammering of the enemy lines, and brought to a conclusion by the eventual break-down of morale within the German nation itself. In saying this I do not desire to detract from the supreme qualifications of General Foch, nor to refrain from the acknowledgment of his all-conquering strategy during the closing months of the conflict. </para>

                            . with his military experience, made it quite clear that there has been favoritism in the ranks of the Australian Imperial Force. And he has established a good case for the institution, of the right of appeal in the event of promotions being brought about unfairly, due to favoritism, through petticoat influence, and the like. I understand that the Minister for Defence has undertaken to look into the whole matter, and that he will endeavour to devise some means whereby favoritism shall have no scope. We should never seek to make a law which would take from a general the right to suspend or supersede any officer, according to his own judgment, at any time. But, surely, no one will argue that the officer affected should not have the right of invoking an appeal. Why should such an, individual be denied the ordinary measure of justice which would be naturally available to him in civilian walks of life?

If injustice has been done, why should we shut out the application of common sense just because the circumstances have to do with the Army ? </para>

                        <para>- I hope and believe this measure will be applied to our Military Forces through many years of peace to come. Will it not be wise, therefore, to accept the proposal of an experienced military officer, who states that it is necessary to provide a court of appeal to deal with cases of supersession ? I I maintain that such a court, by the very fact of its existence, would militate against injustice. I do not suggest that the mere institution of the right of appeal would prove a strong factor for fair play ; but the realization that any instance of injustice might be exposed by that medium would be bound to have considerable effect. In such circumstances injustice would not occur. </para>

                        <para>- Then if it is right and proper, surely we have sufficient ability to make it effective, and the Government or the Minister for Defence will not brush it aside. Before the dinner adjournment I was under the impression that it was the intention of the Minister to give the matter his careful consideration. In legislating as rapidly as we do there is always the possibility of mistakes occurring, and when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> first lodged hi3 complaint I asked the Minister if he would not endeavour to have an amendment drafted to meet the case. I think the Minister will remember that during the second-reading debate, I made such a suggestion, and now we have the Bill before us in Committee it is a good opportunity to make some provision in the direction <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has indicated. If the amendment moved by the honorable senator does not meet with the approval of the Government, surely this Committee can take the question in hand, and decide upon something that will be acceptable. We do not have to consider an amending Defence Bill every twelve months, .and in view of the extraordinary statements that have been made during the course of the debate, it appears that it is our duty to embody something in the measure which will be the means of preventing officers exercising powers to which they are not entitled. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> trust the Minister will adhere to what he has in mind, and have an amendment drafted or introduce an amending Bill later so that every officer and man in our Military Forces will have the right to appeal to some tribunal when he considers that he has been unfairly treated. </para>

                    <para>.- If the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> carefully peruses my subsequent amendments he will see that under them the Minister would in time of war have power to suspend an inquiry until hostilities had terminated, but that facilities would be given for the recording of evidence. The work of promotion could be carried on, but it is my endeavour to insert a provision so that when war is over what is, perhaps, an unnecessary stain on an officer's character may be removed. Although the Minister has said that an officer's character i3 not necessarily affected by supersession, he is always a marked man, because it has been decided by a high authority that he is absolutely unfitted for promotion. </para>

                        <para>- That is the effect, and when once a man is superseded he is to some extent damned. If I were to succeed a commander in the field, and I ascertained that Brown and Jones had been superseded by Smith and Edwards, I would be very careful before I promoted those officers, and I would not do so until I had kept them under close observation for a considerable time. The Minister pointed out that there was some doubt cast upon my judgment, but if there is a scintilla of evidence on that point, I should be told of the occasion on which it was displayed, and of the exact nature of the charge. It may not have been a lack of judgment in military matters, but lack of judgment in some minor matter. That is the extraordinary position in which an officer is placed under the present law. I notice, with regret, that I cannot expect the support of the majority of the Committee, and it is, therefore, not my intention to press my amendment to a division. </para>

Before the divisional commands were made General Brand wrote to me and said that as one of the senior officers I might be considered suitable for a command, and he wanted to know if I would be prepared to accept such a position. I wrote declining ,to express any opinion until the conditions of service were made known. I told him that I did not know whether such work would interfere with my duties here, quite apart from the aspect of introducing politics into the Army.

                        <para>- Apart from that, there is the danger of these appointments being deliberately sought, and we may find a number of comparatively junior officers in Parliament approaching members of the Ministry in an endeavour to secure support. In view of the  recent  decision of the Committee on the amendment I moved, the question of their suitability could not be raised. "We are sent here by our constituents to do our duty and criticise with the utmost severity the proposals of the Ministry, not only in matters of defence, but in other directions, and it is questionable whether it would be desirable for members of Parliament to hold such positions. </para>

In return for the Minister submitting to acts of the Military Board not strictly legal or somewhat shady in character, the members of - the Board might say to him, " We will agree to appoint your figureheads, if you in turn will wink when we put our brothers, uncles and nephews into comfortable positions around the barracks, and send men without family influence out into the backblocks." </para>

                        <para>- That is so, but it will be found that there are no Territorial officers holding commands above the rank of colonel. I never heard of a divisional commander being appointed from any but the Regular Army. One of the most bitter complaints voiced in England and in France was that no Territorial officer, and no officer of the Kitchener Army  ever had a chance of any Staff billet. There were many most brilliant men in the business and scientific world who joined the Kitchener Army and rose to the rank of colonel. It was well known that their ability was far superior to that of their brigadiers, but the close corporation of the old Regular Army effectively shut them out from promotion beyond the rank of colonel. Honorable senators can see that such a position as is contemplated here could not arise in Gre'at Britain. </para>

                    <para>.- There have been occasions, especially during the last few days, when I have felt a very great deal of sympathy for this amendment. At the same time, I must say that my judgment is against the acceptance of the principle it involves. I contend that we do not give up our rights as citizens when we become members of this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> proposes this discrimination against members of the Federal Parliament, but not against members of the State Parliaments. That may be. because State Governments have no say in the making of military appointments. </para>

Ours is a citizen army, and we have universal training. A man may be elected to the Senate or to the House of Representatives at the age of twenty-one years, when, under our Defence Act, he may be still liable to six years of compulsory training. Yet, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott's</inline> amendment, he must not be permitted to accept a commission. </para>

If a man goes out of a training area, he is placed on the unattached list, and if the Senate sat at Canberra many officers would have to be placed on the unattached list willy-nilly. </para>

In every Federal Parliament there has been in one House or the other one or more citizen officers holding commands, and I never heard it suggested, even by the most virulent Opposition, that the Government of the day, in keeping an officer in a particular position, were doing so for political purposes. When I was Minister for Defence in a Labour Government, I venture' to say that, with the exception of Lieut. - Colonel O'loghlin, who was a member of the Labour party, every Citizen Force officer in the Parliament was on the opposite side to me in politics, but no one ever suggested that because they were paid they might come over to our side. </para>

With a citizen army such as ours, the difficulty raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> is inescapable. We have to decide whether we shall have a citizen army, and then to decide whether it is to 'be open to all citizens, or a disqualification should be imposed upon a certain section. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> said that we should disqualify members of the Federal Parliament from holding these offices, and I say that if we did so we should stigmatize ourselves as ' corrupt. The honorable senator wishes us to say that we have men amongst us in this Parliament who may be tempted by these positions, who are prepared to sell their votes to the Government, and that the Government are going to buy them for £300 a year, though they will be at the same time expected to give the equivalent of ninety days' service for that pay. I think that an officer who takes one of these positions will have a pretty hard time, and will not grow very fat on the pay he will receive. </para>

                        <para>- He may be superseded by the electors. That has happened before now. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> suggests that in order to favour a political supporter the Government may in time of war give a command to a man who has been out of training for six years. At present these officers, who are also members of Parliament, may be appointed to positions in which they- will have a great deal of hard and unthankful work to do, which is not very much appreciated by the general public. I cannot for the life of me 'believe that the dangers which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> anticipates are ever likely to arise. Nothing of the kind has so far occurred, though the existing practice has continued from the inception of the Defence Act. </para>

                    <para>. -  I have been listening for so long now that I began to be afraid that if I did not get up I would take root. From the discussion we have had this evening, I think that if I had to start again as a member of Parliament I should like also to be a military man so that I might join in such discussions. I think that the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> is entirely unnecessary. If we have prided ourselves in Australia upon one thing more than another, it has' been upon the purity of our Parliaments. I do not recollect any scandal in our parliamentary life such as seems to be anticipated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott.</inline> I do not understand how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> can suggest that we could trust the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> not to exercise political influence in giving a man a job worth £30 a year, but we could not trust him if he were in a position to give a man a job worth £300 a year. If the honorable senator made it £30,000 a year it would at least have the merit or demerit of a good bold swindle. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> may trust the Minister for Defence not to make an unworthy appointment for £300 a  ye.Ar  for political purposes. I point out'40 the honorable senator that both Houses of this Parliament have power to grant leave to their members, and I do not know of a single case where leave of absence has been refused a member to attend to urgent private business much more to attend to the business of the  country which, was so recently and so gloriously performed by our citizen soldiers.  The presence of citizen soldiers in this Parliament may be of the greatest assistance. I am sure that the Minister for Defence, when he was on the other side politically, received valuable assistance from the single-minded worthy military officers in this Parliament who were opposed to him. It is derogatory to the Parliament to suppose that any of its members could be actuated by  the motives suggested by the amendment. No member of the Senate would succumb to the terrible temptation to become a political advocate for £350 a year. Members of this Parliament are not likely to  stoop to anything so low as that. </para>

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, members of the Citizen Forces who have been employed on* active service abroad may, upon their return to duty with the Citizen Forces, be given such rank and allotted such regimental seniority as are approved by the Governor-General, on the recommendation of the Military Board. </para>

                <para>This amendment will enable us to appoint persons who served on active service, whether with the Commonwealth Forces or with the British Forces. It will meet the case of a fairly large number of men who did not join the Australian Imperial Force at all - men who were British Reservists, and at the outbreak of war returned to Great Britain to serve with the British Forces. They 'have since come back to Australia, and are Australian citizens in every sense of the term. Some of them gained commissions on active service, but under the law as it stands we could not give then! commissions in the Citizen Forces of this country unless they went all through the mill again. </para>

                        <para>- No. This will not give the Government power to bring anybody to Australia. It may 'be said that, it will throw open commissions in the Citizen Forces to everybody. Well, do we not wish to have the gate open wide enough to secure the very best officers available? If a man served on active service with the King's Army anywhere and came to Australia and became a citizen of this country,, he should be in the same position as anybody else. At present the Act confines all appointments to members of the Citizen Forces-; and there are officers in Australia to-day, men who were born in this country and won commissions on active service, but were never members of the Citizen Forces. </para>

                    <para>.- I have no very great objection to the clause now that the Committee has ruled against me on my amendment with regard to the supersession of officers. There is nothing now to prevent the Military Board appointing a man who was second lieutenant in the British Army, and about whose services little or nothing may be known, to 'the position of lieutenant-colonel in the Commonwealth Military Forces, because he may be appointed to such commissioned rank and allotted such seniority as are recommended by the Military Board. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know; but I have known the Board to do some very unreasonable things, and I would be failing in my duty now if I did not point  to the possibilities. In an interjection during my second-reading speech, the Minister most unfairly remarked .that my amendment would have the effect of making the officering of our present Forces a close preserve for members of the Citizen Forces. As a matter of fact, I had no such intention. My amendment was merely designed to prevent a second lieutenant, or a first lieutenant, for that matter, .of a British regiment being granted the rank of captain or major to the prejudice of Australian officers. As my amendment was negatived, I content myself bow- with pointing out that it is open to the Military Board to bring out an English officer and, without examination, to appoint him. to any rank in the Citizen Forces they think fit. That would be perfectly legal, and quite justifiable, if we pass a measure giving them this power. </para>

                    <para>. -  I listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> with some interest, but it appears to me that there is another aspect to the case which he quoted. Let me state it. I had on my scientific staff in Tasmania . a young fellow who had been appointed as a Rhodes scholar. He had just completed his .work at Oxford when the war broke out, and as he could not come back to Australia .he promptly enlisted im the British Army, where he served with distinction, rose to the rank of major, and got the Military Cross. We must- have some provision .in our legislation to give such men a chance when they come back to Australia. This young man's whole military training was outside of the Australian imperial Force, but he was nevertheless a distinguished military officer, and we should provide for him and others who may be of material advantage, from a military point of view, to this country. He left Australia, not. with the idea of losing his Australian citizenship, but to train in one of the great Universities of the world. I am in entire sympathy with the Minister. </para>

                    <para>.- Such cases could be met by granting equivalent rank to that held on. active service, and my proposal, had the previous amendment been accepted, would have been designed to this end. This provision is unique. The Military Board has no power to appoint an Australian Imperial Force officer- above the rank he held in the Australian- Imperial Force without requiring him to pass an examination, but a major in the British Army may be appointed by the Board to a lieutenant-colonelcy over the heads of equally worthy Australian officers. </para>

The Military Board, after very serious consideration, might desire to have such a man here for the purpose of imparting instruction. Surely we must make provision for cases of that kind. We might have a man who has had a specific training in a special branch of military science, and whom we- wished to push forward for the- benefit of our' own Forces. Surely we must make- some' provision by which we may be able to utilize his services for the benefit of Australia ? </para>

                        <para>- That is the question. Though every graduate and his parents enter into the agreement to which I have alluded, . in case of hardship, a graduate may resign under certain conditions. For instance, we might make it. a condition that he should refund some portion of the cost' of his training to which the Commonwealth has been put. Or we might say to him, "Well, under these) circumstance's, we will permit you to resign." But he cannot resign as- a matter of right. The conditions under which he may resign,, short of rendering twelve years' service, will be determined by the Military Board. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> knows that every citizen officer is responsible for the equipment which he controls. If we allowed him to resign forthwith, we might not have time to get a report upon that equipment, and to ascertain that everything is all right with his command. I take it that the intention of the provision is to give time for inquiries to be made, so as to insure that everything is straight before he is permitted to resign. </para>

                    <para>. -  I notice here a provision which purports to bind graduates of the Military College to eight years' service as officers. I recognise that the Commonwealth gives to the young men of this institution quite a valuable education. But I do not think that this gift by the Commonwealth warrants us in insisting upon an agreement that the services of these young men shall be retained for eight years after they leave the College. It is not an extraordinarily generous thing for a Government which really requires the services of highly-trained military men to say to our youths, "We will give you a free education at the Military College." In almost every State of the Commonwealth, the State Government has provided bursaries which not only permit young men attending the University  to  become doctors  or  lawyers, but are sufficiently liberal  to  maintain them in reasonable comfort whilst they are completing their course. Why does the State do this? Because it is a distinct advantage to the State that it should have well trained medical men. It is equally  a  distinct advantage to the Commonwealth that it should possess highly-trained military officers. Why, then, should we compel Duntroon graduates to complete eight years' service as officers? </para>

                <para class="block">Suppose that the Service is quite distasteful to a man, and that the Military Board will not permit him to resign. What can we get from an obstinate man who is retained in the Service against his will! I recollect a very distinguished parliamentarian in New South Wales, who in the early days became a member of the Artillery Force there - I refer to the late A. G. Taylor. In those days a man had to pay £25 if he wished to get out of that Service. They were the days of the nice, white, pipe-clayed belts. Taylor had no £25 to enable him to get out of the Service, and, accordingly, he appeared on parade one morning with his boots whitewashed and his belt blackened. The military records of that State contain the intimation that he was ' ' incapable of being taught," and that is how he got out of the Service. I suppose that it costs £200 for the maintenance of every student who enters the Duntroon College. </para>

But I was viewing the position from the stand-point of a student's maintenance. I do not anticipate that there will be any sudden break away of graduates from that College, but I do anticipate that occasionally a man will desire to leave a Service which has grown distasteful to him. In that case we can only charge him the cost of his maintenance, because in the event of war we could still count upon getting his services. </para>

S.o far as Duntroon graduates are concerned, I am sure they did all that was expected of them, and more. Their . war-time services demonstrated that they had been raised to the highest standard of efficiency. </para>

There need be no fear that during that period we shall suffer any lack of material necessary for being turned into training officers for our Forces. </para>

The Standing Orders must be observed in the spirit as- well", as* in the- letter, and it would ill become me to permit a ruling of the  President  to be over-ridden' by the merely formal  intervention' of one- honorable senator' in order to&gt; allow another who has been arbitrarily interrupted to resume . his remarks.

                <para>With ' regard to the clause -itself,.' the position-, can' be summed up&gt; in a. few words. It. appears to- be- a very fair provision that the Commonwealth, having spent a considerable sum on the five years' training of a young officer at Duntroon, should be entitled -to the benefit of his services -over an appreciable term. I have mentioned a 'sum approaching £5,000 as the capital cost of each officer when turned out from Duntroon. It is fair, then, that if a cadet, with the consent of his parents, deliberately chooses, . and sets out upon a military .career by way of five years' training at Duntroon, which involves the Commonwealth in an expenditure of several thousand pounds, the country should be entitled, in return, to the benefit of his services for a reasonable length of time. This clause should not provide an option for the officer to get out; but it rightly permits the Commonwealth to dispense with his services or to allow him to get out if deemed proper.- </para>

In addressing myself to a serious subject it is absurd, and shameful,- that I should be interrupted as the  Chairman  was bound to do. Surely in this Chamber, one's opportunities for debate should not be restricted. On the second reading of this .Bill I referred to .this matter, and I now desire to repeat that .what I desire to see in the Service is the highest efficiency. Any. man who knows anything at all about the conduct of the last war will realize that efficiency was secured only "by having highly-trained men. What was the position of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> He came through the war period very creditably as the Minister conducting the Defence Department, and. no matter what my opposition may have been, I have always maintained that he did hie work well under difficult circumstances'. But how much better would he have succeeded' if he could have -organized the business side of the Military Department by having men to .assist him with a college training and commercial experience  as well. If men -had had five years' military training, . and had drifted into other occupations in the commercial world, their ser-' vices would have 'been available, and would have been of .great -advantage to the Department. </para>

My quotations will be brief when compared with the length of the speech delivered. I shall give quotations, 60 far. as I can, which are not affected by anything which precedes or follows them, but which in themselves are sufficiently concise and definite to support the 'statement which I made.

I invite honorable senators in this Chamber, if they have any doubt concerning the impression conveyed by the speech of the honorable senator, to peruse the records and draw their own conclusions. If they do that,,. I have not the slightest doubt that they will realize that I have not twisted the honorable senator's remarks in any way. I have taken, as far as I can, sentences which are complete in themselves, and nowhere can I find anything which would justify me in modifying the statement I made, that on that occasion he was specially urging us to direct our attention to arriving at peace by negotiation. </para>

I have not had an opportunity of carefully perusing the speech to which he has referred, but I believe it was made on an occasion when I said in this Senate that we were " in this fight to a finish." </para>

                    <para>I wish to take a portion of that statement, which, if torn from the context and read by itself, might put the movement of which I am a member in a very false position. It is this: "The Labour party stands for the immediate cessation of fighting." I am emphatically and firmly to repudiate that. So far as the peace policy of the Labour party is concerned, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arch.</inline> Stewart has no more right to publish what is Labour's peace policy than I or any other member of the community. I say emphatically that so far as the Australian Labour party are concerned, we are in this fight to a finish. Let there be no mistake about that. I shall try to put before the Senate the peace policy of the Labour party as decided in conference in my own State. I do not want to do <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart</inline> an injustice, but I believe his State has adopted practically the same peace proposals as the Labour party at their conference last June. The resolutions of the New South Wales conference are somewhat lengthy, but in view of the interest in the matter at the present time, it is only fair that I should quote sufficient to put Labour's peace policy fully before the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I did so because I resented, first of all, the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> that I advocated peace by negotiation. I venture to say that when the speech which I delivered in the Senate at that particular juncture, in which I said that the Labour party was in the fight to a finish, is read it will be admitted that it does not indicate the stand of a man who was out to advocate peace by negotiation. In the quotations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen I discussed the question of peace by negotiation, considering how the war would end, and what would happen when it came to an end. After all, we know now that when the Armistice was signed negotiations were commenced, and they are still going on. The few words I have quoted from my speech will show that my attitude to the war was that we were in the fight to a finish. </para>

                        <para>- No ; the men went themselves. I have used the word "sent" in the sense that we provided ships for them in which to go to the Front, in the same way as honorable senators are sending the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> across the water at the present time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen's quotations show what my attitude was. I put as the first possibility victory for the Allies; the second possibility for the ending of the war I put as peace by negotiation, and it will be remembered that  President  Wilson, in January of that year, had put his proposals for negotiation before 'the people. I then mentioned the third possible ending of the war, and I do not think that a man was wrong when discussing the possibilities of the war in including, as a third possibility, a German victory. I object very strongly to being told that I was an advocate of peace by negotiation.. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen immediately did so apply it. Then I made the offensive remark for which I have apologized. <inline font-style="italic">T</inline> realize that no man has a right to be offensive in this chamber or anywhere else. If he is in the wrong, possibly the easiest way out of the difficulty is to admit it. I' think at the same time that, holding, as I do, a public position as a member of the Senate, I have a right, when the attitude I took up during the whole of the war, in. spite of the risks, if there are risks in opposing popular feeling in certain quarters, is misrepresented by interjection or otherwise, to resent being placed in the position of one who desired to end the war by a peace, no matter what the consequences. Honorable senators who were here discussing military matters day after day know what my attitude was. and they know that I never once shifted from the view that everything we could do intelligently to win the war should be done, but that, failing .to win the war, I realized the possible consequences of failure quite as clearly as " did the most enthusiastic loyalists, as they term themselves. Regarding my use of an offensive expression to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> I wish again to say that any attempt to put me in the position of advocating peace by negotiation, irrespective of the consequences, does not fairly represent my attitude during the whole of the war. </para>

The honorable senator would not venture to put himself in opposition to them. This statement was published in the press in the early part of the month, of June, 1918 - </para>

                    <para>We are of opinion that a complete military victory by the Allies over the Central Powers can only be -accomplished by the further sacrifice of millions of human lives, the infliction of incalculable misery and suffering upon the survivors, and the creation of an intolerable burden of debt to the impoverishment of the workers who must bear such burdens, and the practical destruction of civilization among the white races of the world. We therefore urge that immediate negotiations be initiated for an international Conference for the purpose of arranging equitable terms of peace, on which Conference the working class organizations shall have adequate representation, and the inclusion of women delegates, and. we further urge that the British self-governing dominions and Ireland shall be granted separate representation thereon. </para>

                        <para>- I wish only to say, in conclusion,, that I do not think that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will seriously contend that I misrepresented him when I referred to the picture he drew for the consideration of members of this Chamber: He made for us a sketch of the peace delegates around the peace table - a' sketch of the German peace delegates- on one side and the Allied peace delegates on the other side - and asked what harm could come from that. Honorable senators, I think, will see that I was- justified in the interjection I made. </para>
