        <para>Honorable senators, will remember that in addressing myself to the fixed period of service after training which under this clause students attending Duntroon College are required to give, I said that I considered the provision a mistake. It would be a mistake, even though without it we lost to&#39; the service of the Defence Department one or two per cent, of officers turned out of the college. We know that one thing from which the Military Service is suffering at the present time is that, brilliant men who on the field of actual warfare displayed military genius and great capacity for military service, are shut out from employment in our Forces, because of the need for finding employment for trainees of the Duntroon College. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> informed us that the cost of training men at the Duntroon College amounts to &#163;5,000 per head. Knowing that the honorable sen a* tor is so careful in dealing with financial matters, X have accepted his estimate; but, when we take into consideration that from 130 to 150 students are being trained there each year, although the full course covers four years, I am inclined to believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> estimate is altogether too great. If those trained at Duntroon remain in Australia we shall be well equipped with officers for our military needs. I have a son who is now too old to be sent to the -Military College, but if he were young enough to be sent there I should hesitate very seriously about letting him enter the college if he was to be bound down for eight years after he became a man. Such a provision must be injurious, rather than beneficial to the college. No thoughtful man would think of binding a son to a profession which he could not leave for eight years after he reached manhood. He would prefer that his son should enter a profession which he might leave at any moment. We know how many professional men change their occupation. We know that there are many who have passed as doctors or barristers who later have engaged in altogether different pursuits. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>may argue that this provision is already in existence, add that he is proposing in this Bill only to put it in a different form. By the form in which it appears in the&#39; existing Act, a general impression is conveyed that a trainee at Duntroon College may leave the Military Service at any time, but the Minister is proposing iri this Bill to make it quite clear that there is no &#34;get out&#34; for a trainee of the college. I should like to suggest that this is a time when we might suspend the work of the college altogether, and decide that for ten years we shall have no &#39; further military training in Australia. We might decide that for ten years we are sufficiently equipped and trained for war. We have officers and good soldiers here, and the nucleus of an efficient army, and a substantial saving of expenditure might be brought about by cutting down at once the operations of all military training institutions; This might be a wise course to adopt if the financial position is as disastrous as Ministers are making out. I do not underestimate the seriousness of- our financial position,, and for years past I have taken advantage of every occasion to voice the need for careful attention to our finances&#34;. If there is to be a sudden curtailment of expenditure, what better course could we adopt than the suspension of these institutions when we have an abundance of the material they turn out in the shape of trained military men? I shall call for a division upon this clause, because of my objection to the binding of trainees of the Military College for eight years after they  hare left the college, and because the time is opportune for the military authorities to consider whether they cannot effect a great saving in expenditure by suspending the operation of these training colleges for the next ton years. </para>

          <para>. - With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> objection to the length of service required from officers after they have been trained iu the Military College, there is an aspect of the question upon which some light may be thrown. I understand that we bare in Australia to-day so many men trained at Duntroon that it is found almost impossible to place them in jobs in the Military Service. We have a number of men who were staff-sergeant-majors, warrant officers, and instructors before the war. Some of these men who went to the Front rose as high as majors, and in one case that I know of to the rank of lieutenant-colonel on the field. These men, on their return, were required, in accordance with the promise they made before they went away, to revert to their pre-war rank. When some of them who had gained distinction in the field asked that their claims should be specially considered by the Military Department, they were told in effect - and I have seen this in writing - that there was no opening for. them, because the Department had a number of Duntroon Military College men for whom they were looking for jobs I understand that in districts where, previous to the war, Citizen Force officers acted as adjutants for regiments, we have Duntroon-trained men now occupying positions as adjutants and quartermasters in each of the Military Districts. If we have not a surplus of officers trained at Duntroon, how is it that the men to whom I have referred who have achieved distinction in the field cannot he granted even honorary commissions? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said that men trained at Duntroon might, after their training, desire to leave the Military Service rather than continue to serve for a period of eight years, as provided by the clause under consideration, and I say that, even in the interests of the Service it might be advisable that some of these men should get out. We had a case recently of a man who, for some reason, wished to leave the Service, and did leave it. He was court martialed, and a great hullabaloo made about the case, lt was said that discipline had to be maintained, and that others who might wish to leave the Service should be impressed by the horribly shocking example of a Duntroon officer being arrested and court martialed. Then the whole thing fizzled out. After hearing the evidence of the military medical officer the court martial said everything was quite all right, and the officer was allowed to get out. Such restrictions should not be imposed upon men who wish to leave the Military Service. </para>

When he appeared before the court martial his counsel put up the defence that he was medically unfit. As a result of the evidence given, I ordered a special medical hoard of inquiry. It was found that the man was medically unfit, and for that reason he was allowed to resign. If that officer had applied to the Medical Board there would have been no need for him to have taken french leave. </para>

            <para>- There was a medical examination, but it was of quite an inconclusive character. That fact was disclosed in the evidence tendered to the court martial. One part of the finding of the medical inquiry was that the officer was physically unfit, whilst another part of it affirmed that he was still fit for home service. The inquiry did not result in a definite finding either way. I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> that there is no present difficulty in placing Duntroon graduates. That is proved by the fact that we have temporarily filled a number of positions with the non-commissioned officers to whom he has referred. There are many of these officers still holding temporary positions because there are not sufficient Duntroon graduates to fill them. That position is quite consistent with the reply which I have given, that we cannot permanently appoint these officers to such positions, because, as time goes- on, we shall be able to fill them with Duntroon graduates. </para>

But we must have regard, not merely to the number of cadets who are taken into the college for any one particular year.&#39; They have to undergo a four-years&#39; course there, and consequently we have to plan for quite a number of years ahead. . Otherwise the result would be that when the graduates left the college there would be nothing for them to do.

            <para>- Lord Kitchener recommended the establishment of the college in order that it might turn out the schoolmasters for our Army. It is a mistake to think that it was founded to supply anything else. It is intended to turd out the future instructors for the officers of our Citizen Army. Having established it, we have practically contracted with, its trainees, that they shall instruct our Citizen Forces. If we now turn round and appoint citizen officers to instructional positions, we shall break our contract. Obviously the officers of our Citizen Forces cannot be as competent as those who are specially trained as instructors and administrators. For that reason, Parliament has always laid down the principle that positions on the Instructional Staff must be filled by the college graduates. Otherwise we might as well wipe out the institution entirely. There can be no halfway house. For that reason these non-commissioned officers cannot be permanently put into the positions which they now hold. But there arc positions in the Permanent Forces which they can fill permanently, such positions as quartermaster, &#38;e. Wherever it is possible to do so, we are putting them into these positions, so long as they have served successfully at the Front. But the instructional positions must he reserved for the Duntroon graduates because that is the plan which has been laid down. We have entered into a contract with these graduates, and if we break it we shall be morally obliged to pay them compensation. I repeat that a man who has distinguished himself upon the battlefield is not necessarily either a good instructor or a good administrator. </para>

            <para>- The Government have a right to say to the Military College graduates that the Commonwealth shall have the benefit of their services for  a  prescribed term in view of the expenditure to which it has been subjected upon their behalf. But after these men have completed their training they should have some guarantee that they will occupy positions of a certain standing. In Sydney, only last week, I was talking about some young men who were sent to England during the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the second Fisher Government, in order that they might he taught how to build submarines. I suppose that there were eight or a dozen of them. After having been in the Old Country for some time they returned to the Commonwealth. Upon his return, one of them who did remarkably well at Home, who had passed all his examinations, and upon whom the Commonwealth had expended &#163;1,000, obtained a job which he could have &#39;secured had he never been sent to England, and had never a single penny been spent upon him. To-day he is in charge of a ,big private concern, and is doing remarkably well. Another of these young men secured a good position in America, where he is doing excellent wark. Whilst 1 agree that the Commonwealth is entitled to some return for its expenditure upon Duntroon graduates, upon the other hand we have a right to see that during the eight years for which they will be bound to serve the Commonwealth as officers they receive fair play. It was a scandalous thing for the Commonwealth, after spending &#163;1,000 in sending a young fellow to England, to allow him, upon his return, to be appointed to a job which he could have obtained under any circumstances. </para>

          <para>. - I cannot agree with the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> that in the interests of economy Duntroon College should be discontinued, but he has set me thinking whether fair opportunities are given to those men who are now holding * certain positions in the Citizen Forces. Until something definite is done by the League of Nations to prevent wars Australia, of all countries in the world, cannot afford to relax her efforts in the direction of defence. While listening to the debate I could not help thinking that our system of training cadets at Duntroon is perhaps operating unfairly to those men who received their practical training on the battlefield. No doubt the Minister is quite correct in saying that some of the men who proved excellent leaders during warfare do not possess the necessary qualifications for successful administrators or for imparting instruction to recruits; but an ounce of practice always appeals -to me more forcibly than a ton of theory, and so I cannot see why these men with their practical experience of warfare cannot be properly equipped for instructional duties in a much shorter time than is now required for the training of our cadets. I should like to know if there is anything in our regulations to prevent those officers who satisfactorily served this country during the war from entering Duntroon College for short periods  of training for the particular duties they are asked to undertake. . </para>

            <para>- To what extent would they require training ? Having a thorough . knowledge of the .practical side of the military business all they need is &#39;&#39; topping off,&#34; as it were, in the duties &#39; of the administrative and instructional staff, and I should say that they would acquire this theoretical knowledge in about half the time necessary . for the training of raw recruits. I am an uncompromising advocate of preference to returned men. If it is possible for the Government to assist these men, I believe it should be done, because they have the practical side of their work at their fingers&#39; ends, and we should avoid, if possible, superseding them by Duntroon students, and casting them on the labour market. Surely we could enable them to acquire this knowledge without keeping the college going at its full strength in the training of recruits. I do not know that this would be economy, because no doubt the same staff would be required to teach 50 as to teach 100 or more students. I believe that if these men possess ordinary intelligence - and I have no doubt on that point - and have an interest in their profession, the Government should help them, rather than allow them to drift on in temporary employment, until the time comes for their replacement by Duntroon students. I know  the Minister&#39;s  heart and soul is in the business of his Department, and I hope, therefore, that something will be done. </para>

The Duntroon students are given an all-round training, and, when they go out from the college, may be posted to the artillery, engineers, infantry, or any other branch of the Service. </para>

            <para>- If the practice here is the same as in Great Britain, the men who get the highest marks in the last year are posted to the more scientific arm, that is to say, they go to the engineers or artillery. But every student has a grounding in all branches of the Service, whereas these sergeant-majors, who have strong claims for consideration, have been trained in only one branch. They are infantrymen or artillerymen pure and simple, so it will be difficult to adjust these men to a proper course of study. They have, however, rendered this country invaluable service. Long before the war they laid the foundation, in many cases, of out Citizen Army, and carried it on right through the war, doing, really magnificent work. They realize now that they are coming nearer to the time when they will be displaced by Duntroon students, and so, in the latter part of their middle age, they are faced with the probability of being obliged to take some labouring job. </para>

He suggested that while these men on active service proved very good men in the field, they were not necessarily good on the instructional and administrative side. But I want to point out that the men to whom I referred are those who for a great number of years were engaged on the administrative and instructional side of the Defence Department. </para>

            <para>- I am not suggesting that an officer in charge of musketry -does not know a little more about his work than a captain or a warrant officer under him. I consider it my duty to say that the non-commissioned officers in Australia are men who do a good deal of instructional work of greater importance than ordinary preliminary training, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> suggests. Some of the men holding non-commissioned rank in Australia have been to England to be trained, and a man I know of is one of the finest musketry instructors in Australia. There are other non-commissioned officers equally efficient if they are to be judged by their capacity for instructional and administrative work. I may mention as an illustration a man who was recently appointed Federal Secretary of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia; who was a noncommissioned officer prior to enlistment, but whose services abroad were so satisfactory that he became a Brigade-Major on the Staff in France. When he returned to Australia, despite the fact that he possessed sufficient instructional and administrative ability to be promoted to the rank of Brigade-Major when abroad, he was told that there was- no position carrying a commission available. What I fear in the future is that unless a man has the hallmark of Duntroon College on him, and is one of the &#34; socially elect,&#34; he will have no chance. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>VARDON  (South Australia) &#91;11.501.  -  The most important point in connexion with this discussion is the service required of a student, and, person: ally, I think it would be well if the term were reduced from eight to five years. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> may be able to convince me to the contrary, but I feel that a man having undergone a period of training at the Military College may find that he possesses some latent ability of which he had no previous knowledge. It is &#39;quite possible that some students may find after several years of instruction that they would be&#39; more successful in some other capacity where the remuneration would be more attractive. I do not think it advisable for students to be compelled to serve such a lengthy period, because it may not be of advantage to the individual, and on the other hand good men are required in other spheres  of  activity. In these circumstances I consider it desirable to limit the term to five years, and if any honorable senator is prepared to move in that direction I shall support him. </para>

            <para>- He might do so; but I do not think we should altogether regard Duntroon College as a high or public school, and allow him, after completing his course to follow other than a military career. Before a youth goes to Duntroon we may assume that he has made up his mind to become a soldier, and that he enters the College for that purpose. </para>

A case was brought under my notice a short time ago of a man who had served for a good many years as a sergeant-major on the Instructional Staff, and who also served with distinction abroad. On Lis return he was appointed to the Instructional Staff, but it was suddenly discovered that he was a quarter of an inch too short. </para>

            <para>- Probably they could not pull both. The ability of this man was not in question; but because he was a quarter of an inch below the regulation height he was superseded by a man who is practically new to the work. The man submitted his grievance to me, and I passed it on to the authorities. It <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> quite probable that the matter has not. been brought under the notice of the Minister for Defence, as it is impossible for him to keep in touch with the details of such a large Department. Notwithstanding the man&#39;s ability and experience abroad he has been placed on the scrapheap because he is slightly under the regulation height. During a period of  3tress  the Government were quite prepared to utilize his services to the full; but now the war is over there is no room for him. </para>

            <para>- A man with ability will get on anywhere. The Minister, not intentionally, but in the adroit manner .he always adopts, draws a conclusion from the argument one is submitting to the Senate different from that intended. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> puts the position more clearly than I succeeded in doing when he stated that there were returned men who were not only fit and capable to undertake the task of training our Forces, but who might be actually more fitted for such duties. The Minister has said, in explanation, that while a man may be an excellent leader during war operations, he may prove a poor instructor. My desire is that the authorities should permit a test. I suggest that every returned man who desires to do so should have the right to undergo&#39; an examination, together with Duntroon trainees. Men who have never seen the inside of Duntroon, and who have never even been to the Front, should have their opportunities, by way of competitive ex-, animation ; and if they proved more fitted than the Duntroon cadets they should be given preference in the matter of appointment to training positions. </para>

            <para>- They would not admit him unless he was properly trained in his craft. That, however,, does not bear upon my suggestion. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has opened my eyes concerning the future of our military college graduates. The chief purpose of Duntroon appears to be to produce schoolmasters. My idea was that Duntroon was to become an institution which would provide us with our military officers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> has set out the position of non-commissioned officers on the Instructional Staff, and he has pointed out that they are often better informed and more capable of training than the commissioned officers over them. The argument was questioned by some honorable senators. I have a keen recollection of the career of an individual from the early days of our Citizen Force training. He entered the service as a lieutenant, but so incompetent was he that he was hurriedly made a captain. He was absolutely unfitted to perform the duties attaching to that rank; so he was made a major. It was a standing joke among the men in the ranks to watch the performance as they marched out of camp each morning. The major would be sitting stiffly on his horse, and there would be an old sergeant-major, a British Army man, standing by his side. The troops, as .they passed, would watch the sergeant-major bring his heels together with a click as he came to attention, and they would hear him growl, <inline font-style="italic">sotto voce,</inline> &#34;The Brigade will move out in sections of four from the left.&#34; The major would then loudly repeat this order - sometimes, however, forgetting its completion when&#39; only half way through; whereupon, he would have to appeal to the sergeant-major again: to help him out. This kind of thing would go on in one camp after another, until the major rapidly became a general. The reason for his promotion was that he could not be trusted in any other jobs. The authorities could not always be telling off sergeant-majors to stand at his elbow and give him every order. &#34; All this is an absolute fact. </para>

        <para>As for Duntroon and the question of permitting outsiders to compete with trainees, I would remind the Minister for Defence that the men who were forced to remain behind and train our battalions have been treated very unfairly and, indeed, cruelly. They proved their efficiency, and now they are being turned out in order to make room for others. They were anxious to go to the Front; but, seeing that some one had to remain behind to train the raw battalions, the most efficient non-commissioned officers were selected and kept back. They never had a chance to gain commissioned rank, for there was a huge gap which they could not bridge. Why should there not be, in this democratic country, every opportunity to rise by each consecutive rung in the ladder of military promotion? Duntroon is being developed in the direction of making the military utterly exclusive and sheltered from the competition or interference of outsiders. If an outsider, with all the benefits of war service, could hold his own with the cadets, why should he not be given his chance ? </para>
        <para>As for the matter of binding down the Duntroon graduates to a period of eight years&#39; service, what attraction is there for them in the amount of pay which they may earn ? The Minister should not forget that the sacrifice is not all on one  Bide.  While it may cost the country a large sum to train these cadets, it should be remembered that if they had not entered Duntroon they might have been earning considerably more at the age of eighteen or nineteen than is available to them right up to. the end of their compulsory term of service. If the authorities cannot train and turn out enough graduates for the purposes of officering our Australian Forces, there is no insurmountable reason why the numbers of cadets who may be accommodated at Duntroon should not be increased. . No very considerable additional outlay would be involved. My chief aim in regard to military matters is to insure efficiency. Nothing could be more fatal to efficiency than to bind down those who enter the Military College to long terms of service at an inadequate remuneration. I regret that the obvious feeling of the Committee is against my proposal in regard to the clause under discussion. </para>

          <para>. - If there should arise any marked demand on the part of outsiders to enter into&#39; competitive examination with the Duntroon cadets, I think opportunities might be provided for them to  sit  for the Duntroon examination, just as there are chances for those who have not entered our universities to sit for university examinations. It should not be impossible, if deemed advisable, to conduct Duntroon on the lines of a university, and to throw open the examinations to outsiders. Such a procedure, I take it, would meet the ideas of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> and possibly&#39; numbers of Citizen Force officers might be ambitious to undergo such tests. I do not see that any harm would result, while possibly great good might follow. </para>

There is no reason why such an officer should be given preference over an officer who has not had service overseas because there is no difference between their military qualifications. There are certain officers who have served abroad in purely administrative positions.

          <para>. - I thank the Minister for his further explanation. I had the impression from his previous remarks that the omission of the word &#34;abroad&#34; was to prevent the penalizing of any member of the Australian Imperial Force who, for military reasons, had to remain in Australia during the war. </para>

          <para>.- The drift of the discussion, if the Minister&#39;s explanation is correct, and I do not doubt that it is, leads me to the conclusion that the Com&#34;mittee, in agreeing to clause 9, &#34;will deliberately do a great injustice to a number of valuable men in the military service. I take the case of men who volunteered for active service, but whose services in the organization of the Forces here were held to be so valuable that they  were  not permitted to go to the Front. Many of these men were actually looking for any opportunity to get away, but they were always met with the official- reply that their services were required in Australia. These requests to  be  allowed to go to the Front were made to such an extent that a regulation was issued preventing men soliciting permission to go abroad. </para>

            <para>- Quite so. Honorable senators should consider the the injustice that may be done under this clause. I take the case of a man holding &#39; the  Tank  of captain who was not permitted to go to the Front because of the value of his services here. Another officer, his junior, was allowed to go away as a lieutenant. In two years this junior officer rises to the rank of colonel, and then the man who was a captain when this man went away, and is still a captain, is permitted to go to the Front and serve under the colonel who had been his junior, because the junior was given an opportunity that was never given to the captain. If we, at this stage, agree to a clause which may have the effect of inflicting grave injustice upon men who were prevented from going to the Front because of their efficiency, we shall be doing the Military Service no good. We shall, on the other hand, be continuing throughout their military careers the injustice inflicted upon men who were prevented from securing promotion in the early days of the war by being compelled to remain in Australia. We are going to say that, no .matter what position they may occupy, cr what their abilities may be, there shall be no more promotion for these men. That is not justice. It is not a fair deal. If these men were prevented from going to the Front after they volunteered, and if their persistency in trying to get away was such that the Defence authorities had to make a regulation imposing a penalty upon a man for trying to get away, I cannot agree with honorable senators if they decide, by passing this clause, to further penalize such men for the term of their natural life. To test the feeling of the Committee, I move - </para>

            <para>- There was a regulation of that sort framed during the early stages of the war, hut before the conflict ended every officer who wished to go to the Front was at liberty to do so. Of course, there were certain officers who desired to go upon active service, and whose names were submitted to the General Officer Commanding overseas, who said that he did not want them. Most of those officers are now out of the Service. The amendment is entirely unnecessary. </para>

          <para>, The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner ) has completely ignored the explanation given by the Minister regarding this clause. Instead of the officer to whom he referred being penalized, he will be protected by this clause. The supposititious case put forward by Senator Gardiner about the captain who was retained in Australia in order that he might prepare the men about to proceed to the Front sounded all right for the moment. But the Minister has since explained that an officer of similar rank might have been in charge of troops upon a transport, and that, under existing conditions, he enjoys a</inline> considerable  advantage over the officer to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> referred. The clause will remove that injustice. </para>

Surely it is reasonable that v/e should continue the policy of recognising actual service upon the field of battle, by giving a preference, other things being equal, to those who have incurred all of the risks of war. * It is perfectly clear that the object of the clause is not to inflict injustice upon the officers who remained in Australia, but to remove an injustice by placing them upon the same footing as officers who were engaged upon transports during the war. </para>

          <para>.- I listened very carefully to the statement of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> and it was because of his statement that I submitted the amendment. I ask honorable senators whether an officer who was prevented from going to the Front should be obliged to suffer because his superiors would not permit him to go? That is the question upon which I desire to get a decision. </para>

            <para>- But a hard case may illustrate a bad law which should be remedied. I am not putting an isolated case, because whenever a new brigade was going to the Front there were any number of applications from officers who desired to accompany it. Indeed, the trouble became so acute that a regulation was issued forbidding these men to apply for permission to go upon active service. These officers acted under orders, and did their joh well. Now, when the war is over, we are asked to say that they shall have no promotion in .the future. </para>

            <para>- I do not wish to prevent the advancement of men who went to the Front. I am concerned only with officers who were kept here because they were efficient, and upon whom the  training of our troops actually depended. Under this clause a man who joins the Service to-day may become a captain at the end of perhaps three or. four years. Then, when it comes to a question of promotion, that man will be promoted over the heads of officers, with perhaps twenty years&#39; service who were prevented by the Defence Department from going to the Front. The provision will inflict a grave injustice upon such officers, and will put  a  stigma upon them merely because they were prevented from going to the Front because their services were required here. </para>

            <para>- The permanent officer in our Military Forces who refuses to go to the Front when his services are required there should be put out of the Service. But if officers who were kept in Australia because of the valuable services which they were continually rendering in the preparation of our troops are to be prevented from gaining promotion in the. future, they will be. the victims of a very grave injustice. Have these men. shirked their duty in any way? Did they not volunteer ? </para>

            <para>- Yes, but the point to be emphasized is the interpretation of the words &#34; if not inconsistent with the context.&#34; If they were eliminated I agree that the difficulty would be satisfactorily solved. This section was passed as being applicable, to the British Act, and in its present form it by no means excludes the supposition that there may be some form of so-called active service here, at home. I think, from that point of view, it is advisable to retain the word &#34;abroad.&#34; </para>

I presume, then, that the Minister will not regard their services as being more valuable than the services of an officer doing training work in Australia. </para>

In  connexion with the question raised concerning members- of the Permanent Forces who were unable to go on active service, I have made inquiries, and find that there were two sections, which were dealt with in a different manner.&#39; The members of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery were prevented from going abroad in the early stages of the war; but I am unable at this juncture to give the date when they were released and allowed to volunteer, but it was, I think, during 191-6 or 1917. That release did not apply to other members of the Permanent Force. On the 23rd July, 1918, the Military Board recommended that all members of the Permanent Forces should be given an opportunity of going on active service in such capacities as could be arranged, and that was approved and promulgated on the 24th July, 1918. </para>

            <para>- Then it would have been contrary to military discipline. I understand from the Minister&#39;s statement that a number applied, and were permitted to leave Australia. My contention is that an order was issued - I want to be quite clear upon this - prohibiting men from applying. Applications were numerous, and I have a very clear recollection of some restriction being placed on the men. &#39; I am not stating definitely that an order was issued, because I do not claim to have a very clear recollection of the incident; but there are things that come under one&#39;s notice that are not forgotten in a hurry. I shall be glad if the Minister for Defence will make further inquiries, because if I cannot get the desired information in this way I shall place a question on the notice-paper so that it shall be supplied. If an order was issued in 1914 or 1915 prohibiting permanent officers from applying to go abroad with . the Australian Imperial Force, and that order was not cancelled until 24th July, 1918, I feel sure that  honorable, senators will see that the men affected did not receive a fair deal, because during the whole .time they remained in Australia they were not entitled to promotion. That is what I have been arguing . throughout the debate. I &#171;m under the impression that a regulation, or a general order, or something of that nature, was issued to prevent them from going abroad. </para>

            <para>- I had .a slight connexion with the Defence Department which may have brought me somewhat prominently into the matter, but this was something I had nothing to do with. The Minister for Defence gave me a certain section of the work to attend to - I have no complaints to make - but I was not conversant with all that was happening. One would naturally be more impressed with &#39;what was brought under one&#39;s direct notice; but I have a strong belief that officers were prevented by a military order from going abroad. The statement which has just been made by the Minister for Defence shows that a certain section of the men were not released until the 24th July, 1918. </para>

            <para>- That is so. Surely honorable senators can see the unfairness of the whole position, because if a man applied in July or August, 1918, he would he open to all sorts of imputations, and probably be charged with endeavouring to go overseas when there seemed a possibility of the conflict terminating. I think I have clearly stated my reasons for moving in this direction, and honorable senators will realize that I have done so in an endeavour to prevent these men being unjustly treated. </para>

        <para>During the course of - this debate we have listened- to some interesting statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> and other honorable senators, and sufficient has been said to prove that a good deal of dissatisfaction exists. There is an impression abroad that appointments go by favour, and that they are in the hands of a military clique. I do not think any one will say that that impression has been caused by the statement of one person; but the impression exists. It is understood that if an officer has the support of a certain section of the Administrative Staff all goes well, but if that support is lacking his position is hopeless. I followed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> very closely when referring to the . case of &#34;Albert Jacka. I have had the pleasure of reading a report written by  Colonel Courtney  concerning the circumstances under which Captain Jacka won his distinction, and the value of the report is increased by the fact that it was written before the honour was conferred upon the gallant soldier- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman&#39;s</inline> references to the incident, although very excellent, corroborated practically all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> had said. The fact that Jacka&#39;s report as Intelligence Officer did not go to the General Officer Commanding does not carry much weight, . as I take it that Jacka&#39;s superior officers would not have forwarded the report above their own signature if  they did not think that it was substantially correct. The fact remains that after a certain incident, particulars of which have been&#39; related, this fine officer did not receive any more publicity, which clearly indicates that there is something lacking in our Military Department. No room should be left for false impressions, and w&#169; should draft our Acts in such a way that men cannot be unjustly treated. I am obliged for the information which the Minister tas given, and I trust that later on he will supplement it &#34;with the particulars I desire. I know from experience that the Minister will be quite prepared to give all the information at his disposal, even though it may not suit his case. &#39; I&#39; still assert that in the early stages of the war many were prevented from going abroad, and. I am supported in that contention by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.</inline></para>

I do not wish to thresh this matter threadbare, though the Minister&#39;s statement bears out what I have already said.

          <para>.- I direct attention to the penalties set out in connexion with infringements. It seems incredible that any employer would refuse to take an apprentice into his service again after he had been compelled to absent himself owing to military duties. However, should such a case occur, a fine of &#163;50 would be inadequate. The offence is, in my opinion, a criminal one of the worst type. If an employer is so antagonistic to the defence of his country as to penalize an employee by dismissal merely because he has compulsorily attended his. military duty, he should be punished by a term of imprisonment. There were cases during the war where certain employers - either anti-militarist or indifferent to the defence of Australia - refused to take back their mcn upon returning home. Such conduct may well be repeated in the future, either in time of peace or war. I therefore move:- </para>

            <para>- What I mean  is  that they would be liable to imprisonment instead of to a monetary penalty, no matter what extenuating circumstances they might be able to advance. If the honorable senator were to suggest that, in addition to the fine, there should be an alternative of imprisonment, that would give the authorities the opportunity to exercise their discretion, and deal with each case on its merits. . It is quits possible that at the outbreak of hostilities an employer might be conducting a highly prosperous business, enabling him to employ a number of apprentices. Something might happen during the war period  which would so diminish his business that at the close of the war it would be quite impossible for him to employ the same staff of apprentices as be had before the war. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> by his amendment, proposes that such an employer should be imprisoned because he could not comply with the Act. </para>

            <para>- We have to provide for exceptional cases, and the provision should be made so elastic as to give the authorities the discretion necessary to mete out justice. I hold no brief for the employer who has taken advantage of the absence of an apprentice fighting for his country, in order to refuse to re- employ him on his return. It is my desire that every returned soldier should, on his return, secure as good, if not a better position, than that which he occupied before he went to the war. But I think it would be dangerous to accept so severe a penalty as that proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> when in the case of some offenders against the clause there might be extenuating circumstances which would not justify the imposition of the penalty of imprisonment. The honorable senator would be better advised if he proposed that provision should be made for a fine or for imprisonment, so that the merits of each case might be considered. </para>

If an employer refuses to re-employ an employee because of his military service, a pretty stiff penalty is proposed by the Bill. If honorable senators do not consider &#163;50 a sufficient maximum penalty for the offence, I have no objection to increasing it or to accepting a proposal for an alternative of imprisonment.. I think that we should allow the monetary penalty to remain, as there might be cases in which it would be reasonable to give an employer the benefit of the doubt. On the other hand, there might be very serious cases where punishment by imprisonment would not be too severe. </para>

          <para>, -  The suggestion offered by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> is a wise one. The end&#39;s which legislation has had in view have often been defeated by undue viciousness in legislative provisions. I recently came across a case where a contractor to the Australian Navy was a company. It was really a proprietary company, but there was only one man concerned. He defrauded the Australian Government and the Navy. When the officers of the Crown Law Department got on his track they found that the only punishment provided for his offence was imprisonment, but they found also that they could not imprison a limited liability company. Consequently, this- &#34; scallywag &#34; who took down the Australian Navy  got  off scot-free from any consequences of  his  &#39; illegal . action. I think  that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> would be  well  advised if he proposed to add after  the  words, &#34; Fifty pounds &#34;  the  words,   and,  or  six  months&#39; imprisonment.&#34; </para>

            <para>- Yes. For reasons of his own, reasons of his business,, of his environment, and peculiar &#39; to his own case. The penalty imposed by the Bill for an offence against the clause is &#163;50. That is the maximum penalty that could -be enforced under the clause. I ask honorable senators on one side or the other not to suggest savage penalties, such as a penalty of six months&#39; imprisonment for an offence against this clause would .be. . I am not keen at any time that this Legislature should force upon the people of Australia a system that, in , the whirligig of international events, might shortly be found to be altogether unnecessary. This proposal will go abroad, and a very bad impression of the action of the Committee will be formed. I intend to oppose any suggestion of a- military caste or a military clique so far as the imposition of penalties in the administration of the Defence Act is concerned. I must oppose such a penalty as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has suggested. </para>

            <para>- I do not think my remarks on this measure justifies the Minister&#39;s suggestion that I am &#34; agin &#34; the Government all the time. I thought, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> was speaking, that if an employer deliberately used his power to prevent a youth in his service from doing his military training, in the&#39; interests of the country, almost any penalty was good enough for him; but while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> was speaking so effectively against the proposal, I could see, with him, the gradual encroachment of the military influence on the civil power. I think now,, that there is room for thought concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle&#39;s</inline> amendment. Why should penalties for military offences be more savage - if I may use the term - than penalties for civil offences? I am satisfied that if the penalty be made so severe no Courts in Australia will order any imprisonment for offences of this kind. At all times the penalties must be commensurate with the offence, otherwise we shall never get a conviction. </para>

            <para>- I see the position quite clearly. And if it is for the protection of the apprentice, why not provide that, instead of six months&#39; imprisonment, the employers be required to pay, say, six months wages to his. apprentice <inline font-style="italic">&#39;i</inline> That certainly would be some protection for the apprentice. &#34;We must look at the facts as they confront us. We must realize that if an employer really wants to get rid of an apprentice, he need not commit an offence against the provisions of this Bill at all. I venture to say that, in order to evade a conviction, he would take good care to re-engage his apprentice at the conclusion of his period of training, and then discharge him for some other offence. </para>

          <para>. -  After the fine appeal by my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> on behalf of the employing classes, I should like to- say a word or two for the employed, for the apprentice, who, to my mind, is more worthy of consideration in a matter of this sort than anybody &#39; else. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> have both missed the point. The clause proposes to establish a penalty for the employers who refuse to engage or reestablish in their work an apprentice who has bet- n called away to do &#39;military training. The position is perfectly clear. An apprentice, by the law of the land, is required to do certain military training or war service ; he may bc away -a week or- two, or longer, and in th:s clause we are providing that when his period of military service is completed he shall, at least, be assured re-engagement by hk employer. This, I submit, is entirely in the interest of the apprentice. We do not want it to go forth that this Senate has so little real concern for the interests of apprentices, and other employees, as to make no effort to protect them in such circumstances. We want to take away from the employer the right to refuse re-engagement to any employee who may be taken away temporarily from his employment to do military training. It is refreshing to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> speaking on behalf of the employer. As a rule, the employer is well able to look after himself. He has at his disposal other means of getting rid of an apprentice whose services are not satisfactory. The articles of apprenticeship contain provisions to this end. We want to be sure that the interests of no apprentice shall be sacrificed by reason of any Act of Parliament compelling him to do certain military training whether he likes it or not. I hope the clause will be allowed to stand. </para>

I should be glad, also, if it could be provided that some of those penalties could be directed into the pockets of the people who suffered, because, after all, it is not much satisfaction to a man who has been discharged because he has been called upon to do military training, to find that his former employer has been penalized to the extent of 5s. or &#163;50, or imprisoned for twenty-four hours or until the rising of the Court. </para>

            <para>- That will not affect my argument, which is that if there is a monetary penalty in connexion with this, and no other, it is more likely to protect the employer&#39;s apprentice than if we had a sentence of imprisonment up to six months. It must not be overlooked that not only cadets are affected, but men who go on military service for a period of years. I believe that, as the months roll on, the Minister will find it more and more apparent that our Defence Acts and military methods will very largely have to go into the melting pot. If a sentence of six months&#39; imprisonment is added to the penalty, it would give greater power to the military authorities to deal with an apprentice in whatever form they like, because his interests will not always . be considered. To carry the argument to its extreme, a Force could be sent to Thursday Island, Rabaul, or any other of the Possessions under the Commonwealth control, and kept there on military service for twelve months, or even two years. In such a case, those serving would be considered to be on service, and the military authorities would allow both the employers&#39; interests, and, in certain circumstances, the apprentices&#39; interests, to go hang. </para>

          <para>.I believe that power is given to the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> under the Defence Act to grant exemption from service wherever hardship would be imposed upon the person called up, and consequently, if the Act is administered in a sympathetic manner there is power for the Minister to grant exemptions in cases of hardship. On the other hand, nothing is provided in the principal Act to assist an employer who may be detrimentally affected by his apprentices being taken away. If the Minister has power under the Act to grant an exemption to- an apprentice in cases of hardship, it is not unreasonable to ask - although I do not see how it can be done in this clause - that similar exemption should be granted to the employer, the success of whose business may depend upon the assistance of his apprentices. If the clause is passed in its present form, perhaps it could be redrafted so that power could be given to the Minister to grant exemptions. </para>

The honorable senator will see that this provision is designed to protect an apprentice against a. master who desired to take advantage of his compulsory absence. An apprentice is bound to his employer under articles which provide that the service shall be continuous. On the return of an apprentice from war service, an employer may say, &#34; These articles provide that your service shall be continuous, and as you have violated them by going away, your apprenticeship cannot be continued.&#34; If a youth goes abroad to serve his country, the Government have provided that he cannot be punished, and, therefore, a penalty of &#163;50 can be imposed on an employer who treats an apprentice unfairly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was advocating the interests of the employer, and he could not understand why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> was supporting the apprentice. The honorable senator has lost sight of the fact that it is the employer who would be involved, and that we are trying to protect the apprentice against an unjust employer. </para>

            <para>- On the question of penalties, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> said that if we make them too severe we are likely to defeat the intentions of the Act; but directly after that he said that we were only protecting the apprentice, and not the. youth who is not an apprentice. In that plea he would wax eloquent, and say, &#34;You are only protecting one class.&#34; My answer to that is that it is quite true. In one case we have clear evidence that a lad was engaged in an employer&#39;s service, but in the other we have no clear evidence that it would be continuous. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> objected to the penalty because he thought it would protect the employer. The employer undertakes to keep a lad in his employ for a certain period, and when he returns he may endeavour to break the arrangement, in which case the Government have power to impose a penalty of &#163;50. </para>

          <para>.- I  have  listened  with  interest to the arguments submitted, and I am totally opposed to vicious or savage penalties. I think the Government would have been well advised if they had allowed the clause to remain as it is. Honorable senators will remember that  100  years ago the laws throughout the world, including those in our own Empire, were extraordinarily severe, and men were transported for stealing a pocket handkerchief or killing a rabbit. </para>

            <para>- The point I wish to make is that this is a civilized age, when the public are more amenable to the laws of the land, and when punishments provided in&#39; regard to breaches of the law are no longer savage or out of proportion to the nature of the offence. If any employer, in the exercise of what he believed to be his rights, were to attempt to dismiss an apprentice, it would be rightly regarded as a savage form of punishment if he were landed in gaol without redress. The tendency of the infliction of such punishments would be. to turn the public mind against our military laws altogether. It might even swing the people right over from a state of obedience to law to the embracing of Bolshevism. </para>
