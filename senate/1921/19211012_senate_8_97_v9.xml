Vestey Brothers are closing down their splendid freezing works at Port Darwin ? (b) if so, do the Government realize the seriousness to Australia of such a retrograde step in the development of a necessary primary industry ? (c) do the Government intend to take any action to endeavour to encourage Vestey Brothers not to dismantle their works, or, generally, to protect employers in the Northern Territory, and in other parts of Australia, from the persecution by certain unions ? </para>

                            <para>. - Circumstances constrain me to bring my remarks to a somewhat speedy close. When the debate was adjourned last evening I was just about to deal with the momentous appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> our Minister for Defence, as our 'delegate to the Disarmament Conference at Washington. It is very much to the credit of the Senate, as a deliberative body, and particularly representative of the Australian people, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said, that on an occasion like this the spirit of party should be so entirely absent as to enable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> who is one of the leaders opposed to the Government, to get up in his place and most chivalrously and generously applaud the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who is now on his way as our envoy to the gathering at Washington. The opinion was hazarded by some persons that the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> would arouse a chorus of disapproval from the Australian people. I am glad to say that such a protest has been almost entirely absent. It was a predication falsified by the event. What better appointment in the circumstances could have been made? It is true that the representation of Australia by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> would have been acclaimed, and properly acclaimed, and would, perhaps, have had the very best results in regard to the proper presentation of Australian opinion to the delegates who will assemble at that great Conference. But the Prime Minister could not go, and such representative members of the Administration as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph.</inline> Cook and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen, who so worthily acquitted himself in our interests at Geneva, also could not go. In the circumstances, therefore, what better appointment could have been made than that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce?</inline> The fact remains that he had the longest term of office of any Minister for War in any Government of the ' nations engaged in the great struggle from which the Empire and its Allies have so happily emerged. He was not Minister for Defence at the beginning of the struggle, for it must be said to the credit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen that he, with consummate ability and great dash organized, equipped, and despatched the first  20,000  men as Australia's contribution to the conflict. But the Ministry of which he was a member was defeated at the polls shortly after the outbreak of war. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> then took the reins of office, and. held them until the struggle waa happily consummated. The magnitude of the effort made by the nations engaged in the struggle dwarfed everything that had hitherto been attempted by the greatest empires of the world. And let it not be forgotten that the effort put forward by the Commonwealth and the people of Australia, whom the Government represented, transcended altogether any previous military effort made by the British Empire, notwithstanding its great inheritance and glory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> sent more than  300,000  men from Australia overseas. No British Minister had ever equipped- or sent forth an expeditionary force of anything like the size of the Australian Imperial Force </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is quite right: Therefore I say that the dispassionate judgment of posterity will accord to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> the merit at least of having been successful in his great effort, and success, as we know, is the touchstone by which his administration will be measured when other circumstances have been completely forgotten by the Australian people two or three generations hence. They will then be able to see in proper perspective the achievement of the man who held the reins of our war administration during the recent European war. I hope, and, indeed, I feel sure, that in his mission to Washington <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will be accorded a full measure of practical, sentimental, and political support by the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>As for the Conference itself, honorable senators will know that some years ago I took the initiative in this Chamber, which collectively most loyally supported me, in regard to the representation of Australia's interests at Washington. I could see, to use a word which I am not particularly fond of, that the orientation of events, so to speak, was towards the United States of America; that the United States of America, with its 110,000,000 of people, speaking the English language, occupying a territory rich in material resources, a people rich in technical skill, rich in racial energy, and rich in business ability, was destined to become one of the greatest, if not the greatest, Power in the world for all the generations that are likely to concern us at all events. Some years ago I suggested - in fact my motion was agreed to by the Senate - that if the exigencies of British diplomacy did not make it undesirable for Australia to have representation at Washington, the Commonwealth should be represented there by a gentleman of at least the status of a High Commissioner, who would be in touch with the people of the United States of America., and apprise them, of the Australian view point upon matters in which our common interests may be involved. If we had been so represented many of the difficulties that have arisen in connexion with Australia's representation at the forthcoming Conference would have been avoided, because the American people would have been familiarized with Australian . ideals and aspirations in connexion with Pacific questions. Anyhow, the time has come, and I feel sure that the Administration, as disclosed by the answer .given by the Minister to my question, have determined upon a policy of representation of Australian interests a,t Washington. Without saying anything in detraction of the Mother Country, which is the prime factor in the British Empire, it is just as important that the Commonwealth should be permanently represented a.t Washington as it is that we should be permanently represented in London. Such a proposition cannot logically be gainsaid. I trust that the Minister will, at an early date, in connexion with the question, at least disclose what the policy of the Government will be,' because a policy is very shortly to be disclosed as indicated by the favorable reply to my question, and it is to be hoped that it will be one that will be put into operation at the earliest possible opportunity. I do not suggest that it is essential to put the proposed policy into operation while the Minister for Defence is our representative at the Washington Conference, but thereafter. Australia should be represented at the capital of the United States of America by one of her proved and tried statesmen. We need not be too eulogistic, but I believe that the Commonwealth does possess men equal to any of the world's best statesmen. Sections of the Australian press have been very hostile all along to Australia's representation at Washington; but pressmen are only human beings, and, like politicians, are not infallible. I do not hold it against them as a crime .because they did not see the desirableness of it; but it must be to the credit of the Senate of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia that it had sufficient imagination and foresight to indicate to the Government its desire to have Australia properly represented at Washington several years ago. In regard to the Disarmament Conference, it may be that I am, as has been said of a French statesman, owing to advanced years, " somewhat dry of soul and somewhat empty of hope." I am not altogether empty of hope that the Conference may produce successful results; but men, whether as individuals, or races, or nations, are still full of jealousies and passions, and still possess envy and the desire to fight. Man is a fighting animal, and, although it will be exceedingly difficult to get anything very tangible in the way of results from the Conference, let us hope for the best. I know not what the results may be. I am not a prophet, but I hope for the best. Although I hope not for much, I fear not at all. But this has to be said: Unless this Conference is an unqualified success it will be a failure. It cannot be a partial success, because modified success will only retard the approach of the inevitable hour. Honorable senators  and  others  who have conversed with me in private and in public know what I mean when I speak of the approach of the inevitable hour. </para>

                            <para>- If that is done it will be a great success; but failing anything like an agreement between the great Powers of the earth it will do what it was never intended to do, accelerate the approach of the great convulsion that I think reasonable men fear. Let us hope that mankind, having been sufficiently -chastised during the recent great conflict, does sincerely long for a permanent peace. But the desire for peace is not as greatly iu. evidence as some philosophers would have us believe. If I were to attempt to tabulate the number of wars in progress, the rumours of possible wars, the many threats of the destruction of rapes and nations, it would be a difficult task. But let me say that all the evidence tends to show that after all the world is an abattoir. Man is a fighting animal, struggling for supremacy, and by some mysterious law he cannot at times help himself. Some nations and some men cannot refrain from fighting, and the desire seems to be growing. There is one nation to which I would like to refer, and towards which I have the most friendly feeling - I refer to Portugal. Portuguese territory is within two or three days' sail from Port Darwin; and at Timor, of which Dilly is the principal port, it has been the custom for hundreds of years to moor vessels to trees.  Can honorable senators imagine strong, virile nations being likely to- tolerate such a practice? We may talk about dispensing with war, but we will have something that will produce the same result as war. We will have conquests in one form or another; and, while other nations are progressing and increasing their populations, no nation will be allowed to remain in possession of a territory when it is content to moor vessels to trees instead of providing adequate and modern wharf accommodation. Portugal is to have representation at the Washington Conference. Honorable senators know that I am a strong Imperialist. I know the American Government has to recognise the British Empire as a diplomatic entity; but such important Dominions as Canada and Australia should have separate representation. I do not wish at this juncture to encroach, upon my privileges by dealing with the motion of which I have given notice; but the Australian Commonwealth has as great an interest as, if not a greater interest than, Portugal, or even Holland, in the Pacific and the settlement of those questions which are incidental to the consideration of Pacific matters. Holland has extensive territory to the north, which she has used very well. Australia has a very great concern in these matters, and as a virile people we should not only populate this continent, but in time extend our population to the Mandated Territories. In doing so it will be a most difficult matter for use to avoid a clash of interests with other nations. </para>

                    <para>The work of our envoy to the Washington Conference is most difficult. He has nothing to give away. He can consent to a procedure in regard to disarmament and * advise us that it is desirable to do certain things. But there are other. questions in connexion with which he cannot give anything away. All the people of Australia believe in the laudable ideal of preserving this continent for the white races of the earth, not with the idea of absolutely excluding the entrance of a coloured man, but so that the white races shall be protected from, too great an impregnation by coloured "people. In regard to the White Australia policy, I subscribe my adherence to what, after all, is a most interesting experiment, for maintaining what may be regarded as a human national park for the preservation of the white races. These questions are of the greatest human and scientific interest; and, as I have said, our delegate has nothing to give away. Therefore, let' us understand how difficult his task is, and, as a minister of the gospel would say, " Let us support him spiritually with our prayers." Although I am allowed a good deal of latitude in discussing this motion, I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> you would bring me to task if I debated the terms of the motion of which, I have already given notice. I shall not incidentally discuss these matters, because it would be somewhat unfair, and would be taking undue advantage of the wide latitude allowed on such an occasion as this. I hope, though, that the Administration will recognise that, in order properly to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> there should be uttered, or issued, a sort of declaration of faith and rights on the part of the Australian people as represented by this National Legislature. We want to show to the nations our intentions, our desires our sympathies, in regard to this matter. We want to show them that we are willing to disarm, that we desire to be and to remain in friendly relationship with all peoples of the earth. We wish to indicate, at the same time, that our interests are to us as grave, as vital, indeed, as are the Pacific interests of any other nation. We want to show, further, that we have, as the Scotch preacher advised, " a good conceit of ourselves"; for if Australia, with a population of nearly 6,000,000 white people, tamely submitted to the non-representation of its interests except in a roundabout fashion, while the interests of such a country as Portugal are to be represented at the Conference by a direct delegation, it would become indeed necessary that something should be said. While I am not an aggressive Australian, and do not wish to see the Commonwealth take up a jingoistic attitude, the Australian people can deservedly hold their heads high; and this Commonwealth Government - any Government of Australia - can do the same. That being the case, -let us see that we are not relegated, so to speak, to the wash-house, but that we are given the prominence which a nation  of 6^000,000 English-speaking people - an almost unsullied white race - merits and can legitimately claim. I am most willing to withdraw my motion; it were well, indeed, that instead thereof the Government should accept my suggestion. I feel sure that the attitude of the Ministry is not hostile to the matters which I have been speaking upon. I emphasize that a kind of declaration of faith, intention, and attitude on the part of the Australian people would be one of the strongest factors which could be called into existence for the support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline></para>

                    <para>In regard to what may be called the practical side of the Budget, honorable senators were speaking of the expensive tastes of modern -white Democracies in the course of yesterday's debate. Reference was made to the tremendous number of functions which a Government is called on to perform in a country such as Australia, and to the continual requests and demands preferred which necessitate national expenditure. The same rule holds good with regard to the administration of a white Democracy as in respect of the ordinary domestic affairs of a member of such a Democracy. A Japanese Judge, a man of light and learning, would probably receive the equivalent of <inline font-style="italic">£60</inline> sterling per annum in payment for his services upon the Bench. Who would think of paying an Australian Judge of the Supreme Court only £60 per annum ? We live more expensively than do the people of many other races. Our scheme of civilization, our tastes also, and our culture are more costly; although I do not say, in respect of the last named, that it is of a better quality. Of necessity, the cost of government in such a country as ours is immeasurably higher than elsewhere. A Government is, after all, only representative of the life of the units composing the nation itself. And, if it costs a white man and his family £4 or £5 per week to live, it must cost a white man's Government proportionately the same to carry on, so that its functions can bear comparison only in1 regard to their magnitude with the cost of government of a civilization of a more economical character. We cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs. We cannot have what the Australian Democracy demands without calling upon that Democracy to draw pretty deeply from its pockets. We cannot have good government without paying for it - certainly not such government as the Australian people demand. Therefore, a good deal of the talk about economy has been and is very general. Economy is always desirable if it can be satisfactorily practised; but I, personally, would not be able to take the Budget and so analyze it as to be able to convince this Chamber that the Government could save millions of money without impairing the efficiency  of our national services. It is all very well for various and differing organizations to pass resolutions in favour of economy without at the same time offering even one practical suggestion for the saving of as much as £100,000. </para>
                    <para>I desire to refer briefly to the proposal for the holding of a Federal Convention for the manifest and declared purpose of substantially altering the Constitution. I look upon the Constitution as being, on the whole, a highly satisfactory instrument of government. It is true that the progress of a couple of decades has disclosed that there are some difficulties in accommodating State and Federal  functions with respect to legislation and administration. There is 'an occasional overlapping. Now and again a "Noman'sland " has to be traversed, in which a succession of Judicatures has to be called upon to decide which are State and which are Federal functions of legislation. But that sort of indefiniteness is inseparable from the Federal system of government, and it was contemplated, indeed, when the Constitution was laid down. I do not say that there will not come a time when events will have so clearly crystallized as to permit us to perceive such defects, such disabilities, in the national Constitution as will appeal to the reason of practically all electors, and cause the Constitution to be remodelled, or, at any rate, altered to a certain degree, by the machinery which the Constitution itself provides. The great men who formed this instrument of government were called together by a Convention, it is true ; but that was necessary, for there was, at the time, but a very shadowy Federal body, namely, the Federal Council, and it possessed only very limited powers. But the instrument which that body conceived and recommended to the Australian people for adoption, carried within it machinery which can be -easily and satisfactorily operated by the Commonwealth Legislature to-day, and at any time, for the periodical amendment of the Constitution. Many attempts have been made" to alter the Constitution, although the Commonwealth has been in being for less than a quarter of a century, but few have been successful. </para>

                            <para>- There were the alteration in regard to State debts, and the alteration . of the period for the election of senators - matters of expediency which were carried into effect without difficulty. Except for those matters, the Commonwealth Constitution has not been altered, although the people have been expressly appealed to, from time to time, by men who wish to alter the Constitution for their particular party purposes. To the good sense of the people of Australia, let it be credited that the people have always refused to have their Constitution altered for party purposes and for the purpose of securing party  objectives,  and I think they always will. I am fully sensible of the fact that there are certain difficulties, which seem to be more or less completely disclosed, in the Commonwealth Constitution. The time is altogether premature for the calling of a Convention, which, according to some people, who intend to get representation through it, will have for its task the complete re-modelling of Australia's instrument of government. There is an organization which is called the Australian Legion, and which has in contemplation dictation to the States as to how many Chambers their Legislatures should comprise. Part of their Federal Convention programme is to have the States reduced to one House each. </para>

                            <para>- What has that to do with the Commonwealth Convention ? While I do not completely commit myself to opposition to the proposal, I am afraid there will be an attempt by a certain gentleman to acquire the portfolio of the Treasury again; and if ever he gets into power, to reduce the payment which is being made to the States. Of such action I entirely disapprove. One of the best things for the Australian people to do is to use the State Parliaments, where then can function more satisfactorily than the Commonwealth Parliament through being in direct touch with  most of the secondary industries and interests. If I had my way, so convinced am I that Australia is too big to be wisely governed from one centre, that if I were called upon to do anything in the way of remodelling the Constitution, I would not give the Commonwealth more functions of government, but I would restrict the operations of this Parliament to four or five major matters only. What do we know of the troubles of the Northern Territory? It is too far away from. us. Australia is too big. Who can intelligently discuss the state of affairs in connexion with the administration of New Guinea? I know I cannot. Of the grievances of New Guinea I hear but the faintest echo. We have men here from other States who are going to make representations about the unsatisfactory nature of legislation, which there is very little doubt the Commonwealth Parliament is competent to pass. If we axe wise we shall be very careful before we pull down the great wall of our Constitution, which is now only green. Let the people govern themselves under the present Constitution for the next fifty years with such amendments as their Legislatures regard, and as the people indicate by referendum, as necessary. When all nations are combining, out of chagrin, and from their load of debt, to throw society into the melting pot, we in Australia. - this rock of safety under the British flag - should hesitate before we liberate the revolutionary forces which will try to do things to which we cannot agree. </para>

                            <para>. - This is a very opportune time, as we are not overburdened with business, to bring forward a matter which has already been before the Senate, and has been dealt with up to a certain point by a Select Committee. I refer to the matter of the officers of the Senate. We have a Public Service </para>

                        <para class="block">Bill on the business paper, and I think the evidence taken by the Select' Committee will be very useful to honorable senators when they are considering that measure. When I brought the matter before the Senate on the first occasion, very few of us had any great knowledge as to the kind of regulations those officers were working under. All we knew about the matter was that they were under the Public Service Act. Apart from that, neither the Senate generally nor the House Committee know very much .about the regulations governing our servants., I thought the matter would be discussed without trouble, and that honorable senators would be glad of the opportunity to clear up the doubt surrounding the position, but to my surprise a great deal of hostility was encountered. We were wrongly told that I was proposing the appointment of a Committee to inquire into the working of other Committees. I was informed that the Select Committee could do nothing, and that the Public Service Act would have to be altered. I knew the Act would, have to be altered, and it was in order to get evidence, which would put us in the position of knowing what alterations were necessary, and give us something to work upon with some degree of certainty, that I put that aspect of the question as clearly as I could. In spite of all I did, however, a personal element, for which I was not responsible, crept in. Had I known that there were so many obstacles to be thrown in the way, I would certainly have moved in a direction other than I did. I thought all I need do was to put a motion on the business paper, and that would be the end of it until the matter was investigated, but all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way. Even after the Select Committee was created no end of difficulty cropped up. I was sorry for that, because there was ample justification for an inquiry, and the position of ignorance in which the Senate found itself, was the very best reason for the appointment of a Select Committee. Another very suspicious aspect of the question cropped up. After the notice of motion to appoint the Committee had been discussed, there suddenly appeared a recommendation from the  President  of the Senate and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives. A most extraordinary communication was unearthed. We had not heard a whisper of it before. There had been no mention of it in debate, and no hint of its existence in the House. This document was put in very suddenly, as  a paper, to be printed. It was a recom.mendation  to  the Government to provide that the control of the officers of the Senate and of the Parliament generally should be handed over to an outside body - the Public Service Commissioner. It was a most extraordinary <inline font-style="italic">volte face</inline> in connexion with parliamentary affairs. I should have thought that a proposition of that kind would have come from the  President  and  Speaker  to Parliament, and that we in this Senate would have been the first to be communicated with. There was no earthly reason why the Government should first be informed of these things. It was a matter for Parliament, and for Parliament alone. The officers of Parliament are not under the control of the Government, but of Parliament. Every Parliament in this country is undoubtedly in the same position. One would have expected that, if there had been any necessity for a change, there would have been less hostility to my proposition to have an inquiry. In spite of the recommendation which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> made, you gave my motion every possible opposition. You tried to prevent an inquiry being held upon a matter on which, it was evident, a great deal of ignorance prevailed. Later on, when we set to work on the Select Committee, and were taking evidence, we found that one officer after another was being prevented from coming before the Committee and giving evidence. </para>

It is evident that the same "game" was going on all the time, and was being pushed to an extreme. Any other President who knew that his administration was being challenged would have been the last to take such action. He would have remained neutral, instead of trying to intimidate the lower-paid officers, and to scare them against giving evidence. These officers were threatened that if they did give evidence they would have to take the responsibility of their action. </para>

                        <para class="block">Those tactics made me all the more determined to get to the bottom of the thing. I am sorry that in consequence of what was done the evidence was unduly circumscribed and forced into a narrow channel. The facts that have been disclosed, however, will be valuable to the Senate in framing future regulations or laws for the control of its officers. I do not know why any effort should have been made to hush up this business. It is a public matter on which Parliament and the public have every right to be fully informed. We know that unlimited criticism is hurled from time to time at the various Departments of the Government. One may attack the Government in any way in regard to any of its Departments, such as the Post Office or the Customs Department. Any charge may be made, and free criticism indulged in, against the Defence Department, and, perhaps even more so, against the Repatriation Department. These are all public Departments which are open to criticism, by any one, and rightly so. Then why, in the name of common sense, should this one Department of Parliament be excluded from criticism or inquiry? The Select Committee was treated as if it were a hostile body, and was told by the  President,  in a brusque sort of way, " So far as these officers are concerned I stand in the place of the Public Service Commissioner, and the whole of the duties of Commissioner devolve upon me." That may have been a satisfactory answer up to a certain point; but when we came to inquire into the working of the Public Service Act as it affects the Senate officials, we found that about the only thing that the  President  had done to carry out its provisions waa to call himself the Public Service Commissioner. All the duties in connexion with the office were ignored. There was no scheme of classification, which is a very prominent feature of Public Service administration. No regulations had been issued for the control of the officers, so that they would know what their duties and rights were. They received no guidance from the  President  at all. During the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the three farmer Presidents, the House Committee occupied a position of responsibility, and was allowed to control the affairs to which I have referred. Had that practice been continued, there would not have been any need to raise this question. The  President  arrogated to himself a position that no other  President  had sought to occupy. He was the dictator, the autocrat who controlled everything. Neither the House Committee nor the Library Committee, as far as he could prevent it - which was not very far in the case of the Library Committee - was allowed to interfere with him in any way. He was the Public Service Commissioner as far as the Senate officials were concerned. </para>
                        <para>SenatorWilson. - The powers are vested in him. </para>

The reports of the Select Committee show that the three members opposed to me almost re-echoed what I said, but modified it. It was merely a question of degree, and not of drastic principle. I may have something to say about individual members of the Select Committee later on. </para>

                                <para>- I hope that I have always earned credit for being candid. I do not believe in any underhand work in connexion with public business, and I have always tried to do things in a fair and open way. So far as the duties of this position under the Public Service Act were concerned, all that the  President  did was to control a number of officers and perform various important functions without providing himself for the purpose with the machinery laid down by the Act. In order that honorable senators may grasp the position, I should explain that when the Public Service Act was under consideration in this Chamber, the first  President  of the Senate was very insistent that Parliament should retain control of its own household. He desired that, above everything else, it should retain that power. But what could we do if the  President  failed to carry out the provisions of the Act to the letter, and to exercise the powers reposed in him under the Act? I am sure that the three first Presidents of the Senate recognised that difficulty, and they overcame it by leaving full powers to the House Committee. </para>

                                <para>- I am not at all surprised at that admission. In the way I have suggested, all friction was avoided, and in the management of the officers of Parliament nothing in" the nature of a scandal ever occurred. Things went on in that way - the provisions of the Public Service Act being ignored and common sense being applied to the management of the officers of the Senate. Had that state of things continued, I dare say that there would have been very little comment about it, or objection taken to it. But we know that in time very grave alterations of practice took place, and very grave injustices occurred. Some officers who were in the service of the Senate for twenty years received practically no promotion, whilst others who had been here for twenty years were still temporary officers. I am pleased to say that since I moved in this matter some of these grievances have been removed, and, therefore, I take credit to myself, so far as the lower-paid officers at all events are concerned, that I have done some little good. There was also injustice done in another way, to which I am very sorry to be obliged to refer, because it reflects very little credit on those responsible. One officer who was employed in this building for ten years as a temporary officer was, perhaps, a little more insistent than others upon his rights according to the wages award fixed outside by the Arbitration Court. Because this officer asked for his rights according to the decision of an institution which this Parliament set up, he was victimized in the most cowardly way. He met the same fate as many members of unions in the past who stood out for their fellows and were the first to complain of their conditions. He was, the first to go. That did not end the matter. In order to build up a case against that officer we had the  President  of the Senate on the floor of this chamber dragging into the discussion upon the case statements which, according to sworn evidence, were not true. </para>

                                <para>- No. The reason I did not produce it before the Select Committee was that I desired that the lady should give evidence. As she did not get an opportunity to do so, I am taking care now to have the letter put on record. The affidavit or declaration made by this lady is included in the printed proceedings of the 'Select Committee. ' I ' cannot find it at the moment, but I do not think that any one will question my statement that this lady swore . an affidavit which was put in in evidence before the Select Committee. It was quite evident what would happen to the employee referred to as soon as an opportunity presented itself. During the time the Senate was adjourned this man was dismissed after being here for ten years, and without ever a complaint, one may say, against his work. According to the general opinion of honorable senators and of honorable members in another place, who were acquainted with him, and saw him at his work daily, there never- was any occasion for a word to be said against him. He has been dismissed since then, and it is hardly necessary for me to fill in the reasons. I shall leave it at that, in the hope that the  President  will see the necessity of doing the manly thing in connexion with this matter. </para>

                                <para>- I am discussing, and I hold that I have a perfect right to da so, the pa.per  that  has been placed before the Senate. The recom"mendation concerning the transfer of control was placed before the Senate in a most mysterious manner and at a time when it was required to suit its purpose. We were told that it was dated many months ago. If so, we ought to have been informed, when we were discussing this matter on the last occasion, but we heard not a whisper about it. The  President,  flying in the face of the general opinion of the Senate, proposed an alteration in connexion with the control of its ^officers. . He proposed to hand control over to an outside body. All this he did without in any way consulting the Senate or Parliament. It is a well-known practice in the British Parliament that the  Speaker  shall be careful, at all times, to safeguard the rights of Parliament and never, at any time, to hand over control of any of its officers to any outside authority. Even the King of England has been fought on this issue, for there is on record a statement by one of the Speakers of the House of Commons that " he had neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak, other than what the House authorized him to see and say." But without consulting members in any way, the  President  took it upon himself to make a recommendation, behind the back of Parliament, to hand' over the control of parliamentary officers to an outside body.  His  action, I am pleased to say, has been condemned by both sections on the Senate Select Committee; the general opinion being that Parliament should retain full control. </para>

                                <para>- Not a bit; but only the Library Committee controls the business of the Library, whereas the House Committee has allowed the  President  to control everything. That is the difference. I was on the first Library Committee, and I know that its authority then was practically the same as to-day. No variation has been permitted by the several Speakers who have presided over that body. The authority of both Committees is identical. This being so, what is responsible for the change in regard to the House Committee? Members have become indifferent, or are unaware of their authority, and so they have allowed one thing- after another to be controlled by the  President.  According to the minority recommendation- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> is not included - authority should be retained by the Senate over all parliamentary officers," and an annual report  should be submitted to Parliament by. the House Committee. This the  President  has failed to do. If reports were presented 'annually, members of the Senate would know what was being done. The absence of these reports has resulted in a good deal of the trouble that has arisen. I hope, therefore, that in future, the affairs of the Committee will be carried out in accordance with the general view as to what is right, and that there will be printed regulations for the guidance of officers, who will then know just exactly what they are entitled to, and ito whom they may present grievances if grievances exist. At present they have practically no Court of appeal. As we have shown in our report, they  cannot approach the House Committee. Officers who have been fined for trivial offences, and desired to go before the House Committee to explain their position, have been denied that privilege. We think that (the House Committee should know of all these matters, and. control the parliamentary officers. I hope, therefore, that honorable senators who are members of the Committee, will see to it that their rights are safeguarded in future, and not allow them to be set aside by any statement by the Presiding Officer. </para>

                                <para>- Let <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> state in public what he said to me privately, and I will be satisfied. Anyhow, the Auditor-General denied that he had anything to do with Denholm's  dismissal. Who was responsible for that statement, and how was it made in the Souse of Representatives ? These are things that I should like to know. Everything points to the fact that things have been done in an underhand way, and that this young man was denied an opportunity to place himself right before the people of this country in regard to his dismissal after a period of service covering ten years. An officer who had been so long as that in the Public Service had every right to be hoard. In consequence of the treatment he received, a cruel injustice was done; and although some honorable senators may think that it would add to the dignity of the proceedings in the Senate to allow such matters to pass without being ventilated, I do not intend to do so. I am anxious that Denholm should not be victimized in any way. He was occupying a humble position - he was just a working man - but he should not be subjected to any injustice on that account. If there are some honorable senators who are prepared to remain silent and allow the matter to pass without comment, they are free to derive what benefit they ear from their action or inaction. </para>

It has been my practice for forty years to protect the interests of those who cannot protect themselves ; and, as one who has been victimized, I feel it my duty and responsibility to protect those who need assistance. I would be a coward if I did not offer assistance merely because the person involved was occupying a humble position. I endeavoured to have the matter adjusted quietly when this employee was dismissed in the manner I have described, but I failed. I have, therefore, made my protest publicly. There are quite a number of other questions that could be discussed on this motion, but, as I have already taken up much of the time of the Senate, I shall not avail myself of the opportunity to do so on this occasion.  </para>

Honorable senators and the public would be entitled to assume that these attacks have been made upon me with the full sanction of the Government, and I would believe that such was the case if I did not know anything to the contrary. The Select Committee was appointed, and accepted office on the assumption that they were doing something which had the approval of the Government, and there are some members of the Committee present who will not deny (that. They assumed that [because the .Government Whip <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator de Largie)</inline> was successful in moving for the appointment of the Select Committee, ; the Government desired it, and some members of the Committee consented to act only for .that reason. </para>

Who has a better right to respect the will of Parliament than its Presiding Officer? If a Presiding Officer does not give effect to the expressed will of Parliament, he should do so. How can Parliament express its will more effectively, decisively, and emphatically than by Act of Parliament? That is the only way Parliament has; and I have obeyed the expressed will of Parliament as set forth in its enactment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie complains that .there are no regulations for the guidance and management of the officers of Parliament, and he also said that annual reports had not 'been issued. During the .preceding thirteen years this has not been done, and I would like to know why no complaint has been lodged. </para>

                                <para>- The House Committee did not have control, because the responsibility rested with the  President  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and if they shifted their authority they would be disobeying the expressed will of Parliament. If the will of Parliament has been disobeyed for thirty, or even forty, years, it does not say that  such action is right. I was the first presiding officer to endeavour to have regulations framed ; but I found 1 that there were many legal difficulties to prevent its being done. The officers themselves found that they could not be framed in a way that would prove entirely satisfactory. The whole gravamen of <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator de</inline> Largie's charge is that I departed from established practice; but such is not the case, because I followed out the procedure previously adopted regarding the Library Department. I did not  interfere with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> at all, and although  deputy chairman  of that Committee, I never expressed an opinion, when he asked for my advice, on any matter referred to .the Committee which I considered came within his responsibility under the Act, but refused to take part in the' discussion and left the table. I was not prepared to take part in any illegal action, and merely obeyed the expressed will of Parliament. In regard to the Committee of which I am the  chairman,  I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> will bear me out when I say that on every matter placed 'before the  Committee, with the exception of that of salaries, I accepted the decision of the Committee. Parliament has saddled me with certain responsibilities, and I would be lacking in my duty if I placed those responsibilities on the shoulders of some one else. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has also said that I hampered the appointment  of the Select Committee. All I did was to see that it did not act contrary to the rules of Parliament. The moment the Committee was appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, as  chairman,  issued summonses to several officers of the Library and Joint House Departments without asking the consent of the Joint House Committee and the Library Committee, which was contrary to parliamentary practice. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and I therefore intervened. No request was made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> or myself in regard to the attendance of any officer. The investigations of the Select Committee were limited to the officers of the Senate, not to those under the control of the two Houses. " <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie did not have the intelligence to realize that plain, simple fact. I do not intend to discuss the whole of the report, which deals principally with the dismissal, of one man. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has said that Denholm was victimized, that I went out of my way to persecute him, that I treated him unfairly, and in a high-handed and tyrannical manner. As a matter of fact I did not act in the matter at all, either by voice or suggestion. I did not say that the boy's services should be terminated, neither did I suggest that any action should be taken, because I had not the power under the Act to do so. Temporary employees are under the control of the head of the particular Department in which they are employed. </para>

Temporary employees had, wherever possible, to be placed on the permanent staff', or their services terminated. The Auditor-General was continually raising objections to temporary employees being illegally retained, because the officers of the Auditor-General's Department found it exceedingly difficult to vouch for the expenditure if the practice were continued. It was because of that that certain action was taken.

                                    Largie said that I brought the termination of Denholm's appointment before the House Committee. I did nothing of the kind.

                                    was there and knows exactly what transpired. Certain rearrangements of the duties of the officers were suggested by the head of the Department, and incidentally Denholm's position arose. The arrangement of the duties of the staff was a proper matter for the Committee to decide.

Now, as to the matter of Denholm, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie states that he was most diligent, attentive, and faithful in the performance of his duties. As a matter of fact, Denholm was not anything of the kind. The officers of this Parliament are required to sign a book showing the exact times of their coming to and leaving the building. Denholm, I know from personal observation, would sometimes come to work after 10 a.m., and would sign the attendance book as having arrived at 9 a.m. I repeat that I, personally, saw him on more than one occasion come in after 10 o'clock; yet he signed the book for that day as having arrived at 9. I emphasize that that is within my own knowledge. </para>

                                conduct, however, was overlooked, and he was again employed in the rooms, and was afterwards placed on the lift, where for some time he carried out his duties fairly satisfactorily; but later on he became careless and unreliable - often unnecessarily rough in his handling of the lift doors, and neglectful in making proper provision for the working of the automatic appliances during his temporary absences, which were by far too frequent. He was also in the habit of marking his time of arrival as 9 a.m. in the attendance-book, although very often known to be late. He acquired a habit of gossiping, and has for some time past been more or less a disturbing influence, which, if allowed to remain, would seriously interfere with the control and work of the Department. He has been fined for an offence against discipline in charging officers of the Senate with robbing him of money that he considered should have been paid to him, and in refusing to apologize when called upon to do so; and I myself, in conversation with him in my room, have' several times had to check him for incivility. It may be asked why he was allowed to remain here so long. The answer is that he has been very leniently dealt with, and his lack of regard for discipline overlooked to a much greater extent than, in my opinion, it would have been in other Departments.

                            <para>Certain influential gentlemen have interposed on behalf of this young man. I think, however, it should 'be acknowledged that officers whose duty it is to supervise and study the conduct and character of employees are in the best position to judge a case of this kind on its merits. This case having been so dealt with, it was considered undesirable to recommend Denholm for permanent employment. Further temporary employment not being permissible under the Public Service Act, was also out of the question. </para>

Recently a night watchman was appointed in connexion with the care and oversight of the parliamentary buildings. Among his duties it is required of him that he shall go the round of the premises several times through each night. Recently he reported that, in one of the rooms on the other side of the House, after 11 p.m., and when the buildings had been closed and no one was supposed to be within them, he found Denholm waking up from a drunken sleep. When the latter was charged by the night watchman with being illegally on the premises, Denholm had the meanness to say that he had been brought there by an officer of the House, and he named the officer. </para><continue>

Indeed, I acted in exactly the reverse manner. It was pure leniency on my part - and for that, perhaps, I am deserving of all that has followed - in having overridden the decision of the head of the Department. For, had the purpose of the responsible officers been secured, Denholm would not have remained so long in service in these buildings. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie practically says that I told a deliberate lie, in my statement that Denholm's mother wrote a certain letter regarding the boy, and that he has in his possession an affidavit affirming that assertion, I can only say that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie really wanted to be fair- had he even so much as mentioned the matter to me, or to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monahan,</inline> or to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr..

                                <para>- It did not matter a straw to me. The honorable senator obviously knows so little of the rules of Parliament that he cannot be expected to be aware of the irregularity of the procedure attaching to the calling of this young man before the Committee. But I again assert that there were three persons, at least, who could have, and would have, sworn, if they had been called, that they had seen and perused the letter in  question  . . I have nothing to say against <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Denholm;</inline> I do not know anything or desire to know anything concerning the lady. Such a letter, however, was unquestionably written. It was not written to me, but it was shown to me. I read it. It was grossly unfair on the part of the young man concerned that he should have deceived  or have attempted to deceive his mother. She wrote bitterly complaining that he had been kept on duty for such unduly long hours, and had been so badly dealt with, indeed, that his health had become impaired. </para>

                                <para>- I reiterate that it was not written to me; therefore, I cannot produce it. But it was written, and I read it. As for the innuendo that either I or the responsible officers of the Senate had any motive for our actions towards and treatment of Denholm, I dan assert that we had no motives. I feel rather strongly upon the whole subject, because I believe that it is due to personal animus that these continual attacks have been made upon me. They are such that I can only stigmatize them as being derogatory to the dignity of the Senate. </para>

That can be brought about by way of a simple motion. I call attention to it as being a straightforward test and procedure for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie to adopt. I venture to say, however, that he will not put the test into practice. I challenge him- here and now. If he will move a. motion, or place one upon the business-paper of the Senate, in conformity with the suggestion which I have just made, I shall be prepared readily to submit to it. I would suggest that the honorable senator should also, similarly, and at the same time, place his official position in this Chamber open to the decision of the Senate. </para>

                            <para>.- The motion is one upon which honorable senators naturally expect to deal chiefly with the finances of the nation, although, at the same time, opportunity is offered for them to debate any questions which they think affect Australia's welfare. I shall not attempt to make an analysis of the Budget. If there is one question occurring in a deliberative assembly of which I am a  member,  which I like least, it is the discussion of finance, although I recognise that the financial affairs of the nation, are of most urgent importance1. </para>

                        <para>In a contribution by a previous  speaker  the Government was taken to task for excessive expenditure in the direction of defence, and from that I propose, in a measure, to dissent. Until there is some better organization among the peoples of the world, some greater safety against the possibility of a recurrence of war, no greater question demands the attention of the Legislatures of Australia than that of defence. It was the continual cry for retrenchment and economy in the defence expenditure of the' nation which led the British Government into the condition in which the Empire found itself on the fatal 4th August, 1914. The very men who were ever urging the British Government to economize in the expenditure for the defence of ;the Empire, sire represented in Australia to-day by the people we have clamouring against this Government and the expenditure of money for the defence of Australia. If the future should hold for us any such dire calamity as that which overtook the Empire in August, 1914, and we should find ourselves unprepared, defenceless, and perhaps on the verge of destruction, these very men who are now clamouring for economy would be the first to accuse the Government of lack of foresight in failing to prepare for the emergency. I wish to see the utmost judgment displayed in the preparation of the defences of Australia, but, at the same time, I have no sympathy with those who are always .clamouring for retrenchment in this direction. I hope I am optimistic enough to look forward to the time when the wisdom of the peoples of the  world will he such that it will be unnecessary to make such comprehensive preparations for war; but that time has not yet arrived. Until it does, it would be little short of treachery to Australia were the Government not to make all necessary preparations to meet such an' emergency. </para>
                        <para>Another grievance with a large number of economists outside is the cost of government. 'I think I pointed out in a previous debate that the cost of government in Australia <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> of the population is very high indeed; but it is equally true that if our population were ten times what it is to-day, the actual cost of government would be very little more. There are now between 5,000,000 and 6,000,000 people in the Commonwealth, and they demand the same effective system of government as would be required by 50,000,000 people in the same area. The proportionate increase in the cost of government for the larger number of people would be small indeed. There may be some directions in which more retrenchment might be made, but, in the aggregate, the saving which could be effected is very small if we are to give efficient service to the people. Those discontented persons who are always complaining of the cost of government should recognise that we have the same service for the 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 of our population as 40,000,000 or 50,000,000 would have were they here to receive it. </para>
                        <para>There is another grievance which is very widely expressed by a certain section of the community, and that is the heavy taxation which the people now have to bear. We hear all over Australia, and we read in a great many of the news prints of the Commonwealth, serious complaints against the administration of this Government, because of what is termed the extravagant and extraordinarily high expenditure. There is- a failure to realize that a vast portion of this expenditure is an aftermath of the war. The majority of those who are now complaining are the very people who, during the war, urged the Government to leave no stone unturned in order that Australia might play its part in that terrible conflagration. The sentiment expressed by a previous Prime Minister, at the beginning of the war, that Australia was behind the Mother </para>

                                <para>- Very much more, many of them. Some of the prominent newspapers of Australia are greater sinners than the average. Australia did wonderfully well in the war, and the men who represented us did marvellously; but Australia as a whole must foot the bill. The people must remember that they have received the goods. Had Australia not played its part in common with the other British Dominions, it is more than probable that we would not be governing this country to-day. Australia would then have been under the Government of a nation which would certainly have insisted upon the people being called upon to pay a great deal more than they are required to pay by the Governments that control the affairs of the Commonwealth from time to time. I want the people who are always clamouring against the expenditure, which is the result, of the part Australia played in the war, to remember that they not only received the goods, but they still have this Dominion to occupy. This important part of the Empire is still their own. They have their property, and they have the opportunity to make incomes in consequence of the expenditure of this money in the great efforts made by Australia's sons. </para>

We know that the taxation is high, but it is because of the enormous interest bill we have to meet on over £300,000,000, which was borrowed to enable us to play our part in the war, and, of course, in addition, to provide for those men who have played their par.t as soldiers of the Empire. </para>

                                <para>- I am not speaking so much of the grumblings of Parliament as the grumblings of the taxpayers outside. I quite realize that it is an unpleasant thing to have to hand out one's money. Many people in their advancing years have an opportunity, probably for the first time in their lives, to make provision for their old age, and it is very annoying to them to receive a demand from the income tax collector for a very substantial proportion of the money they might otherwise be putting away. </para>

                        <para>There is another subject to which I want to refer. It forms the foundation upon which the prosperity of Australia depends. I mean the increase of population within our States. It is well known that the Government at the present time has in operation a system of immigration from the Old Country. That is all very well, but it seems to me, that something mora ought to be done. I am not altogether satisfied with the arrangements which have so far been made for the reception of the immigrants when they arrive from overseas. One of the worst things that the Government can possibly be guilty of is to induce people to come to Australia from far-away England, Ireland, Scotland, or Wales without making sufficient preparations to enable them to earn a living when they get here. </para>

                                <para>- No. The system of nominating immigrants has been carried on for a long time, but there is now in operation an ' arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States. I am not by any means satisfied with the arrangements made by the States for the utilization of these immigrants when they arrive in Australia. It is well known that there is a good deal of unemployment in Australia to-day, and' the idea of bringing people out to this country to swell the ranks of the unemployed would be the worst thing possible. Looking through the Commonwealth Statistician's <inline font-style="italic">YearBook</inline> for 1919, I find that there is  an indication in the vital statistics for that year of a way. in which the Government can increase the population of Australia by an even more desirable class of settler than any from overseas, good though these may be. The year 1919 is the last full year for which statistics are available. I find that the death rate of infants under five years of age in Australia for that year amounted to 11,833; under one year, 8,464; and under two years, 10,172, In a healthy country like Australia, with a total population of only 5,000,000, those death rates are too high. </para>

                                <para>- I am not prepared to say that, but there is no authenticity for such a statement. It may be true, or it may be untrue. The Government of the day has provided in the present Budget for the expenditure of about £700,000 on maternity bonuses. This is not the first . time that I have raised my voice in opposition to this system, and I suppose it will not be the last I am fully convinced that the Government could expend this money to far greater advantage in the interests of the people of Australia,and that if it was properly expended in the direction I am going to suggest, theusands of infants who are sacrificed in Australia yearly could be saved, and would make the very best pf residents. The native-born of any country are undoubtedly the best class of resident we can possibly have. </para>

                                <para>- I will tell the honorable senator. I do not know whether he has had the opportunity of watching the activities of an association called the Child Welfare Association. I believe there are such associations in nearly every State, but I have had the opportunity, particularly, of watching the operations of an association of that description in Hobart, Tasmania. 1 have seen nothing more practical or more helpful in the preservation and the building up of the child-life of a nation. The people connected with the association, by their energy and self -sacrifice, all of which is  given in an honorary capacity, not only collect .money to pay for the provision of nurses to wait upon mothers and prospective mothers and advise them in the treatment and feeding of their children, but also to provide for infants milk which has been tested by a Government officer. If a mother at Hobart is not able to pay for the milk, it is provided free by the association. I say, without any doubt of the accuracy of my statement, that there are many children alive in Hobart to-day that would not be alive but for the activities of this association. If the Government were to enter into arrangements with the States;' and to divide the money now given in "maternity bonuses <inline font-style="italic">pro rata,</inline> among the States, according to population, on the understanding that it must .be spent in the establishment of child-welfare _ associations, a vast amount of good which is not attempted at the present time would be accomplished. The money might be  given on the stipulation that it would be' augmented by the States. Many of the bonuses now given are expended most ridiculously. An investigation which was made' a short time ago, and information which was. obtained on sworn evidence, showed that in 99 per cent, of births in Australia the bonus was claimed. I have heard many stories of the way in which the bonus has been expended. The other day I was told of a case in which a very popular young man became a 'happy father, and in conversation with his friends .he said he was going to claim. the bonus. He was followed by a friend, and when he had received his £5 he was advised that he was wanted at Menzies' Hotel. He went there, in compliance with the request. 'What took place there I do not know, but subsequently he received a bill from Menzies'. Hotel for £30. The gathering had been drinking the baby's health, of course. The facts as I have stated them in this case, I believe, are absolutely true. I know of other instances in which the bonus has been invested in Tattersalls, and others in which it has been placed to the credit of the child, to mature at a certain age. That was not the intention of Parliament when this system was enacted; and I venture to say that out of the. £?00,000 which it is proposed to expend during the coming financial year, at least £300,000 of it will bo paid to people who do not require it, and the balance, too often, to people who merely act as agents between the Government and the doctor. I do urge upon the. Government once again the desirability of entering into . negotiations with the Governments ' of . the different States to bring about an improved method for the expenditure of this money, so that better results and greater benefit to Australia will accrue. Although we require an increase of our adult population as quickly as we. can secure it, I should prefer to' spend more money* on the preservation of infant life in Australia than to have it spent upon immigration. . </para>

                        <para>There is another question arousing considerable agitation in parts of Australia, and in none more than in Tasmania, upon which I desire to say a word. I refer to the operation of industrial arbitration. Where a practicable and sensible administration of the principle of arbitration is possible, I nave always' been, and I am still, a supporter of it. But I recognise that in some cases wo have now got into a position which is absolutely untenable. As an instance in point, I can cite the case of -an industry in which Southern Tasmania is' considerably interested. I refer to the timber industry and the effect upon it of the last award made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. As a result of that award, the industry is at present paralyzed. I have very carefully read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins' report on the industry, and. from his view-point I am unable to confute his statements. I know the labour which men have to undertake in working in the bush, particularly in the southern parts pf Tasmania. I am not prepared to- say that  the conditions laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins' award would not be right if those engaged in the industry could afford to carry it on under those conditions. But what is the use of making an award for an industry if any- attempt to put it into effect must involve the closing down of the industry? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins' award proposes the payment of a weekly wage to bush workers; wet or dry the amount is the same. The position now is that the mill-owners find that - the men, and they are quite right, will not work, while it is wet, because-the award provides that under such conditions they shall be paid their wages even if  they remain at home. They cannot work when it is windy, and, in the circumstances, to attempt to comply with the conditions of the award in the southern part of Tasmania would mean that those carrying on the industry would have to pay the men they employ a week's wages for, on the average, two or three days' work. No industry could be carried on under such conditions. The timber industry is not the only one in Australia which is in practically the same position, and unless the Judge administering the arbitration law will take into consideration the practicability of giving effect to his award, and its relation to other industries, we must do something with our arbitration system. I know that many people in Tasmania are agitating for the abolition of the principle of arbitration. I should not strongly object if that meant the abolition of the Commonwealth arbitration system and the substitution for it of some system within a State under which the local conditions of each industry might be considered. I recognise, however, that we cannot in Australia go back to the old condition of the survival of the fittest in industrial disputes. We cannot depend for their settlement on strikes or lockouts. Those methods belong to a past age. We must have for the settlement of industrial disputes a system which can be operated in a lawful and equitable way. Unless the men undertaking the settlement of such disputes will take into consideration the possibility of the industries to comply with their awards, the arbitration system must undoubtedly fail. </para>
                        <para>There are one or two small matters especially affecting Tasmania which I may mention. I refer to the light dues at present charged for shipping, in connexion with which I have had a very voluminous correspondence with the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> and the operation of the Navigation Act as it affects coastal shipping. I recognise that, in connexion with the operation of the Navigation Act, we are up against a very difficult problem. But with regard to the other matter, I maintain that in dealing with Tasmania the Government have been arbitrary and unsympathetic. By insisting on the payment of full dues by ships using practically only one light on the coast of Tas mania, they have prevented vessels calling at that State, although it would have been to its material advantage if they had done so; and the fact that they have not done so has meant a considerable loss to Australia. I have already explained all this to the Minister for Trade and Customs, but, so far, have been unable to enlist his sympathy. I desire now to say publicly that I still hope that the Government will reconsider the light dues charged in certain portions of Australia. Where ships derive the benefit of a considerable numiber of lights it maybe quite right to charge them full light dues ; but it seems to me absolutely ridiculous to charge full light dues to a ship casually calling at one port of Australia, it may be, to land or take up a few passengers or to take in stores, and carrying on practically no cargo trade with thatport. </para>
                        <para>I have a word to say upon another question which was touched upon by a previous  speaker.  I refer to the Convention proposed to be constituted to consider alterations of the Federal Constitution. Perhaps I may more effectively express my views on this matter by quoting a letter which I addressed to the Prime Minister on 2nd December, 1920, just after an adjournment of this Parliament. I wrote as follows: - </para>

                        <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.-</inline> As I believe you will during the present recess consider and decide upon the constitution of a Convention to consider and recommend certain alterations to the Federal Constitution, might I be permitted to make a suggestion <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> the appointment of such Convention.? I hold that it is more helpful to make suggestions before such a matter is considered by the Government than to criticise and perhaps oppose a scheme after the Government are committed to it. Now, first let mo say that I am opposed to the election of a Convention in the ordinary way, for the following reasons:- 1st. Such an election would cost the Commonwealth at least £80,000, 2nd. We should have all the turmoil and disorganization of industry incidental to a general election. 3rd. If the delegates to the Convention were elected on other than the Senate franchise and electorates, they would not be representative of the whole State; if they were to be so elected, then, in practice, only wealthy men or members of the Federal Parliament could offer themselves as candidates. 4th. It is practically certain that at such an election the great majority of successful candidates would be members of the Federal Parliament, they being the better known men, and the Convention would only be the </para>
                        <para class="block">Federal Parliament in another form. 5th. There is no guarantee that the public men and women would support the recommendations of such a Convention at the subsequent referendum to the people, and without unanimity of support the people would surely vote no, and all the trouble and expense would result in nothing. It would be worse than useless to hold such a Conference or Convention unless it was so representative as to secure for its recommendations the united support of all parties at the referendum. Now my suggestion is that the Convention shall consist of thirty-five members, to be elected in equal numbers from the Parliaments of each State and the Parliament of the Commonwealth, that is to say, the Legislative Councils and the Legislative Assemblies of each State, and thu Senate and House of Representatives of the Commonwealth, shall elect five delegates. Method of Election. - The two Houses shall sit conjointly, and Che President will call for nominations, which must he in writing and signed by not less than five members, no member will be permitted to sign more than one nomination. Nominations closed, the House will proceed to elect its five delegates under the proportional representation system now in operation in Tasmania. A Convention so elected would bo thoroughly representative of all classes of the people, and its recommendation's would, I believe, receive an affirmative vote at the referendum. If in this I should be disappointed, and the people again voted " No," then the loss incurred in preparing the question would be comparatively small. That is a rough outline of my idea, and I submit it for your consideration. </para>

I have not the confidence of the Government in the matter, hut it seems to me that they are determined to constitute a Convention by an election by the whole people, similar to the way in which certain Conventions were called together prior to the establishment of this Parliament. </para>

                                <para>- I agree with the honorable senator. I believe that after having gone to the expense of an election for members of the Convention, the whole of it will be wasted unless we can secure, in regard to the recommendations of the Convention, the acquiescence of those men and women to whom the people look to advise them at election time, and that the vote, as in the case of all former referendums, will be in the negative. It is natural that people should hold conservative opinions on questions of this kind. If there is a difference of opinion amongst those who ought to know, and who are expected to guide the people, the decision will be to leave things as they are. Certain alterations should be made in the Constitution in order that the Government may function as directed by the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so; but if there is any serious division among the leaders of public opinion in Australia, we shall never get an affirmative vote from the people for any amendment of the Constitution. We must have this unanimity prior to the submission of any question to the people. I am satisfied that by the selection of Convention representatives from all the Parliaments of Australia we shall secure the widest possible expression of public thought, because the whole of the Legislative Assemblies in the different States are elected on the adult franchise. Although in two of the States the Legislative Councils are nominated by Governments elected by the people, the Upper House franchise in the States is a property qualification. I do not approve of this system, but it certainly can be claimed that the representatives in our Legislative Councils speak for the most conservative section of the people. I am satisfied that a Convention selected in the way I have outlined would prove a satisfactory method for the expression of public thought as to the amendments of our Constitution, and I believe its recommendations would be accepted by the people. So convinced am I that it would be a sinful waste of money to hold a special election for members of the Convention, that I want to declare my opposition to it now. My proposition is worthy of consideration. If the Prime Minister thinks fit to throw it into the waste-paper basket, I feel forced to state my opposition to his views in regard to the election of the Convention. It may be suggested that the election could be held at the same time as the general election for members of both branches of the Commonwealth Parliament. That, again, would encounter my opposition. </para>

                        <para>I am satisfied with the Budget brought down by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook).</inline> I realize that in some respects considerable hardship must be imposed upon the people, and, as I said in the earlier part of my speech, "the people, having received the goods, must now be prepared to meet the bill. There are encouraging signs as to the attitude of the people towards their obligations. There may be occasional outbursts such as, no doubt, are occurring at the Workers' Conference in Brisbane, but I believe the great majority of the people desire to settle down to the inevitable task of rehabilitating and reestablishing Australia in a better position than she occupied before the war. I need hardly reiterate statements I have previously made to the workers in this respect. If there is any foundation - and perhaps in some cases there is - for their belief that they are not receiving their due proportion of the wealth which they produce, there is ample opportunity in Australia for the workers to become producers on their own account. I have pointed out on other occasions that between  1913  and  1918  the workers of this country lost, from industrial disputes, in wages alone, over  £10,000,000.  Therefore, I urge upon those who are. discontented with the present system the wisdom of co-operation in production. Let them become their own employers. The world is wide. No difficulty is presented. There is absolute freedom in Australia. If they want to abolish capitalism, co-operation affords a convenient medium. By this means they may accomplish their ends quietly and lawfully. Let them by cooperation become capitalists, - and pay themselves from the results of their own industry. This is the only practical and true test of sincerity of purpose. We learn from the Trades Hall representatives, and from those who are sitting in the Workers' Conference in Brisbane, that the workers are determined to destroy the present organization of capital and labour, to abolish wage payments, and, in short, to cast the whole social and industrial system into the melting-pot, and see what is going to result. I ask any of those who advocate this course of action what they are going to substitute for it. <inline font-style="italic">Not</inline> one can give the slightest indication. They are like a' number of people, cast adrift in a boat, who decide to scuttle it, and then see what will happen. They are making no provision for the future, notwithstanding that in Russia to-day they have an example of what must inevitably occur if they adopt this course of action in Australia. Russia, a country of immense wealth, and with an enormous population, is so disorganized that at the present time millions of people are face to face with starvation, and hundreds of thousands are dying. Notwithstanding all this, there are still some people who urge that the workers of this country should try the same experiment. My last words to them on the present occasion are to ignore any such advice. Like everybody else, they must bend their backs to the burden in order to carry Australia through the difficult times that lie ahead. The vast majority did this loyally during the war, and now that we are in the aftermath, everybody, whether he be the humblest worker in the land or a citizen in the highest position, must accept his individual responsibility, and make his contribution in payment of the bill we have received in return for a free country with all the possibilities of becoming a very great nation. </para>

                            <para>. -  I do not intend to take up very much of the time of the Senate. My remarks in regard to the Budget will be more in the nature of questions. I am aware that it is customary to allow a good deal of latitude in debate on this motion, which deals with the raising and spending of  £65,000,000,  but it appears to me that the introduction of irrelevant matters such as have been mentioned this afternoon has the effect of bringing our parliamentary procedure very near the borderline of farce. </para>

                        <para>There are one or two matters upon which I desire information. I defy any honorable senator to speak at short notice comprehensively on the Budget. In my opinion, weeks of study are needed to comprehend it thoroughly. There are many items which we could not possibly expect to understand unless we had at our elbow some of the heads of Departments to enlighten us. The other day, in the South Australian Parliament, the Premier, referring to the proposed Convention for the amendment of the Constitution, had something to say about the cost of running Commonwealth, as compared with State, Departments. He said - </para>

                            <para>They knew from their own experience in Australia that control by State Governments was more efficient and more economical than control by the Federal Government. Taxation collecting was one example out of many that might be quoted. The Commonwealth employ a staff twice as large as the State to collect incomes and land tax from the taxpayers of this State, and the cost was very considerably more than twice as large, although the Federal authorities dealt with a considerably smaller number of taxpayers than the State authorities, because of the £5,000 exemption in the Federal land tax. </para>

                        <para class="block">That is an extraordinary statement , to make, and I feel that we should be enlightened upon the matter. If it is true that the Federal authorities have nearly twice as many people to do the work of tax collecting some explanation should be forthcoming. </para>
                        <para>There is a number of items in the Budget figures which require some explanation. I notice, for instance, that in the General Division of the South Australian Taxation Office, nine assistants were employed during the last financial year and that eighteen are to be engaged during the current year. The amount spent last year was £1,093, and the expenditure this year is estimated at £1,791. In the Clerical Division of the Western Australian Taxation Department the number of clerks is to be increased from nineteen to thirty-seven. </para>

                                <para>- That may account for the increase. As compared with the number employed in the Tasmanian Department in 1920-21 there is a slight reduction. In perusing the Budget figures I notice that allowance has been made for a cost-of-living bonus based on Arbitration Court awards. I know, of course, that some time previously there was a strong agitation for increased wages, which were not granted; but to meet the difficulties confronting' employees at the time the Government agreed to pay certain bonuses. This year there is a considerable increase over the amount voted in 1920-21, but I have learned since looking into the figures that the probable explanation is that the amount in the previous Estimates was to cover only a portion of the last financial year, whereas the present estimate is for a full year. That may or may not be the case; but it must be remembered that the cost of living is coming down. According to <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs,</inline> the cost of living in August this year was 20 per cent. lower than it was in August of last year. It is patent to every one that the cost of living is decreasing, and I am wondering why an amount should be placed in the Estimates for this purpose. </para>

                                <para>- That may be so ; but it does not affect my contention. Right through the various Departments special amounts are included to meet the high cost of living, the payment of which should engage the attention of the authorities. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> in another place said that he had a fine Budget to present; but the fact remains that while we had a surplus last year of between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000, it is expected that at the end of this financial year that surplus will be reduced to an amount in the vicinity of £3,800,000, showing conclusively that we are going to spend £2,800,000 more this year than we shall receive in revenue. The Government would be wise if they went through the Estimates - we have had their assurance that they have been compiled most carefully - and pared them down so that we could balance the ledger. </para>

                                <para>- I shall do so when the time arrives. The Treasurer has said that, approximately, £7,500,000 in the form of income tax payments has not been collected, and the explanation is that certain taxpayers are at present unable to meet their liabilities. A business man in presenting his balance-sheet, or the  chairman  of a company in submitting his statements of accounts to the shareholders, would look upon such an amount as an asset. The Treasurer, however, says that he expects during the coming year to collect £690,000 of the amount outstanding; but a larger sum should be available. If I did not pay my income tax the Commissioner would distrain, and I would have to find the money. When there is such a tremendous amount outstanding a genuine effort should be made to collect it in justice to the other taxpayers. </para>

                        <para>In reading the Budget Speech I was very surprised to find that practically no mention had been made of the shipbuilding policy, and the intention of the Government in connexion with the running of Commonwealth steamers. During the war we did many things that would not have been done in ordinary times, one of which was to purchase ships. It was recognised at the time that a good " deal " had been made, but conditions have altered, and to-day, instead of ships costing between £30 and £40 per ton to build, they are being constructed for about £7 10s. per ton. In reading an American publication a few days ago, I noticed that the Government of the United States of America are about to cut their losses in regard to shipping and turn the whole business over to private enterprise. I believe that the Government would be well advised if they adopted a similar course, because they will not be able to compete with private ship-owners unless they are prepared to write down the capital cost of the ships to about £7 10s. per ton, and thus show a profit on the transaction. </para>
                        <para>In regard to our financial position generally I am sure we are all anxious to do the best that is possible in the circumstances. We know there has been a general outcry throughout the Commonwealth in regard to wasteful expenditure; but when such statements have been made to me concerning alleged extravagance, I have asked those making them to mention a particular item on which expenditure can be reduced, and it is seldom that they have been able to do so. We should, if possible, endeavour to square our accounts this year. </para>

                        <para>I now wish to direct the attention of honorable senators to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> in which it is quite  clear he fell into a serious error, owing to the fact that he did not anticipate participating in the debate at that juncture, and consequently had not the opportunity to study the Budget figures very closely. Referring to the Defence expenditure, the honorable senator asserted that there was an increase in the cost of the Permanent Forces of approximately £300,000. If honorable senators will turn to page 124 of the Estimates, they will find that the explanation of that increase arises from the fact that previously items which were charged under several headings have been transferred to and are included under the one heading of " Permanent Forces. ' ' Adding together the amount set against the Permanent Forces and the next line on page 124, it will be found that the vote for the administrative and instructional staffs has been cut down to £250,000. In reality, that amount was transferred to the heading of " Permanent Forces," so that whilst it has apparently increased the cost in that direction, there is a reduction to the extent of £50,000. One item alone, for allowances paid to married warrant officers of the Forces, absorbs £40,000. I do not know the views of honorable senators, but if there were any Government employees who were insufficiently paid it was the members of the Permanent Forces, who, considering the services rendered, have been in receipt of a most beggarly pittance. It seems to me that the men who do the work and incur the risk ought not to receive less than the ordinary wage paid to men, but slightly more. This vote does not pretend to place them on the same footing as those who obtain employment in the open market, but it is a modest effort to reduce the margin which hitherto existed. That brings the amount down to £5,000, and I have not had' the opportunity to peruse the figures sufficiently to ascertain where increases have been made; but it must be evident that in a service incurring such a heavy expenditure the amount is very modest. </para>
                        <para>I desire now to refer to the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> and I think the Senate will join with me when  I say that we listened with considerable pleasure to his remarks on highly important subjects, with which he dealt in a profound way.

                        <para>I desire to say a word or two now respecting the criticism which has been directed at the Budget. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> made a common-sense remark when he mentioned that when people complain of the nature of the Budget he asks them to point out wherein its defects consist, and invites them to ooma down to details. He informed us that none of these critics had been prepared to do so. Owing to propaganda being conducted outside, it has become the practice for almost everybody to denounce the Budget; but if people are asked for any instance of extravagance, they are unable to point to a single example. The fact is that they do not study the Budget, but are misled by wild statements of newspapers and persons outside, and they merely repeat the criticisms of those parties and productions without examining the situation for themselves. I am bound to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is not free from the liability of being charged in these terms. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> expressed moderate views, and gave his recognition to the fact that a pound .will not do any more for the Government than for a private individual. A pound note cannot be expected to do for the Government to day, any more than for a private individual, what it would have done a few years ago. It is idle to expect the Government to get back to prewar conditions when the community itself has not returned thereto. No one will say, of course, that somewhere or other a pound here and there might not have been saved. But I would remind honorable senators that it is impossible to insure an absolutely close scrutiny of each and every Department. The major fact is that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> was faced with £2,293,000 of additional expenditure which had become obligatory, and which there was, therefore, no possibility of avoiding, unless1 Australia was to repudiate her obligations. There was, for instance, a payment due in connexion with the war debt which had been incurred in the previous financial year. Will anyone say that that payment could have been reduced? There was an increase of £1,469,000 by way of interest upon sinking fund. That sum was payable on debts incurred during the year preceding that with which the Budget has to do. Could the amount have been struck out without repudiation ? Then there is the matter of increase in respect of invalid and old-age pensions. Will any individual outside of Parliament, or inside, suggest that anything be struck off there? </para>

                                <para>- Exactly ! In respect of bank exchange there is an item of £105,000. That payment could not have been avoided. Of course, we could have avoided the transactions which occasioned the debt, but they arose out of just payments of obligations incurred in London. Will anyone suggest that Australia should tell financial London that we do not propose to, or cannot, pay our debts? Then, as for the basic wage, whether honorable senators may regard with approval or otherwise the action which has been taken by the Government, this Chamber having given its approval to arbitration and trade awards in preference to the bad old system of strikes and squabbles, will not say that the basic wage item should have been struck out. Next, upon the carriage of mails to Europe during the war there is a debt of £200,000. That is an obligation incurred in a previous year, which could not have been avoided and cannot now be repudiated. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so; but the trouble is that all the economists outside are quite willing that the Government shall continue to carry on an expenditure which they themselves approve. They desire the practice of economy only in connexion with those sources of expenditure which touch somebody else. I make these observations in view of criticisms which have been made largely outside, but which have found their echo in the Senate. In addition to the items which I have just mentioned, there are still others, which go to compile a total of £4,000,000 of new expenditure. Some of this outgoing is consequent upon policy, but it is an expenditure which the Treasurer positively had to face and make. While paying out that increased </para>

                        <para>Bum of £4,000,000, of which fully £2,250,000 was obligatory and inescapable, the Treasurer has managed to present a Budget which shows an actual total expenditure amounting to £20,000 less than that for the year preceding. I hold that the Treasurer should be given credit for the display of a desire and a capacity to cut down wherever the operation could be practised without endangering the efficiency of the Public Service. It is idle, I repeat, to talk of an extravagant Budget when the Treasurer is carrying an additional load such as I have specifically mentioned and when he is budgeting to get through the financial year with a smaller outlay than in respect of the previous year and very much smaller than was the amount expended during the year before that. It is only fair to the Treasurer that I should say this. The vague and widespread criticisms which have been hurled at that Minister afford an evidence of the unfairness which, for political reasons, frequently attaches to Governments and Ministers. Had critics stated that the Treasurer gave some evidence of a desire to improve matters and presented a Budget which, allowing for various inescapable increases, showed a reduction upon last year's expenditure, although there was still room for further specific savings, such criticisms would be welcome. Unhappily, however, there is a tendency to fall upon the Federal Treasurer tooth and nail, and to level at him the accusation that his administration of the financial affairs of the Commonwealth has been productive of nothing but squander and loss. </para>
                        <para>I have to do with a spending Department. I read reports of speeches delivered outside of Parliament, and I  peruse various statements published in the press. All these evince a great desire for economy, and denounce the Government for extravagance. Hard upon my reading of these particulars, however, it has often been my experience that the men who have made the strangest denunciations have pleaded with me for the continuance of some source of expenditure which the Government had proposed to cut down. I may cite, for example, the matter of vocational training classes. Occasionally these classes have become so reduced in numbers that there has been no warrant for continuing two or three of them in one neighbourhood, and they have been merged into one. Immediately, however, protests have been raised in the locality where a class consisting of three or four trainees has been disbanded and merged with others. The fact is that if any evidence of extravagance can be discovered by critics of the Budget, the chances are that those expenditures have been maintained because of some pressure brought to bear from outside sources ; and the experience has been that this pressure has been applied in most pronounced form by those very individuals who have been most eloquent and insistent in their demands for economy. </para>
                        <para>With respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon's</inline> inquiries upon shipping matters, the Government intend shortly to indicate their policy. I trust that the honorable senator will then be placed in possession of . the information which he seeks. There is a great cry raised everywhere concerning the fact of the Government continuing to build ships when vessels can be bought more cheaply abroad. I wonder if those who argue after that fashion would be prepared to apply their logic to everything imported into Australia. What is the Anti-Dumping Bill intended for? When there isa slump, and other countries are heaping their goods into the local market for sale at less than the cost of local manufacture, the cry about anti-dumping provisions is raised. </para>

There are some people who have not forgotten the con- tract, who know it exists, and who yet are opposed to. the transfer of the Seat of Government to the Federal Capital. The loudest opposition comes from Victoria, and particularly from Melbourne, and we are entitled to ask whether the opposition is based on patriotic grounds, or whether consciously or unconsciously the opponents of the transfer to Canberra are actuated by some selfish motives. We may reasonably inquire whether those people are afraid of losing a certain amount of prestige, or perhaps a certain amount of financial support, through the Seat of Government being removed from Melbourne. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot see how going to Canberra would affect the representation. I  a3k  whether they are actuated by patriotic grounds or by the question of the personal convenience of members and officials. It has been stated openly and publicly by members of this Parliament from Victoria, some of whom represent Victorian constituencies to-day, that they would not be able to go to Canberra because it would so interfere with their arrangements that they would either have to give up their business, or cease to be members of the Federal Parliament. It has been affirmed that in their case they would prefer to sever their connexion with the Parliament. Some three or four .months ago the  Hon.  James Page, whose death sent the Parliament into mourning, submitted a motion' in the other House practically similar to the one I have just moved, and, within two or three days of the motion being presented, a leading article appeared in one' of the principal metropolitan newspapers of Melbourne. I quite ad'mit that a leading article in a newspaper may be only the private opinion of the person who writes it, or it may reflect only the opinion of the proprietor of the paper, but 1 think we may assume that when such an article is written, either for or against a cause prominently before the minds of the public, the strongest possible arguments available to the writer for or against the question will be employed. The leading newspapers are wealthy organizations, and they are able to obtain the services of the ablest writers on the particular questions dealt with. </para>

                    <para class="block">If we take the arguments used by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper, which' is one of the ablest, and certainly one of the bitterest, opponents of the transfer of the Federal Parliament to Canberra, I presume we shall be covering the strongest objections which can be raised to the proposal. It is stated in the article referred to that it is very desirable that those who object to the transfer should give full force to their objections. So I take it that in this article we have the full force of the objections raised to the Federal Capital being established at Canberra. It is a long article, which one may fairly say embodies those arguments. To begin with, we are told that there are difficulties in the way, apart from the cruelties it would inflict upon members. I might be permitted to pause one moment here, because this is the first time to my knowledge since Federation - and I have been a member of Parliament since the inception of Federation - that a single word has been raised in this particular newspaper as to any inconvenience that might be occasioned to members. Always, until this time, when anything has been proposed for the convenience of members, it has been denounced by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> as extravagant.. Now, for the first time, this newspaper speaks very tenderly of the cruelty and inconvenience that might 'arise through members being transferred to Canberra. </para>

                    <para>My chief object to-night will be to try to persuade the Senate to fix some particular date on which we shall transfer the Parliament to Canberra. It is extremely interesting to read the - history of the transfer of the capital in America from Philadelphia to Washington. The history of that movement shows how analogous to the position in Australia are the circumstances under which Washington was built. In the first place every objection was raised against leaving the place which was. then the Seat of Government to go into new, virgin, and  neutral territory. Vested interests played their part, just as they are doing in Australia to-day. State jealousies were at work in the same way. At last an American senator submitted a motion practically similar to the one I have moved this evening, except that it did not deal with  His  Majesty's Ministers. The senator simply moved that the  President  of theSenateshould summon that body to meet at Washington. Certain articles were written in the press of America' at the time dealing with the cruelty of leaving the flesh-pots of Philadelphia in order to go into the wilderness of the Potomac. In fact, I am not quite sure that there was not a certain amount of plagiarism in the article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 13th April. This is what was published in an American article - </para>

                        <para>In. the last year of the century, Congress moved, bag and baggage, to its future municipal home. What it found there did not excite any very great enthusiasm. The surface of the so-called city was covered with scrub oaks, and the. shrubbery which flourishes in marshy places, of which there were only too many near the Capitol. The largest avenue (Pennsylvania) was in reality a morass covered with alder bushes. Streets were an unknown luxury. The solitary sidewalk, between the Capitol and the Treasury, was improvised of chips hewn from the public buildings, and the sharp fragments lacerated both the feet and the feelings of pedestrians. The Capitol, White House, Treasury, and War Department buildings were in process of erection or just completed, but there were no other buildings of size or importance, not even hotels. The disgusted members were obliged to lodge at Georgetown and to go thither by stages over very bad roads. The contrast was the more unhappy as many members had grown attached to the comforts and refinements of Philadelphia, which at that time boasted 50,000 inhabitants. In the end, however, this barrenness bore good fruit. The very obvious defects before their eyes made all men, whatever their previous theories on the subject, more favorably inclined to render the city at least habitable, if not elegant. </para>

                    <para>The Americans did that. . If we were called upon to move to Canberra tomorrow we would not have to put up with the inconveniences that the members of Parliament in America had to put up with. In proof of that statement, I have here the first report of the Federal Capital Advisory Committee, which, I think, has been laid on the table of this Chamber. There are some interesting things in that report, and one of them I would like to read. There has been a certain amount of work done at Canberra, and in regard to this the report says - </para>

I happened to be in another House when, strange to say, a Minister of the Crown at that time denounced some of our officials for the work done at Canberra. A Royal Commission was appointed, and some remarks of that Commission were not flattering to those who did the work. Some people had an idea that there had been a great deal of extravagance at the Capital, and I think it only right to read what this Commission, which was appointed by the Government, said. </para>

                        <para>An adequate and satisfactory water supply has been provided, including a weir and reservoir on the Cotter River impounding 380,000,000 gallons; an electrically-operated pumping station; 31/4 miles of rising pipe mains; pipe-head reservoir at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Stromlo</inline> (3,000,000 gallons capacity) ; 61/2 miles of gravitation pipe main to Red Hill; and a reservoir at Red Hill (3,000,000 gallons capacity). Special attention is invited to the attached detailed reports(vide Appendix " C. ") adopted by the Committee, and already submitted with its Fourth Interim Report, of 21st April, 1921. In this report it is shown that the selection of the Cotter River as a source of supply for the Capital has insured an ample and pure water supply, and that the works carried out in connexion with the pumping scheme are amply sufficient to meet the requirements of the Capital for many years to come, whilst facilities exist for the construction of other works for enormously increasing the supply . . . </para>
                        <para>Brickworks, with up-to-date equipment, have been built, and the manufacture of high quality bricks established on sound economic lines, which can be extended to meet future demands. The construction of concrete pipes has also been satisfactorily developed, and investigations have been made into the local sources of supply of other essential materials ... </para>
                        <para>Railway connexion with the New South Wales ' system at Queanbeyan has been . effected and extended in the form of a constructional tramway, crossing the Molonglo River on a timber bridge, into the site for initial development, thus facilitating access and the transport of materials. </para>

                    <para class="block">A good deal of useful and satisfactory work has been done at Canberra in comparison with the work done at Washington before the senators and members of the House of Representatives of America went there. There are many more conveniences, and generally Canberra offers far greater advantages than did Washington. We have rattling good roads throughout the Federal Capital, water, a sewerage system, and electric light. There is Queanbeyan within 8 miles, and Goulburn and Yass within motoring distance, and we have motors and trains running right into the Capital. None of these things was possessed by the Americans when they went to Washing-  ton. I noticed in a newspaper the statement that in one of the State Parliaments of America there is a blind chaplain who every day travels 35 miles there and 35 miles back, in order to attend the meetings of that Parliament to read prayers. We have a great many conveniences that the American members had not. History does not tell us whether the American legislators broke down under the many great inconveniences they had to put up with. I suppose that if they had done so, we would have been told of it. Washington to-day is testimony to the patriotism of the American legislators, who were prepared, in order to fulfil the Federal compact, to put up with the incidental inconveniences. I take it that we are not of softer clay or feebler fibre than the representatives of America. I have lingered a little bit over the question of the inconveniences that would accrue to members. I would be very sorry if the writer of the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> should feel that we were having to put up with a great deal of inconvenience and hardship. As the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> indicated just now, it would not be any greater inconvenience for New South Wales members to go to Canberra than to come to Melbourne. </para>

In the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> article we are told that a contract was entered into between the people of Australia and the people of New South Wales, and they say that "No honest man would endeavour to break that contract." I am very glad indeed to know that a newspaper which has been so bitterly opposed to the transfer to Canberra has stated in a leading article that no honest man would endeavour to prevent the contract being honoured. We are glad of that admission. It is something to help us along the way. But there are some objections to the transfer. We are told that we ought not to go at the present time, because of the financial stringency  of the market.- I take it that this argument is being voiced by a number of people. </para>

                            <para>- I am not talking of property in Melbourne. It would have been better to have gone years ago, because it would have cost us less to transfer. By every day that we delay we are adding to the cost of moving. Therefore, the sooner we can get there the better it will be from a financial standpoint. The continued expansion of the activities of- Parliament increases the cost of removal- every day. The longer Parliament stays here, the greater will be the  activities associated with it. In this Budget there is a new Department created  - the Department of Public Health. Immediately you increase the activities of government,, you must have buildings to put the officers, in, and you have either to rent or build them. If the time comP3 when you have to transfer the activities of government, the greater the number of them the greater the cost of the transfer. Consequently, I have no hesitation in saying that now is the best time, even from the financial stand-point, to move to Canberra. We could have had a better time in the past, but no time will be better in the future. We have a great asset in the Federal Territory - an asset of land that is not being utilized. Immediately we go to Canberra the land will bring in a revenue. There is a revenue being brought in now from the land we have resumed, and. it is paying for its cost already. If we started to create a city, people would go there ' and would build, land values would increase, as they do everywhere -else, and an annual revenue would be derived. 'Instead of this being done, that asset is lying idle. Every day that we delay we are actually losing money. The Government could readily get a private company to put up all the buildings required if it were given the land. </para>

                            <para>- I would not. The land at Canberra is a good asset, and I should not be prepared to part with it. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> had shares in a paying mine, he would not be inclined to hand them over to some one else. I do not suggest that, at the present time, costly buildings should be erected at Canberra, such as might be considered suitable for the National Capital of a people numbering 50,000,-000 or 100,000,000. The population of Australia is little more than 5,000,000, so that marble palaces are not required at Canberra ; bub we should have buildings there, it may be of a temporary character, but suitable for our purposes. It is a matter of indifference whether legislation is passed in a tent or in a marble building.- I venture to say that the mother who has to pay more for boots for her children because Parliament has imposed a duty on boots, is not concerned as to whether the duty was imposed in a tent or in a marble palace. </para>

It may now be 'impossible to erect the necessary temporary buildings in time to enable Parliament to be summoned at Canberra, when it meets after the next adjournment, unless the recess decided upon should be a long one.- I should personally be prepared to give the Government a recess sufficiently long to enable that to be done. I do not hesitate to say that, within twelve months, all the work really necessary for the transfer of- the Seat of Government to Canberra could be done. In connexion with one of the exhibitions held in America, the people of. that country, within twelve months, erected a hotel that housed 20,000 people. </para>

                            <para>- No, there appears to have been some misunderstanding in connexion with this matter. I was present with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Fuller at a public meeting at Katoomba, some little time ago, at which a motion was proposed urging the transfer of the seat of the Government to Canberra. He made a statement at that meeting that, when he was Minister for Home Affairs, he had plans drawn up which would have enabled the transfer to be made in twelve months. I said that I was very pleased to hear his statement, and that when I returned to Melbourne I would ask for those plans. I have asked for them and have been told that they are not in the office of the Department. I have wired to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Fuller telling him what has happened, and I shall get his reply later. It may be that I: misunderstood what he said. But we all know that if people are determined to do anything it can be done. There is one general present who is a member of the Senate, and he could tell honorable senators what was done under pressure in time of war. </para>

                            <para>- One of our generals told me the other day that our engineers built railways, and that marvellous works were completed within a very limited time during the war. Honorable senators have heard of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kirkpatrick,</inline> a very prominent architect of New South Wales', who built the Commonwealth Bank, which every one who sees it will admit is a great credit to all concerned in its erection. I was speaking of it recently to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> E. Box, who was secretary to the High Commissioner some years ago, and who has travelled around the world, and he mentioned that, with the exception of one in New York, he knew of no bank building in any other part of the world to compare with the Commonwealth Bank. When I put a question to- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kirkpatrick</inline> on the subject he told me that if he were given a free hand he could put up the buildings necessary for the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra within twelve months. I admit that he could not do so if he were to be hampered by the Public Works Committee, and we must abolish inquiry by the Public Works Committee so far as these buildings at Canberra are concerned-. There is a good deal to be said in favour of doing so. Surely the work of the Federal Capital Advisory Committee is not to be criticised by the Public Works Committee. </para>

                            <para>- We can abolish that . provision so far as works necessary for the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra are concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kirkpatrick</inline> told me that he could build everything necessary for the transfer of this Parliament to Canberra within twelve months, and I have mentioned the fact that a hotel accommodating 20,000 people was built in the United States of America within that time. The whole population of Canberra will not amount to 20,000 for a number of years to come. If we cannot do what has been done in other countries in the matter of building there must be something wrong with our engineers and contractors. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> will agree that our soldiers compared favorably with the soldiers of Europe, our cricketers have humbled the Englishmen on the cricket field, and, if given a free hand, our architects, engineers, and builders cannot do what similar men have done elsewhere, let us introduce some people into this country who will be able to do it. Do not let us limit our immigrants to rural workers, but let us introduce also people who will be able to help us to build up a nation. Unless Parliament is prepared to give them a free hand and to tell them that it is necessary that they should do the work required within a certain limit of time, we cannot blame our officials if they do not carry out the work in the time required. I was much struck some years ago in learning from, a Queensland representative, I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> that when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Mcllwraith was Premier of Queensland he wanted the military Estimates cut down. He gave his officials a certain time in which to carry out the reductions he required. At the end of a fortnight or three weeks, they came to him and said that they regretted very much that they were unable to cut down the Estimates. He then said, " Very well, gentlemen, I give you another forty-eight hours, and if you cannot do so within that time, other officers will be appointed who will do what I require of you." At the end of the forty-eight hours the Estimates were cut down in the way desired by the Queensland- Premier. </para>

                    <para>I do not desire to take up time arguing the necessity for our going to Canberra. That is not a question for this Parliament to decide. It has already been decided by the people of this country, and the decision is a part of the Federal agreement. Honorable senators representing Western Australia will remember that when the Federal Convention was taking place there was nothing in the draft Constitution about building a railway from east to west. When the State Premiers of that day met they decided amongst themselves that if Western </para>
                    <para class="block">Australia came into the Federation that railway should be built. That was not an agreement between the people of the different States of Australia, but an arrangement arrived at between the Premiers of the various States. Still I venture to say that it had a great deal to do with the construction of the railway, and had an important influence in the Senate and in another place iri inducing members of this Parliament to decide upon its construction. The New South Wales people honoured that part of the Federal bond. We are losing about £500,000 a year on that railway, and the people of New South Wales have to bear nearly half of that loss. If a bond entered into in that way by representatives of the people was honoured, there is all the more reason why a bond entered into between the people of the different States themselves should be given effect. I think that there are no people who should "be more ready to honour this bond than the people of Victoria. When the Conference of State Premiers <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> which I referred took place, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. (after Sir George)</inline> Reid was anxious that the Federal Capital should be established in Sydney, that proposal was objected to by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner. A compromise was arrived at, at the request of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, as a result of which the Capital must be at least 100 miles from Sydney. Consequently, Victorians should be the very last people to raise any outcry about a "bush Capital," because, as I have shown, this provision was inserted in the Constitution at the instigation of the then Premier of this State. We all admit, of course, that we have been very generously treated by the Victorian Government and the Victorian people. For twenty years we have had the use of this building rent free, and a residence for the Governor-General has been placed at our disposal free of interest on capital cost. </para>

                            <para>- Then they should have resigned from the Ministry, instead of scurrying away and not voting on this issue. To my mind, it is unfair for members of a Ministry not to take their full share of any responsibility. I leave it at that. We are entitled to expect the Ministry to be united and to be solidly behind us in this matter, because it is part and parcel of the Government policy. The Ministry are responsible for the Estimates, in which certain provision is made for the transfer to Canberra, and we have a right to expect that every member of the Government shall vote for the proposal. Every New South Wales member, whether Nationalist or Labour, has voted every time for the transfer of Parliament to Canberra. In Victoria every member of the Labour party also supported the proposal, which, as I have shown, was opposed by certain Nationalists and two Victorian members of the Ministry in another place. As a member of the Nationalist party, and anxious that it should succeed at the next election, I am concerned that people may ask why it is that while members of one party are prepared to honour the contract, there is hesitancy on the part of certain members of another party. </para>

                    <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> article, to which I have already referred, goes on to say that there are dangers to Democracy if the. Federal Parliament is transferred to Canberra, owing to a weakened representation. All I can say is that there will be no weakened representation from New South Wales. It is quite possible that one or two distinguished representatives of Victoria, rather than sacrifice their business interests in order to go, would retire from  the  Parliament; but it does not by any means follow that, taking Australia as a whole, there would be any weakened representation at Canberra. The article suggests, also, that without the effective exercise of public opinion there will be an aggravation of machine government, and a wider separation of the Administration from the people. If that is true, then we have no right to go to Canberra to-morrow, or the day after, or, indeed, at any time. However, I shall not argue that question to-night. When Federation was an accomplished fact, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Barton, whose name stands high in Australia and throughout the civilized world, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Deakin, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> E. O'Connor, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. B.</inline> R. Wise, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, all were of the opinion that the Capital should hot be in some great city, but rather that it should be removed from ally such influences. With all due respect to the writer of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> article, I think I can safely rest upon the opinion of these distinguished leaders in the Federal movement. I also note that the opinion of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is not shared by many other journals throughout the Commonwealth. For instance, the <inline font-style="italic">Kalgoorlie Miner</inline> states! - </para>

                            <para>- No; I will not do that. I think we are entitled to have a definite date fixed for the meeting of the Federal Parliament at Canberra. If we do this - and it was done in America - then the Seat of Government will be removed to the Federal Capital on that date. Already we have a large number of conveniences there. It is near to Goulburn, Queanbeyan, and within motoring distance of Yass. We do not want elaborate buildings. Even some of the items mentioned in the report to which I have referred may, I thirds, be- cut down. For instance, there is the provision, £3,000 for taking the Prime Minister, the  President,  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> across. I think it is possible to do that for less than £3,000. Therefore, we might save a little' on that and upon other items. When the contract was honorably entered into twenty years ago, the people of New South Wales did not ask for a time limit. They trusted to 'the honour of the people of Australia, as represented in this Parliament, and I am loath to believe otherwise than that the people's representatives here are anxious to honour the bond as. soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>. - After the official announcement yesterday that it was practically impossible for the Seat of Government ito be transferred to Canberra for at least three years, I am astonished to find 'a motion such as that just moved being submitted to the Senate for serious consideration. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> was speaking, I intimated by interjection that the people who made' the contract should have the right to alter it, and I repeat it. During a recent visit to New South Wales, I had numerous opportunities of discussing the question with prominent residents in Sydney, and I found that there is not any ambition on the part of the residents in that State to have the Capital transferred; but there is a strong desire on the part of some politicians for a move to be made in that direction. </para>

                            <para>- I thought that old argument would be " trotted out," and for the information of the honorable senator, I may say that at this juncture I shall deal with the construction of such a line as I expect the Senate to treat the proposal embodied in this motion. SenatorThomas said that if a transfer had been made some years ago the expense involved, would have been considerably less than it  would be at present. That is quite true. But the honorable senator must remember that when we return to normal conditions a transfer could be made at much less expense than would now be involved. Arguments have been adduced that by transferring the Seat of Government considerable expenditure in rents now paid in Melbourne would be avoided; but many of the offices established in Melbourne and in Sydney would still be required if the Seat of Government were transferred. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think we could. I have no desire to assist in repudiating any contract entered into unless it is the desire of all parties to the con tract. If it is the wish of a majority of the people to establish a Federal Capital, I am prepared to assist in honouring the compact at the proper time. What is our position to-day? We are labouring under a burden of taxation. Developmental work in every part of the Commonwealth is being starved owing to the high cost of money; and, notwithstanding this, there is the ridiculous and absurd suggestion that money should be expended in this useless manner. Let us consider for a moment the huge development that could take place, for instance, in the productive lands in Queensland by the expenditure of capital. I desire to conserve the interests of all States, and I trust shall never be charged with being parochial in matters which relate to the well-being of Australia. If the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> had not published the articles to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> has referred, he would have been robbed of his ammunition, as his arguments from beginning to end were based on quotations from 'that newspaper. It has been said from time to time that it would be in the interests of good government to get away from the criticism of thepublic press and the environment of large cities; but I do not know how any Government can expect to, avoid press criticism. It would be regrettable indeed if it were thought that a transfer to Canberra would be the means of avoiding press criticism, which is necessary in the interests of good, government. </para>

                            <para>- That is quite likely. There seems to be no regard whatever for the circumstances in which this compact was' entered into, and no comparison has been made with that time and the . present. Since the agreement was made, millions of pounds have been spent in the defence of Australia, and although no one desires to take exception to the expenditure which has been involved in defending our liberties, we cannot forget that our liabilities in this regard must further delay the establishment of the Federal Capital. A few years ago taxation was about £3 6s. per head of population, but to-day it is. about £12. When this proposal was discussed our total taxation was in the vicinity of £13,000,000 sterling, but to-day it is between £50,000,000 and £60,000,000. Notwithstanding the colossal burden which the taxpayers have to carry, and the enormous increase in interest rates, this ridiculous proposal is submitted for our serious consideration. Queensland has recently floated a loan at about 7 per cent., which is an indication of the 'high cost of money. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> suggest that the Seat of Government could be transferred to Canberra within, say, twelve months? </para>

South . Australia, and Tasmania. I do not think that there is one honorable senator who would be convenienced by the transfer, and, as a representative of South Australia, I have a right to voice the opinions of the majority of the taxpayers in that State. The people outside are screaming for economy, and this is an instance in which expenditure can be curtailed. It is our duty to consider the cost of money and material before entering into such a huge contract, which will cost the people of Australia many millions. Are we to be accommodated at Canberra in tin shanties or tents? Although our pioneers who developed our vacant spaces were prepared to reside in such primitive structures, I do not think those who are responsible for the framing of our legislation would be willing to do so. </para>

                        <para>. -  I support the motion so ably moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas.</inline> The Senate cannot forget its responsibilities to the people of Australia in connexion with this matter, and although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> referred to the transfer of Parliament to Canberra as being untimely and uncalled for, I may inform him that it is many years overdue. This question should have been settled more than ten years ago. Honorable senators should not misinform others as to the true feeling regarding the duty . of the Federal Parliament to keep the promise entered into at the inception of Federation. It is not only a politicians' question in New . South Wales, because from one end of the State to the other there is a continual and emphatic demand for immediate action, and until the transfer is made this Parliament stands condemned in the eyes of the people, because it has practically repudiated its con tract. The senior partner - New South Wales - which pays one-half of the taxation of the Commonwealth, was promised over twenty years ago that a transfer would be made, and up to the present that arrangement has not been honoured. For the first ten years there was reasonable ground for delay, because Parliament had not set its house in order or organized its work. There were many difficulties with which to contend, but for the last ten years not. only have the main difficulties been overcome, but large initial expenditure at the Capital site has left it in such a position that the Government could be called upon to meet there within three months. </para>

                            <para>- I realize that. Let us look at the matter from a financial point of view. If the Capital were established next month, there would be such a demand for land and increases in land values that it would be the best investment that the Government had entered into. Values would not increase by 10 per cent., but by 100 per cent., and as the land is the property of the Commonwealth, the whole question of finance would adjust itself from the day this Parliament was big enough - will I say true enough - to keep its promise to the people of New South Wales. I recall that there was once a close division taken in this Chamber concerning whether a railway should be built from South Australia to Western Australia. It was my personal view that the railway should have been constructed from Queensland through the centre of Australia to the West; but, because Western Australia had come into the Federation on the strength of a promise that the transcontinental line would be built direct, I voted in support of the project. I regarded the promise as a sacred one; and, as a representative of a State which had agreed to honour the pact, I had no option but to vote as I did. This matter of the establishment of the Federal Capital at Canberra cannot be put aside as a simple question of personal convenience or otherwise. What does the Constitution provide ? What did the whole of the States vote upon, and what did the whole of the people of </para>

                            <para>- I do; but I do not look forward to its becoming much cheaper than at present for many years. Most of the costly work at Canberra has already been undertaken and completed. I refer to the water supply, to the electricity plant, to the preparation of the roads and sewerage, to the making of bricks for buildings and homes, to the supply of timber, and other things. Much money has been laid out upon those works, which are ready and waiting, and in respect of which there can be no return until the Capital shall have been established. The value of the city site will increase, perhaps, one hundredfold in five years. Its population will become assured when the Federal Government has been established there. I hope to live to see land which the Government originally purchased at £5 an acre become worth £500 per foot. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister has provided a valuable' illustration-. The Capital city will be built as a model, and it will ever remain the property of the people of the Commonwealth. It will more than repay the interest on its cost within twelve months of its establishment. In a few years thereafter it will give such an ample return that the only regret which any one will be able to utter will be that the transfer had not been accomplished long before. I am satisfied that the Federal Capital will be established a,t&gt; Canberra within a very brief period. I would almost wish to see the present Government lose its opportunity to establish it. If a» Labour Government were returned to power it would be a matter of only some twenty-four hours before orders were issued for the meeting of the first Parliament under the new <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> at Canberra. Even if the Labour Government were returned on a minority and knew that its first meeting of Parliament would be its last, that meeting would be held at Canberra; and I am positive that there would never again be another meeting of the Federal Legislature outside of Canberra. Almost all the work that has been done so far has been put in hand by Labour Administrations. Visitors to Canberra to-day may see in the visitors' book a statement penned by an honorable member of another place, who is now a Nationalist. I refer to the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> who stated that he was satisfied that the Capital would never be established at Canberra unless by a Labour Government. I advise the present Government to move quickly if it wishes to deprive a Labour Government of the honour. </para>

                            <para>- I regard the motion as an expression of opinion that, at some reasonably early period, a definite move should be made in that direction. I wish to say a word, first, as to what I conceive to be the attitude of New South Wales. I would not like to 'have it believed that that State is unreasonable, or lacking in a proper sense of what is due to the country at large, or unimpressed with the difficulties which confront the Government to-day. New South Wales has possessed her soul in patience: she has accepted the inevitable, and she would . not have been so vocal as she has been upon this matter but for one consideration. When it was obvious that efforts were being made - some of them finding expression in speeches delivered in this Parliament - to delay the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra, New South Wales said very little. She expected such opposition. But what has aroused New South Wales to indignation is the obvious suggestion of repudiation now running through much of the opposition. New South Wales has considered the special circumstances of . the country due to the war and has been content to wait. She would even now consent to further delay if she were assured that at the end of a reasonable . period the promise would be redeemed. She has been warned, however, by the press of this city and by the representatives of this State, that it is not delay, but the cancellation of the contract, which is being sought. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> rather surprised me when he read some extracts from an article published in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age. .</inline> The leader writer of that newspaper must have been at the time, like Jove, nodding, when he wrote that no honest man would repudiate the obligation. But who was it that called; the Canberra project a scheme to erect a " bush capital " ? It was the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> If Canberra is a bush capital to-day, and if that is an objection to the establishment of the Federal Parliament there, it is an objection which will hold good next year and ten years hence. Has the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> ever described the proposition as a good one If Has the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> ever said that the contract is one which ought to be honoured, but in respect of which there should be some little further reasonable delay? No; the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> has referred to Canberra as"this bush capital " and has created a prejudice in the public mind against it. Its arguments have not been for delay; its references to "a bush capital ' ' have not -been in the interests of reasonable postponement. They -have all been levelled at the abandonment of the project; which is exactly what the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> seeks. That newspaper has referred to a tremendous amount of waste incurred by creating a Federal Capital at Canberra when there is at disposal this magnificent city of Melbourne. That is an argument that will be as strong five years hence as it is to-day. It is an argument not for postponement, but one which suggests the wisdom of the abandonment of the contract. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> . says the scheme is a danger to Democracy. If it is a danger to-day the argument is one directed against going there at all.I shall cite one other argument, namely, the reference of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> to the discomforts which will have to be borne by members of Parliament. One is. disposed to smile. When the Greeks bring gifts take the liberty of becoming suspicious. In any -case, if the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra will prove a discomfort to members in 1922 or 1923 the journey will be equally as uncomfortable in 1933 or 1934. Here, then-, is another argument, not for postponement, but for abandonment. A great cry for economy has been raised in this State; but has it ever occurred to the public that -there is a very close connexion between that cry and the opposition of Victoria to the creation of Canberra as- the Federal Capital? I say that there is a very close connexion. </para>

                            <para>- If it entailed greater expenditure to remain here and would mean actual economy to go to Canberra, the hostility displayed in this State and city would not be lessened. There has grown in the minds of the people of New South Wales the thought that these arguments have not been advanced as pleas for postponement, but that they have all been levelled at the creation of a public feeling which will render possible the abandonment of the Federal Capital scheme. In spite of all the clamour of hostility, I take the liberty of doubting whether Victoria as a whole is opposed to the transfer. Of course, I could get no support in Collins-street, and possibly none within the four corners of the " Block," but I shall take Victoria as a whole. Victoria was a party to the original compact. She voted for the Constitution, in which the question of the Capital was left open. When the Constitution was amended Victoria was called upon to vote again. How did Victoria vote ? With a diminished majority? No; but always with the same uniform majority as on the. first occasion, and she voted for the amended Constitution, in which New South Wales was being conceded the privilege of having the Federal Capital established within its territory. </para>

                            <para>- I thank the honorable senator for reminding me of that. Victoria supported the amendment, well knowing the arrangement made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> who has been known on the platform as a supporter of the proposal on the ground that it was embodied in the Constitution, on one  occasion told an audience that, being under age at the time, he was not one of . those who had made the compact, but he said the people of Victoria had made it, and, if they wanted anybody to help break it, it would be necessary to get somebody other than himself. So it does not look as though Victoria was so hostile as Melbourne metropolitan journals would lead us to believe. The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> is a typical Victorian, who is well versed in politics. He  was  a member of the Hughes Government at the last election, and he went out as a supporter of the platform that the Government then submitted. The programme contained adherence to the redemption of the Canberra compact. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> had an easy win, and I have never heard anybody say that he was flying in the face of the public opinion of Victoria. There are certain sections in Victoria who, consciously or unconsciously, are moved by their own local interests, and they are doing all they can to create a public opinion so strong that it will hamper the Government . in its plain duty to redeem a pledge contained in the Constitution itself. Let me deal with one of the arguments addressed to the Chamber by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> because that argument also suggests repudiation. He said that those who made the compact could alter it. If he means that by submitting that question now, as an amendment of the Constitution, a majority of . the people of Australia could alter it, I beg to differ. Technically they could, but this is 'a compact between the people of five States and the people of one State, and the compact cannot be morally altered -unless we get the consent, not only of the five States, but of the one also. </para>

It seemed to me that he was talking 'more of eternity than of time. He said he would agree to the proposal when we found all the capital necessary for the developmental work to be done in Australia. When -we have -found all the money necessary to develop our enormous stretches of empty country - the honorable senator  . would  proceed to honor the compact. In view of arguments of this kind, one cannot be surprised that New South Wales  considers  it time for her to wake up.

                            <para>- Then I wish to make it easier for that to be done. The establishment of the Seat of. Government at Canberra is certainly one method by which the congestion of population in the State capitals could be relieved. It would not make a difference in the number of buildings occupied, but, instead of all of  them  being, massed in the present Seat of  Government,  some would be at Canberra. The Government has plainly told the people where it stands. It does not for a moment give any encouragement to the idea, either of abandoning the project, or of postponing it so indefinitely that it will die of old age. On the other hand, while the Government is anxious to carry out the project, it has some regard for the financial position of the country. So it has not asked Parliament to approve of what might be regarded as an extravagant expenditure on the Capital on this year's Estimates. Rather than force some hectic pace, as is suggested when Parliament is asked to get to Canberra within twelve months, the Government has come to the opinion that better results would be achieved if expenditure proceeded in some measured way. </para>

                            <para>- No, but. after due deliberation. The Government must shape its course by considering to what extent it can provide the money to proceed with' the undertaking, and how far it can proceed so that for every pound spent there will be a reasonable asset. Those two considerations have shaped the Government policy, and it has put forward a proposal which it asks Parliament to approve, and which it thinks Parliament will accept. The amount of expenditure proposed is within the competency of the finances. It is not so large a sum as I, as a New South Wales representative, would like to see on the Estimates. It certainly will not satisfy the more enthusiastic advocates of the Federal Capital, but it will disarm all opposition from, those who desire to consider our financial position rather than see the ultimate abandonment of the project. I do' not know that I can support the motion in its. present form, because it is not in the mind of the Govern- - ment to have the necessary buildings provided' to enable the Parliament to go to Canberra for the next session. I rather fear the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> that the adjournment should be for so long a period as would be necessary to enable that to- be done. -As a matter of convenience, it is' necessary for Parliament to meet at least once a year. If we 'adjourned until next session to enable effect to be given to the motion, we would come into conflict with the Constitution itself. It will be realized that it is impossible for the Parliament to meet at  Canberra within twelve months, and I suggest such an amendment as would represent an expression of opinion that efforts should be made for the Parliament to proceed there, and that Parliament, having regard to financial and other considerations, should endeavour to meet there at the earliest possible date. </para>

                        <para>. - After listening to the mover of the motion, and to the speech of the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Milieu),</inline> I do not know that it would make a great deal of difference whether I voted for or against the motion, but, if it is to stand as printed, 1 would certainly be sorry to give a silent vote. I, congratulate the mover on the thorough, concise, and clear manner in which he dealt with the subject. The Minister, although he will vote against the motion in its present form, has supported it. I recognise that Australia is committed to the Federal Capital. Wisely or unwisely - I am inclined to think unwisely - it has been included as part of the Federal compact that there should be a Federal Capital in New South Wales not nearer than 100 miles to Sydney. That being so, that compact will have to be honoured at the  proper time. I have had the opportunity of viewing the site chosen, and, after thoroughly inspecting and studying the plans as presented by the engineer there, I am convinced that no better site could have been found for the purpose. If we are going to, have a Capital City, I think the site at Canberra is all that can be desired. I was very pleased with the layout of the City. It will certainly be a model city when completed. I am not nearly so optimistic as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> regarding the wonderful developments that are likely to take place there, and the enormous capital that he said would be created by the establishment of the City. I do not look with any hope to the Federal Capital ever being more than a model city. I cannot imagine that there will be a large settlement there. I cannot imagine that there will be industries to provide employment for people settling there. A Seat of Government will always carry with it numbers of the leisured classes. There is a certain prestige associated with a Seat of Government. There will be the officers necessary to carry on the governmental duties. There will also be the trades people necessary to attend to the wants of the community. I cannot imagine that land values are ever going to be £500 per foot, or even £10 a foot. They will not be that price in our time, anyhow, whatever may occur when the population of Australia is fifty, sixty, seventy, or even one hundred millions. If the motion is insisted upon as printed, I shall certainly oppose it, because now, of all times, whatever remissness has occurred in the past, whatever faults have been committed by previous Governments in not establishing the Capital before the war, is the most inopportune time for launching upon a large expenditure for the purpose. I ask honorable senators whether we have the money to spend ? The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Milieu)</inline> seemed rather to ridicule the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> that money was wanted for developmental works. Have we plenty of money for all those undertakings that are essential to the welfare of Australia Have we plenty of money for the defence of Australia. It will be no use having a Capital City if we lose Australia. Would Australia be one iota safer by the establishment of a Federal Capital? Have we plenty of money for the conservation of water, which is so essential to the prosperity of Australia? </para>

                    <para class="block">Have we plenty of money for the hundred and one different enterprises which will build up the prosperity of Australia, make the people happier, and increase the population? If we have plenty, then let us build the Federal Capital. I have nothing to say about the jealousies - real or imaginary - of the people of New South Wales and Victoria; but I say that the people of Australia will not be one jot better off by the establishment of the Federal Capital at Canberra. There may be 'a few people, of course, who would be associated with the Capital, and would be a little better off financially, but Australia would be no sounder than it is to-day. No better legislation would be passed at Canberra than would be passed in this chamber. </para>

                            <para>- The air is very bracing. In Victoria there are many samples of weather, and if you do not like one kind you can have another. I ridicule the idea that members of this Chamber can be influenced, browbeaten, inveigled, or coerced into some -action that they would not be guilty of if they were in the isolated position of the Federal Capital. The suggestion is ridiculous" I remember, in 1917, when thousands of people were on the steps of Parliament House, howling and declaring that they would do this, that, and the other to members if they could not get what they wanted. Did it have the slightest influence on any member of this Chamber or of the other Legislature? Surely not. If any member were influenced, he would be unfitted for the trust that his electors have reposed in him. As far as legislation is concerned, it will not be altered by the fact that it is enacted in the isolated position at Canberra. While I want to assure the Senate that no influence can change my adherence to the contract, which I realize has got to be carried out, I am strongly opposed to any endeavour to force the Government to incur extraordinary expenditure at the present time. The agitation to break the contract, which has been referred to by the Minister, has no sympathy from me. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator knows perfectly well that to break the contract would mean that the Federal Capital would never be erected. To delay its erection while the cost of material is 100 per cent, over the normal cost is another question altogether. I said some twelve months ago that, although there was then a certain amount of unemployment in Australia, I could foresee a day when unemployment would be more keenly felt, and when the Government would be very glad that they had one, two, or three millions of money to expend in finding work for the people. The carrying out of this work at Canberra is a consideration that might influence members to some degree, but I want to say that I am not going to vote for this motion as it stands. If  a  motion is proposed, setting forth that this Parliament has no sympathy with any agitation for breaking the compact entered into and embodied in the Constitution, I shall be in sympathy with it, and I will vote for it; but I will not vote for a motion calling on- the Government to expend money in the erection of a  Capital  which can be done without for a considerable time, when money is so badly required for other purposes. </para>

                        <para>, -  I would like to explain my position because, when the Estimates were before the Senate last year, I voted against the expenditure of £150,000 at Canberra. I did so, not because I had any desire to tear up a solemn obligation and a solemn compact entered into with New South Wales, but because I honestly and conscientiously believed that the time was not opportune. I differ to some extent from my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> and I may be taking my political life in my hands when I say that although I do not support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> although I do not believe in being rushed, into the building of this Capital, I support the Government in their wise, prudent, and cautious way of spending money by degrees on the Capital. After I had given my vote, I went to Canberra, and I am sorry to notice that many honorable senators have not taken the trouble to see it for themselves. I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> has been there. </para>

                            <para>- You were therefor ten minutes when the Prince of Wales was there. I stayed there for a week, and found that £1,700,000 had been spent there. I found that all the spade work had been done, and that all. the statements that the newspaper press of Victoria and other countries have been circulating about the Cotter River being a trickle are lies. I found the Cotter a wide stream, containing the purest water in Australia. The Government has built a reservoir 50 feet deep, and extending for13/4 miles. I found that there was enough water at Canberra to reticulate not only the Capital, but, probably, the city of Melbourne. I found all these things actually in being, and I said, "Are we going to let the crows roost on this, apart altogether from our solemn obligation to New South Wales?" found that a powerhouse and sewers had been constructed. I saw magnificent roads, far better than most of the- roads that we have in South Australia. I found a water supply, while practically nothing had to be done but to make the streets in the Capital, and to let public enterpriser select sites for business premises. I am sure that I am safe in: predicting that the result will be so good that the capital will pay for itself within a period of fifty years, which is a very short time in the history of a great nation. I was one of the senators who asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to construct the North-South railway. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 'Hughes</inline> very generously and justly promised to go on with the work, at once. In fulfilment of his pledge he sent a party to inspect the track right from Oodnadatta to the Northern Territory, Can we expect the New South Wales members of this Senate to vote for the North-South railway if members for South Australia tear up the contract in regard to the Federal Capital? The members for New South Wales will bear me out when I say that I have never approached one of them for a vote. </para>

I have such an intense admiration for the character, the ability, and, I might almost say, the nobility, of members of this Senate, that I believe that there is not one of them who would make an unholy bargain for any purpose whatever, much less for the construction of the Federal Capital or theNorth-South railway. I am sorry that I cannot vote for the motion in its entirety, but I support the Government in its suggestion to spend the amount stated on the Estimates for Canberra - I cannot recall what the amount is at the moment - because the construction of the capital is a high and solemn duty that we owe not only to the people of New South Wales, but to the people of Australia. </para>

I intend to support the Government in the matter because I regard that as a duty I owe not only to the people of New South Wales but- to the- . people of Australia generally, who come within my purview as a legislator for the whole continent.

                        <para>. - I also do not wish to give a silent vote on this motion: I say at once that there is no idea in my mind of repudiating the contract entered into with New South Wales. We are all agreed that that contract must be honoured. At the same time I cannot vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas'</inline> motion in its present form. It is only twenty-one years since the Federationbecame an accomplished fact, and twenty-one  years  in the life of a nation is but a very small span of time. If I might make  a  suggestion, which, I think, was also made ; by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen a little while ago, I think  that  a time should be fixed within  which  we shall remove to Canberra. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that money is . particularly scarce at the present time, and if, within the next two or three years large sums are to he expended at Canberra, the money will be diverted from enterprises which at present are more urgent. I think that we should say that we are going to Canberra within a specified period. If we do that, we shall get there. </para>

                <para>May I remind honorable senators,  in  order to prevent confusion, that on. the passing of -my motion the Senate will meet at 11 o'clock to-morrow morning, in view of the fact that, prior to  our  recent adjournment, we altered our Sessional Orders, and have  not  since reverted to  the  old . practice. Another reason for ask ing the Senate to meet to-morrow at  11  a.m. is that I expect the Supply. Bill will have  reached  us.  toy  that time, and I shall seek the cooperation of honorable senators to pass it in time to . permit of the payment of the Public Service at the usual time. </para>
