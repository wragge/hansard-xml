                <para>Thisis an ordinary Supply. Bill, with the exception of one provision. When I say that it is an ordinary Supply Bill I mean that it provides for the continuance for one month of the ordinary services of the year upon conditions to which Parliament has already given its sanction. The exceptional provision is for. three instead of for two pay days. Public Service salaries, as honorable senators are aware, are paid fortnightly, but it happens on this occasion that the third pay day of the coming financial year will . fall on the 4th August, and unless the course proposed in this Bill were adopted, it would be necessary, before the 4th. August to ask for a further warrant to enable pay-  merits due oil that date to be made. That is: the only way in which this. Bill is in any way an exception from the ordinary Supply Bills. There is, however, one item covered by the Bill : to which. I wish specially to refer. In. the vote for the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department it will be observed that there is an unusually large amount provided for. That arises from the fact that there is- included in the vote an amount of &#163;200,000 payable to the Imperial . Government under these circumstances:. Prior to the war. Australian mails were carried under the contract with the Orient Company. With the outbreak of war shipping was dislocated, and, as honorable senators are aware, many vessels, were commandeered for war purposes., That applied particularly to boats of the Orient Line. Consequent upon that disturbance of facilities for the carriage of our&#39; mails, it became necessary that Australian mails should be shipped on any occasion which offered, and. they were frequently shipped, on vessels of the. Peninsular and Oriental Line, with which the- Imperial Government had their contract for bringing English mails here. Under an arrangement which exists under the Postal&#39; Union Convention we became liable to the Imperial Government, which had the contract with the Peninsular and Oriental Company, for certain charges in respect of the mails placed upon boats under contract with the Imperial authorities. Quite recently they submitted their account in conformity with the Postal Union. Convention, and claimed. from us an. amount of &#163;321,000. </para>

                        <para>- The amount provided for in this Bill covers a number of years, and the cost to Australia is less- than it would have been had the original contract with the Orient Company been fulfilled. I have said that the Imperial Government claimed &#163;321,000, but after considerable negotiation between that Government and our own, they have agreed to accept the sum of &#163;200,000, and that amount is in this Bill included in the vote for the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. It is rather interesting that when our facilities for the transport of letters&#39; became less the number of letters to be forwarded very greatly increased, consequent upon the fact that so many of our soldier citizens were in Europe. The percentage of mail matter to be carried increased tremendously; by 189 per cent. in one year, and by 529 per cent, in the year in which the maximum of. mail matter was carried. These figures show the great- effect on the weight of our postal matter which was consequent upon so. large a number of our citizens, being abroad, and the correspondence passing between them and. those whom they had left at home. </para>

                    <para>. -  As under this Bill  we  shall commence the expenditure on public services for the new year, its consideration  affords an excellent opportunity for the Economy League, which, I suppose, is represented in the Senate, to get to work on the reduction of expenditure right from the beginning. If we pass a sum of money for public services for the month of July, measured by last year&#39;s votes, that will be a very good reason why, at the end of July, we should pass another Supply Bill based on last year&#39;s votes for August, and so on for September, October, and until the end of the financial year. But as there is in Melbourne, which is the home of economy, a burning desire for retrenchment, that is being fanned into flame in certain quarters, I should like to see a development of that movement in the Senate. If there are any members of that League here sufficiently interested to try to bring about economy, I suggest that they move a reduction in the Estimates of each Department by 2&#189; per cent. They may think that is not enough, and declare for 5 per cent., and possibly some, even more enthusiastic, may declare for 10 per cent. If it is essential to retrench in any of the Departments, to my way of thinking the only people in a position to retrench effectively are the heads of Departments and the Ministers concerned. I do not think the Senate can take up any item and say, &#34;We will wipe this out,&#34; or, &#34; We will reduce that.&#34; I have a pleasant recollection of being connected with the Retrenchment party in the New South Wales Parliament thirty years ago. The Government and Opposition were very evenly balanced, and we sent the Estimates back to be reduced by 10 per cent. They were reduced by 10 per cent, accordingly. That stands as the highest -achievement in economy ever accomplished in any of the Parliaments in Australia. There are, of course, Governments so sensitive as not to stand that kind of treatment, and it may be that quite a number of gentlemen who manage the affairs of the Commonwealth Departments might refuse to carry on if they were treated so rudely as the Parliament of New South Wales in 1891 treated the Government of that State. </para>

Millen, the Minister for Repatriation, tried to make out that it was the first time any one had ever heard of the promise that a payment of one-third would be made in May last, one-third in May next, and the balance at the expiry of the term, or that the bonds were to be redeemed in three equal instalments. </para>

                <para>SenatorGARDINER.- If the honorable senator admits that the head of a Government can distinctly promise returned soldiers that, irrespective of the necessitous cases, one-third of the total amount would be redeemed in May, 1921, and the remaining two-thirds in equal instalments later, and that that promise does not carry with it the implication that each bond-holder is to be treated equally, I shall know where I stand. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> introduced the Bill he dealt with his pre-election promises, and quoted from the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier.</inline> Part of that quotation is as follows :  - </para>

Bonds not covered under the above heads to be redeemed as follows: - The Treasury to take up at least &#163;500,000 per annum, in May, 1921, the whole of Australia&#39;s share Of indemnity payable by Germany to the Allies, which may be estimated at anything between &#163;7,000,000 and &#163;15,000,000, to be earmarked for the redemption of gratuity bonds. If the indemnity actually received on or before May, 1921, does not reach &#163;10,000,000, the Government to make good the deficiency up to &#163;10,000,000. The Government is to redeem the balance of the outstanding - bonds after May, 1921, in not more than three equal annual instalments. The Government undertakes that if, after May, 1921, the financial and general outlook in the local or foreign market warrants raising the outstanding balance, or any part thereof, by loan, it will do so. </para>

                            D. Millen&#39;s interjection raises the doubt whether there was a definite promise that each individual bond-holder would receive one-third of his bond. in cash. I take it that the credit of an Australian Government is still sufficiently good to insure that, when a promise is made by its head to redeem one-third of the bonds in May, 1921, every bond-holder will have the right to consider himself entitled to the redemption of one-third of his holding. If we have a Government which makes promises which only it understands, and makes them merely to deceive, keeping something back, and putting on its words an interpretation which no fair reader can construe out of them, then I am prepared to let Ministers have the whole advantage of that, and I hope it will do them good. I have quoted the Prime Minister&#39;s definite written promise as used at a meeting of his friends before the election that, after &#163;10,000,000 worth of bonds had been taken up by the banks and the Repatriation Department, and by payments in necessitous cases, and payments to soldiers who married, and soldiers&#39; -widows who re-married, the Government were prepared to find an additional &#163;12,000,000 in May, 1921. I do not shift from my interpretation of that statement as a distinct and definite promise to every bond-holder that his one-third would be repaid in May, 1921. I can find no reason for thinking that one bondholder was going to be treated differently from another.

                        <para>- I shall hand the extract to the Minister, so that ho can peruse it. The report I quoted was taken from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the 10th November, 1919. Practically the same statement was made by the Prime Minister in Parliament in March, 1920, when the War Gratuity Bill was under consideration, when he said that if the indemnity actually received before May, 1921, did not reach &#163;10,000,000, the Government would make good the deficiency up to that amount. The Prime Minister&#39;s statement in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> and in Parliament before the last general elections was definite and clear. He said that if the indemnity were not paid before 1921, the Government would pay &#163;10,000,000. &#39; That, of course, was irrespective of the money that would be paid over by the banks, and in necessitous cases. I speak with a good deal of feeling on this matter, because when one rises to make a statement on a matter concerning which there is some doubt and suspicion, honorable senators endeavour by interjection to obscure the issue, in the hope that nothing more will be heard of it. A definite promise was made to the soldiers, and it was confirmed by the Prime Minister when he introduced the War Gratuity Bill in March, 1920. But the Government supporters, who claim to be enthusiastic for, and to have a monopoly of enthusiasm for, the soldiers&#39; interests, now endeavour to discredit my statement. </para>

As the Leader of the Opposition has been mentioned, I may say that if there is any man who earns his money, surely he who occupies that position does so. </para>

When we commence referring to economy I do not think it is fair to suggest that only those employed in the Public Service should be called upon to make sacrifices. If it is to be a question of economy, there should be reductions all round. Those who advocate economy should ask . not only the members of the Public Service, but the large firms, to reduce high salaries by 20 per cent., so that those who are in more fortunate circumstances should share in the reduction, because there is just as much patriotism in the Public Service as there is in the so-called Economy League. Under this measure an amount of &#163;5,866 is provided for this Parliament. What reduction can be made there? If we reduced the members&#39; salaries it would not amount to much, because they are only a small item. </para>

                        <para>-I do not know whether it is not, because it is right to pay well for satisfactory service. The Economy Campaign must start on a logical basis, so that all sections of the community will be affected. We should call upon those who are in more prosperous positions - particularly those outside the Public Service - to find more money in order to pay our war debts off more rapidly. What objection could there be to a special income tax of  50  per cent, on all salaries over  &#163;350  a year until our war debts are discharged ? If such a tax were imposed - there would not be a very large number in the Public Service who would suffer - our war debts would be paid off at a more rapid rate, and the burden on the workers would be considerably reduced. As I have stated, there is an amount of  &#163;5,866  for Parliament. The Prime Minister&#39;s Department, an ever growing, one, requires  &#163;18,000;  the Department of the Treasury,  &#163;92,000;  and the . Attorney-General&#39;s Department,  &#163;8,000.  I do not know whether it would not be economical to increase the vote of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, because if there is one slow Department in the Commonwealth it is that of the Attorney-General. I believe, however, that the Department is ill-equipped, and as it is not- economical to hold up business for any time, an increased vote might be the means of the work being expedited. There is also an amount set down for defence purposes, and in this connexion I wish to thank the Minister for the information he has given concerning his Department. He cannot, of course, disclose all that is taking place in regard to the making of munitions. I inspected with pleasure an intricate piece of workmanship which he submitted to me yesterday, and I must admit that satisfactory efforts are being made in the direction of defending Australia. -I accept his statement of yesterday, that one-third of the vote for defence purposes is being used to supply material for the defence of Australia. I should like to . know whether there is much scope for economy under such conditions. Personally, I would largely discontinue the services connected with that Department, except the equipment section of it, and all the money which I could save in that way I would devote to providing the machines which are requisite for our effective defence.&#34; I gather from the Bill that the cost of the military . arm of our Defence Department for one month will be  &#163;112,000.  Even that does not seem to be a very large sum when we consider that it represents a month&#39;s Supply for a warlike nation like Australia. I am &#39;forced to the conclusion that Australia is a warlike nation, because when I look around I find a general to the right, a general to the left, and a general in front of me. Under the Bill provision is made for an appropriation of  &#163;240,000  in connexion with our Navy Department. Seeing that our military preparations will cost only  &#163;112,000  for that period, there may be a little room for economy in regard to the proposed vote of  &#163;240,000  for the Navy Department. But we must remember that a portion of that expenditure may be necessary&#39; in connexion with the construction or repairs of docks, or ships, or submarines. Obviously, we cannot have an effective naval defence unless we are willing to pay for it. Then it is proposed to expend a sum of  &#163;114,000  upon our air services. I think that that amount is a pretty stiff one for a month&#39;s Supply for a new branch of the Defence Department. The whole of that money, I think, should be used in the purchase of machines. </para>

                        <para>- A military authority upon my left interjects that we have the men, and I agree with him&#39;. Then it is proposed to appropriate  &#163;81,000  for a month&#39;s Supply in connexion with the Department of Trade and Customs. I think that in the interests of economy we could wipe out that Department altogether. We are invited to vote  &#163;112,000  for the military defence of this country, and  &#163;240,000  for its naval defence, whilst at the same time we have in existence a Department of Trade and Customs which is doing its best to prevent exporters from abroad sending to Australia, without any cost to the public, machines which would be of infinite benefit to us if we were at war to-morrow. In  this connexion I specially refer to the duties upon motor lorries, motor tractors, motor cars, and motor cycles. . Let us imagine Australia at war, with an ample supply of motor cycles, motor cars, and motor lorries. Let me assume that the possession of a sufficient number of motor cycles, with side cars attached, would increase the effectiveness and mobility of our forces by three, that an adequate supply of motor cars Would increase its effectiveness and mobility by seven, and that a sufficient number of motor lorries would increase its effectiveness and mobility by eleven. Obviously, the three combined would increase the effectiveness of our forces by twenty-one. When we consider the wide spaces in this country which are not traversed by railways, we must admit that there is no matter of greater importance than that we should possess the vehicles which will be needed to carry both our men and our guns wherever they may be most urgently required. </para>

                        <para>- None whatever. If the Defence section of this Chamber is in earnest, its members cannot shut their eyes to . the fact which I am endeavouring to stress. Just imagine a duty of 40 per cent, upon a motor cycle! If I were Minister for Defence, I would encourage all the young men upon our farms to use motor cycles, by supplying them with these machines upon easy time-payment terms, so that we should always have a force available whose members had been effectively trained for war. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but it would be a Time-payment Department which would return us very good value for our money. If we spend hundreds of thousands of pounds for defence purposes, and at the same time shut out, by means of high duties, machines which could be effectively used in time of war, our attitude is a ridiculous one. Upon many occasions the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has wisely remarked that we must take to heart the lessons of the war. I agree with him. But if there is one lesson more than another which I have learned from the war, it is that it is impossible to exaggerate the importance of motor traffic in time of war. </para>

The Minister has told us that one-third of our military expenditure is being devoted to the manufacture of munitions, and that consequently there is no room for economy in respect of that vote.

                        <para>- I desire to protect the lives of our soldiers should we ever be called, upon to defend ourselves against an invader. Why should it be necessary for us to employ an army of Customs officials to keep out of this country the machines which are most necessary for its defence ? Long-range guns for our defence would be useless in the absence of motor lorries to carry the necessary shells to them. Under this Bill the Government propose to spend the best part of &#163;500,000 upon war preparations during the next month, whilst, at the same time, they contemplate incurring a large expenditure in shutting out those transport vehicles which would be of the greatest possible service should war unfortunately overtake us. If the Defence Department permitted all the farmers who were willing to do so to take over motor lorries and motor tractors, conditionally that they undertook to keep them in order, when war broke out we should have not only a large number of effective machines but a sufficient force of men who had been trained to handle them. I remember hearing a statement by a very high military authority concerning the evils which resulted, through the inability of the drivers to efficiently handle a certain tractor which had only just come into use. If the duties upon the motor vehicles which I have mentioned were remitted for, &#39;say, two years, the men who are engaged in the motor trade would have their warehouses full of them. </para>

We say that we want to defend this country, and yet the most effective weapon for its defence is not admitted free of duty. An official of the Trade and Customs Department will say to the owner of a motor car, &#34; You cannot bring that into the .Commonwealth until you have paid duty upon it to the extent of &#163;40 for every &#163;100 of its value.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- Yes, absolutely. Let the Government start upon their manufacture, and I shall not care what duties they impose. I have a statement in my possession to the effect that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Ford, of motor-car fame, proposed to establish a branch of his business, his opponents were not afraid, because they reckoned that it would take five years before . he could come into competition with them. If the Government propose the expenditure of another &#163;1,000,000 for the manufacture of motor cycles, lorries, and other engines of war, they will find me supporting them, although I am such a staunch economist. The point I make is that the Government are not doing- that, and at the same time they are asking us to spend a lot of money for defence purposes. Why should they not be logical, and say that as we are not mailing these machines, which are necessary for the defence of the country, we shall admit them free of duty, so that, when war finds us, we shall be in a position to use them? That would be a sound proposition for either a Protectionist or a Free Trader. The Government are asking us to spend about &#163;350,000 per month for war purposes, and at the same time they say that the most effective machinery for conducting a war shall not be allowed to come into the Commonwealth free of duty. </para>

                <para>There are several other Departmentswhich can be dealt with more effectively in Committee. I might refer to the Department of Works and Railways; and I am doubtful whether that&#39; is-  not a Department which might be abolished with advantage to the Commonwealth. Most of our Departments are top heavy. Their overhead charges are, far too great. I am not referring now to the salaries of individual officers, because, in my opinion, if there is one section of the community which more than another is insufficiently paid in proportion&#39; to ability and service, it is the Commonwealth Public Service. In the State  which I represent the salaries of the public servants have been reduced by the State Government by about 6 per cent. I mean to say that they have been effectively reduced by that amount by the decision of the State Government to tax those salaries to that, extent. I think there is only one thing left for the Commonwealth Government to do, and that is to make the reduction good to public servants in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- Tasmania is the only State that is in receipt of a grant, and New South Wales pays half the amount from a feeling of friendship towards the people of Tasmania. The interjections of honorable senators are tempting me to get away from. the principles of the Bill, to which my remarks should be confined, and I shall therefore reserve further remarks until we are considering the schedule of the measure in Committee. I should- like again, however, to suggest that the Works and Railways Department is one which should be given strict attention by the Cabinet, to see that we are getting value for the money spent on it. I am not commenting on the officials, their salaries, ability, or services, but on the undue overhead growth of various Public Departments. This will have to be attended to by the present or by - some other Government. When a Department is brought into existence, the staff grows and flourishes exceedingly, though whether the work is accomplished more effectively is quite another question. I again ask the Economy party, now that we are beginning the expenditure for a new year, to give us some indication of what .they mean .by economy. I suggest to them . again that this is the Bill in connexion with ..which they should start their campaign. </para>

                    <para>.- The few remarks I have to make on the second reading of this Bill will be confined as closely as possible to one or two items covered by the measure. I should like, however, to say that I was&#34; astounded to hear- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> advocate the abolition of the Customs system at this time, and on the ground of our war experience. I theught that if there was one thing which we learned during the war, it was the necessity of every country being self-contained and self-reliant. . Surely the experience which not only we, but the great centre of our Empire, had during the war brought home to us with irresistible force the necessity of having the whole of our requirements provided by ourselves. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>One other matter to which the honorable senator referred was the desire for economy. There -is one thing which those gentlemen who are so pronounced in their advocacy of economy overlook, and it is the fact that in Australia we have all the machinery of government necessary for governing a population &#39;of 50,000,000. I do not see how we could have less, or how we could abolish any of our existing Departments. When we suggest to the advocates of economy that some Department in which they are particularly interested should be abolished they at once resent the suggestion, but they are always ready to advocate the abolition of Departments in which other persons are concerned. We have a population of only a little over 5,000,000, and consequently our cost of government is abnormally high, but if we had a population of 50,000,000- the cos.tof government would not be very materially increased. If our people are to be efficiently governed, I find it difficult to suggest anything in our machinery of government that we can do without. </para>

                <para> I wish to make a reference to the question of pensions for the blind. The case to which I intend to refer may be considered an isolated one, but that should  not influence us. What is important is that a legitimate grievance should be remedied. It will be remembered that last year this Parliament carried an amendment of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act exempting blind pensioners from the ordinary disqualification attaching to pensioners generally. We made provision that blind pensioners should be permitted to earn up- to &#163;4 5s. per week without any diminution of the . pension they receive from the Pensions Department. . It was intended that that should apply to all blind pensioners. Unfortunately - and I do not hold the Drafting Department of the Government blameless in this matter - section 22 of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act was not amended as it should have been. That section reads - No person shall receive an invalid pension unless .... his relatives, namely, father, another husband, wife, or children, do not, either separately or collectively, adequately maintain him. </para>
                <para class="block">I am sure it was the intention of Parliament, and, I believe, it was the intention of the Government, when that amendment was passed, that this section should be also so altered as to allow a blind pensioner, although his father might be in a position adequately to maintain him, to receive the full amount of his invalid pension. I addressed the following letter to the Treasurer some time ago dealing with this specific case: - </para>
                <para>Hobart, 19th May, 1921. </para>
                <para>Right Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook, Federal Treasurer. </para>
                <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. -</inline> May I present for your special consideration the case of a blind pensioner. He has been refused the pension on the grounds that his father is able to maintain him (section 22, Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act).  His  father&#39;s income is approximately &#163;518 per annum, and if his son Tom was his only dependant he might reasonably be expected to maintain him, but, unfortunately, he is not.  His  elder brother is a complete invalid, and his second brother has now developed blindness, and his sister, through illness, has had to relinquish a position by which she earned her own living; so you can imagine how far &#163;518 would go with four invalids in the house. I know it was your intention, and the intention of Parliament, when the last amending Bill was passed, to pay the pension to blind persons, irrespective of what assistance they might get from friends; hut, unfortunately, section 22 of the Act was not amended, hence this trouble. Now the only way that I can see that justice may be done to blind persons, and the intention of Parliament given effect to, is by a more liberal interpretation of the Act. This son is over twenty-one years of age, and if the father turned him out the pension would have to be paid. However, I leave the case to you with confidence that you will do the best. </para>

                </para>
                <para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. -</inline> With reference to your letter of 19th May, addressed to the Treasurer (copy attached ) , I have to say that the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act provides that no person shall receive an invalid pension if his relatives, namely, father, mother, husband, or wife, adequately maintain him. Information in the possession of the Department shows that Tasmania, is being adequately maintained by his father. The Act does not provide for differential treatment in the case of children who are over twenty-one years of age, and under the circumstances the law will not permit of the payment of pension. I regret, therefore, that nothing further can be done in the matter. </para>
                <para class="block">I cannot understand why, in the face of the Act of Parliament and the desire of the Government, the law need be so strictly administered to the very letter. There is no doubt in my mind, and I do not think there is any in the mind of the Government, that their intention, and the intention of Parliament, was that a blind pensioner should be placed on a different footing from those invalided through other causes. There was a long debate on the question at the time, and the amendment of the Act was fully justified by the arguments then advanced. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so, but other sections of the Act provide that the ordinary invalid pensioner shall not be allowed to earn more than &#163;65 a year, and if he is in receipt of more, his pension is reduced, whereas the blind pensioner was specially dealt with in consideration of his special affliction. If any body of people were ever grateful for an Act of Parliament, the blind people of Australia are grateful to this Parliament for being given the opportunity of earning what they can. I do not think I ever participated in anything which gave greater satisfaction to others, or brought greater satisfaction to myself, than the passing of that Act. I appeal to the Government to introduce an amending Bill, if that is absolutely necessary. I do not know whether there are any other cases than the one I have named. There may be many, but if there is only one, that instance indicates such a manifest injustice to the individual concerned that Parliament might even rush a short amending Bill through to correct the error which obviously took place when the last Bill was before it. The father, in this case, is a really good &#39;citizen, and, I am sure, will carry out his responsibilities to his family to the last penny; but he has two blind sons, one crippled, and an invalid daughter, so that practically the whole family is invalided, and his position is especially hard. </para>

He, therefore, cannot receive the pension, which is decidedly unfair and unjust in every way. </para>

                <para>Another important question concerns the position of old-age pensioners who are in various institutions. It has been brought up several times in the Senate. When the Old-age Pensions Act was passed, the general practice was that the old-age pensioners in institutions were maintained to the extent of 8s. per week by the Commonwealth, which paid the money to the States or to the institutions themselves, and the pensioners also received 2s. a week each as pocket money. Since then the pension has been increased to 15s. per week, but the pocket money has not been increased to the old folk. I do not  know  whether the Commonwealth Government has increased the money paid to the institutions for the maintenance of pensioners, but the failure to  increase  the pocket&#39; money paid to the old people themselves is contrary, to the proper policy. We ought to do all we can to encourage the old people to <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> into these institutions, where they are often better cared for, nursed, and kept clean, than elsewhere, and their remaining years made much more comfortable. - The policy the Government has adopted rather tends to keep them out of the institutions. If they can stay out, they receive 15s. per week, but if they go in they are paid no more than the 2s. a week which was originally granted. This question has been brought before the </para>
                <para class="block">Treasurer, and when I last raised it here the Minister representing the Department promised to bring it before the Government, but so far I have had no intimation that they have come to any decision.. I should like the Government to consider it, and to see whether they cannot increase&#39; the pocket money to at least 5s. per week. Honorable senators know how rar 2s. will go in the purchase of tobacco or other little articles that old people want. </para>

                <para>Another question which arises concerns the expenditure of nearly &#163;750,000 a year on the maternity allowance. I spoke of this some time ago, and believed, from the Minister&#39;s expressions, that my remarks met with considerable sympathy from the Government. We are not getting reasonable value for the money which is so expended. I am not advocating any reduction, and this is not an economy stunt on my part, for I would expend more money in advancing the object for which the vote was originally passed - that is, to increase the natural-born population of Australia . If the system of public maternity clinics, nursing homes, and so on was extended-, a great deal better work would b&#39;e accomplished. I have had an opportunity to observe the work carried on in Hobart by the Child Welfare Association, .where a number of enthusiastic ladies are associated with doctors, and meetings are held, at which prospective mothers receive advice as to the treatment of their children. Pure milk supplies are arranged for, where the mother may purchase milk at a standard price, or get it free if she is unable to pay. Children&#39;s garments are provided by the association, and, generally, where-ever necessary, advice is given and care expended on the upbringing of the child. In the method we have adopted of paying &#163;5 on the birth of practically every child in Australia, we are rather misguided. </para>

                        <para>- There is a great deal of truth in the suggestion that the mother in most cases acts only as an agent between the Commonwealth Government and the doctor or the nurse, but it is also true that in many instances the money is misapplied. I find, from sworn evidence taken before a Committee of which I was a. member, that for 99 per cent. of the births in Australia the bonus has been claimed. Practically in every case the maternity allowance has been claimed. If the institutions I have named were subsidized by the Government a great deal more effective assistance would be given to those people who require it, and those who do not need it would not suffer. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is quite wrong, as I would be the last to assist in doing that. I have seen the work of these institutions, and can say, without hesitation, there is absolutely no suggestion of pauperism, because women of all classes visit the clinics to receive advice, which they frequently pass on to others. I quite understand what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> has in mind, but I would bc the last to do what he suggests. I feel sure that this system could be carried out without branding any one as a pauper. I strongly urge the Government to take the earliest opportunity of considering the advisableness of dispensing with the present system of paying maternity bonuses, and to spend a similar amount in co-operation with the State Governments. I believe that if an amount of &#163;750,000, which is at present expended, were devoted to the work I have suggested, the State Governmentswould co-operate by subsidizing that work. I feel positive that a considerable number of Australian citizens would also assist by augmenting the funds, and thus render valuable aid to those whom we desire to benefit. </para>

                <para>I desire to refer to our expenditure in searching for oil. There is an item in the schedule dealing with the work at Papua, and I would like the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> to indicate what is being done in that direction. I have a very strong suspicion that there is an unseen and powerful influence existing in Australia with the object of preventing the discovery of oil. lt is most remarkable that every effort to discover oil in Australia has been frustrated, either by ridiculous mismanagement, or some accident at what may be, to some, a most opportune time. In connexion with the shale oil in Tasmania a syndicate was floated, with which a gentleman who is a member of this Senate was closely associated. They obtained the services of a man who had been employed by a big oil company to manage the affairs of the syndicate, and advise it as to the capital required.; but, instead of starting to exploit the discovery in the most economical way, the retorts were placed on the opposite side of the hill from the adit. Honorablesenators will readily realize that with the deposits on one side of a hill and the retorts on the other, the handling costs were considerably increased, with the result that the syndicate became insolvent. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I suggest, and, although I believe such is the case, I cannot prove it. The same peculiar happening occurred in New South Wales. Honorable senators, I suppose, are well aware that, approximately, &#163;1,000,000 was spent at the Wongan Valley, where a railway was placed on the&#39; opposite side of the hill from where the deposit existed. After expending, approximately, &#163;1,000,000 the company found that when they were in a position to commence operations their capital was exhausted, and they had no opportunity of developing the deposit. At Roma, in Queensland, where natural gas is rising from the earth, there are strong indications of oil; but when the bore reaches a certain depth, and one at which they expect to find oil, something breaks, and the bore becomes choked. </para>

                        <para>- It is a common occurrence in boring for oil. So far as I can learn, when the point at which they expect to discover oil is reached, something breaks, and the money expended is lost. In regard to Papua, I wish to be very careful, because I have the highest opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade,</inline> with whom I was closely associated in connexion with his report upon the shale deposits in Tasmania. He appeared to me to be a practical man; but I am now advised that, after all the money we have spent in Papua on his advice, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, in co-operation with the Commonwealth Government, has abandoned the original site and commenced operations 40 miles distant.. The Minister for Repatriation can inform me if I am correct, but I have read a statement to that effect in a reputable paper, and I, therefore, believe it to be true. </para>

                        <para>- It was done evidently on the advice of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, as they are contributing to the cost, and I imagine that they would make a genuine effort to discover oil. It is not likely in these circumstances that they would wish to throw us off the scent. I would like to know if our expenditure in co-operation with this company is anything appreciable. If <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade,</inline> as Australia&#39;s oil expert, agrees to abandon all that has been done, and recommends additional expenditure upon a site 40 miles away, some explanation is necessary. Perhaps when the Minister replies he will be able to give some information on the point. </para>

                        <para>- In moving the second reading of this Bill, the Minister for Repatriation referred to the fact that the Government were paying the Imperial Government a sum of &#163;200,000 for letters carried on a poundage basis by the Peninsular and Oriental Company during the war, which, of course, was the proper thing to do. We pay &#163;170,000 a year to the. Orient Company, and when letters are taken by the Peninsular and Oriental Company they are paid for at poundage rates. We have heard at times that the- Postmaster-General&#39;s Department has shown a substantial surplus, but if during that time money .which ought to have &#39;gone to the Orient Company has not been paid, the surpluses must be reduced. I understand that the Peninsular and Oriental Company claimed &#163;321,000. They made a claim for &#163;300,000, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oxenham;</inline> who was in England at the time attending the Postal Conference, succeeded in securing its reduction to &#163;200,000. In view of the fact that packages&#39; come under a special rate, it seems odd that we should have been asked for &#163;100,000 more than we were really liable for. </para>

Under the Postal Union rates, the &#163;391 000 referred to was - a fair and legitimate charge. But the Imperial authorities have treated Australia liberally, as they usually do. </para>

                <para>Upon several previous occasions I have entered my strong protest against the continuance in office of an Acting Public Service Commissioner instead of a permanent Commissioner. Having looked into the matter, however, I find that the position is even worse than I thought it was. For nearly five years we have had an Acting Public Service Commissioner who could have been dismissed by the Government at practically a moment&#39;s notice. The Statute under which he was appointed contains only two sections, one of which reads - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Notwithstanding anything contained in the Commonwealth Public ServiceAct 1902-15, the Governor-General may appoint William Burton Edwards, Esquire, Public Service Inspector, to be the Acting Public Service Commissioner as from the 4th day of May; 1916, to hold office as such Acting Public Service Commissioner until the appointment of a person to be Public Service Commissioner, or until the Governor-General otherwise directs. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Under that Statute, during the past four or five years the Acting Public Service Commissioner might have been dismissed at a moment&#39;s notice, without any reason being assigned for his dismissal. The&#39; inspectors who are associated with him occupy exactly a similar position. This is a very serious matter. The Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> when moving the second reading of the Public Service (Board of Management) Bill, affirmed that the existing system had broken down. I differ from him. But that it has not broken down is certainly not the fault of the Government. Under our Public Service Act, even a messenger boy cannot be dismissed without reference to an Appeal Board. Similarly, a lettercarrier&#39;* services cannot be dispensed with without quite a number of formali-ties  having first to be complied with. When the Commonwealth Public Service Act was passed in 1902, the Public Service Commissioner was appointed for a term of seven years. His inspectors were appointed upon a similar tenure, and only the two Houses of this Parliament were empowered to remove them from office. The idea underlying that procedure was that these officers ought to be made strong and powerful. That was a very proper course to adopt. But for  some  years past these officers might have been called upon to resign at any moment. The term of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Skewes,</inline> who is a Public Service Inspector, has expired-, and for some time he has held his position only in an acting capacity. This gentleman is frequently called upon to appear before the Arbitration Court to present the case of the Government to that tribunal. The ex-Public Service Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> has properly pointed out that it is no  easy matter for the Government to get evidence for their side of any case before the Arbitration Court. He says - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>In the actual proceedings of the Court in connexion with the hearing of evidence, the interests of justice have been seriously prejudiced by the fact that while the claimant organizations were able to make a free selection of witnesses from the whole field of employees, on the side of respondents (the Commissioner and Department concerned), it has been a matter of the utmost difficulty to obtain witnesses from within the Departments, owing to the strong aversion of branch heads against appearing in the Court and subjecting themselves to be cross-examined and pilloried by their subordinate officers. One notable case which was brought before the Court occurred where a manager of a Telegraph Branch, who had submitted evidence on behalf of the Department, was the subject of an &#39; insulting resolution carried by the Association, and was made the recipient of an iron cross with an opprobrious epithet engraved thereon. </para>

I was much struck recently by reading something which appeared in a newspaper in connexion with &#39;.the inquiry by the Royal (commission appointed to investigate conditions at &#39;the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. -The statement was made in the newspaper, that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Hayes,</inline>
                    who was secretary to the Commission, made a definite complaint to the Commissioners- that he had been threatened by the secretary of ope of the Labour unions that when the Labour party came into office he would lose his billet because he had given evidence on behalf of the Government against some of the workers.

                            as against that person. That is a case in which an attempt was made to intimidate a public servant who gave evidence before a court of inquiry. If

It is high time that officers, -upon whom so much depends, should tie given permanent positions. In spite of the fact that officers acting temporarily as . inspectors . may be dismissed,  we  can  speak highly of their strength of character. their &#39; integrity,- and the work they have done. Their  &#39;Services  have justified the judgment of

                            who  was  responsible for their appointment to the position which they now hold temporarily.  I  say that the time has come when we might reasonably ask that such men should be permanently appointed.  I  do not say that

                            who is Acting Public Service Commissioner, should be made Public Service Commissioner, or that

                            should be appointed permanently as an inspector, but  I  do say &#34;that their positions should no longer be held by officers temporarily appointed to them.

                    <para>.- I  do not know that  I  would have taken any part in the debate on the second reading of this Bill -were it not for the fact that, in his speech this afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> seemed to resent the attitude  I  took up yesterday regarding his statement concerning the redemption of war gratuity bonds.  I-  want to say in reply to his utterances to-day that  I  think his experience of the feeling amongst those who are holding the bonds is singular.  I  have moved about amongst returned soldiers, probably as much as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has done, but  I  never heard any suggestion by a returned soldier that he interpreted the statement made by the Prime Minister&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> some time ago to mean that  one-third of each war gratuity bond would be redeemed in 1921.  I  have very carefully read the statement made by the Prime Minister, and  I  cannot read into it the interpretation put upon it. by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> The Prime Minister -promised that in May, 1.921, provision would be made for the redemption of a certain proportion of the value of bonds then existent. .No one can read into that the suggestion that he meant to convey to- the returned soldiers that one-third of each individual bond would be redeemed.  I  do not know what has actuated <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> in making his statement, but  I  feel that it may give rise to a good deal of disappointment amongst men holding gratuity bonds, who may be induced to believe that they have been misled by the Government. </para>

I  trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will refrain from attacking the&#39; Government with regard to the measure of relief they are prepared to afford to the men who served their country so well during the war.  I  always resent any suggestion that the Government have not done all that they could do in that direction.  I  hold no brief for the Government, but if  I  think they are unjustly attacked,  I  feel it is my duty, as a member of the Senate, to give expression to my views with regard to what they have done. </para>

                        <para>- I  am not referring to the possibility of gratuity bonds being put on the market, but to the charge made against the Government of not having redeemed the promise made by the Prime Minister to those who received the bonds.  I  am quite satisfied that the promise has been kept to the letter. No doubt the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D.</inline> Millen), in replying to this debate, will be able to tell us the value of the bonds that have been redeemed, and whether the promise of the Government in this connexion has been fulfilled. </para>

                <para>Looking through&#39; the schedule of the Bill,  I  notice one or two&#39; matters to which  I  should like to refer. There is one subject which has already been mentioned, and that is the continuance of the present conditions under which the maternity allowance is paid.  I  indorse every word uttered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> on that subject this afternoon. Last year  I  made my first appearance in this chamber, and  I  took the earliest opportunity to protest against the conditions under which this allowance is paid.  I  hope that the Government will evolve some scheme which will insure that in every case where assistance  is necessary it will be forthcoming, but that the allowance will not be paid where it is not needed. I took the opportunity during the recess to read a portion of the debate which took place when the proposal to pay a maternity allowance first came before Parliament. I find that the view expressed by the majority of those who voted for the allowance was that some provision should be made to meet the necessities of the case, but it was never suggested by any member of the Parliament who took part in the debate that the &#163;5 maternity allowance would be accepted by every parent of a child born in Australia in the future. It was suggested that only those who really needed the allowance would apply for it. We find that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has said is perfectly correct, and in almost every case of a birth in Australia the parents claim the maternity allowance. . We have to call upon people in receipt of very small incomes to pay their share of taxation, and we should make provision that people with very small means should not he called upon to pay any portion of a maternity allowance to wealthy people whenever a little stranger arrives in their home. I said last session, and repeat to-day, that I would approve of any scheme which will provide that, if the present allowance of &#163;5 is inadequate in certain circumstances, it shall be increased in order to meet the necessities of parents, and this could be done if at the same time we decided that the allowance should not be paid to persons who are in no need of it. </para>

It is appalling to find on reading our statistics that, with the additional medical and scientific facilities which are at our disposal to-day, the rate of infantile mortality is rather increasing than decreasing in Australia. It was contended when the maternity allowance was first proposed that it would lead to a reduction in the rate of infantile mortality. </para>

                <para>As to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle&#39;s</inline> statement about the allowance made to old-age pensioners in charitable institutions controlled by the State authorities, I should like to make a suggestion to the Minister whereby the case could be met. To-day, and for some time past, the sovereign has not been able to purchase anything like the amount of goods it did in normal times. Although consideration has been given to that fact by the Commonwealth in almost every other instance, it has not been given in the case of the old people who receive 2s. per week while in State-aided institutions. The old-age pension has been increased to 15s. per week to meet the increased cost of living, and I take it that the amount paid to the State Governments by the Commonwealth for the maintenance of the old people in the institutions has also been increased proportionately. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so. I suggest that, as the amount of pension has been increased by the Federal Parliament, the amount paid to the pensioner for pocket money should be increased proportionately. If that means a slight decrease in the amount paid to the State authorities for maintaining these old people, it is reasonable that the States should bear it. The sum of 3s. per week will obtain for the old people barely what they obtained for 2s. a week in normal times, and it is surely reasonable, therefore, to suggest that they should be paid 3s. per week, the balance of 12s. per week to be retained by the State authorities for their maintenance. In all probability that arrangement would meet the case. The men only use the pocket money to buy extra tobacco, and the women use it to purchase a few little things that add to their comfort. They have had to go short, because 2s. will not purchase as much as it did prior to the outbreak of the war. </para>

                <para>Reference has been made to the necessity for economy, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> dwelt at some length on it in connexion with the administration of the affairs of the Commonwealth. He spoke of the Taxpayers&#39; League and other organizations which have been formed to insist on economy being observed and exercised by the Commonwealth Government. I am an economist, because I do not believe in money being spent by the Commonwealth Government without their getting value for it. I believe we are all at one in that regard ; but, in fairness, not only to the Commonwealth Government but also to the State Governments, I must observe that the people outside, who have to find the money, very often fail to recognise that &#163;1 in the hands of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth or the Treasurer of a State can purchase no more than can &#163;1 held by an ordinary citizen. If the decreased purchasing power of the sovereign applies to the ordinary citizen, it applies just as forcibly to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth or of a State. If in normal times the Treasurer could obtain a certain amount of material, or goods, or services for &#163;1,000,000, he can to-day obtain only about &#163;600,000 worth of goods, or material, or services for that sum. Therefore, although we have apparently a much larger revenue, it does not follow that we are more extravagant than we were, because our expenditure is keeping pace with the revenue, and is much larger than it was. We may be more extravagant, but we can only arrive at a true solution of the question by careful analysis. </para>

                        <para>- I believe we are; but I want to be absolutely fair. The time has arrived when we must economize as far as we possibly can, while preserving efficiency; but it is not economy to have inefficient service in any Department. It is true economy to insist on obtaining full value for the money we spend. If we can keep our expenditure within reasonable bounds, and assure the people that we are getting value for it, there is no room for complaint. Every one is forced to admit to-day that the prices of commodities are on the down grade. We shall find that many of the materials and goods required in our Commonwealth operations can now be purchased at much lower rates than a few &#39; months ago. The time is ripe, therefore, for the Government to consider the question carefully, and to show those who have to find the money that it fully realizes the seriousness of the financial position of Australia. With prices showing a falling tendency, there will be a corresponding decrease in the expenditure required to obtain the same results that were obtained with a larger expenditure last year. The public are keen enough to look at these matters from most points of view; but I do not think they have been as keen as they might have been in recognising the fact that the sovereign is no more valuable in the hands of the Treasurer than in those of the ordinary citizen. </para>

                        spoke of the war gratuity bonds, and the promises made by the Prime Minister when the gratuity was first mooted to him by the Returned Soldiers&#39; League. I wish to state the promises which, in my opinion, were made to the men, and the belief which the majority of them held regarding the ultimate cashing of the bonds. I was present, not as the representative of one of the States, but as a sort of adviser to the representative from Tasmania, when we first interviewed the Prime Minister regarding the bonds. After considerable discussion, it was felt at the time that it would be impossible for the Commonwealth to raise money to provide a gratuity payable in cash to the returned men. The Prime Minister put it to us very frankly that the only possible market then open to borrow the money required to pay the bonds was the American, market, and that, in view of the rate of exchange - at that time the &#163;1 sterling &#39; was worth only ia little over three dollars - and the high rate of interest obtainable in America, it would be unwise to consider a cash payment. He then dealt rather fully with the fact that great sums of money would have to be raised for repatriation purposes, and finally it was put to him by one of our delegates that the soldiers would
                        <inline font-style="italic">be .</inline>
                        prepared to accept a gratuity payable in nonnegotiable bonds. The Prime Minister asked the representative of each State individually whether he would accept that suggestion on behalf of the soldiers of his State, and the men accepted it unanimously. The position, as I understood it - although I .admit that on this point I am at variance with one or two of my colleagues who were present - was as follows: - The Commonwealth guaranteed, in regard to necessitous cases, &#163;500,000 a year from revenue. I think that wa3 all that was guaranteed at that time. That sum was to be . used for cashing bonds in necessitous cases, and where soldiers were married, after their return. In addition, any man applying for a &#34;War Service Home, or for assistance in land settlement, or in any other .phase of the activities of the Repatriation Department, could cash his bond in repayment of his indebtedness in that direction. I was also clearly of the opinion that the total amount of the indemnity which the Prime Minister then hoped would be payable by Germany in May, 1921,. was to be used in reducing the amount owing at that date on the war gratuity bonds, apart from the amount which had been paid in necessitous cases or through the Repatriation and &#34;War Service Homes Departments. It was further suggested that the banks might cash a certain amount. The Minister for Repatriation may not be aware qf the fact, but I know that, in the initial stages of the negotiations which the league conducted with the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister set his face very definitely against the banks cashing any of the bonds, because he said, &#34;We are in the position of being able to say, - or of having to say, to the, banks, with regard to the loans which we are floating for repatriation purposes, that they must take up whatever amount is undersubscribed.&#34; I think he also said, regarding a loan which the Government had recently floated, that&#34; the Government had called on the banks to take up &#163;4,000,000 or &#163;5.000,000 compulsorily. I understood that, if the German indemnity was not paid when it became due, the Government was pledged to make good, to that extent at least, not less than one-third of the bonds then, remaining, by redeeming them in -cash. Some of my colleagues differ from my understanding of what the Prime Minister promised at the time, but in support of. my view I would point out that a various number of millions was spoken -of in computing the amount of money which would be. claimed from the War Gratuity Branch of the Treasury on account of soldiers who used their bonds to make payments to the Repatriation Department, and the strong point which the Prime Minister made, in my recollection, was that the loan which, would be floated for repatriation purposes would be relieved to the extent of the value of the. bonds which were paid over to the Repatriation Department. That is, if &#163;10,000,000 were paid into the Repatriation Department in the shape of gratuity bonds, the repatriation loan of &#163;20,000,000 or &#163;25,000,000 would be relieved of the payment of that amount of cash.

                        <para>- If a soldier was granted land on rental, as was the case in Tasmania, and the rent fell due, he could pay for it with a gratuity bond. I admit that if the State Government was the landlord, and wanted the rent, it would look to the Commonwealth Government to cash the bond, but I understood at the time that the Prime Minister hoped that that would not be necessary. I believe that an arrangement was afterwards made by which a certain number of business people - I know some of them in Melbourne - were granted permission to cash war gratuity bonds, thus relieving the Treasury of the obligation to cash them in a certain number of necessitous cases, &#34;But on the distinct understanding that those business people would not be able to demand cash for the bonds at the Treasury immediately. To that extent the Treasury would be relieved, but not entirely. I believe the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> was about to interject that the Government had to find the money in any case. I was. under the impression that the amount expended for repatriation purposes, and that which was paid out from the Treasury, after exceeding the &#163;500,000 per year, would be apart from the one-third which would afterwards be required. In justice to the Government I think it is fair to say that I know that the promised expenditure of &#163;500,000 has been largely exceeded, and that very much better arrangements have been made by the Government than were contemplated in connexion with the permission given to business people to cash bonds in certain circumstances. As far as possible, I believe the Treasurer has done all he could to meet&#39; the position. Further, the Returned Sailors&#39; and Soldiers&#39; Imperial League of Australia, which has a mem.bership of over 150,000, has agreed that the present is not an opportune time to endeavour to raise a special loan for the cashing of bonds, particularly wh&#39;en a number of the holders are not needing the cash, and in that way the soldiers have again shown that they have the interest of Australia at heart. I know of one man who has framed his bond, and has it hanging on the wall, which indicates that he never intends to cash it ; but that, of course, is an extreme case. . There are, however, thousands of men to-day who are in need of money; but, on the other hand, there are some whose immediate requirements are not pressing. From the information I have gathered from members of&#34; the War Gratuity Board, there are few ex-soldiers in Australia who ave really necessitous and who have been unable to get their bonds cashed. </para>

                <para>Following on the. question I submitted to the Minister for Repatriation as to whether, in the event of the death of a soldier his widowed mother, if she had children depending upon her, would receive a pension, I received the reply that if it could be shown that the soldier was the Support of the family, or that the mother had had children who were dependent upon her twelve months prior to the enlistment of. the soldier, a pension would be paid. My contention has always been that we have to consider what a soldier would have been doing if he had lived. A case might arise where a boy of nineteen had enlisted, and after going to the Front his father died. It is said by certain supporters of the attitude adopted by the </para>

A boy may have enlisted at nineteen, and have been killed when he was twenty, but if he had lived until he was twenty-three or twenty-four, he would have been the main support of his mother, and brothers, and sisters. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to have that explanation. Notwithstanding the reply it was definitely and distinctly stated that in cases where it could be shown that a mother was dependent upon a boy twelve months prior to the enlistment, a pension would be paid. I think the Minister will give me credit for not attempting to push a claim where I have felt that the ex-soldiers or their dependants were endeavouring to impose upon the Department. I know of a case where a man had received training at a vocational school, and was afterwards earning &#163;4 18s. per week. Later, when he was out of work he submitted a claim for an allowance; but when inquiries were1&#39; made it was found that the total income of the four people with whom he was living, in addition to the &#163;2 2s. he received, was &#163;6 19s. per week. When I was asked to assist in obtaining an extra living allowance I said that I would not do anything of the kind. I was informed, I believe by the Board, that amending legislation was required to give it power -to pay pensions to the widowed mother or brothers and sisters of a deceased soldier, unless it could be proved that the soldier had been supporting his mother. &#39; </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I believe it will be necessary for the Government to shoulder the responsibility, and I am hoping that when the Minister replies he will make a statement to that effect. When people such as those I have mentioned have agreed to purchase homes at &#163;700, it is often an absolute impossibility for them to find an additional &#163;136, particularly when many of them are receiving reduced pensions. The living allowance has been dispensed with, and the amount received in thousands of cases is 20 or 30 per cent. less than it was when the price was fixed at &#163;700. They cannot possibly find the interest by way of rent for the larger amount. I think it is time those who are engaged in constructing these homes began to give the soldiers for whom the houses are being built a fair deal.I know of one instance where a Deputy Commissioner visited a building where a workman was tossing bricks about in a careless manner, and when he was asked how many bricks he was laying he replied, &#34; Do you know this is a War Service Homes job?&#34; The officer replied,  &#39; Yes, it is ; you put on your coat and go to the office for your wages.&#34; I think some of those who- speak of our returned soldiers and of the sacrifices they have made, should endeavour to give them a fairer deal by rendering service in keeping with the money they receive, which would be the means of houses being built at a more reasonable cost. </para>

It is impossible for me, at this juncture, to deal with many of the matters brought forward during the second- reading debate, because, I submit, on the second reading we should deal only with the principles of the Bill. To-day, topics ranging from the payment of a maternity allowance to the discovery of oil in Papua have been introduced. </para>

The Prime Minister&#39;s first public utterance on this question, which was indorsed by him when introducing the War Gratuity Bill in the House of Representatives, was to this effect: After having dealt with the undertaking to make money available for the cashing of bonds in necessitous and other circumstances, he said the Government undertook to cash bonds to the value of &#163;500,000 a year, an amount which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foster</inline> says has been exceeded.

The Prime Minister said that the balance of the bonds outstanding after May, 1921, would be redeemed in not more than three equal annual instalments. Let us take the value of the bonds issued at ?30,000,000- as a matter of fact the value does not reach that figure, but that is a convenient basis on which to work. </para>

It cannot be contended for a moment that that ?6,000,000 was to be in addition to the ?10,000,000. It was a part of it, and proportionately as the Prime Minister was able to cash these bonds, he was reducing the amount to be paid by the Commonwealth in redemption of his pledge. </para>

                        <para>- No. But because the honorable senator chooses to accept the figures of some person outside, he has no right to accuse the Government of having failed to live up to their pledge. What is wrong with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> statement to Parliament ? To me, the position is abundantly clear, and the explanation which I have given is that which has been accepted by all who have devoted consideration to the matter. The original estimate of the value of the bonds to be issued was. &#163;30,000,000. The Government undertook to redeem &#163;500,000 worth of bonds every year in order to meet necessitous cases. That would be equivalent to an expenditure of &#163;750,000 during the eighteen months &#39; which have since elapsed; but to make myself perfectly safe I am willing to say that it represents &#163;1,000,000. But what is the position? The Government have already redeemed &#163;2,,250,000 worth of bonds in that way. That hardly discloses a breach of faith ou the part of the Ministry. Then the Government arranged with the banks to immediately cash &#163;6,000,000 worth of bonds. But for that circumstance, the banks would not have cashed them. The Government also secured the active cooperation of many private individuals who took up these bonds, with the result that already &#163;13,500,000 worth of them have been cashed out of . a total, not of &#163;30,000,000, which was originally, supposed to be the amount of the issue, but of &#163;25,800,000. More than 50 per cent, of these bonds, therefore, have been cashed, and we are continuing to cash them wherever the circumstances of the soldier warrant that course being taken. </para>

Nevertheless, I am quite convinced that the consensus of opinion is that the Government have not merely made an honest, but a successful, effort, to redeem their pledges to the soldiers. For the rest, I am willing to leave the matter to the common sense of the people and to the verdict of the soldiers themselves. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and&#39; his party have made many efforts to damage the Government in the eyes of the soldiers, but the soldiers have not forgotten -the attitude of the two political parties towards them.

                        <para>- It is not necessary to do so, because a Statute is the result of a vote of this Senate. For the honorable senator to say that any vote of this Chamber has resulted in a swindle is to speak disrespectfully of it. The question does not require argument, because there are scores of precedents to be found in the practice of the House of Commons, which quite bear that out. Unless he is moving for its repeal, an honorable senator is not entitled to speak disrespectfully of an Act of this Parliament. Therefore I must ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to obey our Standing Orders, and to withdraw the objectionable statement which he has made. </para>

Whereas the votes recorded for Senators. Cox, Duncan, and myself were counted up to the last &#39;preference, even the second preference votes recorded for Messrs. Grant and McDougall were not counted. I make the statement that the Act under which that was done was -a swindling Act, and that is merely good English to apply to it. </para>

I have ruled that an honorable senator taking advantage of the opportunity to make an explanation or apology has no right, in doing so, to continually repeat his offence. If the honorable senator desires to make any explanation or apology without repeating his offence, I give him the opportunity to do so. I regret that his feelings should have been excited, but I appeal to him, for the sake of the camaraderie and good feeling which should exist amongst members of the Senate, to adopt the proper and manly course usually adopted of apologizing for the statement he has made. The honorable senator asked me which of the standing orders prevents an honorable senator from reflecting upon any Statute passed by Parliament. He will find that it is standing order 418, which provides that - - </para>

                        <para>- I should not be inclined to take that view with regard to the operations in New South Wales. I think that the reason for the failure there was the reason which has been accountable for failure in the case of hundreds of mines in Australia. Gold mine after gold mine, because of mismanagement, has resulted in failure. Yet no one will suggest that the failure was due to the exercise of some sinister influence against the production of gold. Mistakes are always made, and will continue to be made. </para>

I have managed to secure a little further information in connexion with it.I understand that the Imperial Government were entitled to charge &#163;321,000 under the terms and conditions of the Postal Union Convention. The Commonwealth Government pointed out that to some extent the Imperial Government were themselves responsible for the disruption of the mail service by commandeering the Orient Company&#39;s boats. In addition, there was some extra cost thrown upon the Australian Government in carrying out matters, if hot at the request of the Imperial Government, then in such a way as to assist and expedite undertakings in which the Imperial Government were concerned. They &#39;were entitled, as I said, to ask for &#163;321,000, but, taking a broad view of the matter in their usual and characteristic spirit, they agreed to com1 promise upon a payment of &#163;200,000. If any matters of detail are referred to in Committee, I think I can promise to furnish honorable senators with the information they desire. , ^

We might send a request to another place to increase the amount proposed for the equipment of the Senate. I am perfectly satisfied from the -experience of the last few months, since the  President  has been wearing a wig at the request of a large number cf honor-able senators, that there are other things necessary to maintain &#34; the dignity of this Chamber. Why not a mace? In another place they have the mace as well as the wig, and the Senate would seem to be somewhat behind in this- matter., I think that, in order to keep up the dignity of the Senate, an officer carrying a mace should be required to bear it twice round the chamber before placing it at the head of the table, which is really the proper place for it, and not .at the foot, as is done in another Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- If the black rod will do the business as well, I do hot see why the officer. in charge of it should not carry it round the chamber in opening the sittings of the Senate. Since we last discussed the wig, I have been looking up history for information about it. I spoke of it as originating away back, in the very early days, but quite a number of people have since assured me that- 1 was absolutely wrong, and that the wig came into use in the middle of the seventeenth century. One gentleman quoted to me what that great diarist  Pepys  said when wigs were coming into general use in England. He stated that the wig came to England from the French Court. The then King of France, Louis the &#34;umpteenth&#34; - I am not sure which one it was - was a very vain man, and very proud of his hair. When it began to &#39;fall out -he adopted the wig to cover up what he considered a deformity. The aristocrats of England after chat time all wore wigs. I am speaking of a period &#39; just following the real Revolution, when, for the first time, England had a republican form of government, which, I venture to say, proved itself the most effective form of government it ever had.  Pepys  spoke of wigs coming into general use in that country in .the middle of the seventeenth century, and added that he had just had his wig baked. I understand that the aristocrats in these days all wore their hair long, and were fairly &#34;lousy.&#34; When wigs came into general use, it was an easy way to get rid of the vermin to have them baked, and there were public places where that was done. Another place might accept a suggestion from me to provide an amount on the Estimates for the establishment of an oven in connexion with this Parliament. The presiding officer of -another place has worn the wig for some time, and now that it has been adopted in the Senate, I do not think we should have it by itself. If another place has the mace, we should at least have the black rod, and introduce more form and ceremony into the opening of the Senate to give the proceedings the proper amount of dignity. There might be a parade twice round the chamber before the  President  took the chair in his wig, so that we might see him&#34; to full advantage in his flowing robes, and admire him in the costume he has now adopted. I shall not quote again the statements he made in the earlier days to show how strongly he was opposed to- the wearing of the wig when he had not the job himself, or dilate on how strongly he hunkered after the flesh pots  of Egypt when he had not got them. The thing that was to him an abomination in the costume of the gentleman who presided over the Senate at that time took on quite a different aspect after he was elected to the position. He then found it necessary to adorn himself as his earlier predecessors had done. &#39; </para>

Now that we have begun to dignify the proceedings of Parliament by the wearing of a wig, we ought seriously to lay ourselves out to see whether we cannot go further.

Further, is the Minister aware that considerable dissatisfaction is expressed regarding Australia&#39;s representation in Paris through the branch of the High Commissioner&#39;s office established there?

                <para>The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> was in France not long ago. I wonder if he took the opportunity to see this office in Paris. If he did, he probably saw how inadequately it was provided. If it is necessary for us to establish trade relations with continental people, Paris is the centre from the continental point of view where most of the exchange is done, and any representation we have there ought to be appropriate, or we should have none at all. My information has come, not from one, but from several correspondents, and from Australians who have gone to France since the war to visit the battlefields. Ordinarily, they would not have gone to France on business; but, having gone there, they have called at the office of the High Commissioner in Paris, only to be astounded at the most inadequate representation of Australia that obtains there, and the very few opportunities there are even for Australians to get from that office information regarding Australian activities on the, other side of the world. If that office is in-aptly and inappropriately equipped, it is time the Government woke up to the fact, and either disestablish it, or make it more in keeping with the dignity and position of the Commonwealth. In the years to come a much larger number of Australians will go to France than ever went before, because of the hallowed associations that some of the fields of France have for the relatives of those who fell there in the great war. When those people are passing through Paris, if they know the Commonwealth has an office there, they will call at it .for information or advice. I earnestly hope that the Government, mindful of these facts, will see that whatever branch  of the High Commissioner&#39;s Office is established in the French capital is suitable and serviceable. </para>

                <para class="block">Wales - Minister for Repatriation) &#91;6.27&#93;. - The divisions now under discussion do not cover the amount for which the Commonwealth Government is responsible in connexion with the office to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has referred, but his remarks are just as pertinent here as they would be elsewhere. I had an opportunity to visit the office, and must admit, with a considerable amount of regret, that I largely indorse what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has said. The representation of Australia in Paris is not nearly on a sufficiently pronounced scale. The gentleman who is there, probably, does as well, and perhaps even better, thau he might be expected to do with the facilities provided for him. If it is worth our having representation in Paris at all - as I think it is - it is worth having it done properly. I do not blame the High Commissioner. The gentleman in Paris, who is an Australian by birth, is allowed quite a modest amount per year for his office and other expenses. I think it is about &#163;500 a year. If Australia wants effective representation on the Continent, she can give up all idea of getting it for &#163;500 a year. I would almost go so far as to say that, unless we are prepared to make that office effective, we might as well close it. At present all it does, and all it can do effectively, is, in the case of Australian and other travellers to furnish the little information that they require; but to say that it is a trade centre in the interests of Australia is to misuse terms. I cannot indicate to the Senate any definite action which the Government have in view, but the reorganization of the office is under consideration. I hope at no distant date to be able to tell the Senate what the Government have decided. I am sure that the majority of the people of Australia would say that this is a thing that ought to be done, and I hope the Government will do it, and I am certain that as soon as they do there will be a howl against increasing the cost of government. In Australia, as in any other country, we cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs, and if Australia is worth advertising and pushing, as she is, we must incur the necessary expense, and take the ordinary business risks in order to do it. </para>

                    <para>. - With respect to the items having to do with the Northern Territory, of which there are six, aggregating &#163;8,920, I wish to ask whether, in view of information concerning recent occurrences in the Territory, the Government can furnish the public with any idea of their intentions ? When may a statement of policy be expected ? It would appear that in the course of their administration the Commonwealth officials at Darwin have experienced considerable difficulty in collecting taxes. A number of residents have refused to make payment, and have been imprisoned. By certain of their fellow citizens these people are regarded as martyrs. According to press reports today, a large meeting was held at Darwin last night, and among those present was a gentleman who took part in prosecuting an offender. Presumably he had been engaged by the Commonwealth to conduct the case against a person who had refused to pay his taxes ; but the circumstance of his presence at the meeting would seem, to indicate that, in his opinion, there was justification for the gathering. </para>

                <para>Several-resolutions were agreed to concerning the future attitude of residents and having to do with the representation  of the Territory in the Federal Legislature. </para>
                <para>Earlier this session the Government introduced a Bill into the Senate which contained a proposal to grant a certain degree of representation in this Chamber. It failed to pass, however. Since then there has been some indication that the claims of the residents of the Northern Territory to modified representation elsewhere would be considered. </para>
                <para>The Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> has recently visited the Territory, and perhaps upon his return some definite announcement may be made. That extreme northern part of Australia has been the cause of considerable embarrassment to the Commonwealth Administration, and, whatever may be said concerning the merits or demerits of the situation, the obvious fact remains that the administration has not been very satisfactory. In so commenting, I do not refer merely to the present Government or to any particular Government or Minister. Apart&#39; altogether from the feelings of the residents, there is strong apprehension on the part of the community generally regarding the future of the Territory, where much Commonwealth money has been, and is being spent. I do not expect that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> will be able, or is prepared, to make a comprehensive reply at this moment ; but it is due to the public and particularly to citizens of the Northern Territory, that as soon as possible the Commonwealth authorities should indicate their intention to make an exhaustive pronouncement of policy. Meanwhile, trouble at Darwin is becoming intensified, and is likely to grow worse until the Government shall have broken their long silence. I do not expect any statement, however brief or lacking in definiteness, before the return of the Minister for Some and Territories, but it should tend to restore norma&#93; conditions if the Government took the earliest practicable occasion to indicate their future line of action. </para>

                    <para>. -The Government are aware of the generally unsatisfactory conditions prevailing in the Territory, but as has been shown by the departmental administration, while Ministers have no desire to be harsh to citizens disposed to take the law into their own hands, we are determined to maintain the law, whether that law be good or bad, and whether the grievances of the residents be well or ill founded. In a country such as the Commonwealth, with constitutional means of redress always available, and with a Parliament ever alert to probe complaints regarding public grievances or disabilities, the Government cannot find justification for any individual citizen defying the law-. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has suggested the importance of making a definite statement. The Government are not indifferent to what is transpiring in the Territory. The Minister directly responsible has recently visited that region, and will shortly return. We propose to await his return in order to obtain a first-hand account of his impressions and a direct statement relative to the condition of affairs. As soon as possible after the return of&#39; the Minister for Home and Territories the Government will address themselves to the problem of the Territory, with a view to arriving at some final and definite policy, and will then announce that policy in the interests alike of Australia as a whole and of residents of the Territory in particular. </para>

                    <para>. -  The Minister appears to think that those citizens of Darwin who have refused to pay their taxes are lawbreakers, and, as such, must be punished. That may be a sound view, but it should not be forgotten that these people are called upon to obey laws which they have had no hand or voice in making, and to pay taxes at the behest of a Legislature in which they have no representation.  I  trust that when the Government may be considering their policy, upon the return of the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> they will not deal with the Territory as though it were a portion of Australia which has its direct representatives in the Federal Parliament. Rather, they should apply themselves to the situation as the British Parliament would deal with a Crown colony. </para>

                        <para>- Britain was spending much money in America. An army was being maintained there, for instance. But, generally, if a difference of opinion arises, it is not a bad practice to try to learn the other man&#39;s point of view. One cannot get much out of a man who thinks he has been wrongly treated. If some of the residents of Darwin have adopted drastic means of making known their plight, it is because they are convinced that such course is not only right, but the best. The people of the Territory consider that the only effective method of bringing their grievances prominently before their fellow citizens of Australia is to resist payment of taxes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> says, &#34; You countenance law-breakers.&#34; </para>

                            put the words into my mouth. However, it is not a question of countenancing breaches of the law, for, after all, there is something above the law. If a law is unjust, men are morally right in resisting it. The residents of the Terri tory consider that the law is unjust, her cause taxation has been imposed upon them by a Parliament in which they have no representation. They demand representation before they will pay their taxes. If Parliament adopts the attitude of

                            and calls them lawbreakers, there is little likelihood of them receiving justtreatment.

What if these men are making martyrs of themselves? What if they feel that they have been so unjustly treated that they are justified in defying the law and submitting to punishment? We have to consider whether we are doing any good by placing them in that position, and if there is not a reasonable way out of the difficulty. The Government have a difficult proposition to handle, and, as the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> has visited the Northern Territory, and is doubtless coming back with fullinformation,the Government will be in an infinitely better position to deal with the question when he returns. </para>

                        <para>- The Government were so satisfied of the injustice to which the residents of the Northern. Territory were being subjected - I will put it that way, even if the Government do not approve - that they were prepared to give them representation in the Senate, but honorable senators were not agreeable to the proposal. By introducing their Bill the Government recognised that the residents of the Northern Territory were being unjustly treated. They went to the extent of introducing a measure into this Chamber to give them representation. But that Bill did not get through, and, of course, the Government cannot bc held responsible for that.The introduction of such a measure led the  people to believe that an effort was being made to give them representation in the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- If there was any offer to drop Canberra, and give New South Wales its freedom, that State would accept, that offer. The Government have recognised that the Northern Territory desires representation. Before the Territory was taken over by the Commonwealth the residents there had representation in the South Australian Parliament, and now the Territory is under the control of the Commonwealth Government it is only natural that they should desire representation. Another &#34;way out of the difficulty would be to create another State, and then, under the Constitution,  they could have six representatives in this Chamber and five members in the House of Representatives. </para>

                    <para>. - Have &#39; the Government considered the question of improving the shipping service between Papua and the mainland ? I have had a good deal of private correspondence from people living in Papua who are very optimistic concerning its possibilities, but they say that the principal obstacle in  the way of advancement is the lack of communication. They are now dependent solely on the Burns, Philp line of steamers, which, I understand, is providing an irregular service. This is a considerable handicap to the people living in Papua who are carrying on business there. As I understand some of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers are laid up, possibly the Government might make the experiment of placing, at least, one of their boats in this trade. Will the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> state whether the Government have given consideration to that proposition, or to any other which will bring the people in Papua and the Fiji Islands into closer communication with the mainland? </para>

                    <para>. -  I listened with interest to the honorable senator&#39;s remarks concerning the confidence of the residents of Papua in the future of their territory, and I trust their enthusiasm is justified. At present what they really require is an increased expenditure of Commonwealth money. The additional facilities which the honorable senator mentions arc undoubtedly desirable, and the Government are endeavouring to provide them, but are confronted by the demands of the shipping companies for increased subsidies. Negotiations are proceeding, and I think  the  honorable senator will agree that  it  is  desirable  that I should not say anything further  at  this  juncture. </para>

It seems, therefore, that there is some special method of dealing with the various Factories under the control of the Defence Department.

                    <para>. -  I am rather glad that .this question has been raised. because, it affords me an opportunity to point out the unfortunate position in which these Factories find themselves. Take, for example, the Clothing factory, which provides the uniforms for our Forces. That Factory has no funds of it own, because, although there is a vote for the cost of the uniforms, that vote is not paid over to the Factory, but is paid into a Trust Fund. The salary of its staff and the wages of its employees are paid out of that fund, as is also the COSt of the materials which it uses. In the case of the uniforms, the money for material is paid from the Trust Fund in question into the Trust Fund of the Woollen Mills, which supply the cloth. The proceeds, therefore, from these Factories find their &#39; way into the Consolidated Revenue, and there is. .a vote from the Consolidated Revenue into the Trust Funds to keep the Factories going. If any of these Factories make, a profit,, as most of them do, that profit is not shown, except in their balance-sheets. The Woollen Cloth Factory made a profit of upwards of &#163;6Q,000 one year, but that profit did not go into the Trust- Fund. It was paid into the Treasury, and the Treasury month by month pays into the Trust Fund -.sufficient to keep the-. Factory solvent, and to enable it to -pay its operatives as well as to pay for the material which it requires. </para>

                    <para>.- There is one matter connected with this Department which was brought under my notice some time ago, when I embraced the opportunity of placing it before the Minister. It relates to the Royal Australian Naval College. Whilst the Minister acknowledged that the statements then made were correct, he said that the reason for the complaints was that no funds were available. I have seen the honorable gentleman in reference to this matter, and he has no objection to .my bringing it before the Committee. Some time ago I had the privilege of visiting the Naval College, and the impression which it made upon me was that it is the finest educational institution in Australia.. -Its administration is excellent in every respect. As honorable senators are aware, its students are required to undergo a very severe physical test, and it may be assumed, therefore, that they represent the finest physical type of youth to be found in the Commonwealth. Yet several of the parents of these .students approached me not long since and stated that they could not, understand why it was that the boys during vacations exhibited every symptom of imperfect health. A few of the parents had had their lads medically examined, and in two cases I was- informed that the doctors&#39; opinion was that their illness was largely due to poorness of blood, which probably could be traced to the dietary scale provided at the College. Upon inquiry I ascertained that it had been the&#39; custom for the College to receive weekly supplies of vegetables from Sydney. These vegetables towards the end of the week were naturally very stale and altogether undesirable as articles of food. I learned, also, that it was very difficult to procure fresh meat, as the College is situated 25&#39; miles from the nearest railway station. The supply of fresh milk, too, had to be carried daily a distance of from 12 to 14 miles. It is evident, therefore, that the illness of these lads was. due to the deficient diet provided at the College. Upon communicating with the authorities there I was: told that the students are continually suffering from boils. It is true that quite. recently a bi-weekly supply of vegetables has been provided. But the whole position is summed up in the final reply given by the Minister in regard to the supplies of fresh meat, milk, and vegetables. He said that &#34;The necessary funds and staff for this purpose were not available, and, as the present supplies are considered adequate and satisfactory, no change is considered necessary.&#34; It seems to me to be a foolish policy to prejudice the success of this institution by endeavouring to effect such a small economy. It would be a good thing if the College produced its own vegetables, meat, and milk. There are 300 acres attached to the institution, and an expenditure of a few hundred pounds would remove the only defect which I can find in it. </para>

                        <para>- It is contained in a report from the captain in command of the institution, which reads - Vegetables supplied. - From the 3rd February of this year, there has been a local bi-weekly supply, and it is reported that the vegetables have been from that date fresh and good. Prior to this year the supply of vegetables was obtained periodically from Sydney. It is reported that boils have been prevalent amongst all persons at the College. Endeavours have been made to remove these complaints, and for the last two terms boys suffering from boils have been provided with- meals in a special mess formed for them in the hospital, where more green vegetables and fruit are supplied than can be provided in the general  mess.  The medical officer of the College reports that boils seem to be less frequent now than formerly, and attributes this improvement to the fact that fresh meat has been supplied  from a  local source during the current year. A. liberal supply of lime juice is also supplied to the cadets during the summer months, with the object of minimizing this complaint as far as possible. </para>

                    <para>. - I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> to quote the sentence which I had imperfectly caught, because in the absence of the. explanation which he has since given the impression might have been conveyed that the authorities at the College were carrying on operations, knowing that the supplies of food were unsatisfactory. But there is the definite statement from them in the report which the honorable senator has quoted that they regard those supplies as adequate and satisfactory. It would be a very serious matter if the impression got abroad that the Government were withholding from the students of that institution necessary articles of diet and were thus jeopardizing their health. But it is quite clear from the statement which has been quoted that whatever may have been the cause of the temporary shortage of supplies, the supplies which are now available are regarded as adequate and satisfactory. I confess, however, that the whole thing comes as a surprise to me. Possessing the knowledge which I do of our back country, and knowing that there are places where milk, outside of tinned milk, is never seen, and where there is always a shortage of vegetables, when I am told that, at a place like Jervis Bay, boils are breaking out amongst the students of this College because of some temporary dislocation in supplies, I decline to believe it. If it. were so, how is it that much worse conditions do not prevail throughout Australia? Even though honorable senators may not have lived as I have done in the back country, they know something of the conditions there, and that people in the remote districts have often to put up with a shortage of supplies of vegetables and milk. Yet, we never hear of these troubles as a result. Does it seem reasonable that boys attending a college not more than 20 miles from a railway station, and provided for according to a dietary scale which we may be certain has been approved by a medical authority, should have developed this trouble for the reason stated ? I cannot believe it. </para>

                        <para>- That might be so; but apparently the parents of the boys have noticed the occurrence of. the boils, and I assume that the parents of boys throughout Australia would be equally as observant of the condition of the health of their boys. The real question which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> has raised is as to the advisability of the institution making arrangements for growing its own vegetables, and providing its own milk supply. That is a different proposition, and makes clear the statement quoted from a report that there were not funds available for that purpose. It is clear that the vote provided, while sufficient to meet the cost of supplying vegetables and milk to the institution, was not sufficient to cover the cost of employing gardeners to grow the vegetables, and employing men to carry out the work necessary to provide a milk  supply  for the institution on the spot. </para>

                        <para>- By train or by coach. There is no reason why they should be brought to the College on horseback unless there is a regiment of horse marines under training there. A 20 miles ride is but a morning sprint before breakfast compared with the distances I have been used to. Whether it would be more economical or more satisfactory for the College to provide its own vegetable and milk supplies, I am not in a position to say, but I should say that the reason why vegetables and milk are supplied under the existing conditions is that the other proposition has never been put before the Department. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the honorable senator not to be too hasty in his judgment of this matter. I have never known a public institution to object to the enlargement of its borders. I know of no public Department that would not, if that were possible, prefer to provide everything for itself. That appears to be human nature as developed in the Public Service. It should be possible to determine with some degree of certainty the advisableness or otherwise of giving effect to the proposal which the honorable senator has mentioned. The College authorities must know what their vegetable and milk bills amount to. </para>

                    <para>. -  Some time ago, we passed a Bill which altered the practice in existence until then with regard to the calculation of the value of goods for the purpose of assessing duty payable in the case of goods coming into the Commonwealth from countries with a depreciated exchange. As a result of the passing of that measure, or rather of a decision of the High Court then recently given, it was anticipated that  there  would  be  claims made upon the Customs Department for  the  refund of excess  payments made  under the  previous  system of calculating prices for duty. I should like to ask if, in the course of  the  administration of  the  Customs Department, claims of this kind have been dealt with, and if any are still outstandiug. Can the Minister give us any idea of the amount already refunded to importers because of the altered practice? I am given  to  understand that claims have been sent  in continuously  since the alteration  was  made, and have been met, though to what extent I am not  aware. </para>

Officers were  appointed  at fairly substantial salaries, and, although the war has intervened, it was anticipated that long before this navigation, with the exception of minor matters, would be entirely controlled by Commonwealth authority. It is some years ago since the. first Director of Navigation was appointed for the Commonwealth. Since then one or two gentlemen have been appointed to succeed each other in that very important and well-paid office, but so far the Department has not done anything in the direction of organizing for future development which would warrant the expenditure already incurred, or warrant us in continuing to pay money for its upkeep. </para>

                        <para>- It was proclaimed in operation a month or two ago, but the organizing work of the Navigation Department is supposed to have been going on all the time. There has been a Director of Navigation, and a  Deputy  Director was appointed some six or eight months ago. Various other officials have been appointed, but very little is known to honorable senators, or to the commercial public, concerning what is being done by the Department, or what it proposes to do. I think that we should have some information as to the work of the Department, and whether it is proposed to take over from the State Governments at least those sections of their Departments which it will be necessary to take over if the Commonwealth is to run the Navigation Department in a proper way. The position at present is very unsatisfactory. State officials are like Mahomet&#39;s coffin, suspended between earth and Heaven. They do not know whether they are to remain State officials or become Commonwealth officials. The sooner the matter is cleared up the better it will be for the Navigation Department, and for the commercial section of the public. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to have some information as to the actual position of the vessels constituting the Commonwealth line of steam-ships. Some time ago a Ministerial statement was made, showing that the operations of the Commonwealth line of steamers had. been eminently successful last year, but recently I noticed a paragraph in the press in which it was reported that business had fallen off to a considerable extent, and very great difficulty was experienced in securing freight. Coming up the Bay the other day I noticed at Williamstown and Port Melbourne five vessels lying idle, which I assumed were Commonwealth steamers, because they were identical in appearance. If the Minister could make a statement regarding the immediate or near possibility of freights being secured for these vessels, it would be very satisfactory to the taxpayers. I do not know whether the crews have been paid off or not, or whether the vessels are lyingthereawaitingfreightswhichareavailableat </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Williamstown; but from their general appearance I should say the vessels are at rest until the opportunity arises for them to be put in commission again. I shall be glad to hear from the Minister whether there is any likelihood of trade reviving, and whether every effort has been made by the Government to obtain freights from some part of the world to keep the boats in commission. I should think their capital value was at least &#163;250,000, and I am naturally exercised in my mind as to how long this valuable asset of the Commonwealth is likely to remain idle. I do not know if the Department is offering special inducements to obtain cargoes, but it will be. far bettor to run the boats at a small loss than to let them lie idle, because idle assets deteriorate very rapidly. </para>
                <para>Has anything been done to carry out a promise made to me some time ago by the Trade and Customs Department to appoint an officer, who is at present residing at Devonport, to act as Customs officer for Devonport and Burnie? For some years we have had no Customs officer operating on that coast. Both those ports are important, and many business people there import their merchandise direct from the Old Country, and have been put to the inconvenience of passing their entries at Launceston. Some years ago both Devonport and Burnie were ports of entry. The appointment of a Customs officer would be very welcome to the importing section of the community on that part of the Tasmanian coast. </para>

There is an unfortunate dearth of freight to-day, but that is not peculiar to Government ships. Every paper records idle tonnage all the world over, owing to what we all hope is merely a temporary depression in trade. As there is less trade to do, fewer boats are required to do it. I cannot give the honorable senator any indication as to when brisker times may be expected. I wish I could. I hope that the present conditions will be of short duration so far as a country like Australia is concerned. If Providence is reasonably kind to us, and the good season we have now continues, it will not be long, I trust, before these clouds will pass away, and we. shall be basking again in the sunshine of full prosperity. </para>

I do not expect the Minister to have the information at his finger-tips ; but I should like him to ascertain for me how far the Committee have gone, and when there is a probability of getting their report. I have no doubt they are doing their work well and expeditiously, and I know that it is of great importance. I understand that when they do report they will practically tell the various Governments what the gauge should be for all the Australian railways. I trust that when the report is available, the various. Governments will make up their minds to adopt the gauge recommended by the Committee, because it would be of great advantage to the whole Commonwealth for the gauges of the railways in Australia to &#39;be made uniform. </para>

I would understand from the item of &#163;29,000 for the working expenses of the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway that it represented the monthly loss on the working of the line. I notice that it is not a payment to a trust fund, as in the case of previous items to which I drew attention. So far as my knowledge goes, the &#163;50 for the Queanbeyan-Canberra line is not for actual working expenses. I understand, that a few: men. are at work carrying the line further into the Territory, and the item is intended, I think, to meet expenses in that connexion. .

                <para>Regarding the Queanbeyan-Canberra line, about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> spoke, an arrangement exists between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of New South Wales, by which the State of New South Wales runs that section. For this it is paid a lump sum per year, and the &#163;50 in this schedule represents one-twelfth of that amount. With respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan&#39;s</inline> question, it is necessary for Parliament to authorize the Department of Works and Railways to appropriate money to meet working expenses; but that item is quite distinct from any revenue which may be made, for the latter goes into the Consolidated Revenue. The line under consideration does not, as a matter of fact, incur the loss shown in working expenses; the amount should be reduced by the total of receipts standing to the credit of the system. I may . remark, in this connexion, that if one were to call upon all the accountants in the world to devise some system of presenting Budget particulars in order to reveal public accounts in the worst possible light, no more perfect method could be suggested than that which is in operation. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has referred to a  specific example. He pointed out that it would appear that a pertain factory under the control of the Defence Department cost so much to run - that is to say, that there was a loss of a specified amount in maintaining it. As a matter of fact, the factory generally makes a profit. It certainly earns  a  large proportion of the money charged against it. Yet, from the method of presentation of the facts in the Budget files, it- would appear that the factory is debited with the whole amount of its working, costs as an absolute loss. I shall cite another instance from the affairs of my own Department. Certain people have been so patriotic  as  to leave varying sums of money to the Repatriation Department. These gifts total at present,I think, about &#163;150,000. The sum has been put out at interest, and &#163;12,000 has accumulated. That amount, however, has been made to appear as a debit against my Department, under the system of bookkeeping employed in the Treasury. The &#163;12,000 has to be paid into the Treasury in order that it may be paid back to the Repatriation Department, and, so that this transaction may take place, the Treasurer has to ask Parliament for authority to pay the sum over; Thus it is made to appear as  an  item  of expenditure  debited against repatriation, whereas, in fact, the &#163;12,000 is an asset earned by my Department. The system may be all right from the point of view of the Treasury, but it does not command my respect. </para>

                <para>I desire to make one or two references to postal matters, and to ask that my representations shall be brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General. A considerable time ago the Department of Works and Railways was requested to effect some alterations and additions to the Burnie post-office. The proposal remained in abeyance for a long while, but last year tenders were invited for alterations to the front of the building in order that urgently necessary accommodation might be afforded the public. However, the departmental estimate was very  little  more than half the sum of the lowest tender received; consequently, no tender was accepted. At that important seaport, which has been accurately described as the front door of Tasmania, absolutely inadequate postal facilities exist. Burnie is a busy - place, having not only the interests of the town itself, and also those of its maritime connexion; but it is the centre also of one of the finest agricultural districts in the northern portion&#39; of &#39; the island.. The post-office has a counter which is 8&#163; feet long. At that space must he transacted the business of a post-office, a money order office, a Savings Bank, . and a Pensions Branch, together with all the other activities associated with n post-office building. Inevitably, business becomes congested, and public and . staff are greatly inconvenienced. Some time ago, when urging the Postmaster-General to speed up the alterations aud additions, I was informed that the project had been temporarily abandoned, and that a report was being obtained regarding the purchase -&#39;of a site&#34; for the erection pf a new postal building. I  urge  .-Watt &#39; the Department concerned  should make haste. I nave been told that&#39; during the past year at least fifty additional applications have been lodged for private letter-boxes. The Department is losing revenue. A sum of money <inline font-style="italic">was</inline> voted last year for the erection of a new postal  building  at Ulverstone. It is necessary that &#39;that work also should be put in hand as speedily as possible. </para>

But if one has a telephone connected with a private residence, one is not bound to make it available to persons outside the household. </para>

I may have a private telephone, and a neighbour or a stranger may call at my residence late at night, after I have gone to bed, and request the use of the telephone. I may object, whereupon he may urge that his need is so great that he is willing to pay me half-a-crown. Why should I not be permitted to charge more than 2d. in the circumstances? In a boarding establishment where a telephone has been installed, the proprietress may deem it necessary to make a charge, say, of 3d. She may know that numbers of calls are made for which she receives no payment, and she may come to the conclusion that, in order to cover such losses, a charge of more than 2d. is necessary. Every Postmaster-General desires to institute some great reform, and up to the present moment this is the greatest I have seen during the present administration. </para>

                <para>When in the Blue Mountains some time ago, I visited the post-office at Wentworth Falls, and found to my surprise&#39; that the office and the telephone cabinet outside is lighted by kerosene lamps, although the electric light cables which supply the electricity to the town are outside. The kerosene lamp in the telephone box is not always burning, and consequently considerable inconvenience is experienced by those who desire to make calls. I drew the attention of the Department to this matter, and have received a letter from the  Deputy  Postmaster-General to the effect that inquiries were being made, but owing to the lack of funds the request could not  be  granted. It is particularly difficult for those who have to do business at a country post-office on a winter&#39;s evening; when the only light available is that provided by kerosene lamps. As the installation of electric light in the post-office and telephone cabinet would be of great convenience to the people at Wentworth Falls, I trust the Minister will bring the matter under the notice of the Postmaster-General. </para>

Millen)</inline> a question concerning the number of houses erected by Messrs. J. and H. G. Kirkpatrick for the Commonwealth Bank, and by the. War Service Homes Department. . By the answers submitted,, the Minister appeared to resent the question, because I suppose he thought I was desirous of proving that the Bank authorities had been constructing houses more successfully than the Department. An inquiry has been proceeding in connexion with this matter, and the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 16th June, 1921, reported as follows: - </para>

We may state that the work is not completed, and until it is completed will cost us a further &#163;4,000; therefore, making our total expenses approximately &#163;42,000 odd.

                    <para>. - SenatorGardiner has come here, as he himself admits, with a carefully prepared brief, by the firm of Messrs. Kirkpatrick. I am not in a position to check his figures, nor do I wish to do so. I am not going to engage in a controversy as to whether the Commonwealth Bank made  more mistakes than did the late War Service HomesCommissioner. But I confidently submit that the number of complaints which reached him are no true indication of the number of imperfect houses which have been built by the Commonwealth Bank. Of course, when a Government Department is concerned, there is a great tendency for people to be more vocal about it than they would be if a private institution were concerned, There is only one matter in the statement read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to which I wish specifically to refer Messrs. Kirkpatrick give the number of contracts which they have let, the amount involved in them, and the average cost per home. They also claim that they have constructed these houses within the limit of expenditure imposed by the Act. But they say not a word about who provided the land. I know that, in a very large percentage of cases, the men themselves found the land, Consequently, the comparison which they institute is not a fair dne. The value of the land would require to be added to make their statement of cost comparable with any statement of the cost of the houses which have been erected by the late War Service Homes Commissioner. That is why I interjected that the statement presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was not a full one. When I see it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> I shall have an opportunity of looking into the figures which he has submitted. But, in the meantime, I thought it was necessary for me to inform honorable senators of one great discrepancy in the statement of Messrs. Kirkpatrick. </para>
