                <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline>
                - It is my sad duty to inform the Senate of the death of a former senator and Leader of the Senate, the Honorable Alexander John
                <inline font-style="italic">McLachlan,</inline>
                who died in hospital yesterday at the age of S3. The late exsenator was born at Naracoorte, South Australia, on the 2nd November, 1872. He was educated at the Hamilton Academy in Victoria, Mount Gambier High School and the University of Adelaide. He was called to the bar in South Australia in 1895, and he became a member of the bar in Victoria in 1929. Ex-Senator McLachlan practised his profession in Adelaide. He was a former chief of the South Australian Caledonian Society, and at one time he was the  president  of the South Australian Liberal and Country League.
            </para>
            <para>Ex-Senator McLachlan was elected to the Senate at the general elections in 1925. He was not due to take his seat in the Parliament until the 1st July, 1926. However, in February, 1926, he was appointed by the South Australian Parliament to fill a casual vacancy in the Senate. He retained his seat as a senator until the 30th June, 1944.  His  period of service in the Senate exceeded nineteen years. Ex-Senator McLachlan was appointed an Honorary Minister for the period from 1926 to 1929, and acted as Attorney-General from 1926 to 1927. He was Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister administering the Development Branch of the Commonwealth Council for Scientific and Industrial Research from 1932 to 1934. He again acted as Attorney-General from March to July, 1932, from April to July, 1934, and ' in 193S. Ex-Senator McLachlan was Postmaster-General from 19St t" 1938, and Minister administer- ing the Development Branch of the Com.monwealth Council for Scientific and Industrial Research from the 12th October, 1934, to the 29th November, 1937. He was the Leader of the Government in the Senate from 1937 to 1938. In 192S, he was the Leader of the Australian delegation to the League of Nations, and he was Plenipotentiary for Australia for. the signing of the Kellogg Pact in that year. From 1943 to 1944, he was a member of the War Expenditure Committee. Indeed, he had a remarkable political and parliamentary career, and it can be truly said that he served his country well. </para>

            <para>That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death of the Honorable Alexander John McLachlan, former Leader of the Government in the Senate, Commonwealth Minister and senator for the State of South Australia, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service. </para>

                (Tasmania- Leader of the Opposition). - I associate myself and members of the Opposition with the remarks of the Minister for the Navy
                <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan),</inline>
                and support the motion that he has submitted to the Senate. The record of service of ex-Senator A. J. McLachlan, which has been read by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Sullivan.</inline>
                is a very distinguished one extending over a very long period of years. From the diversity of offices that ex-Senator McLachlan held, it is obvious that he must have had a very great and wide genera] capacity. He was fortunate in that he had some twelve years of retirement, and I trust that they were happy years for him. To members of his family, his friends and former associates, inside and outside this Parliament, we of the Opposition extend our sympathy.
            </para>
            <para>Unfortunately, J did not have the pleasure of knowing the late senator. He retired from this chamber on the 30th June, 1944, and I became entitled to enter it on the following day. One cannot help noting how quickly changes take place in this chamber. I think I am correct in saying that on the Government side to-day there would be only two senators, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper,</inline> who would have served in the Parliament with the late senator. I think the position is very much the same on this side. Five senators on this side, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown, Senator Cameron, Senator Courtice, Senator Sheehan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney,</inline> sewed with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan. The present members of the Opposition did not have a close association with the deceased gentleman but we know of his high repute, and we join with the Government senators in regretting his passing. </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator COOPER</inline>
                (Queensland - Minister for Repatriation). - The members of the Australian Country party desire to be associated with the motion before the Senate. I associate myself with it most intimately as I was in the Senate for a number of years with the late
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline>
                J. McLachlan. I remember well the fluent arguments he was able to put forward in respect of the various portfolios he held. He first held cabinet rank in the Bruce-Page Government and later in the Lyons Government. He was not only a brilliant debater and good administrator but also a very lovable man. I am quite sure  that, he had no enemies at all on either side of the Senate. Members of the Australian Labour party and members of his own party thought a great deal of A. J. McLachlan. We express our sympathy to his family and to his friends, and our deep regret at the passing of a man who has had such a distinguished carper in association with the National Parliament of this country.
            </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator SHEEHAN</inline>
                (Victoria). - I desire to associate myself with the motion iÂ»f condolence. It. is remarkable how few honorable senators are here to-day who
                <inline font-style="italic">were</inline>
                with
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline>
                during the period mentioned by the Leader of the Government in the Senate
                <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan).</inline>
                I came to this Senate in rather peculiar circumstances. My predecessor, the late
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline>
                had died between polling day and the day on which the newly elected senators were to take their seats. A controversy arose as to the constitutional power to fill the vacancy and when I was appointed it was suggested that the appointment be made a test case.
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline>
                was Leader of the Government at the time, and he possessed great legal knowledge. On the morning of my arrival in the Senate he received me- and was most courteous and sympa thetic to me. During the time that we remained together in the Senate I felt that he was a senator who had the esteem and respect of all honorable senators. Whilst he differed from honorable senators on this side in politics, he displayed no bitter antagonism towards his opponents. When we were engaged in debate - and in those years there were some very vigorous debates on the disallowance of regulations and that sort of thing -
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline>
                always conducted himself in accordance with the highest standards of public life, and gave the Senate the benefit of opinions formed by great experience of parliamentary practice and great knowledge of the world. In 1940, 1 was defeated at a general election, but he remained in the Senate. However, I was privileged to continue my friendship with him; and his sympathetic' attitude towards one in defeat was something that I have never forgotten. 1 regret his passing very very much indeed, because T feel that Australian public life has lost a man who filled his position in it most ably  and well.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator SPICER</inline>
                (Victoria - Attorney-General). - One of the great compensations of undertaking responsibilities associated with public life is the development of close friendships with colleagues on both sides of the chamber, friendships which we should otherwise not be privileged to enjoy. It was my good fortune to enter this chamber for the first timewhile the late
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline>
                was still a member of it. At that, time hr was something of the elder statesman, and I a mere novice who turned to him, among others, for advice and guidance. That advice and guidance, which contained much wisdom, he readily gave to me. Out of that association there developed a friendship which I was privileged to enjoy until his death only yesterday. "A.J." as we affectionately knew him. had a long and active life, during which he made contributions not only in - politics, but also in law, business and pastoral pursuits, which added to the progress and development of the land that he loved so intensely. He was a shrewd judge of sheep. In fact, he was born among  sheep and ended his days among. the,  too.  on his lovely property near Melbourne. which he so greatly improved in his days of retirement to which the Leader of the Opposition
                <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline>
                has already referred. During his earliest days in the practice of the law, he had associations with Mount Gambier, and I understand that he served his articles in the office with which
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline>
                is now associated. Later, he was a partner of Kingston, who played such a distinguished part in the early days of federation.

                "A.J." chose to describe himself as an " f.a.q. Australian ". That, I feel, was a great compliment to his fellow Australians which, nevertheless, typified his great devotion to the country of his birth, his active interest in which continued to the clay of his death. I join in the expressions of sympathy towards his relatives which have been uttered on behalf of all honorable senators, knowing that they will derive great consolation in rheir loss from the knowledge that many others will regret that memories must now replace the personal contact that they were privileged to enjoy for so long.

                (South Australia). -I desire to associate myself with the remarks of the previous speakers. Certainly, a most colourful figure has been removed from the legal profession in South Australia, and also from its political life, by the passing of
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan.</inline>
                He was descended from vigorous Highland parents who were well settled in South Australia when he was born there more than80 years ago. As the Attorney-General
                <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline>
                has said, the late former senator had an intense love of the countryside and of animals.It was my privilege to meet him in South Australia, particularly in the country. He would reminisce upon the early days of the law in South Australia and grazing practices in the southeast of that State.
            </para>
            <para>The Attorney-General has spoken of the former senator's life in general. He entered articles in the office in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gambier</inline> in which I now have an interest and, preserved in that office, are records of deeds and documents written in his own bold handwriting. An interesting feature of his political career was the fact that he started it rather late in life. He practised at the South Australian bar from about 1895 and, at an early age, rubbed shoulders with some of the great figures of federation, including the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir John</inline> Downer. He was a partner of the late C. C. Kingston, who was an early Minister of Trade and Customs. Although he took no active part in the politics for the first 25 years of federation, he met some of its prominent figures in his work at the South Australian bar. Sow, after 56 years of federation in Australia, we mourn the loss of such a figure. I offer my sympathy and condolences to his family and to his relatives who are well known in South Australia. I pay tribute to the fact that the former senator, in the twilight of his life, was able to record in a book, which he distributed among his friends, his rich experiences in the law, politics and South Australian life on the land. I was privileged to have a copy given to me by him and I am grateful that such memories have not been lost to humanity. </para>

                        <para>- I certainly agree with the honorable senator's last comment that Tasmania is very well represented on this committee in the  persona  of the Leader of the Opposition (Senator McKenna) and my colleague, Senator Wright. I have not seen the newspaper report to which the honorable senator has referred, but, from what he has indicated of its contents, it seems to me to show that perhaps the Premier of Tasmania does not altogether appreciate the" purpose of this committee. Its purpose is to have a number of members of both Houses of this Parliament, and from both sides, devote themselves to the task of reviewing the Constitution with a view to seeing if there are means by which it might be usefully amended in certain respects on which both parties could agree. From time to time over the years, we have had agitations for the creation of a constitutional convention. They have never come to anything. In many ways I do not regard that as very surprising because the truth is that if we have anything like an elected constitutional convention we shall have merely a replica of this Parliament. What is overlooked these days is the fact that this Parliament is in truth a continuing convention of the people of Australia to consider amendments to the Constitution. The great difficulty for a number of members is to find time to devote to a consideration of the kind of amendment which the years have shown to be desirable. Therefore, it. seems to me to be a very wise course to commence the process by creating a committee of this Parliament drawn from all sides of both chambers to concentrate on that task. If, as a result of our deliberations, we reach agreement on matters, upon which no doubt it will be necessary to he in agreement, then we shall have gone a long way indeed along the road to getting a desirable constitutional reform, because those decisions will have been reached by a committee comprising members of both. Houses of the Parliament; and it must always be remembered that the consent, of both Houses of the Parliament is a' necessary step in the process of constitutional alterations which, after being approved by this Parliament, must be approved by the people by way of referendum. </para>

I ask the Minister whether any consideration has been given to a. course of action designed to reconcile the conflict between Federal and State wage-fixing authorities? Has the Government considered whether the occasion would be appropriate for a Premiers conference, in view of the industrial disruption that is being threatened on nil sides,  arising  out of this question ? </para>

                        <para>- I direct a  question  to the Minister representing the Minister for Customs and Excise or the Minister for Trade, whoever may be the more appropriate. Is the Minister aware that the Government's policy of restricting imports has operated inequitably among States, and has discriminated particularly against the States of Western Australia, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania? Is the Minister aware that, prior to the imposition, on the ground of necessity, of the controls and restrictions on imports, some of the smaller States imported their requirements of certain goods through principals with businesses established mainly in Victoria and New South Wales? As a result of the import restrictions imposed by the Government, importers in those two States enjoy import quotas at a higher rate than would have been the case had they been importing exclusively for their own States. Is the Minister aware that, the quotas for those two major States having been established, importers in Western Australia and the other smaller States cannot obtain quotas in respect of goods which previously were imported by importers in New South Wales and Victoria, because the Government has related its import restriction policy to a base year in which normal trading activity per:mitted Western Australia and other smaller States to obtain goods through principals in Victoria and New South Wales? Will the Minister consider a full investigation of the application of this policy in order to permit Western Australia, South Australia. Queensland and Tasmania to have the benefit of import quotas, approved by the Government, based on a year other than that which hai  been selected, and to permit those States to obtain equitable quantities of goods subject to import restrictions? </para>

                        <para>- Any policy that requires restriction of imports must have  a  number of aspects of its administration. I cannot accept the proposition that the present policy of import restrictions is so gravely astray that its administration has not covered the point made by the honorabe senator. I cannot accept his contention that the administration has been so inequitable as to give to New South Wales and Victoria import quotas to which the smaller States are entitled. I have heard the point mentioned before, but when specific instances have been brought to my attention, at least, I have found that there was no case against the arrangements. I suggest to the honorable senator that this is the type of thing that cannot be dealt with in generalities. General statements do not do justice to the administrative problems that are always involved. I also suggest to the honorable senator that the best test that he can make is to bring a specific complaint, or a specific allegation, to the notice of my colleague, the Minister for Trade. If he does so, I shall be very surprised indeed if the Minister is unable to give him a satisfactory answer. </para>

                        <para>- I point out to the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation that the dependence of Flinders Island on air transport has increased considerably during the last few years as the result of war service land settlement and has reached the stage where practically no facilities for passengers are provided on the ketches and other small craft which trade to the island. As a result of the high rainfall in Tasmania recently, the inadequacy of the surface of the only aerodrome on Flinders Island has been brought more forcibly to the notice of the residents there. Very few aircraft have been able to visit the island, so that it has become practically isolated. "Will the Minister consult his colleague, the Minister for Civil Aviation, with a view to having a permanent, all-weather surface placed on the runway at the Whitemark  aerodrome,  so that the people who live  on the  island will have a chance to maintain contact with both Tasmania and  Victoria ? </para>

Will  the Minister inform me  whether he has  yet reached a decision regarding  a request  by the association to be  permitted to  obtain component parts for the  manufacture  of artificial limbs  for civilian  amputees from the Repatriation  Department's  artificial limb factory  in Perth?  If he has not done so, will he  undertake  to expedite this matter, as  the need for  such parts is daily becoming  more urgent  if the association is to  continue its  humanitarian work for the  less fortunate  members of the community? </para>

                        <para>- As Senator Tangney will probably  remember, when  she raised this matter on the  21st March,  I said that, if the materials  mentioned  could not be supplied by the  Repatriation  Department, I would get in  touch with  the manufacturers from  whom the department  obtains them to see  whether they  would be prepared to supply  similar  articles to the Civilian Maimed and  Limbless  Association of Western  Australia.  The Repatriation Department  has since  got in touch with the various  manufacturers  about this matter, but no  definite  reply has yet been received  from them.  I assure the honorable senator  that I have  not lost sight of her request and  that, as  soon as information on the  matter is  available, I shall let her know. </para>

                    <para>The question of labelling trees in Canberra for the information of visitors has already been given some attention by the department and it is intended as a first step to affix labels showing the botanical and common names and country of origin to trees in suitable places in Canberra where there are good collections of trees, such as in the vicinity of Parliament House and at Telopea Park. The preparation of labels for this purpose is already in hand. It will be appreciated, of course, that such labelling of trees can only be undertaken on a limited scale; the labelling of all trees in Canberra would be a tremendous task and could not be justified. </para>

                    <para>Ever since the inception of the sales tax in  1930,  the successive governments have been urged by various persons and organizations to amend the law so as to exclude freight from the taxable sale value of goods. It will be appreciated that in considering a proposition of this kind it is essential to have regard not only to such advantages as appear likely to result, but also to the disadvantages which would ensue and to reach a conclusion calculated to have the best results for the community as a whole. The conclusion reached over the years has been that it is impracticable to give effect to the proposal. </para>

                            <para>The sales tax law does not tax freight as such. The tax is payable, in respect of goods sold by wholesale in Australia, upon " the amount for which the goods are sold", and there is no authority in the law to exclude any of the costs which enter into and form part  of  the sale price. There are good reasons why this shouldthe so. This was emphasized  by  Starke . J. in his judgment in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Quarries (Footscray) Proprietary Limited</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Federal Commissioner of Taxation</inline> (59  C.L.R.  111).  That company sold crushed stone for which it quoted, to its customers, prices including cost of delivery to the purchaser.

                            <para>It is clear that the Canadian scheme lends itself to a " snow-balling " of tax to a greater extent than the Australian tax, because of the levy being paid as a general rule, by manufacturers and the wholesalers adding their profit on the tax, as well as the retailers by whom the goods are subsequently sold.

This is achieved where the goods are soldon an f.o.b. or f.o.r. basis and property in the goods passes to the purchaser when the goods are placed on the ship or train.

This was a common basis of purchase before the sales tax came into existence. In buying on this basis, the retailer, in fact, accepts certain disadvantages, in that the risk of loss, theft or damage during transit falls upon him instead of remaining with the vendor until the goods are delivered. Probably the retailer is able to secure a more favorable purchase price by accepting these disadvantages. </para>

                            <para>It appears, therefore, that the amendment would have to be limited to excluding, from the taxable sale value of goods sold by wholesalers, the costs incurred in Australia in getting the goods into the wholesaler's store, from the point of importation or the place of manufacture of those goods. It is considered that wholesalers generally would be strongly opposed to any such requirement. It has been represented by many persons and organizations that persons liable to pay sales tax are already over-burdened with the work of classifying goods according to the different rates in operation, calculating the tax and compiling sales tax returns. Many of them would not be slow to express their resentment if the law placed upon them the added obligation of excluding freight costs from their taxable sale values. Special records would need to be kept of the freight involved in respect of each consignment of goods purchased by them, and each parcel of ponds sold by them would have to be identified with a particular consignment and a calcula tion made of the proportion of freight applicableto the particular goods sold. Some wholesale merchants might have to make special inquiries of the manufacturers from whom they have bought goods before they could determine what amounts of freight had been paid. In practice, it is thought that many merchants would decline to go to all this trouble and would simply pay and charge tax on their full sale prices," for obvious reasons of convenience and certainty" - to quote again the apt comment of Starke J. </para>

Under the proposed amendment, wholesalers would pay tax on imported goods at the customs, in the same way as retailers, and would not pay on their sales. Similarly, wholesalers who sell goods of Australian manufacture would cease to be liable to furnish returns and pay tax on their sales of those goods.

For example, many classes of goods are exempt only when they are sold for use for agricultural purposes. Raw materials are free of tax when sold to manufacturers. Goods for the use of government departments, non-profit hospitals, public benevolent institutions and certain other organizations are exempt from tax. These exemptions are readily secured when the goods are purchased by the buyer who is entitled to exemption direct from manufacturers or wholesalers who have tax-free stocks. If whole- salers' stocks are to be tax-paid stocks, there will be practical difficulties in securing tax adjustments and these difficulties could cause a partial failure of the exemptions system. </para>

                            <para>The strongest criticism of the proposal springs from the practical certainty that its adoption would not, in fact, bring any real benefits to the country or interstate buyers, for whom the change is sought. On the contrary, it would be likely to be to their ultimate disadvantage. Sales taxes in many parts of the world have been criticized for what is called their "snow-balling effect", which arises from the fact, that, in the normal course of business, each trader not unnaturally seeks his margin of profit on his whole outlay for goods, including the sales tax. One of the few recommendations for a retail turnover tax is that, as the tax falls on the last sale by a retailer, there is no " snow-balling effect ". The converse occurs in the case of a tax which is payable at the point of importation or manufacture. The wholesaler has to bear tax when he obtains his stock of goods. When he sells the goods, he applies his mark-up to his total outlay, including the tax, and he thus takes his profit on the amount of the tax. Later the retailer does the same, so that when the goods reach the consumer two merchants have inflated the weight of the tax by applying their margins of profit. Under the existing law, the wholesaler does not do this. </para>

                        to the motion moved by me on Thursday last, following upon a message received from the House of Representatives relating to the appointment of a joint committee to review the working of the Australian Constitution, I should like to make the following explanatory observations.

                </talk.start>
                <para>With respect to paragraph 2 of the message, I have been informed by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> that neither he nor the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> will be sitting constantly on the committee, but there may be occasions when it will be of value for both to attend sittings of the committee. They have, therefore, entered into an arrangementto notify each other when they want to attend the sittings. </para>
                <para>Paragraph 4 of the message requests the Senate to appoint four members of the Senate to serve on the committee and to appoint one of those members to be the  chairman  of the committee. I think it is appropriate that on a committee such as the proposed joint committee, the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> should be  chairman.  Indeed, I think the committee will be fortunate to have as its  chairman  a man with so much legal and political experience and ability. </para>
                <para>With respect to paragraph 8 of the message, it is not proposed that the committee should carry out its functions in the manner of a royal commission. It will not have a lot of people giving evi dence but will attempt to solve the problem around the table and, as occasion demands, it will invite persons with particular knowledge or experience to help in its deliberations. </para>
                <para>With respect to paragraph 11 of the message, honorable senators will agree that the Government should have the final say on the procedure of the committee but not on matters of substance. </para>

I feel I should not allow the occasion to pass without saying, first of all, that the setting up of this committee has the complete and wholehearted concurrence of the Opposition. The Opposition was consulted by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> regarding the terms of reference and constitution of the committee. We find ourselves in complete accord with the terms that have been announced. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I regard the appointment of this committee as being of the utmost importance because if, on examination, it turns out that the Constitution is outmoded then it is badly in need of revision, because an outmoded constitution will not only impede the development of Australia but also must act as a brake upon the prospects and careers of all persons in the Australian community. Personally, I regard it as a very distinct honour to be a member of the committee in such very distinguished company. I believe that the committee, if it sees fit to make any recommendations for change, should probably include in its recommendations means by which the ultimate result may be obtained. I feel that it might recommend to the Government that certain powers that may be within the powers of the States should be sought from the States. I think that would be a natural step. It would be unwise, I should think, to make such recommendations without taking that preliminary step. </para>

                        <para>That this Senate has no confidence in the  President.  1 think that the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan),</inline> as Leader of the Government in the Senate, has taken the proper course, in elevating this motion to a position of first importance in the course of to-day's proceedings. It would be embarrassing for everybody concerned if it were to be left to take a slow course on the notice-paper. At this stage, I express the wish that the matter may conclude at this one sitting. I suggest to the Minister for the Navy that as Standing Order 127 will necessitate the interruption of the debate at 5 o'clock unless the Senate orders otherwise, he might consider, if necessary, moving that the debate be extended beyond 5 o'clock to enable the matter to be disposed of completely to-day. However, that is a matter within the control of the Government. </para>

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline>
                        I shall refer to four matters in respect of the motion that 1 have moved on behalf of the Opposition. I put them, not in any order of relative importance, hut in chronological order. The first matter is your failure to notify the Senate of your decision to recognize one senator in this chamber as leader of a party and leader of himself. I am referring to the fact that the first time that 1 and my colleagues in the Opposition became aware that you had so recognized
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline>
                        was when a debate took [dace in another place and when the Prime Minister
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline>
                        on the 17th April last, indicated that the granting to
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline>
                        of special facilities not made available to an ordinary senator had flowed from the principle that you had recognized him as a leader in this chamber. It is a very significant fact that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole,</inline>
                        until the 8th May, had never made any such claim in this chamber. He kept that matter a secret from this chamber, and I am submitting that you,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline>
                        also withheld from the Senate, knowledge of your decision to recognize
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline>
                        as the leader of a party, although it is quite obvious that you indicated the effect of that decision to the Government itself.
                    </para>
                    <para>We believe very firmly that that was a government decision only, with which neither you nor the Senate had anything to do until the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> announced the principle of the event on the 17th April in another place. That is the first fact which the Opposition objects to, the withholding of all the circumstances of that matter from, this chamber. Its' real significance in the case that I am presenting will appear as I proceed. </para>
                    <para>The second matter concerns events connected with the passage of the Fishing Industry Bill 1956 through this chamber on the 10th May. The second reading of that measure did not evoke many speeches in this chamber. In fact, there were seven from the Opposition and eight, including the Minister's reply, from the Government side of the Senate. That does nor. constitute a very protracted debate, and one could argue that the debate had been disposed of by the Opposition with expedition up to that point. When we went into committee, in less than an hour - certainly after not more than three-quarters of an hour of committee proceedings - the Minister in charge of the bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner,</inline> declared that the bill was an urgent measure. That was in committee, T emphasize, and his allotment of time was six minutes for the completion of the committee stage. </para>
                    <para>I used one or two minutes of that time to protest against the procedure, and addressed myself for only four minutes to posing questions directed towards probing the integrity and good faith of the Government regarding the sale of the assets of the Australian Whaling Commission. Of course, in the time available, I got no answer. Now, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> you were not present throughout the committee proceedings because you had retired from the Senate. However, you have an opportunity to know what goes on in coinmittee, although you may not be in the Senate personally. I have no knowledge whether you did avail yourself of that opportunity on that occasion, but in due course you came back to the Senate and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> moved that the report of the committee be adopted. </para>
                    <para>Officially, you had no notice of any guillotine move in the committee, as in fact you had no official knowledge of- any of the committee proceedings. But, in the event of your having that knowledge nevertheless, you knew that the Leader of the Opposition had a right, subject to your call, to move for the recommittal of the motion for the adoption of the report. We had that very instance under your presidency in November, 1954, when the Senate was dealing with the Stevedoring Industry Bill 1954. At that time, I believe that the same Minister had moved the guillotine in committee, and you ruled against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> to the effect that the Leader of the Opposition might properly move, by way of amendment to the motion for the adoption of the committee's report, a motion for recommittal upon the motion for the adoption of the Opposition might advance arguments in the course of his speech in support of his motion. In short, such a motion would enable the  speaker  to traverse the whole of the purposes of the bill. </para>
                    <para>The moment that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> moved that the report be adopted, I. rose and importunately asked for the call. I asked very loudly, and I have no doubt but that you heard me. I rose ahead of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer,</inline> who rose also, and the fact that I rose ahead of him is recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of that day. </para>

                            <para>- I was also quick, and I have no doubt that I was quicker than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> on that occasion. T have lost on other occasions, but the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of that date shows that T rose and addressed the  President  first, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> then rose and moved in great haste, "That the question  be now put ". Yon. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> gave  that call to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Spicer  Von ignored the Leader of the Opposition. although the practice here - and it is a practice that custom has hardened into a rule - is that you look alternately to different sides of the chamber. That is a traditional rule, and is the practice nol only of this chamber, but also of the House of Commons. i had spoken for only four minutes on the bill, and I particularly wanted to put forward some views. I was in doubt about whether I should talk on the Fishing Industry Bill or reserve my remarks for the debate on the Whaling Industry Act Repeal Bill which was to be brought up after the Fishing Industry Bill had been disposed of. In the light of the gagging that took place on the Fishing industry Bill, I was properly and justifiably fearful that I would be denied an adequate opportunity of speaking on the Whaling Industry Act Repeal Bill. Accordingly, I had two opportunities before me. One was to move the recommittal upon the motion for the adoption of the report, and I have told the Senate what happened to the Leader of the Opposition on that occasion, and the other to speak on the third reading of the bill. </para>

                    <para>I shall now come to the third reading of the measure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> moved the  third reading and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Sullivan,</inline> the Leader of the Government in the Senate, shot out of his chair as though he were jet-propelled - certainly ahead of me because I could not match that speed - -.creaming out his motion, "That th, question be now put ". The only thing that I have seen to equal his speed <inline font-style="italic">w&amp;e</inline> the speed with which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> acknowledged him and put that motion. That, I repeat, was the only thing that 3 have ever seen to equal the celerity with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Sullivan</inline> moved. From what had gone on before, you knew beyond doubt what the procedure was. Ton had ruled in my favour on a previous occasion in similar circumstances, and you knew that I wished to put th,viewpoint of the Opposition in the concluding stage on this hill. The fact thai you repeated that action twice in a few minutes at such speed, shows what your intention was the first time. </para>
                    <para>I put it to the Senate that yours was a  high-speed  performance which was both unfair and unjust to the Opposition. I make the allegation that the  President  of the Senate and Ministers were quite obviously and openly in collusion to prevent the Leader of the Opposition, or any member of the Opposition, from having a voice at all on a bill which had been before the 'Senate, not for a protracted period, but for a perfectly normal period. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> should say that in doing that, you lent yourself to the stifling of debate. The  President  of the Senate became a mere party tool and, in the final analysis, and having regard to what happened before, it was the  President  who applied the closure, and not the Government. In effect, I say it was the  President  who applied the closure - that is, the referee applied the closure - and it was a sorry spectacle for the whole of the Senate to see you tumble from the pedestal upon which you had rightly been placed in the minds of all honorable senators. </para>
                    <para>You must have been gravely mortified, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> when the Government showed  you up - and itself, too, by the way - on that same afternoon, because what was the hurry for the gag? Immediately this matter was disposed of, the Whaling Industry Act Repeal Bill came before the chamber. It was gagged through in one hour, and on the motion of the Leader of the Government the Senate rose at 4.30 o'clock on the afternoon of Thursday. </para>

                            <para>- I repeat, at 4.30 o'clock in the afternoon. I suggest that that demonstrates just how unjust and unfair it was to apply the closure. As I am submitting, you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and not the Government, applied the closure. I suggest that if you had done the right thing, you would have allowed the Leader of the Opposition an opportunity to speak, either on the motion for the adoption of the report or on the third reading  of the Fishing Industry Bill, lt is bad for democracy and for this Senate that that sort of thing should take place. You would have increased the respect in which you have been held by the Ministers themselves had you rejected their suggestions of undemocratic and unparliamentary procedures. You would have grown in stature with  Government sup porters, and would not have suffered the loss of respect from honorable senators on the Opposition side. 1 put it to the Senate that we on the Opposition side do not mind how many blows the Government and its supporters give us. We are prepared to take them and to hand them back in kind, but we do  object  when the referee knocks us out of the ring in the course of the contest. We object to the referee participating in the conflict. In this instance, we were knocked out, not by the Government, but by the referee. </para>

That was the evening when the debate on the motion for the second reading of the Broadcasting and Television Bill took place. 1 remind honorable senators how the call fell on that night. I began the debate on behalf of the Opposition at 8 p.m. and, on that night, the proceedings of the Senate were  being  broadcast.- The Whips, at least, will not deny that from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Wednesday, when proceedings are being broadcast, is regarded as a most favoured and preferred time by all honorable senators. </para>

                            <para>- My speech lasted an hour, and nobody denies that right to the Leader of the Opposition. We had three non-Opposition speakers in a row - Senators McCallum, Cole and Wedgwood. We on the Opposition side had two speakers out of a total of six. We had the first and the fifth instead of the first, the third and the fifth. I submit that that was grossly unfair to the Opposition and showed a disregard by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> of your duty to be impartial. Your action in this matter really reduced the two-party system in this Senate to a travesty and a farce. </para>

                            <para>- Let us examine the question of time in this matter, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> has suggested. He is not only a one-man party in this Senate; he is a one-man party in the Parliament. If he were given his proportion of time in this Senate in a selected three hours' period, he would get one-sixtieth of 180 minutes; that is, three minutes. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> gave him an opportunity to speak for 30 minutes; that is ten times his proper allocation. I suggest that this performance would not be repeated in any British parliament. I can well understand the  President  discriminating against the Opposition, but the question arises : Why was the  President  favouring <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole?</inline> I shall leave that question unanswered for a moment or two until I complete my final point. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the fourth matter upon which the motion is based, and [ refer to the proceedings that took place on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate on the evening of last Wednesday, the 23rd May. The motion for the adjournment was moved at 11 p.m. and in the one hour 25 minutes occupied in considering it, there were two motions of dissent from your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> seven points of order were taken, two private Government senators intervened to movethe gag to terminate the debate and, altogether, the proceedings were most extraordinary. My recital gives only a slight indication of how far you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> allowed the Senate to get out of hand under your presidency on that occasion. I put it to honorable senators who were present that the whole proceedings were quite unseemly. There was continuous uproar from both sides, and the Opposition very properly demonstrated to the Senate the effect of one of your rulings. I make no claim - nor would any honorable senator on the Opposition side claim - that that was seemly, but you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> were obliged to uphold what was done because of a ruling that you gave during the evening. </para>

For that, you must take full responsibility, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> You have shown again and again, during your occupancy of the chair, your capacity to obtain instant order and to preserve it continuously, but you chose not to exercise that capacity last Thursday evening, lt was your capacity to show tact and impartiality which led me in this chamber, earlier this year, to convey to yon, sincerely and publicly, a tribute of esteem and respect from this side of the chamber on your return from a trip abroad. I did that then. Unfortunately, recent events have disturbed that viewpoint of the Opposition. That has unquestionably happened because on Thursday night and into the small hours of Friday morning last, you chose not to exercise those great qualities which you have demonstrated previously you could exercise at will. T pose to the Senate this question: "Was it the fact that an attack upon the Australian Labour party and the Opposition had been launched in this chamber by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> and had to be encouraged and fostered for the reason that it was launched by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole?</inline></para>

The other three matters with which I have dealt all revolve round <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole.</inline> The first is your failure to notify the Senate when you decided to recognize him as the leader of a party. The second is the preferential treatment you accorded him during the second-reading debate on the Broadcasting and Television Bill. The third i3 the licence that you permitted in this chamber last Thursday evening following upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole's</inline> attack. </para>

                            <para>- Is that not true? The  President  will retire on the 30th June. I am merely putting that forward so that honorable senators on the Government side may answer it. The  President  will retire and the Government will lose its majority at the same time. It will have 30 members, and the rest of the Senate, however comprised, will have 30 members. If the  President  does in fact secure the nomination of his own party, he cannot be assured of election if those not immediately of the Government parties combine against him and put up another nominee. In those circumstances a nominee from the Opposition would go to the ballot and, on the figures, would have an equal chance of success with a nominee from the Government side. I suggest those are the considerations that have led you astray and have caused you to use bad judgment in th's Senate for the first time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> You leaned towards the Government on the Fishing Industry Bill; and you have cultivated and leaned  towards <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Cole throughout the last few months in the circumstances that I have outlined. </para>

                            <para>- I am going to deal with that very matter. That very fact supports the very thing I say. Within the last, few days, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> has stood u p in his place and told the Opposition, not when the question of the Presidency but when the question of his recognition as the leader of a party was the issue that any nominee from the Opposition who had hopes of achieving the Presidency could forget all about it. On what ground did he make that statement? He said that because the Opposition had indicated it was opposed to the granting of facilities to him. That is the base upon which he put it exactly. Rather than being out of line with the argument that I am presenting, that is the very essence and the very confirmation of it. It is the very base of t he case I am making and of the view which the Opposition takes of the President's actions. We have no pleasure in putting this forward. </para>

                            <para>- It is my time to talk now. All other honorable senators will have their chance, I presume. I say in conclusion that we feel that the  President  has been actuated less by hostility, or  perhaps not at all by hostility to the Opposition, and not at all, or not. very much, at all events, by bias towards the Government side than by a motive which is on a much lower level indeed - the matter of his own personal interest. It is because of the sequence of events and actions in this chamber, because of the sequence of events and actions by the  President  in this chamber and because of the Opposition's view of those actions that I  move this motion on behalf of the Opposition. </para>

It, was because it was deemed proper that the matter should be dealt with expeditiously. This change that has come over the Australian Labour party recently in connexion with the very high opinion it has had of you is rather extraordinary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> A.the Leader of the Opposition reminds us. it was only earlier this year, upon the occasion of your welcome back from Jamaica, that very gracious and very generous, and I have no doubt at allat that time very sincere, references were made to your personal qualities and to the admirable manner in which you discharged your onerous duties as  President  of the Senate. Now, we are asked to believe that all of a sudden, almost overnight, as it were, all those admirable qualities have vacated you, that you have shed all your virtues. </para>

Now, we are asked to believe that all of a sudden, and without rhyme or reason, all your virtues have vacated you and in the chair of the Senate we now have not a man whom we admire but a man from whom all decency has fled. Why this sudden change? It came out only in the last few remarks of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna).</inline> I was hoping that he would not descend to such levels. I was hoping he would resist the pressure which undoubtedly has been placed upon him in that regard. The real reason is not to attack you at all ; you are completely exonerated. The real reason is that this chamber is being used as the vehicle for an attack upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole.</inline> I assure honorable senators opposite that so far as we are concerned <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> will get no favours but, in the name of common decency, he shall be allowed, within theforms, procedures and rules of the Senate, to speak here on behalf of the very considerable electorate which he represents here. No threats, no bullying, no intimidation on the part of the Opposition shall deter us from acting decently and in accordance with the best procedures of our British tradition. </para>

                        to call the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition knows, as well as I do, that Standing Order 65 provides that a Minister may, at any time, submit a motion. In other words, the business of the Government must be in the hands of the Government. The Opposition should well remember this. It was the violation of that standing order, and of the principle which it was designed to maintain, that led to the double dissolution. The Opposition at that time with a majority in the Senate, on many occasions contemptuously snatched the business out of the hands of the Government. It was because of that arrogant conduct, which was like the last straw breaking the camel's back, that the Government was forced to take the opportunity of dragging the Opposition before a. disgusted people, and the Government was returned to office with an enhanced majority.
                    </para><para>This standing order specifically provides that a Minister always receives the call when he rises. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has probably forgotten that the Government never abuses this standing order. It is availed of only for a particular reason. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice</inline> may laugh, but I defy him to name one occasion on which this standing order has been used other than to put an end to proceedings, as it was on that occasion in May last. Few members of the Opposition will be able to speak about it, because few of them were in the chamber. The Government is here to carry on business and not to make a joke or farce of the proceedings. It is better that the sittings of this Senate should terminate than that they should continue in a state of burlesque. The Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> may well remember that, on that occasion,  a very important bill was being given a " run around " by casual speakers from the Opposition side, who were just popping in and out of the House. I say, as Leader of the Senate, that it is decidedly better for this House not to sit than to have proceedings conducted in an atmosphere of farce and burlesque. On that occasion, if honorable senators opposite had been serious in debating the bill, the Minister would have been prepared to allow the debate to continue. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- That is so, but the .Minister did not want to have the proceedings of this chamber converted into a circus. The Government is reasonable, and is not in favour of curtailing debate, but we well recall that when Government parties were in opposition they received scant courtesy in this matter. So much for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> second point concerning applying the gag to terminate debate. I say again that the Minister in charge of that bill offered to allow7 the debate to continue, but instead of the Opposition treating the measure seriously they regarded it as a joke. The Government will not tolerate that attku.de, and will take similar action again if the proceedings of the Senate are treated in such a manner. On the other hand, the Government will always be "willing to give every opportunity for debate. </para>

                        in his fourth point, complained about the debate on the adjournment, and said that the incident to which he referred was the worst in his twelve years' experience. I suppose that it would probably be one of his most uncomfortable. But so far as behaviour is concerned,

                        and his Opposition colleagues took part in a most disgraceful episode in 1951. The bells of the Senate were ringing, summoning honorable members to attend for the purpose of considering legislation, and Opposition senators behaved like a lot of truant schoolboys - giggling, laughing and poking their heads around the doors to see whether or not a quorum of Government senators was present. In those days, we had a hare quorum. On account of sickness, or for some other reason, we did not have our twenty senators present. We numbered only 24 altogether at that time, whereas the Opposition numbered 36. As I have said, honorable senators opposite were like a lot of giggling schoolgirls or errant schoolboys, putting their heads round the various doors of the chamber and laughing at the discomfiture of the Government because there was no quorum. Of course, that did not prevent them from collecting their pay for that day. Yet, the Leader of the Opposition speaks about a complete sense of irresponsibility! If his memory needs prodding about the worst occasion of his experience in this Senate, I ask him to remember that very disgraceful day. The happenings on the evening of the 23rd May were most unfortunate, but, after all, they were brought on substantially by the Opposition itself.

                        <para>The  Speaker  for the time being, whoever he may be, is obliged constantly to make a decision upon the spur of the moment as to the precise character of expressions that fall in the heat of debate from one member or another. In a large class of these expressions, of course, the decision is obvious; the Rule is clear, the line of demarcation cannot he mistaken. But there must be, and there is, a large margin on which the right decision of the moment depends upon the character of what has preceded the remark. It does not depend on the mere sentence, the mere phrase taken in its isolation, but it depends upon the judgment  of the Chair as to the effect -which the expression may have on the general course of the debate. And I should say, on the general question, that it is the gravest and grossest abuse of the privileges of the House that we should be brought down, that the House should have to assemble, to defend the  Speaker  against a charge of having given a decision at such a moment and on such a class of question which happens to be distasteful to a certain section of the House. It is manifest if this is to be a precedent for our ordinary practice, that if every member of the House who can get a seconder is to ballot for a. day in order to discuss whether the  Speaker  was right or wrong upon some question which in the nature of the case is doubtful, you not only do your best to bring the authority of the Chair into discredit, but you are lowering the whole character of this assembly. For my own part I should make these observations, and I should vote as I am going to vote, even if I were of the opinion that the judgment of the  Speaker  on such an occasion and in such a case was one which after a week's quiet reflection is one which I should not have adopted myself. </para>

                        (Victoria) |~4.42]. - The motion of the Leader of the Opposition
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline>
                        should not be taken lightly. At the outset, perhaps we should consider the functions of the  President.  He is not only the Presiding Officer in this chamber, but also a link between the superior house of tUe Parliament of this nation and the Governor-General, who represents  Her  Majesty the Queen. Therefore, a motion of this nature must indicate the seriousness of the case to be made out, at least in the minds of those responsible for the motion. I endorse the remarks of my leader and I adopt the cases that he has submitted. There have been, admittedly only in recent weeks, instances of absolute bias in the performance of your duties as  President  of this chamber. The Leader of the Opposition has referred to an instance in which you gave the call to various speakers, although I myself had referred to you - I believe in a courteous manner - a. certain question. I had asked how it was that you called three honorable senators who spoke in support of the question before the Senate, and the retort that you made to me, sir, was that it ill became an honorable senator to ask such a question.

All I sought was information, and if the  President  had had a case, one would not have expected him to use the words that he in fact used. To my way of thinking, he has not yet answered the question. He has relied on words that one could rightly say were in extremely bad taste, and his action has permitted the state of affairs, abo,11 which I had asked, to continue in the Senate, so that there are three speakers in succession from the one side of the chamber. I believe that, in cases sued as this, the  President,  in order to be fair and to prevent a suspicion of bias entering peoples' minds, should call another  speaker  who, from past experience, would not be expected to speak along similar lines. </para>

It istrue, sir, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has said, that when the Fishing Industry Bill 1956- was before this chamber, you called. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.</inline><inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> records that fact. It was while he was on hisfeet to speak to the motion, " That the report be adopted ", that theAttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)'</inline> moved, " That the question be now put". If, in fact, you did not callSenator McKenna, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report isincorrect. I submit that in normal circumstances the Presiding Officer of thischamber, or of another place, would call the Leader of the Opposition, and wouldpermit him to continue his speech. 1 regret to say that, in my opinion, if there had not been collusion between the Government and the  President  in this instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> would have been allowed to continue his speech ; that is, if you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> had not been advised that the Minister intended to move the closure. On the occasion in question, there is no doubt in my mind who rose first. Of course, I am relying on my memory and, as we all know, the memory can sometimes lead one into trouble. But I am not at liberty to quote from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the present session. I remember remarking to one of my colleagues at the time that it was not even a photo finish. I arn reluctant to think that such collusion existed because, if the present system of government is to continue - and I believe that all of us desire its continuance - the Chair must be strictly impartial. </para><para>I revert now to the proceedings on the night of the 23rd May. In view of your fairness, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> during the time that you have occupied the chair prior to that time, the Opposition was prepared to think that it was human to err, but divine to forgive. But on that night, when the Senate was in committee, the <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman (Senator Reid)</inline> gave some extraordinary rulings. I now repeat to my personal friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton,</inline> what I said when I raised a point of order at she time that the statement by his colleague that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson's</inline> mind was in the gutter, or words to that effect, was offensive to me. Unfortunately, I I am not permitted to quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of his remarks. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- All I say is that it should have been done. No announcement was made. I remember the words of the Minister for the Navy very distinctly when he replied to a question- asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne.</inline> If he looks at <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> he willsee that he referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole's</inline> position in conjunction with seven others who were then in another place. I believe the position should be the same as it is in Victoria and elsewhere, that is that before anybody can be classified as the leader of a party there should be a certain number of members belonging to that party in either House of the Parliament. When the Minister for the Navy was reading from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> he was referring to the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> had seven col- leagues in another place. Since then a general election has been held and those sevencolleagues have disappeared from the political horizon. No announcement was made after the election until, I understand, some one asked a question of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> in another place. Because of those facts, T do not think there is much weight in the reply given by the Minister for the Navy. </para>

The Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> has, I think, sufficiently dealt with every matter that was raised by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna).</inline> However, I desire to make one or two remarks about the incident in which, apparently, I was concerned, and which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> has made a basis for part of his attack upon the  President.  It was during the later stages of the Fishing Industry Bill or the Whaling Industry Act Repeal Bill, T forget which one it was. We had been in committee, and the "guillotine" had been imposed. A motion was then moved, I think in relation to reporting progress. The moment that, the mover of that motion sat down I was up on my feet. I have never moved as quickly before in my life, and if I were to record my own impression of the occurrences at that stage T would say that I believe I was on my feet before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> despite what is recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> That is my own honest belief. Being a Minister, the  President  gave me the call linder Standing Order 65. which states that any motion connected with the conduct  of the business of the Senate maY be moved bv a Minister of the Crown at any time, without notice. </para>

                    <para>I can understand honorable senators of the Opposition objecting to the tactics - if they may be called that - of the Government in this matter. That is all very proper, and 1 am prepared to accept it. However, it is a mean and miserable business to transfer what should be an attack upon the Government to an attack upon the  President  in this chamber, who is doing no more than obeying the Standing Orders. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> had a great whine and wail because you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> called three speakers who happened to deliver speeches, one after the other, supporting, more or less, the same viewpoint. You called a  speaker  from the Government side of the Senate and he supported the Government's proposal. . You then called <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> from the Opposition side of the chamber. How could you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have knownwhat viewpoint <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> was going to put in regard to that bill? Do the Opposition senators <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> so far as to suggest that the  President  had communed with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> to find out what he was going  to say before he called him, and deliberately called three sneakers one after the other to support the bill ? </para>

                        <para>. - The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna J presented rather a pitiful spectacle this afternoon. I fear ;that, before very long, we shall have Senator Kennelly saying to Senator McKenna, " Look, brother, I have the feel of this business now; you can go home". This debate appears to have become an attack on certain actions that have been taken by the Government so far as 1 am concerned personally. I believe that many of the points of view that have been expressed were thought out after the events of last Thursday morning. Honorable senators on the Opposition side who support the Evatt Labour party have had to go through</inline><inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in their endeavour to make up a case. "What they really wanted to do was to bring into focus the happenings of the early hours of Thursday morning, but they had to go back through the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to buttress their case. I was in the chamber when the Fishing Industry Bill was under discussion in committee. Actually, we were making a farce of the proceedings. The report in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the proceedings at the committee stage of the bill shows that various honorable senators on the Opposition side had an enjoyable time making second-reading speeches.

                            <para>- My Communist friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> - or is he a " fellow traveller " ? - is interjecting again. If we trace <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt's</inline> career through we must admit that the facts prove conclusively that he has allowed communism to flourish in this country, in the unions and everywhere else. He first entered the New South Wales Parliament after standing against an endorsed Labour candidate. He was then removed from the Australian Labour party. Later he was re-admitted, and in 1941 he became Attorney-General in the Curtin Government.  His  first act on becoming Attorney-General was to release Ratliff and Thomas, two Communists, from internment. Very soon after that, he lifted the ban on the Communist party. </para>

                            <para>- I am trying to point out the facts. When we examine <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt's</inline> career a little further, we find that he established diplomatic relations with the Soviet. Then his brother became  president  of the Australian-Soviet Friendship League. We then follow his record as Minister for External Affairs, until <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> come to his latest activity, that of defending the Communists and the Communist point of view before the Petrov royal commission. </para>

                    <para>The facts show that all through his history he has encouraged communism. Now, we find him going one step further. He is now destroying the industrial groups which are the only effective means of fighting communism in the unions.  His  action in destroying the industrial groups has made it possible for those seeking offices in the various unions to stand on a Communist-Labour party unity ticket. Here, I should like to mention again what is happening in Victoria at the moment. In that State, there will be an election on the 6th June for positions in the Australian Railways Union. In that State we find that an avowed Communist, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr .</inline> J. J. Brown, a great f riend of the Evatt Labour party of Victoria, is standing on a unity ticket with the Evatt Labour party, and Evatt supporters, with the blessings of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt,</inline> are helping him in his election campaign. I remind honorable senators also of the fact that  a  short time ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> was passing' through Canberra and he was met by our friend. </para>

                                did a diabolical thing this afternoon when he suggested that the  President  was actuated by personal interests in granting certain amenities to me. That was a disgusting thing to bring forward. There is nothing worse than that.

                            <para>- The honorable senator would do so if he thought it was worth his while. As I mentioned earlier, it was diabolical of the Leader of the Opposition to make the suggestion he did.  1  emphasize that before the last general election I enjoyed all the amenities that I now have. That being so, how can the  President  be prompted by consideration of his own personal interests in granting to me what I am entitled to have in this place? I had these amenities before the last election, and at that time the  President  did not know whether my party would be holding the balance of power in the Senate. The  President  has not, in any way, approached me - nor would I expect him to do so - and nobody else has approached me as to how I will vote in the Senate. </para>

Senatorelect McManus and I will help all we can in the government of this country in  a  way that will bring credit to  it,  and I hope that the Labour party will do  all  that it can to help also. There is no substance in the arguments brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> and if he had any. decency, after his final suggestion aboutyourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> he would seek leave to withdraw the motion. </para>

                        <para>. -  I shall make a brief excursion into the debate, especially because I was the Minister in charge of the Fishing Industry Bill when ministerial conduct was complained about. In reply to the criticism of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> I hope to establish that that criticism has been only a pretext for bringing forward this motion. But before doing so, I wish to make the point, which has not previously been made in this debate, that one of the grounds upon which this attack has been made was your failure, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to notify the Senate of your decision to recognize one senator as the leader of a party. The short answer to that criticism is found on the inside cover of the weekly <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> first issued after the Senate met on the 15th February last following the election. The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report records the formal proceedings of the opening of the Parliament, and printed on the inside of the cover are the names of the  President,  the Leader of the Government, and the  Deputy  Leader of the Government in the Senate, the  Chairman  of Committees, the Leader of the Opposition and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, and finally, in that group of names appears the line - </para>

                        <para class="block">So that in the record of proceedings on i he first day on which the Senate met after the election is contained a statement showing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> as the Leader of the Anti-Communist Labour party. I completely fail to understand how, in those circumstances, the Leader of the Opposition, with any sense of responsibility, can make the allegation that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have been remiss in observing some courtesy to the Senate. This fact illustrates the point, made earlier in the debate, and which, no doubt, will be made again, that the attack is not upon you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and your impartiality, but is merely another symptom of the deep unrest that exists within the Australian Labour party itself. </para>
                        <para>I now refer briefly to the circumstances governing the incidents during the consideration of the Fishing Industry Bill, f ask honorable senators to cast their minds back to the second-reading debate on the bill, in which the Leader of the Opposition said fifteen honorable senators had taken part. The debate was free and untrammelled and there was <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> suggestion that the closure or the gag would be applied. My attitude was, " This is an important measure and the debate may be continued as long as any senator feels he has something to say on the bill That attitude was maintained until the following day. I ask honorable senators to recall the circumstances of the closing of the second-reading debate, ft is entirely true to say that <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> series of scurrilous attacks were made upon my colleague, the Minister for Trade <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> in which it was alleged that he did not call for tenders for the purchase of the assets  of the Australian Whaling Commission at Carnarvon. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> implied that the  chairman  of the Country party had come from Perth to Canberra to use his influence on the Government in connexion with the proposed sale. Be that as it may, my complaint is that those statements were made over the air, and as a matter of common sportmanship  and decency, T. expected that I should have been given an opportunity to answer them over the air. </para>
                        <para>Honorable senators may recall that such an opportunity was not provided. At the last minute I was a little troubled because I believed that, as a matter of decency the Opposition would give me an opportunity to reply to those statements while the Senate proceedings were being broadcast, but it had not the courtesy to do so. Consequently, at the last minute, I asked one of my supporters on the back bench to step into the breach so that I might not gratuitously give to the Opposition an hour and a half on -the air in which to repeat to listeners in Western Australia statements which were dishonorable and completely unjustifiable. What was I to do in those circumstance''? </para>
                        <para>Let me take the story a stage further. When the Senate met on the following morning, I wound up the debate, and I think I can say fairly that I answered effectively every argument and accusation advanced by the Opposition. I gave honorable senators opposite every opportunity to interject. Indeed, I stopped my speech to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> to interrupt and make his points. It, was a matter of great importance to me that the name of my colleague, the Minister for Trade, should be completely cleared in this matter. What was the result? I was subjected to a series of interjections and arguments and the atmosphere and spirit behind them plainly indicated that the Opposition was taking the attitude that if a Minister dared to reply to Opposition criticism, senators from that side would teach him a lesson. Let me tell honorable senators opposite that they will not teach me a lesson. When I have something to say, I shall say it, and nobody on either side of the chamber will call me down. Those were the circumstances at the winding-up of the debate. Honorable senators opposite thought they would make criticisms, while the proceedings were being broadcast, that would remain unanswered. I could not get on to the air. but I answered those criticisms the following day. Tt will bc a day to note when I allow myself  to be browbeaten for answering criticisms! Let. us have no misunderstanding about that. </para>
                        <para>The second-reading debate was wound up in the atmosphere T have indicated. Questions were asked and answers given across the table. I shall not repeat what  they were, but I suggest that there was an attitude on the part of honorable senators opposite of, " We will teach this lad who has taken us on ! " Let them deny that, if they want to play fair. They intended to give me the " run-round " at the committee stage. Do not let us walk away from the truth of that statement. I let them give me the " run-round " so far as my temperament would permit me to do so. I call honorable senators opposite to bear witness that I stood up in the Senate and said, " I shall answer any reasonable question in committee. I shall do the right thing ". There is no question about my being prepared to answer questions at the committee stage. I forget the exact terms I used, but they were something like, " If you are going to give me the ' run-round let me remind you of this:I have the best argument of all, and that is the numbers". There was no honorable senator who did not understand what I meant by that. </para>

                    <para>Now let me refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn.</inline> I bear the honorable senator no malice, because he was doing his job. I am certain he was doing what the party wanted him to do - to hold up the bill. I had the courage to reply to his arguments. When we began to discuss the definitions, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline> started to speak about fish eggs, and he said, "Remember, every fish egg is a potential fish ". </para>

                            <para>- There are others who wish to speak in this debate, and for that reason I propose to finish very shortly. I do not intend to recapitulate whatI said previously, except to repeat the point I made before the suspension of the sitting - that the action I took in bringing down the " guillotine " was taken because I had been provoked. I felt that an attempt was being made to intimidate me, in effect, and I think that justified my doing what I did. Having decided to bring down the " guillotine ", with the assistance of my ministerial colleagues, the task was done efficiently and effectively. The plain truth, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> is that you are bound by the rules of the Senate just as we are. You had no option but to act in the way that you did. I support your action in this matter to the uttermost. </para>

                    <para>I say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that the Leader of the Opposition must be thoroughly ashamed of himself for the manner in which he concluded his remarks on this matter. I put it to the Leader of the Opposition that his position is no different from mine. In this position he is called upon, no less than is a Minister, to show courage in the face of intimidation. We on this side of the chamber know the position. I shall be surprised, indeed, if the hearts of honorable senators opposite are in this motion. I shall be surprised if they are not being pushed into it. In those circumstances, the least that they might have done was to pay tribute to the work of the  President  since he has held his high office, instead of making the dastardly allegations that have been made against him. </para>

                    <para>I defended, in most parliamentary language, the statements attributed to my leader - that is,- the secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labour party and the secretary of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council. What I said was that we, in conformity with the Government's policy - and the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> must admit it - must have a look at our immigration policy. I asked was it right that we should bring thousands of immigrants to this country to live under the conditions under which some of them are living to-day. I pointed out in this chamber that there are as many as 40 Italians living in South Yarra in a home that was built to accommodate a man and his wife and three or four children ; that they have built domiciles in the yard, and that when the night shift comes home, the day shift gets up and goes to work and the night shift occupies the beds. </para>

                            <para>- Irrespective of what my friends opposite may say, that, is quite true. Furthermore, the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> has been interjecting and asking me to tell him about the unity ticket. Does the Minister know anything about the group ticket? If he does not I shall explain it to him and to honorable senators. The effect of the group ticket was that those who did not belong to a group could not stand for any executive position in any organization. Those who the groupers thought had a chance to win an official position in a trade union or in the Australian Labour party were not allowed to join a group because the groupers knew that if they allowed such persons to join a group the latter would win. And if they stood, they were classed as fellow-travellers or Corns. That is why to-day the great trade union movement and the Australian Labour party in the Commonwealth sphere have banned the groups organization. Let us have a look at the unity ticket. The Minister for the Navy has interjected, " What about the unity ticket?" <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> is in this chamber to-night supporting the Government on a unity ticket. Yet, before the last general election, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said she was too old or too decrepit to be a member of the Liberal party. She is still here supporting the Government. T ask honorable senators opposite to have a look at their own unity ticket, and I shall have a look at ours. </para>

                    <para>The position is that press propaganda and the propaganda of Government supporters in this Parliament claim that the great Australian Labour party is prepared to support Communist candidates in various organizations. Nothing could be further from the truth. Labour is the only party in Australia that has ever opposed any other " ism " with the exception of " British-ism ", under which it is our privilege to live. This is the only party that has always opposed Nazi-ism, fascism and communism; and I warn the people of Australia not to be misled into thinking that because they are supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> and the Government they are not supporting something that cropped up in Germany some fifteen or sixteen years ago and, as every one knows, is just as bad as capitalistic communism. Communism revealed its real self in England when the Communist delegates from Soviet Russia visited that country recently and said that if they lived in England they would bolong not to the Labour party but to the Conservative party. Of course they would, because they believe in capitalistic dictatorship. The Labour party believes in a democratic way of life, and people who support it arn willing to sacrifice their lives in order  tn  defend that way of life. </para>

Let us have a look at his form. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole's</inline> colleagues, headed by Senator-elect McManus and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ogden,</inline> the  president  of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labour party, gave <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> a dinnerafter the 1951 referendum and congratulated him on keeping Australia free for democracy. What would have been the position had the Labour party supported the anti-Communist bill? The Prime Minister did not want the antiCommunist bill introduced to become effective; it was only a bogy. My  deputy  leader said the other day that thelittle red rabbit had again been drawn from under the table. Goodness knows where the Prime Minister is going to get. the next one from. He may return galloping on a Communist pony. TheantiCommunist bill was intended to confuse the people of Australia; but when that fact was clearly pointed out to them by our present leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt,</inline> what happened? Senator-elect McManus and' <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ogden,</inline> the  president  of the Victorian branch of the Victorian Labour party, gave a dinner in the Hotel Windsor, Melbourne, and congratulated- <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> on the fine job he had done in defeating the fascist tactics of which the anti-Communist bill was typical. </para>

                            <para>- All 1 hope is that the Â£13,000 that is alleged to have been paid to the great Australian Labour party was not a reality. I venture to say that the party has no funds other than those provided by people whobelieve in it. This party wants nobody to be in it, unless he believes in it. It does not. want stooges ; it wants peoplewho believe in its platform. It is not a platform that was brought into being in 1.955, or 1956; it has existed since federation. The party has always had1 the same name, the great Australian Labour party. It has never found it necessary to change its name; but for  over 50 years it baa retained the same name and the same platform and I hope it will continue to retain them. Let me have a look at. the other side. </para>

                            <para>- I think the honorable senator must have got most of it. Before World War I., we had the Conservative party. While the war was on, the rats went over with Billy Hughes and we then had the Nationalist party. Then there was the "Win the War " party, then the Country party, then the Liberal party, and then the United Australia party. The party to which honorable senators belong has had all the names under the sun, with their party made up of rats and scabs mostly from this side of the chamber. We are glad to be rid of them because, as I have said, we believe in this party and we do not want anybody in it who does not believe in it. We do not want any one who does not believe in our platform to vote with us. But' the Opposition want3 every honorable senator in this chamber to remember that the Senate is conducted by our  President  on behalf of  Her  Majesty the Queen, and I say quite frankly that early last Thursday morning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President's</inline> ruling on the words uttered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> was wrong. May I digress for a moment to apologize for my voice, because I have influenza, perhaps through getting my feet wet. However, I ask how you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> would like  Her  Majesty the Queen, if she were listening to the debate here, to hear the words spoken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> to the effect that our minds are in the gutter, or to hear that her Opposition in this chamber was fostering communism in this country. I suggest that such a thing would never happen, because honorable senators on the Government side would not dare to utter words like that in  Her  Majesty's presence. However, they seem prepared to do almost anything when there are no such distinguished visitors, or when the debates are not being broadcast. </para>

                    <para>I suggest that the Opposition has proved that the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Sullivan</inline> in order to save his face, should not be carried. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> should have declared to this chamber that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> was to be considered the leader of an official party, and as he did not do so - and because of his rulings in this chamber - I say that he has no right to be our  President.  Whether he was right or wrong in not making that statement about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole, Mr. President</inline> has failed to act in an unbiased way to all honorable senators, and if honorable senators do the right thing as members of  Her  Majesty's Parliament, they will vote for the motion so ably moved by my leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.</inline></para>

However, after appearing on three or four occasions, the newspaper became bankrupt. T have never received a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Clarion</inline> which contained that article. In fact, I did not know the article was in the newspaper; I did not read the newspaper, and I had no idea of its contents. The whole point of this matter is that it occurred during a general election campaign, and the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Clarion</inline> said to me, " What about something for our newspaper? We want to get it out, and as you are the leader of the party, what about giving us something for the paper?" I said, " I have no time to do that, but you could work something out yourself, sign my name to it and put it in the newspaper ". </para>

Honorable senators heard the result to-night. For my part, I did not even know that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> ever went to any of these meetings or, indeed, anywhere else. The editor put them in under my name and that is my fault. I have to take the responsibility for it, because I told him to do it. However, as far as my eulogy of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> is concerned, I quite honestly tell the Senate that they were not my opinions. I did not write them, and I did not hear of them until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> took them to an honorable member in another place and raised the whole matter in that place. I heard these statements over the radio, and I can quite honestly say that that was the first time that 1 ever heard of them.

                        <para>.- lt would perhaps be of advantage to the Senate at this stage to recall the motion that is at present before us, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> has been pursuing the usual tactics of the Opposition. He has been talking about anything at all but the motion or the amendment before the Senate, because quite obviously the Opposition does not want to discuss either of those matters. 1 support very strongly the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'sullivan</inline> to the effect that honorable senators on the Government side, and in fact all honorable senators, have great confidence in the  President.  This afternoon, I was very sorry to hear the way <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> spoke, because we on this side of the chamber have always entertained a very high regard for the honorable senator as Leader of the Opposition in this place. Indeed, we have regarded him as the best behaved man in the Senate, just as ] regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> as the worst. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> as far as behaviour goes, wins in a canter. I never thought that I would sit in this chamber and hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> charge you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> with lacking the qualities necessary for the discharge of your duties. It was so unlike him that I am sure he was driven to do it. At any rate, I prefer to think that certain words from the Book of Genesis apply in this case, and that - </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not think there is any doubt about that. Now let us consider the grounds upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> motion was based. The first was that you, M*.  President,  did not stand up and state  to the Senate that you were recognizing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> as the leader of a party in this place. It is quite clear that this is not the only thing that you did not stand up and state. For example, you have never stood up and stated the privilege* that have been accorded to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.</inline> You have never stood up and said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has three offices in Australia - one in Hobart, one in Canberra, and one in Sydney. Yon have never stated that he has a secretary in Hobart, whom he brings to Canberra every week and, unlike other honorable senators who have a secretary-typist who has no travelling privileges, he has an assistant secretary whom he is able to bring at the Government's expense from Sydney to Canberra and send back again. None of those privileges was announced by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> in the Senate, and if you should have announced the privileges extended to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole,</inline> why should you not have announced the privileges extended to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna?</inline> What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. </para>
                    <para>The second point upon which the motion is based involves motions submitted and points of order raised in this chamber in the early hours of last Thursday morning. Whenever any honorable senator mentions something that the Opposition does not like, or whenever an honorable senator mentions the friend* of the Opposition with whom they are fighting elections on unity tickets; in fact, whenever anybody mentions Communists, the honorable senators of the Opposition get up and roar. Where did they learn that technique if not from those with whom they associate? If they are not Communist tactics, then I know nothing about communism. The Opposition will  do  anything to stop us from putting forward our viewpoint, and they adopted those same tactics last Thursday morning. The Opposition will do anything to stultify a debate. </para>
                    <para>This matter arose out of a statement attributed to J. V. Stout, an Evatt supporter in Victoria, to the effect that immigration to this country should be suspended. That is the position. 1 have here a copy of the press report which stated that a resolution of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council asked the Australian Council of Trades Unions to investigate the intake and placement of migrants and to ascertain their effect on living conditions of other workers, particularly in relation to housing and social advancement. The resolution added that, pending the inquiry, the Australian Council of Trades Unions should ask the Government to suspend immigration commitments. They wanted to stop immigration altogether. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> asked whether that was the policy of the Evatt Labour party. That was the whole purport of his remarks. The Opposition employed all sorts of devices to avoid answering that question. We saw the well-known tactics. Honorable senators tried to get away from the point. They raised points of order. They were prepared to do anything rather than discuss the point that was under discussion. </para>
                    <para>Let me remind honorable senators of the remarks that were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> this afternoon. They were very interesting. This was the voice of the new boy. because he has not been in this chamber very long. We have heard a lot of him during this session. I am wondering whether he is trying to get it all off his chest before the 30th June, when a fellow hatchet-man from Victoria will come into the Senate. It will be very interesting in this chamber after the 30th June. We shall watch the proceedings with much interest when one of these gentleman sits on one side and the other sits on the other side. They have been through the mill together, and what a mil1 it is! Then we shall see what's what! As T have said, perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> is getting as much as possible off his chest before the 30th June, arid then he will go  quietly. He would be very well advised to watch his step. To-day, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> said that the  President  was biased. He said that the  President  who now occupies the chair was one of the most biased presidents he had ever seen or heard. He merely showed his shining newness when he said that. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> had been in this chamber in 1950-51, and had experienced what we went through, he would know what it was to sit under a  president  who was biased. </para>

Brother - I know T should not use that word - when you have been here a little longer, and have had a little more experience of the Senate and read the records, you will realize what bias is. </para>

Because they went to the workshops in Victoria, and" when they started to preach the Communist doctrine some of the new Australians booed them out of the place. Of course, the Opposition objects to any references to its encouragement of communism in the trade unions, but all its objections cannot stop the people of Australia from seeing what is happening and watching it grow at every turn. </para>

I reject it with all the emphasis of which I am capable. It is unfair to submit such a motion. It is a display of petty spite on the part of those who engineered the Australian Labour party into submitting it. There are many honorable senators on the Opposition side who did not want to see the motion submitted. </para>

I have watched for signs of deterioration ever since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> left Tasmania to live in Sydney. One could expect a few signs of deterioration when he left Tasmania, but I must admit that I noticed none at the time. However, since he has been hobnobbing with the Yarra bank, he has gone downhill. 1 ask him to get away a little from the Yarra bank, and return to the standard he always upheld until he launched this unsavoury attack.  I  reject the motion, and  I  am confident that it will be rejected by every decent honorable senator. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the motion that is before the Chair, and I regret that this debate has followed the lines traversed this afternoon. It has been my privilege and pleasure to serve under four presidents in this Senate. During that time  I  have never known a debate of this character to take place before this, and  I  hope that T shall never participate in another one. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> was fairly correct this afternoon when he said that this debate was possibly unique iin the history of the Australian Parliament. T think it is. </para>

                    <para>What is the reason for this debate to-day? When we first enter the Senate we are presented with a copy of the Standing Orders setting out the proper conduct of honorable senators and  of the  President.  This debate is taking place because one of those Standing Orders denies to us the right to make  a  direct move in connexion with a vote that took place here in the early hours of Thursday morning. I suggest that after we adjourned on Thursday morning and thought over the events of that day in a calmer mood we all regretted what had taken place in this chamber.  I  feel that the  President  himself, upon calmer reflection, would feel that the debate that took place here and the decision given on that occasion were not in the best interests of what has always been looked upon as the supreme Parliament of the country. Parliament is something more than an ordinary meeting that might be held in the back bar of an hotel in the days that have gone. <inline font-style="italic">lt</inline> is something more than a meeting that might be held in some obscure room, just as it is something more than a meeting of a number of persons who have very little knowledge of the ordinary decencies of life. We have been elected as the representatives of the Australian people and we should conduct ourselves accordingly. We should obey the rules of the organization to which we belong. </para>
                    <para>This question arose as the result of a reference by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> to a press statement alleged to have been made by the  president  of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labour party and secretary of the Trades Hall Council, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stout.</inline> The question of immigration is not new. The question of whether immigration should he limited in Australia is not something peculiar to utterances by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stout.</inline> It has been canvassed far and wide. To-day reference was made to a remark passed by one honorable senator opposite who suggested that one honorable senator's mind moved in the gutter. I have before me a list of about 300 words and expressions which have been ruled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> in the other House of this Parliament to he unparliamentary and which he insists shall he withdrawn immediately they are uttered. One such expression is "gutter tactics", and another is "gutter practices'". Standing Order 418 says - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is a standing order under which this Parliament has been conducted since its inception. Has that rule been observed since the beginning of this debate this afternoon ? For the last three hours or so, honorable senators have, with impunity, hurled at one another remarks and epithets which, until the early hours of last Thursday, no honorable senator would ever have dreamed of being able to use without being asked to withdraw immediately. Where is this Senate getting to? What will be the use of these Standing Orders after to-day? Are they to be of any avail at all? Are they to be of avail any longer in this chamber ( Are they to continue to be the text-book for the future conduct of the business of the Senate? How are we to obliterate from the records of the Senate the decision of the  President,  last Thursday morning, given, I feel, on the spur of the moment and under the stress of emotion at the time, that an interjection was not disorderly? </para>

I think the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> spoke very truly this afternoon when he said he had the numbers.  Th  majority of this Senate is equally to blame with the  President  for the position in which we are at the moment and which will continue to exist for so long as it- is ruled that under Standing Order 418 a reflection upon an honorable senator is not disorderly. This position will obtain for so long as it is ruled that we can with impunity stand in our places and cast reflections upon an honorable leader in another place and accuse him of all sorts of disloyalty, whatever it might be, and of being a person who espouses a cause that could destroy democratic govern-: ment. So long as that position continues, how can this place be looked upon as an important part of our bi-cameral system of government? </para>

                        honorable senator has any other course of action open to him under the Standing Orders to remedy what was done here last Thursday. The only course open to us is a direct motion such as the one before us. It is the only way by which we can expunge from our records the ruling that was upheld by a majority in this chamber. But what has happened? The Attorney-General adopted a role in law that I have never known him # to adopt previously. I appreciate his forensic ability to plead a case, but to-day he did not adopt the attitude of learned counsel who appeals to the judgment of his learned brothers on the Bench. To-day, we saw him adopting the tactics usually used by those who appear in the lesser but still very important branches of our legal jurisdiction. He imagined that he had a jury before him this afternoon. He sought to confuse those jurors. He wanted to appeal to their prejudices. The merits of the case were actually pushed far into the background. But he wanted this jury  later  to-night, with those numbers of which

                        this afternoon, and they are far removed from the part he usually plays. I regret that a man of his ability who, in his heart, must know that this Senate cannot wry on while this ruling stands, should have adopted that attitude. It. would h"&lt;-n been better if he had applied his legal  knowledge to making some suggestions to the Senate to overcome the  difficulty  which has been created. He might  have  moved that the motion be withdrawn,

                    <para>Some honorable senators have spoken about conspiracies, but I am not concerned with them. I have seen some  honorable  senators quietly disappear from particularly important positions which they held in this chamber, unbeknown to the majority of honorable senators. They have been quietly debunked or demoted fr- n! 'he high and honorable positions in which the Senate had placed them  previously.  T have seen lesser senators also removed from positions of honour and trust in this House. However, though some refer to conspiracies, they are better left where they belong - somewhere forgotten. </para>
                    <para>Suggestion has been made abou' intolerance. Since I have been here I have sat under the control of four Presidents, and have heard rulings given not by one or two, but by four, with which I have not agreed. We should have liked to argue those rulings, but because the* were justified by the Standing Orders that was the end of the matter. I ask honorable senators to rectify the present position if possible. Let us devise some means of expunging from the records the ruling that has been given, as a result of which I will be able to rise and make all sortof charges against honorable senator* opposite, and they can do the same to mt in reply. Surely we are entitled to be protected, and to conduct the business of this Senate in a proper manner. </para>
                    <para>The honorable senator who has occupied the presidential chair for nearly three years past with dignity, and with whom we have been pleased to associateas one of our colleagues in this chamber, has made a mistake, assisted by Government senators. By so doing they hav*pulled him down from the high regard in which he was held among  honorable senators  until last Thursday morning. The onus is on the majority, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> has spoken, to remedy the position. I cannot suggest a way out at the moment other than the carrying of the motion. The amendment submitted confirms the ruling, and if it is agreed to I know that the ruling so confirmed will be regarded by Government senators in their hearts as entirely wrong, and one which should never have been allowed to be recorded. If Government senators have a solution, let them put it forward. The Opposition has no desire to see any man dragged down from his high position, and we are concerned that the business of this Senate should be conducted in a proper manner and in accordance with its high traditions. It is up to Government senators to rectify the matter ; otherwise I intend to vote for the motion. </para>

I have heard him pay you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. -President,</inline> the most fulsome compliments, but none of them was so complimentary as is this motion, and the futile arguments advanced by honorable senators opposite in support of it. Here is an important motion of no confidence in the  President,  one which is not lightly moved in any parliament. The Leader of the Opposition has had days in which to prepare his case in support of it. He is a very industrious man, and honorable senators can well appreciate that he will have dredged through <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for months past in an endeavour to find some substance to back up his motion. He will have overlooked nothing. He will have sought to find every small thing that could be used or twisted to suggest that you are partial in some way or other. In spite of all his efforts, he has been able to bring forward only those poor, puerile, feeble arguments which he placed before the Senate this afternoon, and for that reason this motion is one of the greatestcompliments the Leader of the Opposition could have paid you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline></para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>An examination of those arguments reveals their weakness. The first charge of the Leader of the Opposition is that he was not told until April last that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> was to be treated as the leader of a party in this chamber. The answer is simple. In October last, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> announced to the Senate that he was leader of the Anti-Communist </para>
                    <para class="block">Labour party. You, sir, accepted that announcement, the Senate has been a continuing Senate ever since, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole's</inline> name has been published in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> each week as the leader of the Anti-Communist Labour party. </para>
                    <para>The next charge of partiality is that you accorded <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> the rights of a leader of a party in this House. You would have been failing in your duty if you had not done so after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> had announced his leadership, and it had been accepted by the Senate. A third charge is that you called a Minister before you called the Leader of the Opposition. The Standing Orders lay down that you must call a Minister before you call the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition, who has now returned to the chamber, elaborated his attack on you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> by saying, " <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Sullivan</inline> jumped to his feet as if he was jetpropelled and put to you the motion, '  I  move that the question bc now put ', and you immediately put it ". And that is supposed to be an argument suggesting that you are a partial  president  ! If you had not done that, you would have breached the Standing Orders. Standing Orders 2S1 and 433 both provide that when any senator moves that the question be now put, you must immediately, without discussion and without debate, put that question to the Senate. You must do it immediately. </para>

We know, on both sides of the Senate, that all that is camouflage. We know that this motion has been moved in irritation, directed at you because, in this chamber last Wednesday evening, statements were made which annoyed and  upset the Labour party and which you did not insist should be withdrawn. I am going to concern myself with a particular statement, of which I have a quotation here, which you were asked to force a senator to withdraw, and in respect of which, because you did not force the senator to withdraw it, you are charged with being a partial  President.

I say this in relation to that statement, that if you had made the senator withdraw a statement such as that, you would have been stifling all opportunity for free debate in this Senate. The honorable senator said, " My apprehension is this". He said that he believed that to be so, and he has a right to believe it. That is one reason why you should not ask for it to be withdrawn; but over and above that reason, another reason why you should not ask for it to be withdrawn is that it is demonstrably true, and demonstrably a matter of proper political debate. There can be no question that since this schism was brought on by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt,</inline> quite deliberately, he has been making opportunities for the development of communism in the trade union movement. </para>

Did he or did he not, as a responsible member of the Labour government, remove that ban?

                    <para>Did <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt,</inline> as leader of the Labour party, at one stage before this schism, approach a man whom honorable senators opposite are always screaming about in this Senate - Santamaria.- and ask him to write a rural policy for the Labour party at the election then to come? If honorable senators opposite deny that, then let them deny it in terms and not in long sentences. If <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> did that, then why, after the schism he had brought on, did he direct all the forces he could marshal in the Labour party against the man he had previously approached? All of those things are pertinent to, and follow on, the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that this man had given opportunities for the growth of communism in the trade union movement. </para>
                    <para>What opportunities has he given? First, he made a deliberate and definite attack on those who were most active in fighting communism in the trade union movement and who, despite what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> may say, were not by any means all Catholics. He attacked most of those who had been leading the fight in the trade union movement against communism. Not only did he deny these people the right to band together against communism in the unions, but he also went further than that - many people sitting on the opposite side of the chamber know it to their secret discredit. He allowed, in many trade unions, the Labour party to run tickets, so that members of the Labour party and members of the Communist party, both known to each other, could stand for election as trade union officials on united tickets. There used to be a rule in the Labour party that no man could stand for election to a union position on the same, ticket as a Communist. Honorable senators opposite know that that used to be so. I do not know whether that rule has been repealed, but I do know that it has been completely and utterly disregarded.

Honorable senators opposite know that as well as we do; yet they sit there and help the Communists to get into union positions where they can disrupt the economy of the country. They will help them to do that while saying,  rightly,  in their individual capacities, that they are not Communists themselves. </para>

                    <para>One of the main points put forward by previous speakers has concerned your attitude towards <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole.</inline> I honestly feel that it will help you if you can see this matter from my point of view. It is significant that in another place before the last general elections there was a period of bitterness unparalleled in the history of this Parliament for recrimination, sectarianism and the imputation of motives. While that influence remained in another place the business of the Parliament seemed to drift with the result there was continual disagreement and bitterness. By the grace of the electors that influence was removed. Business in another place is now carried on with the ordinary parry and thrust of political debate. There is the usual hard-fighting and the clash of opinions that result in compromise, which is the essence of democracy. </para>
                    <para>The disease which previously existed in the other chamber has now broken out in the Senate. It is an intolerable disease, and one of the points that have been brought forward as the result of the? motion is that your actions, either <inline font-style="italic">b}</inline> accident or design, have enabled this particular influence to become established iii this Senate. I believe that had you taken what I consider to be the right action, you would have stamped out this influence like a cigarette butt. The position is thai a certain senator, who had been elected as a member of the Australian Labour party - and we heard reference <inline font-style="italic">mad,</inline> earlier this evening to the type of thing? he said in order to be elected - announced himself as a representative in this chamber of that excrescence on the body politic in another place. That was quite all right; he was a worthy representative here of that excrescence. Then, the matter was raided in another place about his recognition a-5 a leader with the status and privileges of a leader of a party in this chamber. It has always been recognized that, the Leader of  Her  Majesty's Government should be given a status and afforded facilities of which he is worthy. The same thing applies to the Leader of  Her  Majesty's Opposition. </para>
                    <para>Now, the argument has been put up in a snivelling way that this particular senator should have ' all the rights and privileges of a leader ; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> challenges the right of the Leader of the Opposition to have similar facilities. By way of an aside, I should like to say that the Parliament and the country are fortunate to have a man of the calibre, magnitude of mind and capacity of thought of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> to apply himself full-time to his duties as Leader of the Opposition in this chamber, and, I might say, at the expense of his health on many occasions. "We have indeed an excellent man in the <inline font-style="italic">person</inline> of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.</inline> Now, the argument is pui forward that another senator who announced himself as the representative of another party should be given the facilities of a leader. When his position <inline font-style="italic">was</inline> challenged in another place and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> was asked why this man was given the status of a leader and the privileges associated therewith, the excuse that was made was that the  President  of the Senate had recognized him as a leader. The question had never arisen in the Senate. This matter has been debated already, but it is a matter on which we are joining issue. It was subsequently that this particular senator announced that he was the leader of a party. </para>
                    <para>The position as 1 see it is that this influence has been encouraged. It was eradicated from another place; yet, we now see it taking root in this chamber with the help of decisions made by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> We believe those decisions have not been in the best interests of the conduct of the Senate. Whether we like it or not, the status and dignity of the Senate will diminish as long as that influence is encouraged and sponsored. </para>
                    <para>Last, Thursday morning I took some part in another occurrence that has been mentioned during this debate. That was the use of certain words by an honorable senator. I suggest that if you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> had been asked in accordance with the Standing Orders to direct the  Clerk  of the Senate to write down verbatim the words used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> the whole matter would have been in black and white before the Senate, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> could have explained his words or could have been asked to withdraw them. Thus the whole matter could have been cleared up, and we should have been able  to  decide whether words to the effect that an honorable senator's mind was in the gutter was an accents bie phrase for use in this Senate. However, yon, in your wisdom, decided otherwise, and that is one of the reasons why the Opposition has to-day launched a no-confidence motion against you. </para>
                    <para>In the second matter <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> w,is again the impish mischief-maker who introduced further trouble into the Senate. To-day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> had something to say about conspiracy. "Conspiracy" is another word which has recently been given a lot of publicity, and it is quite marvellous what, some people can do with words. Indeed, it is wonderful what has been done with the word conspiracy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> himself proved that conspiracy did take place when he was the Government Whip. Another honorable senator, a great soldier and a very highly respected gentleman who is now on the back benches, must also remember another conspiracy. Therefore, I suggest that it is not correct to say that Opposition senators are the only ones concerned with conspiracy. Indeed, there are conspiracies going on all the time. 1 remember when a most gracious lady, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Annabelle</inline> Rankin, held an honoured position in this chamber. A certain amount of conspiracy went on then, in which a little fellow from down south was concerned. To the great advantage of this Senate, this gracious lady was again placed in the position that she had previously held. </para>
                    <para>I believe that this impish SenatorWright - if it is not unparliamentary so to call him - does not come into the category of fifth-rate solicitors -that J referred to earlier. He is a man with a high level of intelligence, in fact his intelligence is on a level similar to that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna, Dr. Evatt,</inline> and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> But intelligence is on a level simmilar to such a great, active mind is now feeding this cancerous disease that has come to the Senate. As long as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> has an opportunity to stir up trouble and to agitate and inflame honorable sentaors, he will do so. That is, provided he is allowed to do so by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> I therefore believe that it was wrong for you not to insist upon the withdrawal of the words that he used. </para>
                    <para>In your actions on that occasion, you placed a mark upon the previously clean record of your impartiality and general conduct as the  President  of the Senate, Moreover, that occasion has commenced an era of bitterness which is new to this Senate. If an honorable senator takes exception to words spoken by another honorable senator and asks for a withdrawal, then, for the maintenance of the dignity of this chamber, the words should be withdrawn. After all, we must maintain a certain level of good conduct, because it is in the best interest" of the Senate and of the country. I hope that  the courtesy that has existed here in the past will continue into the future, and will not stop short because of this occurrence. </para>
                    <para>Another matter that I should like to mention is one of continuing irritation to the Opposition. After an honorable senator has sat on this side and has then violated many of the principles that we hold dear, he should no longer be considered one of us. To consider him one of us is a continuing irritation and insult to us. He should be in the corner like one of his school kids, or sitting on the Government side of the chamber. He himself admitted that he was the least intelligent man in the Senate, and I never heard so much honesty from any one. </para>

That was obvious to us all. but he did little to justify the motionnf the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna).</inline> That is an impish motion and, indeed, is probably the most impudent proposal that has ever been put before the Senate. It is to the effect that the Senate has no confidence in its  President.  When I recall that this motion comes after your occupancy of the office of  President  of some two or three years, and when I recall the international and interstate work that you have done, as well as your efforts to ennoble the office you occupy, I. am ashamed, indeed, that anybody with any sense of responsibility could give supporto such a contemptible motion. </para>

That is an insult to the occupant of the office of  President.  In addition, he did his best to tarnish the office itself. That is typical of his achievements in this chamber because, while he has occupied his office, he has displayed to us a degree of prostitution of the parliamentary vote unexampled and unsurpassed elsewhere in British parliamentary history. </para>

Indeed, it shows how the oil lamps have burnt over a seemingly technical presentation of what is a shabby motion, a contemptible motion dressed up in a garb which, to the undiscerning, would make it appear to wear a veneer of logic. The whole tiling is answered by the simple reflection that if one turns to the fly-leaf of

                        his pseudo-deputy, that rising figure, edging in behind him, he shoots out to take the lead even on a shabby motion such as this and loses all idea of the basis of fact on which his arguments should be built, because the fly-leaf of

                        you did it with the design that over the air should go a succession of five speeches in favour of the bill. But the candour of the Leader of the Opposition was not equal to admitting to those whom he addressed in that vein that, in substance and in truth,

                        when he rose to speak, in effect opposed the Broadcasting and Television Bill. Of course, that matters nothing to the Leader of the Opposition so long us it might seem to indicate the purpose that actuates the  President  in giving the call.

I should think that was a truism that would pass any decently seasoned politician. The Labour party has had to carry that incubus on its back for the last six or seven years. The people outside have shown at the last two general elections how they share the conviction that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt's</inline> association with communism disqualifies him from their confidence. Yet, when I make those few innocent remarks in this chamber, all this hubbub arises and, because the  President  allowed that as a parliamentary statement, partisanship is imputed, to him. </para>

                        <para>.- Would it be quite all right if. while I speak, I do not abuse anybody and do the unusual thing of conforming to the Standing Orders? This has been a most unusual debate, lt would seem that we have completely suspended Standing Orders right throughout the debate; and I do not think this has added to the dignity of the Senate or of the debate. I propose speaking in accordance with the rule laid down in Standing Order 419 which provides that every honorable senator shall speak relevantly to the question before the Chair. I rise in the hope - perhaps it is a vain one - that we might be able to recognize the problem that has been worrying me for some time. I refer to the way in which the Standing Orders have been administered. If we can draw some clarification for the future, even from some of the disgraceful speeches we have heard today, my hope may not yet be completely in vain. </para>

I think every honorable senator will agree that it is most unusual to see the Minister moving quickly. During the whole of the time I have known him, he has been, about the slowest man I have ever met. What intrigued me was that, after a few minutes, he said there was no need to move quickly because, under Standing Order 65, he had the right of call, being a Minister. I wish that someone who occupies the chair, whether it be you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> or your  deputy,  would clarify that point for the sake of the Senate, because I believe that there has been a misuse of Standing Order 65.

                    <para class="block">I quote that because this is the very question which triggered this whole matter some time ago. As a matter of fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> you followed the same procedure about eighteen months or two years ago, and I "was perturbed about it at the time. I believe that it is a very fair rule which provides for the calling of one <inline font-weight="bold">Senator from</inline> one side and one from the other. By that procedure the clash of debate is developed, and there is an evenness of discussion as the debate proceeds. This is lost when you suddenly drop Standing Order 405, and swing over to give two Ministers the call, as happened when I rose on a point of order. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> claimed that he was justified under Standing Order 65. </para>
                    <para>But this is the part T want to have clarified : It is logical and reasonable to suggest that the only time a Minister should get the call in that way - that is, to interrupt the normal process of debate under Standing Order 405  -  is to permit of the proper conduct of the business of the Senate. I appreciate that the rule must be there - for example, as in tha committee stage of a bill when several senators are particularly interested in a clause and are raising all sorts of problems, and the Minister halts the debate to answer the questions which have been asked up to that point. The Minister should always have the call in those circumstances, because he knows the best way to handle the subject, and give the most intelligent replies. </para>
                    <para>I can imagine that the Leader of the Government should be given priority in a case of national emergency, such as during a time of war or when special legislation is brought down by the Government for maintaining law and order in the country, but it is an abuse of the power suddenly to say, " "We are going to gag the debate, and we claim privilege under that rule". This it not the first time it has happened, and it may be that in doing this you have felt that you are interpreting the Standing Orders in a proper manner. I suggest that if you give it mature consideration, you would not make such a claim, and neither would any one of the Ministers. It is merely that the practice has grown up under this particular rule, and I believe it is a bad one. </para>

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner,</inline>
                        who became more heated than I had ever seen him before, misinterpreted the position when he decided first to threaten to apply the gag, and then proceeded to do it. After all, if, as he alleges, second-reading speeches were being made at the committee stage, and honorable senators on this side were abusing the committee procedure, it was not for the Minister to make a decision; it was for the Chair to do so. I am a great believer in holding a debate to order, and in the past few weeks that has been successfully done in this chamber.
                    </para>
                    <para>You will remember, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that I drew a distinction between what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "Wright</inline> had said and the opinions that had been expressed on what is unparliamentary language. I suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "Wright's</inline> two utterances went far beyond what had been permitted by previous presidents. You will recall that I pointed out, also, that it had been the practice - and rulings had been given by previous presidents to this effect - that whenever a senator felt aggrieved, it was the job of the  President  to rule that the expression used was unparliamentary, and to ask for it to be withdrawn. I think that is a very wise practice, and it should be followed by anybody who may occupy the chair in future. "When wc force a motion in the Senate as to whether language is unparliamentary, the' expression is added to the written list, or worse still, it is removed for all time from that list. "We have had examples of that, and now the hands of the Senate are tied because of the vote taken the other night. </para>
                    <para>However, I do not wish to traverse that ground again, but I should like some clarification of the reason for departing from Standing Order 405 and acting under Standing Order 65, merely for the application of the gag, which I believe is a misuse of the power. I believe that Standing Order 65 does not truly apply, because it applies to " the conduct of the business of the Senate". I believe you are drawing a long bow when you say that the phrase " conduct of the business of the Senate " allows the gag or " guillotine " to be applied, particularly at the desire of the Minister - and in this case by a Minister whose blood pressure was up. He misinterpreted the Standing Order and misapplied it, either deliberately or otherwise. </para>

                    <para>This has been a regrettable day for two reasons. The first is that the motion now before the Senate has been moved. It is  h  very serious motion because it challenges the authority of the Chair and asks the Senate to say that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have lost the confidence of this chamber. I cannot think of anything more serious that could happen here, because the  President  occupies the topmost position in the Senate. That being so. the occupant of the chair should be held  in  the highest regard by honorable senators generally. It is unfortunate that this motion, expressing lack of confidence in the  President,  should have come forward. It is the duty of the occupant of the chair to rule the chamber in a fair and impartial manner. We must recognize that, whilst we have rules for theconduct of debates in this chamber, it is always within the bounds of possibility for the  President,  being a human being, to make a decision with which we, quite honestly, may not see eye to eye. But he is the man who occupies- the position of  President,  and he is therefore given the right to adjudicate. Whether we agree or disagree with a decision, it is the  President  who gives the ruling. It is only in very extreme circumstances that such a motion as this should be brought before the Senate. </para>
                    <para>Despite what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> and other honorable senators have said, I am not convinced that the matter referred to by them " triggered off ", to adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee's</inline> expression, the moving of this motion. I believe that what happened in the early hours of Thursday morning last was really the crux of this motion. Those events were concerned with two matters, the first being a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson.</inline> Let us think this thing out calmly. A matter concerning immigration had been raised, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> stated that he wanted to bring the subject of immigration back to a real national focus, which I think was a very proper statement. He said that he did not want it to be relegated to an insignificant gutter, the trend along which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> 's mind was travelling. People jumped quickly to the conclusion that the suggestion, was that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson'.?</inline> mind was down in the gutter. Very often we use expressions which other people construe wrongly. I believe that that statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> could well be taken to mean that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> was in a rut. We often say that we get into a rut concerning this or that, and possibly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> statement could have meant, that. I do not believe that he meant his words to bp derogatory. </para>

That, I believe, set off the chain of events which has occupied this chamber for the whole of the day. </para>

                    <para>The second matter which gave rise to this discussion concerned <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> and his creation of opportunities for Com.munists to infiltrate the trade union movement. Once again, offence was taken by an honorable senator. Perhaps 1 should point out that, in respect of the first instance, objection was taken not by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> himself bus by another senator. In relation to the Statement concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt,</inline> objection was taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley,</inline> and again the  President  ruled on the matter. The  President,  in adjudicating on the question, had the right to ask, in his own mind, whether or not that statement was correct. I believe that sufficient evidence <inline font-style="italic">hai</inline> been given here to-night, together with the evidence that has been  published and statements that have been made from time to time, in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, to justify any  president  in saying, " No offence is given by that statement: it lias been published often. It has been stated freely. It is a public matter." As many honorable senators Iia ve pointed out to-night, it is in the minds of lots of people that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> has been associated with Communists and has taken a stand that has enabled communism to develop in the unions. "We heard in the House of Representatives, during the previous Parliament, accusations being made against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly,</inline> in conjunction with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt,</inline> and statements to the effect that they had gone along to unions and asked for Â£13,000 to fight the anti-Communist bill. "We heard talk about that sum being only chicken feed. Therefore, the  President  would be justified, in my belief, in deciding in his mind that that statement concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> was factual and had been stated publicly time and again, so that it had become a public matter and could not be offensive. </para>
                    <para>For those reasons, I believe that when we are dealing with this matter we want to give it mature consideration and be fair to the  President. </para>

In my six and a half years in this Parliament, this is the first time that I have seen such action taken. I do not, know of any previous occasion in the history of the Senate that a similar move has been made. </para>

When I launched this motion to-day, I realized that it would be met with digressions, distortions, abuse, and that kind of thing. I have not been disappointed. I say to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that I am surprised that, although your position in the chair to-day has been a difficult one, you have abdicated your authority upon this occasion by permitting honorable senators to say anything they liked. I put it to you, sir, that that is one additional count that would weaken the confidence of members of this Senate in you. There were occasions in the Senate to-day when certain honorable senators were screaming at each other, and it was impossible for me to hear what the main  speaker  was saying. </para>

                        <para>- The difficult -situation that has confronted you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> is one which, from time to time, the occupant of the chair must be prepared to face. It did not justify your abdicating your authority as you did to-day. That is the one major point that I wish to add to what I said when stating my case this afternoon. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>I now want to reply to some of the statements that have been made. I say  at  once that I directed this motion at you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> or perhaps I should say,  at  your actions. The motion was not directed, as some supporters of the Government seem to think, at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole.</inline> I say at once that, so far as I am concerned, he is the merest incident. This motion was not directed at him. I inform the Senate that, with what I believe to be the unanimous approval of honorable senators on this side, it was launched after consideration and discussion. In fact, I was pressed to go on with it on the last day of sitting, while I was. at the table waiting for the Senate proceedings to begin. Therefore, the suggestions that have been made to the contrary are utterly without foundation. </para>
                <para>Let me say a word about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator' Gorton.</inline> He completely misrepresented the position when he said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> had declared many months ago that he would not support the nomination  of  an Opposition senator for the presidency. The truth is that that was never said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> although his position in this chamber was brought into the light by a motion that was moved from this side. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> also said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> had announced his leadership of the Anti-Communist Labour party in October last. What he announced was, that he was the representative in this chamber of a party that he named. He made no claim to leadership. Still less when the new Parliament assembled did he make any claim at all. When the Leader of the Government in the Senate announced the Government team and when I announced  the  office-bearers of the Opposition, then was the time for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole,</inline> if he had a claim, to make an announcement regarding it, instead  of  presenting it to  the  President behind the back of the Senate. If it was done in that way it was  your  duty, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to acquaint this chamber that you had accorded such recognition to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole.</inline> Then, we would have known what consequences flowed from that recognition and how  the  whole matter originated. When the fact became known, that was the first thing that began to cause senators on this side of the House to question your judgment and your actions. </para>
                <para>That was followed by what happened during the debate on the Pishing Industry Bill. Three Ministers entered into the discussion of that matter during  the  day, the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan),</inline> the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> and  the  Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer).</inline> The Minister for National Development sought to justify it against the background of what happened in the Senate on that occasion.  His  was what I would term the emotional appeal. Honorable senators will recall that he waved his arms and raised his voice during the course of his utterance. He is perfectly entitled to do that, but it is usually an indication, with the honorable senator, that he is <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> weak ground. In this case he professed to be very indignant at the actions of the Opposition on that occasion. As he confessed himself, there was no trouble at all during the second-reading debate and then at the committee stage, far from the Minister being angry and upset, he was the leader of the mirth. [ just remind him of that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline> had developed the theme that there was a waste of potential fish in that fish eggs were used for caviare. I am informed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline> was quite serious. The Attorney-General had been talking about it for some days and was quite disturbed about it. Perhaps, with justification, the Minister for National Development thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline> was being completely facetious. He picked the matter up in that spirit, and I recall very well that he said, " And what happens if an egg loses its potential ? " That brought mirth not only from the Senate generally, but also from me., because I remember that one of my rare interjections was, " You get another egg". I mention those matters, because although they are minor, they do indicate, the real atmosphere in which the Minister, notwithstanding all the imagined wrath and sense of injury he displayed earlier to-day, "gagged" this debate. As a matter of fact, he led the mirth. Then he pretends, to-day, with an air of great virtue, that he was being given the " run-around ". </para>

                <para class="block">The Attorney-General asks the Senate tointerpret that as meaning that at anytime a Minister may do such a thing; but there are several qualifications to thatstanding order. In the first place, that rule must be considered in conjunction with Standing Order 422 which provide-that for such purpose a Minister may not interrupt an honorable senator who is speaking. Secondly, it is subject toStanding Order 405, which reads - </para>

                <para class="block">Thirdly, and above all, it is subject to theimportant practice, hardened into a rule, that the  President  will look alternately from side to side. Standing Order 65- is not simply an affirmative proposition to apply under all conditions. The fault we have charged against you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Presi</inline> dent, is that twice in succession, with complete knowledge of what was afoot, you not only did not look left and right, but you heard a voice from the left  audi gave  the call twice in succession to Ministers, who, with your full knowledge of what was afoot, could only have intended1  to  close the debate. The whole weight of the complaint of the Opposition is  thaT  you, as the referee, knew that the Leader  of  the Opposition was particularly anxious to get into that debate. You knew perfectly well he had two opportunities, one was on the motion for theadoption of the report and the other oÂ» the third reading of the bill. Anybody who was present in the chamber  on  thatoccasion does not need to have any argument addressed to him as to what happened  to  know that you participated with cbe Ministers in that closure. The speed and the whole concert with which the Ministers  and  you acted cannot be recreated now, but was completely evident at the time without a word being spoken, to anybody in the chamber. Anybody who was present needed no convincing  of your determination to keep the Opposition out of that debate. There is no doubt in the minds of members of the Opposition at all. </para>
                <para>The other incident is connected with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> and his preferment on the air to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly,</inline> who is the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. 1 think that on reflection, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> you will agree that while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> forms one-sixtieth part of this chamber and one-one-hundred-and-eighty-third part of the whole Parliament, he is entitled to a hearing; but you will hardly agree that he should be placed in the same position as the leader of one of three equal parties in this chamber. That is the basis upon which you, in effect, treated him. There are not three equal parties in this chamber. We operate mainly under the twoparty system and I suggest that whilst you are entitled to place <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> somewhere in the order of debate, I put it no higher than that he must come definitely behind the officers of the Opposition. He is not ahead of the Leader of the Opposition - and you have not offended there - but he is certainly not ahead of any officer of the Opposition and certainly, not ahead of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. I hope you, sir, will recognize the force of that proposition because the Opposition will not accept the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> is preferred at a preferred time to the officers of the Opposition of which there are 28 members in this chamber whereas <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> is the sole representative of his party. </para>
                <para>I refer again to what happened early on Thursday morning. I think everybody deplores the state to which the Senate was reduced on that occasion. The Opposition felt that it must take a stand and must make a protest if all the bitterness, slander and scandal that was unleashed in the House of Representatives last year was allowed free rein here. We feel that unquestionably it was given free rein last Thursday, because the attack was launched by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole;</inline> and we would be hypocrites if, feeling and believing that, we did not have the courage to stand up in this chamber and say it. We have said it. It has not been a pleasant task to undertake. Nobody on this side has relished the task or his participation in it. Whatever the outcome of the vote, I have the feeling that what has happened, on a long-term view, will be all for the good of the dignity of this Senate and the preservation of the dignity of the Chair. I do not desire to labour the matter further to-night. At this stage of the debate, I am grateful to honorable senators for the hearing they have given me on  this matter that proved very noisy and troublesome throughout the day. </para>
