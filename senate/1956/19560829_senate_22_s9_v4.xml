          <para>- by leave - lt is with very deep regret that 1 bring to the notice of the Senate the unfortunate death on 9th August of the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, the honorable A. G. Cameron. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron</inline> was one of the most widely-known members of the Parliament, and during his long and distinguished career in politics held seats in both the South Australian House of Assembly and the House of Representatives. Born al Happy Valley in South Australia 61 years ago, he was educated at the Nairne State School, which he left at an early age to work on his father's farm. He was elected to the South Australian Parliament in 1927, representing the electorate of Wooroora and remained a member of that Parliament until 1934. In that year he was elected as the member for Barker in the House of Representatives and held that seat until his death. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron</inline>was appointed to the Ministry in 1937 and held for various periods until 1940 the portfolios of Postmaster-General, Minister for Commerce and Minister for the Navy. He was the leader of the Country party in 1939-40, and a member of the War Cabinet and the Economic Cabinet in 1940. He was a returned soldier from World War I., in which he rose to the rank of regimental quartermaster sergeant, and he served as a major in the Intelligence Corps in World War II. He was a member of the Committee on Censorship in 1944, and of the Joint Committee on War Gratuity in 1944-45 and 1948-49. Perhaps, the climax of his political career occurred in 1950 when he was elected  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, and it was probably as  Speaker  that he was best known. A man of strong views, he invariably impressed those he met with the strength of his personality, and Parliament has, by his death, lost one of its staunchest supporters. Archie Cameron loved the turmoil and the hurly-burly of politics. He could give it and he could take it, and he never gloated in victory or moaned in defeat. A rugged and austere exterior covered a warm and generous heart.  His  memory will long be cherished with respect and affection by those who were privileged to know him. I move - </para>

          <para>. - I second the motion which the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> has proposed. I do so on behalf of all members of the Opposition. The Leader of the Government has detailed a most imposing record of service to the public on the part of the late  Speaker.  I do not propose to repeat it. 1 content myself with paying tribute to that record, although it is certainly worthy of elaboration. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron</inline> attained the very signal honour of Cabinet rank and of Speakership, honours which can be the lot of very few in the Australian community. I find it difficult to realize that only some months ago the late  Speaker  was provocatively stamping about this Parliament House in full mental and physical vigour. Then, we were saddened by seeing grievous illness take toll of his physical powers, while leaving completely unimpaired his mental and spiritual forces.  His  body has returned to the earth, but I like to think of his spirit as something out ot character - floating, not marching, on to a happy destiny in the next world. With his passing, very much vitality and colour has gone from this parliamentary scene. </para>

        <para>It is extraordinary how clearly the pattern of a man's life emerges to our vision when he has passed from us. It seems to me that we become absorbed in a man's daily acts, and that they cloud the wider vision of the man. That pattern of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron's</inline> life, in my view, falls into two broad categories corresponding to very strong characteristics of an extraordinary and colourful man. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron</inline> faced every task with tremendous earnestness. He was a man of very deep convictions, not lightly formed, and not easily discarded. He followed every conviction with high courage, wherever it led him, even though that course operated to his own persona) detriment. He sought for what he believed to be right and, in those circumstances, my view is that it is not very important whether he was right or wrong. He was one man who, in my opinion, was completely true to the mould in which he had been cast. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>second great characteristic was that he revelled, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'sullivan</inline> indicated a little while ago, in a situation where hefty blows were exchanged, and he preferred to be a participant in the exchange rather than a spectator. It is extraordinary how much conflict he succeeded in promoting, even from the reputed remoteness of the Speaker's Chair. It seems to me that he treated conflict as of the very essence of life and of living. He seemed to love it for its own sake, as projecting one of the tests of manhood. It was very easy to disagree with him, but it was impossible not to respect him for his manly qualities, his ready and incisive wit, for his apt allusions - biblical, literary, historical and the rest - and this second characteristic, this love of conflict, was, I think, the one that so often involved him in turmoil and criticism. It was typical of the man that only on the day prior to his death he visited the Commonwealth offices in Sydney and signed the necessary papers to summon honorable members for the current sitting of the House of Representatives. He went by car from his office to hospital and died early the following morning. It was a matter of duty to the last. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>private life was a model of austere and right living based on deep religious beliefs. I trust that he is now enjoying that peace which he so strenuously avoided on earth, and which is the reward of high aim and constant endeavour. I extend to members and supporters of the Government the sympathy of the Opposition in the loss of their controversial and colourful colleague. I also express again the sympathy of the Opposition with members of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron's</inline> family in the great sorrow they are suffering through his death. </para>
