                    <para>.- The programme of the Government, containing, as it does, twenty-four paragraphs, reminds me of a bill of fare which was presented to me at a hotel in Hong Kong; about two years ago, and which was about as heavily laden as any bill of fare I had! ever seen. It contained, if my memory serves me rightly, about the same number of items as are included in the GovernorGeneral&#39;s Speech. </para>

                        <para>- After carefully perusing the bill of fare, I found that it contained only two or three substantial courses, the rest being so much surplusage. So, in a measure, it is with the bill of fare which has been submitted for our consideration, because whilst it contains two or three  substantial items, and a couple of what I might call palate ticklers, the rest is so much padding. It contains one item, however, which ought to soothe that small band in Sydney that has become somewhat notorious, and is known in certain quarters as &#34; Sydney secessionists,&#34; who, if the press reports be correct, have had day-dreams and nightmares ever since the inauguration of the Commonwealth, and <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> assembling of the Federal Parliament in Melbourne. I had hoped, in common with many thousands of the citizens of this Commonwealth, that with the establishment of Federation, the creation of the Federal Parliament, and the removal of Inter-State barriers, much of the jealousy which had formerly existed would entirely disappear, and that there would be a sincere and honest desire, especially on the part of the daily newspapers of the various States, to create a genuine bond of friendship and a feeling of unity between the people of Australia. But, as things have eventuated, such has not been the case, and the sinners in that respect exist principally in the State of New South Wales. One would really think that the selection of the Capital Site for the Commonwealth - the place at which the Commonwealth Parliament is in future to assemble and deliberate, - was a matter that concerned only the State of New South Wales. According to the Constitution, the Federal Capital must be situated in New South Wales. The Constitution is in no way contravened so long as it is there situated. It rests entirely with the representatives of the people in this Parliament to decide what site shall be selected. It was agreed by the majority , of the members of this Parliament that Dalgety was the most suitable site. That site was offered to the Federation by the Government of New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- It was offered, if I remember rightly, by the New South Wales Government to the Federal Government for Federal purposes. But, after that site had been selected, certain wire-pullers - certain interested people, I believe - set to work to do al! they possibly could to prejudice the minds not only of the people of New South Wales, but of the other States, against the selected site, and to create a feeling of petty . provincialism and narrow-minded parochialism. I have followed carefully the speeches delivered on this question and the tenor of them has been essentially unpatriotic, unfederal, and anti-Australian. The chief sinner in that respect is the present Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers.</inline> What does he propose to do? He is proposing just now that a referendum should be taken as to whether the people approve or disapprove of Dalgety, and that unless that site secures as many votes as all the other sites put together, it shall be rejected. But, as I said a moment ago, it is not for New South Wales to approve or disapprove of the Capital Site. That is a matter of national concern. </para>

I do not agree with everything that it serves up each morning, but that does not warrant me in saying that it is not a powerful journal. But there have appeared from time to time in the Sydney newspapers - in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> particularly - articles with scare headings, such as &#34; Another Injustice to Sydney.&#34; These head-lines are almost as bi&#39;g as the hand that penned them, and they mostly relate to imaginary grievances of New South Wales. The cause of them is that the Seat of Government happens for the time being to be in Melbourne. </para>

On the 18th May last, there appeared in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> an article headed, &#34;The Federal Capital,&#34; from which I will make a few extracts. It said: - </para>

                </continue>
                <para>The Deakin Government has no intention, has never had any intention, will never have any. intention, unless it be forced bv party or by outside pressure, to arrive at an effective determination. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has always played with the question, and he will continue to play with it. It is so far no part of his programme for next session. It will never be a serious part of his programme for any session while political means can be adopted to prevent it. </para>
                <para class="block">Now, there is no member of this Parliament who has adopted any political means to prevent the Government of the day from dealing effectively with the Seat of Government question. I do not believe that any member of this Parliament has used any political influence, or any influence whatever, to prevent a practical result being arrived at. On the contrary, I feel certain that most members of Parliament desire to hasten the establishment of the Federal Capital, because .most of us are agreed that it would be a good thing to remove the Seat of Government from the large centres of population. To do so would be to foster a more Federal spirit, and a truly national sentiment, and to create opportunities for the promotion of national aspirations. The article went on to say - </para>
                <para>The Federal Parliament has developed into almost a Victorian institution. The influences of its environment are manifested in every de bate. The wire-pulling to secure purposes thai are advantageous to Victoria is not only constantly exercised, but is continually successful. Members from distant States living in Melbourne develop into mouthpieces of Melbourne opinions. </para>
                <para>On minor, questions, where Victorian interests are involved, a hearing can be obtained and a settlement effected, while the ventilation of a grievance from a distant State would be treated as an intolerable infliction. If a small factory in a Melbourne suburb is in trouble the House is hushed, while an eloquent Victorian pictures its insufferable wrongs. If a factory on the northwest coast of Australia attempted to ventilate its grievances, the Victorian benches would rock with laughter. </para>
                <para>A back-country town in New South Wales, the capital of Queensland, a district in Tasmania can make its representations a hundred times to the different Federal bureaux. It will receive a polite rejoinder - a stereotyped promise of consideration. A Melbourne suburb or a Victorian country town wants <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> post office or a Customs officer. ... It lays hold of its member, gets, a personal interview with the Minister, and has its request granted. This sort of thing goes  on  every&#34; day. </para>

The Federal Parliament had its choice of the buildings, and it selected the one in which we are assembled, but the amount expended by the Victorian people in connexion with the matter ought to be remembered. To make the Exhibition Building suitable as a place for the meeting of the Parliament cost the taxpayers of Victoria .&#163;41,760 5s. iod. In addition to that amount, at the initiation of Federation, many other conveniences, especially in the way of housing Federal officials and departments, were placed at the disposal of the Federal Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion South Australia is to be commended for having shouldered the burden of the Northern Territory for such a long period of time. It was refused by New . South Wales, and, in my judgment, South Australia adopted a magnanimous attitude in taking the responsibility of its occupation. The Commonwealth would never be worthy of the name if that portion of Australia were occupied by an unfriendly people. It is, as I have said, a lonesome land, and is within a few days&#39; steam of 750 millions of coloured people, including those of ambitious and audacious Japan and awakening China, and a restless and discontented India. Any man who can look lightly on the vastness and emptiness of the Northern Territory is no true Australian, or he fails to realize the dangers that confront us every day through that vast area of unoccupied territory. </para>

                    <para>Nearly 900,000 persons in Ireland are engaged in agriculture. Since the total population is not quite 4,400,000, and 2,500,000 are returned as &#34;not producing,&#34; it will be understood how large a proportion comes under the head of agriculture. Probably in no other part of the British Empire can be found a body of men who are paid at as low a rate as the agricultural labourer in Ireland. ... In Ireland, the average earnings in seven counties are less than 10s. a week, Mayo being lowest with 8s. gd., while in Sligo the average is Ss. nd., and in Roscommon 9s. id.  The  fact that Irish agricultural labourers - many of them with wives and families to support - can keep body and soul together on such a small income, without assistance, is one of the marvels of the time. ... In Ireland itself, out of every 1,000 of the population, there are 64 men and 63 women of 65 years of age and upwards, while in England and Wales the figures are 42 and 41 respectively. </para>

Where are the opportunities offering for able-bodied men to labour under reasonable conditions and for reasonable hours in Australia? Can any honorable senator who desires to flood Australia with the cheap labour of other lands, point to the avenues that are open? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie dealt yesterday with sweating in Tasmania.

                        <para>- Yes, it is claimed that the wages boards have a. tendency .to drive capital out of the country, as though the capitalists, most of whom are very fat men, had wings, and could fly hither and thither at their own sweet will. I have often asked what country they would migrate to, because there is a disposition 011 the part of the masses of every country to get that which is their due. The Royal Commission in Tasmania was brought about mainly because of the very sad circumstances in which a young girl over there came to her untimely end. She was in the employ of a draper who, I do not expect, is very seriously affected by Federation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> if I followed him rightly yesterday, said in an interjection to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, that the sweating in Tasmania was in a measure due to Federation. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that the honorable senator made that statement. In those institutions the waitresses work from&#39; seventy-nine to eighty-five hours a week, and get from 8s. to 15s., while the porters work eighty-four hours at from 17 s. 6d. to 20s. The Commission found that  flour  millers and gas stokers worked the year round, without Sundays or holidays, twelve hours a day, and that the wages paid to women and girls at knitting factories are too low to admit of even the barest existence. Having read carefully every line contained in their report, I assert that, bad as were the conditions in Great Britain when Tom Hood wrote the <inline font-style="italic">Song of the Shirt,</inline> it may be safely said that in Tasmania to-day some of the women using machines are threading the needles with the threads of their lives, because it is impossible for them to live any length of time under the sweating conditions which are recognised there. The Commission reported that the piece-workers at shirt factories have to toil excessive hours to keep body and soul together; that the- river steamer employes graft from fifty to eighty-four hours a week for from 15s. to 30s. ; and that the women employed in the Government clothing factories can only average from 10s. to us. a week. How long would a Labour Government remain in power if it paid such a pittance to those who make clothing for the use of Government servants? There would be a hue-and-cry raised from one end of the State to the other. However, because the Labour Party is not yet in a majority in Tasmania, those conditions continue. </para>

                        <para>- By whose instrumentality will it be done? These conditions have existed in Tasmania for a long period, but it was not until the advent of the Labour Party to its Parliament, in spite of almost insurmountable difficulties, that a Royal Commission was appointed, and the information I have quoted was elicited. Because of the wide publication of the startling conditions in regard to&#39; many of these trades no doubt measures will be introduced in the Tasmanian Parliament, if not- to eliminate, at any rate, to greatly minimize them. I do not know that the efforts will be altogether successful, because, whilst it is true that public opinion has been focussed upon the sweating conditions in the various States, there are other influences at work in order to prevent the working classes from getting fair remuneration for- their labour. </para>

                        <para>- In a measure the purchasers are to be sympathized with, because, whilst I am not one to encourage the buying of cheap articles, many folks who are in receipt of a beggarly wage, have either to do without that which they want or to purchase goods which have been made under sweating conditions. They must get the cheapest goods which it is possible to obtain. One would really think that the employers of the various States were in sympathy with the desire to see the workers fairly remunerated for their labour, but it is not so. </para>

There is no one, either here or outside, who has, by his individual effort or enterprise, become a wealthy man, but he has, by the united effort and industry of other folks, who have materially assisted him, and who sometimes have been mainly responsible for his success. I was mentioning the fact that influences were at work to prevent legislation from being introduced in the various States to bring about a discontinuance of the sweating conditions I have named. On Wednesday night, according to the daily .newspapers, there was a meeting of the Employers&#39; Federation in Melbourne. That body, I think, embraces, if not the whole, ;the principal employers of the States. At its recent meeting a gentleman named <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Aves</inline> was introduced, and after complimentary reference had been made in &#34; regard to his visit, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fairbairn,</inline> who is  president  of the federation, and represents Fawkner in another place, expressed himself in the following terms in regard to proposed remedial legislation affecting the working classes: - </para>

We can take it then that if there were no Labour <inline font-style="italic">Party</inline> in &#39;Parliament there would be no Wages Boards, and that sweating would be rampant in every State. I have now finished with Tasmania. Victoria is not altogether a &#34; working man&#39;s paradise.&#34; There is sweating in every direction here. It is notorious that the clerical workers of Victoria are aBout the worst sweated workers in Australia. In warehouses, drapery shops,, .financial institutions, and banks, men are expected to clothe themselves in fine raiment, to pay their way, and to live decently on a wage amounting in some cases to from 17s. 6d. to 30s. a week. Financial institutions are, it is said, to-day in more than favourable circumstances. They have had exceptionally good years, and in consequence they have, for some time past, been paying good dividends. One would naturally think that, in such circumstances, their employes would receive some consideration. </para>

As to banking, I met a man the other day, who said to me, &#34;I am tired of living a single life.&#34; I said, &#34; Why do you not go into the matrimonial market; there are over 60,000 more marriageable women in Victoria than there are marriageable men.&#34; He said, &#34; I should like to get married, but if I did I should lose my job.&#34; I replied, &#34; Then you will have to remain single; but why should you lose your job ?&#34; He said, &#34;The regulations of the financial institution in which I am employed lay it down that a man cannot get married unless he is .in receipt of at least <inline font-style="italic">&#163;200</inline> per annum. I am not getting anything like that. I have gone carefully into the matter, and find that if I secure promotion no quicker in the future than has been the case in the past, I shall be sixty-nine before I get ^200 per annum, and then I shall be too old to think of matrimony.&#34; The Labour Party are sometimes accused of being opposed to the marriage tie, but what about these financial institutions? If they were owned by the people, depend upon it the condition of those engaged in them would be very much better than it is to-day, and a man certainly would not have to wait until he arrived at nearly three score years and ten before he received <inline font-style="italic">&#163;200</inline> per annum for his labour. These evil conditions apply not only to banks, but to insurance offices. A writer, signing himself &#34;Humanity,&#34; wrote to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> with regard to clerks in insurance offices. He said- </para>

                    <para>I desire to direct public notice to the cruel manner in which the clerks in insurance offices in Melbourne are being sweated. These clerks have to be on duty at g o&#39;clock each morning, and for four or five days each week all the year round do not leave off work till 9 or 10 o&#39;clock at night, with a short interval for tea. Should any of your readers doubt this statement they can easily verify it by visiting Collins and Queen streets any night. They will find all the offices lit up, and the clerks at their tasks. Numbers are married, and for the sake of economy in house rent, live in distant suburbs, consequently they have to leave home by 8 o&#39;clock in the morning, and do not reach it again till near midnight, suffering from brain-fag caused by pouring over intricate calculations during the long day and night, his only desire being to creep wearily to bed. No relaxation, no time even for those home social intercourses which are the salt of life. Such an existence must, sooner or later, impair and undermine the most robust constitution. </para>
                    <para>It may be asked, &#34;Why do the clerks submit to such treatment?&#34; </para>

                    <para>It is because they are powerless. If one of their number, more venturesome than the rest, complains, he is met with the reply, &#34; If you are not satisfied, you have your remedy ; there are plenty I can get to take your place.&#34; The fact that these clerks have to work such long hours daily is conclusive evidence that the offices are greatly undermanned, this, notwithstanding the fact that there is quite an army of unemployed clerks whom it would be an act of  mercy  to employ. </para>

                        <para>- On the ground that it was not desired to disclose the private business of employers. The State Government was moved to establish a Wages Board in connexion with the starch industry, consisting of an equal number of employers and employes, with an independent  chairman.  There was a section in the Factories Act introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine,</inline> now member for Flinders in the House of Representatives, but formerly Premier of Victoria, providing that Wages Boards might fix a rate according to the highest wage paid by reputable employers. The starch trade Board met, and had before them all the reputable employers in the industry. But they could not find one who paid what was considered to be a &#34; reputable &#34; wage, notwithstanding that one of the principal manufacturers of starch is a representative in another place, in a very big way of business. The Board, not being able to come to a decision, and to fix a wage which in their opinion was a just and living wage, sent the case on to the Court. The Court sat. Evidence was taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hood. Some of it is very bad reading indeed from an industrial point of view. It is said that we want immigration to Australia - that we want more people here. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The same firm employed 75 females at an average wage of 13s.1d. Messrs. Parsons Bros, employed 16 males at an average of  &#163;1  9s.10&#189;d. per week of 50 hours. Messrs. Lewis and Whitty employed 8 adult males, averaging  &#163;2os.  5&#189;d. per week of 48 hours, but the average was much reduced when the salaries of highly paid experts were excluded from the calculation. One married man supplied the Court with a list of his household expenditure per week. Let me quote the details. Rent came to 5s. Honorable senators know what a palatial mansion can be got for that sum in Melbourne ! The amount paid to the baker was 3s. 6d. ; to the butcher, 5s. ; groceries, including tobacco, 12s. ; hospital box,1d. I may mention incidentally that, if the evidence be correct, it is almost compulsory for these employes to deposit something out of their wages every week in the hospital box, which is set aside for that purpose. There have been occasions when some of the employes have not had the wherewithal to place contributions in the box. and have borrowed small sums in order that they might not lose their job. </para>

                        <para>- The party to which I belong will endeavour to take the stiffening out of these people when they come along and ask for more duties, if the new protection is not recognised in connexion with the industry. The other household payments in the case I have mentioned were : firewood, 2s. 6d. ; vegetables, 2s. Milk there was none - it was a luxury which the employe could not afford. He had even to borrow a newspaper from his next-door neighbour, not being able to afford one of his own. I suppose that if all the people in the street had been employes at a starch factory, none of them would have been able to keep in touch with the times through the press. </para>

I say that there are no opportunities offering in Australia for artisans, and so far as my knowledge goes, there is no suitable employment in any one of the States that can be offered to immigrants, if we first of all provide employment for the people who are already here. There are in every one of the States armies of unemployed. At a meeting of the Trades Hall Council of Victoria on Friday night last, the following resolution condemning the action of the present Government in introducing contract labour to work on the cane-fields in Queensland, was carried unanimously. </para>

When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> was speaking of the efforts put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> and others, to get workmen in Australia to supply the cane-growers of Queensland with labour, he said that the Socialist Party in New South Wales had written to an Italian paper to say that the cane-fields of Australia were no place for Italians to work in. If I understood the honorable senator, he further said that the publication of that letter in the Italian newspapers was the chief reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> acting on behalf of the monopolistic institution, known as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, was unable to obtain labour in Italy.

                        <para>- I do not wish any member of the Senate to imagine that I or any other Labour man objects on the score of colour or nationality to the introduction of any man on earth, but we have the very strongest objection to the introduction of labour from other countries with a view to bringing down wages in Australia, and to making the existing conditions of labour in this country less bearable than they are to-day. Immigrants have been, I will say, lured to New South Wales. When in that State a short time ago, I got hold of a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times,</inline> in the columns of which appeared a short article describing interviews with three or four young fellows who had been introduced to that State by the New South Wales immigration agent. They said that they were told when in England that they would have no difficulty whatever in obtaining suitable employment as farm labourers in New South Wales. Believing that what they were told was absolutely true, they made the voyage to that State, and they further said that after making many tramps through various parts of New South Wales, the only employment offered them was farm work at10s. a week and keep. They also said that had they known that, before they left the provinces in which they resided in England, they would not have come to Australia, because in England they had been receiving from12s. to 14s. per week, and in addition were allowed to cultivate a certain area of land for their own use and benefit. </para>

                    <para>I have been in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, and in all cases I found that there was a shortage of labour certainly, but it is of boys, youths, and girls; as in this thrice-blessed country you cannot afford to pay the prices for men&#39;s labour unless it is &#34; improvers.&#34; As a stranger, I was quite unable to understand before I came here how labour required to fight every inch of the way to get a living wage, but, after a few months&#39; knock-around looking for an opening that is not here, I have come to the conclusion that Australia does not need help, but she has plenty of her own people to help first, without inducing poor and confiding strangers to her doors, where, if starvation does not meet them, it is merely a question of time before they are down to the submerged tenth, or, at least, they have to accept a pittance, and so keep the existing labouring people and artisans with their noses to the grindstone. </para>

                <para class="block">That is the experience of an immigrant, and it is the experience of many others. I have always believed in the future of Australia, and I dare say I am as patriotic as most men. Its population is not in keeping with its enormous area. In the course of years, with wise and judicious administration and just laws, the probabilities are that its population will be doubled, but that period will never arrive until the Government of the day recognise that the main causes of sweating, overwork and under-pay, are not traceable either to free-trade or protection, but wholly and solely to earth monopolization. The land question must be grappled with. The Labour Party propose to tax the big estates in order to break them up. They say that the unimproved land values tax is scientific and just. There are others who ask, &#34; Why tax land and no other form of property ?&#34; There is no analogy between land and any other form of property. Every other form of property is the creation of industry ; land is the creation of the Almighty, intended, not for the people of to-day, but for the people of all time. It is because we have been foolish in our day in parting with the people&#39;s heritage that we are suffering so acutely in Australia at present. </para>

                        <para>- It may be news to some honorable senators, but there are many who cannot see daylight in front of them. Probably it is because they will not. Efforts have been made in other States to settle people on the land, and to every effort there has been more than a ready response from landless people. Whenever land is made available there are, as a rule, nearly three times as many applicants as there are blocks available. It is an admitted truth that for every, man placed permanently on the land two others are provided with employment. It should, therefore, be our desire to consider the question of land taxation, not from the point of view of any State, but rather from a national stand-point. The Federal Parliament has power constitutionally to impose uniform land taxation throughout the various States, and the Labour Party will not be satisfied until it succeeds in that direction. We are told that our land tax will drive the poor farmers to destruction. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s party said so. The anti-Socialists said that the Labour Party&#39;s proposed land tax would ruin the poor farmers, and they said it not once, but every time they had an opportunity. We were told also that the land tax would cheapen land. So it will, but is there any virtue in dear land? The complaint in every one of the States is that land is too dear. If, then, the Labour Party&#39;s proposal will cheapen that land without affecting the fertility or productivity of the soil, so much the better for those who want land and for every, citizen of the States. In Victoria there is a sort of land tax which is contributed to, if my memory serves me rightly, by only about 889 persons. The amount of money realized is very small. I shall quote official figures in order that the public may have some idea of how the land-owners of this State have been advantaged by the expenditure of public money and public effort. In Victoria, we have about 56,000,000 acres of land. Of that area, about 26,000, 000 acres have been alienated. The amount of money the Government of the day received for that area was &#163;31,561,439. The value of that land today, with improvements, is &#163;222,598,941. Exempting the effort and enterprise of those who possess the land, it is worth today, without improvements, &#163;131,599,078, leaving a margin of community-created values of about &#163;100,000,000. What have the people of Victoria done to advance the price of that land ? First of all, they built railways, and for that purpose money, was borrowed. The State of Victoria borrowed for railway construction and rolling-stock &#163;41,398,037, and we have paid back in interest on that sum no less than &#163;44,877,000. That means that we have paid . &#163;3,478,963 more by way of interest than the total principal, and yet the principal remains unpaid. We have borrowed &#163;14,993,837 for public works, which has all gone to enhance the value of land, and on those loans we have paid in interest &#163;15, 01 7,000, and yet that principal remains unpaid. All that the land-owners have contributed by way of taxation to the State of Victoria is &#163;3,371,854. The least they can do is to pay the interest on the money borrowed to enrich them. That is the least, in fact, that they ought to do, and if it was done we should have a different tale to tell about land settlement and industrial conditions generally. I feel that this land question might be much more exhaustively treated, because it is one on which I feel very keenly and deeply. I believe it is the one paramount question that concerns not only Australia, but every country on God&#39;s earth. As, however, there will be time and opportunity for me to speak on that and other questions at a later period of the session, I shall say no more. In conclusion, I desire to thank honorable senators for the patience with which they have listened to my remarks, and to express the hope, in all sincerity and all earnestness, that this session will be fruitful of results, and that the legislation passed will be in the interests of the people, and make for the advancement and prosperity of theCommonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I must congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> upon the ability he has shown in the speech we have just heard. He must have taken great pains to get at the figures which he has quoted, and which, speaking as a whole, I have no doubt are perfectly correct. I am sure I speak for all honorable senators on this side when I say we as deeply deplore the conditions which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has portrayed as do honorable senators on the other side. It would be a sad day for Australia if those conditions were its normal conditions. I take it, however, that they are conditions that exist in every civilized country on the face of the earth. They have existed in America, Canada, and Europe, and I am sorry to say that in Italy and some of the other countries the honorable senator has referred to, they exist in a far more severe form than in Australia. I venture to assert, however, that throughout the civilized world there will not be found, speaking broadly, a happier, more contented, or better paid class of people than is to be found in Australia, although, as I have said, there are very many sad episodes in the labour conditions of Australia, and I am sure the honorable senator and his confreres are honestly trying their best to improve existing conditions. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt that my honorable friends are in earnest in trying to bring about a better state of affairs, but we on this side are equally as earnest as they are in desiring to improve the conditions of the people. I wish to make a short reference to the Imperial Conference. I take it that we, as Australians, are very proud that the people of the mother-land received our representatives as they did. From a commercial point of view, it is a good thing that the Prime Ministers of British self-governing Dependencies should meet together at intervals, and place their separate views and policies before the Imperial Government. I think, however, that the Conference should deal with matters of business rather than with matters of policy. I am pleased that the Prime Minister, with his charming personality and his great gift of language, met with a fine reception, but when I have made that statement I have come to the parting of the ways. I believe that with his lofty ideals, he imagined that the views which he so strongly held were in harmony with those of the people of Australia. But I hold that to a very great extent he misrepresented Australia. I have not yet learned that at the last general election here, the question of preference was a matter of such importance as he stated in the Conference. </para>

                        <para>- In a general sense, the question of preference was accepted by the whole of the people of New South Wales. Indeed, I may say that the freetrade section of its people hold far more practical views on the subject than does even the Prime Minister. We are what &#91; may call practical preferentialists. Where the Prime Minister made a great mistake was in asking the people of Great Britain for something definite.  He asked them to submit to a tax on their food. When they naturally asked, What are you going to give us in return&#34;&#34;? his answer was generalities and bubbles. He did not give a single practical illustration of what he proposed to give them.  His  experience ought to have enabled him to see that there cannot be a one-sided preference ; that if the mother country, which opens her ports to our goods, is to be asked to tax her people&#39;s food, it was only right and proper that he should have stated how the people of Australia would be prepared to reciprocate. Why did he not indicate the nature of the reciprocity? Simply because he dare not take that step. He knew only too well that any preference which he might venture to offer would be repudiated by the very party to whom he owes his position. To show that I am talking by the book, I shall read an extract. I presume I may safely conclude that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua,</inline> the  president  of the Manufacturers&#39; Association of Victoria, is a gentleman whose views on this question would be expressed under a sense of responsibility. Speaking at its annual meeting in Melbourne, he said - </para>

                    <para>If, owing to the cold reception given by the British Government to this question at the Conference now being held in London, preferential trade had been given its death-blow, they would regret the loss of their ideal, but they should not deceive themselves or anybody else on the subject. If, as their opponents said, preferential trade and protection were so incompatible that they could not exist together, then they were not preferential traders. If the proposal were now dead he did not think many of the inhabitants of Australia would pass sleepless nights in consequence of it. He would be very much surprised if they did. It was said of them that while they believed in preferential trade, they would raise a howl if any proposal were made to reduce duties. It was quite true they would howl, and to some purpose, because the present duties were a mockery of protection in many respects. Their position was that the Australian industries came before English or any other industries. </para>

                <para class="block">I take it that no other interpretation can be placed on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua&#39;s</inline> views than that no preference will be shown to Great Britain with regard to any reduction of existing duties, and therefore that the Prime Minister had gone a little too far in even his generalities, which implied nothing more than what would be done if preference were sanctioned by the Government at Home. I take it that the knowledge conveyed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua,</inline> who represents the party which keeps <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> in office, was that that gentleman was not in a position, and never intended,, to offer to the people of Great Britain, any preference that was worth calling a preference. I assume that where a preference is given, a sacrifice must be made in return. Although the Prime Minister was asking the people of Great Britain to make a very great sacrifice, yet he offered in return mere generalities or bubbles. I should have had a very poor opinion of the workers of Great Britain if they had consented for one moment to allow themselves to be taxed for the benefit of a people who were not prepared to make a sacrifice in return. The people of England know what a sad state of affairs existed there prior to the advent of the free-trade party to power. It is to the middle classes and the workers, I believe, that Great Britain owes her present great position. Those classes have always been the bulwark of her liberties, and I for one thank God that Great Britain has yet her great middle classes alongside the working classes, which, at any rate in these matters, dovetail and form the great backbone of the country. If. ever there was a verdict given by the people of a country, it was given by the people of Great Britain at the last general election in connexion with the free-trade policy. No victory, not even Gladstone&#39;s victory,&#39; was so great as that victory by the people. </para>

                        <para>- I do not understand the workers of this community if the honorable senator represents them here. They appear to have no affinity to, or sympathy with, the workers at Home in matters in which I should expect to find them united. The Prime Minister went to the old country, and practically allied himself with the old Tory Party, and yet when he returned, my honorable friends patted him on the back and said &#34; Well done.&#34; What sympathy did he show to the workers or the middle classes of England? I do not suggest that he has no sympathy, because I believe that he possesses a very kindly temperament, but in that case he showed no sympathy. Both yesterday and to-day much has been said regarding the Tariff. It has been pointed out that in Tasmania, Victoria, and other States, there is a great deal of sweating, and I think it was insinuated by one  speaker  that to a certain extent New South Wales was worse than the other States, because at one time she had a partially free-trade policy. I desire to show how Federation and its protectionist duties affect the different States. Prior to Federation, I said that the citizens of the smallest States would be far more seriously affected by its establishment than they imagined, and that with protection increased their difficulties would also be increased. The report of the Royal Commission in Tasmania discloses a sad state of affairs. I venture to say that with higher protective duties, Tasmania &#34;will be landed in an. even worse state of affairs. Federation had this effect, that by removing the barriers it gave free play to large manufacturers who had the most modern machinery for carrying on industries and producing goods at the lowest possible cost. They were thus enabled to exploit the States. T say deliberately that in the present condition of affairs a small manufacturer in Tasmania has no earthly show of success against the better equipped factories of Melbourne and Sydney. </para>

We may not allow a single imported article to come into Australia, but we shall have then exactly the same condition of affairs as prevails now. The great manufacturers of Melbourne and Sydney, with their modern machinery and thoroughly equipped factories, will be able to keep out the smaller manufacturers of the smaller States. The large manufacturer has certain charges to incur which make it a necessity that he should maintain a certain output under- all circumstances. A small manufacturer is not similarly situated. </para>

                        <para>- The history of manufactures show us that trade tends to centralize itself. That remark applies to England, France, Germany, and all manufacturing countries. In England the cotton mills are mostly in one district. Liverpool is the port through which nearly all the cotton from America comes into England. Over and over again an endeavour has been made to establish cotton mills at Liverpool. But not a single mill has succeeded. Manchester is the centre of that industry. Why is that the case ? The buyers have a good deal to do with it. Buyers from all parts of England go to Manchester to purchase what they require. They sample the goods of one manufacturer after another. It is convenient for them to be able to purchase in one district. Again, there are problems in connexion with manufacturing that make it impossible under present conditions for small manufacturers in the smaller States to compete. I should be very pleased indeed to find that I am wrong in my deductions. I should be glad to find that the manufacturers in the smaller States are able to succeed. No one would be more glad than I. But I do not think it will be so, and I believe that increased protection will make present conditions ten times worse. </para>

                        <para>- I take the Premier of Tasmania, who has explained the position of his State at conferences in Melbourne and Brisbane, as the best exponent of its finances. He states that since federation, Tasmania has suffered severely, and I venture to add to that that higher duties will simply place her in an even worse position. I am one of those who would favour the payment of a special grant to Tasmania in consideration of the sacrifices she has made, if that could fairly and equitably be done. </para>

Either she is prosperous or she is not. Personally I believe the State Treasurer. There may be an air of prosperity about Tasmania, but her finances have certainly been crippled. I venture to say that if duties are largely increased, the consequence will be that we shall soon have the people of the smaller States coming to the conclusion that they have been mistaken in their fiscal views. They will become, I will not say free-traders, but certainly ardent revenue Tariffists. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that it will happen, owing to the causes I have mentioned. It has always been a source of curiosity to me to observe that the workers of Australia have made enormous sacrifices for what I believe to be a delusion. It is a well-known fact that in Sydney since Federation the cost of living of a working man and his family has increased to the extent of at least 4s. In spite of labour legislation, much of which has been good and beneficial - I say so sincerely - the working classes of Australia to-day are, financially, no better off than they were prior to Federation. Why? Simply because the cost of living caused by higher duties has seriously affected the purchasing power of the sovereign. </para>

                        <para>- Well, I believe that if we had an official going round, and knocking at the door of every house in Australia every week - saying to a man with a wife and six children, &#34;I want 8s.  a  week out of your weekly wages to pay for the cost of Government &#34; - we should very soon have a different state of affairs. Direct taxation would be a source of infinite good to the country, but so long as human nature remains as it is, we shall find Treasurers putting in the plea that indirect taxation is safest and best, because it enables them to get money easily out of the pockets of the people. Now, I wish to make a remark in regard to the mail contract. I am pleased that the Government have tackled the matter with commendable promptitude, but at the same time I cannot help feeling that they have placed themselves in an awkward position. They have absolutely: proved their incapacity as business men. The contract let to the mail syndicate was the most absurd one, considering its importance, that was ever entertained by business men. </para>

I said from the first that a contract of that kind ought to be placed in the hands of people who were able to show that they had the means to carry it out, and that a bond of &#163;25,000, with &#163;2,500 in cash, was not sufficient for that purpose. </para>

I approved of the contract as I should approve of any contract which I considered to be in the interest of the Commonwealth, but to be sure that it would be carried out, I should have stipulated for a much heavier penalty than is even now sought to be imposed by the Government upon persons who are known to be able to carry out such a contract. </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to support, in every way I can, the views submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> on the question of defence. It is a most serious question, and should be dealt with practically. I agree with the  Hon.  W. M. Hughes, member for West Sydney in the House of Representatives, in the views he has expressed as to the desirability of compulsory military training for the youth of Australia. I think that all youths of a certain age in Australia should be compelled, for at least a couple of years, to undergo active military training, which would fit them in time of need to take an active part in the defence of the Commonwealth. I am very sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> took it upon himself, when in England, to state that he was authorized by the people of Australia to ask the British Government to agree to terminate the Naval Agreement, under which the Commonwealth pays a subsidy of ^200,000 a year to the Imperial Navy. I do not know where the honorable gentleman got his authority to say that. So far as I know, this Parliament was given no opportunity to debate the matter, and unless it was due to the inspiration of the high ideals by which he is sometimes moved, I am unable to understand how the honorable gentleman could have made such a statement as expressing the views of the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has given, no information on the matter to which I have referred. I wish to deal now with, the proposed transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth. I am afraid that, in expressing my views on this subject, I shall not be found in harmony with many honorable senators on the opposite side. In many respects I have no. doubt that the people of Australia would be glad to have the Northern Territory taken over by the Commonwealth, but the transfer should be made on equitable conditions. South Australia took over the responsibility of managing the Northern Territory not less than forty years ago. I take it that at the time those in charge of her affairs believed that the resources and&#39; possibilities of the Territory were such as to insure that the work of its development would be profitable to the State. The public men of South Australia, as we know by our experience of those who have represented that State in the Senate and1 in the House of Representatives, are not less capable than those of any other State. I assume that during the forty years that South Australia has had charge of the Northern Territory her statesmen (have made every practical endeavour to develop and populate that region. In all the circumstances, I see no equity in the agreement made by the Prime Minister with the Government of South Australia. If such a company as the British West India Company had taken over the Northern Territory, and had undertaken to develop it, and if, after forty years of effort they had to acknowledge absolute failure, and that they could see no probability of making their occupation of the Territory successful in the future, what should we think if, in bargaining for its transfer to the Commonwealth, the Company asked the people of Australia to reimburse them for all the expenses and charges they had Incurred in their unsuccessful efforts to develop it? It is most unjust that the Commonwealth should be asked to pay the &#163;3.500,000 expended by South Australia and take over an interest debt of &#163;130,000 or &#163;140,000 a year, in addition to being called upon to develop this country which, after forty, years, South Australia has been unable to develop. Why should we be asked to take over this country without a shred of knowledge as to how it is to be developed and populated? </para>

                        <para>- I am giving my views on the agreement entered into by the Prime Minister with the Government of. South Australia. I believe it to be inequitable and unjust. I admire the pluck of the people of South Australia in taking over that Territory with the responsibilities attached to its occupation, but it should not be forgotten that if, under their management, its occupation had proved a great success, they would have gained all the profit and kudos. It is only common-sense to suppose that they would not be permitted to hand it over to the Commonwealth if they had the slightest idea that they would be able to develop it themselves in their own interests or in those of the Commonwealth. Experience has shown that they have been unable to do so, and the terms of the agreement made by the Prime Minister placed the people of the Commonwealth in a most unfair position. It is probable that the Prime Minister, in consenting to such an agreement, did not absolutely commit himself to its terms, but expected that they would be fully debated by the Commonwealth Parliament. Still, I think he made a most serious mistake in entering into an agreement embracing such conditions, seeing that he could have no knowledge as to how the Territory should be developed, and that the experience of South Australia had been one of sad failure. I am unable to agree with the contention of those who argue that the transfer of the Territory from South Australia to the Commonwealth should be carried out as a measure of defence. The country may have possibilities of which I arn unaware, but at present I look upon it as a great wilderness, a buffer Territory, constituting an effective obstacle to the invasion of Australia by any of the peoples who&#39; have been referred to this afternoon. Does any sane -man believe that, without ships to carry their products away, and in view of the laws with respect to the immigration of aliens to Australia at present in force, there could be any considerable invasion of the Territory? If Japan or other Eastern nations desired to invade Australia they would find hundreds of places along our 10,000 miles of coast-line where they might land, with better chances of realizing their desire. At some future time it may be of advantage to the Commonwealth to have  a  railway connecting Port Darwin or some other port in the Northern Territory with the eastern coast, but the construction of such a railway before the development of the country would simply be a means of assisting those who might desire to invade it. From the point of view of the defence of the Commonwealth the construction of such a railway before the development of the Territory would be absolutely mischievous. </para>

                        <para>- It is part of the agreement for the transfer of the Territory that we should take over the existing railway, and inferentially that we should connect it. with the eastern States. Some honorable senators appear to associate it with the proposed transcontinental railway to Western Australia. If representatives of that State will take my advice they will let the Western Australian railway depend upon its own merits. That is their only chance to. get it constructed. If they associate its construction with some of the conditions involved in the transfer of the Northern Territory, it will be a very long time before they get it. Personally I believe that the Western Australian railway should be constructed. If the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill is brought forward again this session I shall probably vote for it ; but I doubt very much whether I shall be justified in doing so if it is associated in any manner with the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth under the conditions contained in the agreement which has been placed before us.

We view the peculiar statements made by the Victorian press as denoting that, in their opinion, the Capital question should be left for the future. They even go so far as to say that it will be plenty of time fifty years hence to consider the question of placing the Capital in New South Wales.

If that&#39; is not true, then let the people of Victoria put their views into action, and show us that they are in earnest. There are very few honorable senators who really thought that the selection of Dalgety was in any sense a reality. We know very well that it was simply put forward in order to hinder the selection of a site which the New South Wales people would like. </para>

The whole question? resolves itself into the fact that New South&#62; Wales entered into the &#39;Federal &#39;compact, for something. Its, people would not &#39;accept Federation without something in return, and they asked for the Federal Capital. </para>

                        <para>- The people simply, said, &#34; We shall not. go. into Federation, unless we get some equivalent in the shape of the Capital.&#34; The opposing forces said, they would not allow the Capital, to be at Sydney. It was, therefore, proposed that, the Capital should not be within 200 miles of Sydney, and eventually the limit was. fixed at 100 miles. I ask any reasonable person why New South Wales- made it a. condition that the Capital should, be fixed in that position. It was simply because they thought that if they had the Capital, it should be within easy distance of the main ports - Sydney and Newcastle. Only in that way could1 New South Wales . gain the advantages to be derived from the Capital being within its borders. That is the real crux of the question. Until the difficulty is settled, the people of .New South Wales will not reconcile themselves to the administrative actions of any Ministry, especially of one which, having representatives of New South Wales in it, should act according rathe spirit of the agreement, and not on lines that will be most prejudicial to the people of New South Wales as a whole. </para>

                    <para>. - I have not very much to say, and if I had I am not in a very fit condition to say it, but there are one or two points in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech that are worthy of consideration. To start with there is the allusion to the important institution that may, be now said to have been firmly established - I mean the Imperial Conference - at which, whatever our views of the present Prime Minister may be, we are  all  bound to admit that he distinguished himself in a most extraordinary manner, and presented Australia and Australian views in a way that must redound to the advantage of Australia and also help more firmly to cement that friendly feeling of kinship throughout the Empire which we all so much desire. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly, but that opportunity always exists. The question of all questions in the Prime Minister&#39;s mind, and in the forefront of the discussion - Imperial inter-commerce - was clearly indicated by him, and certainly, although no result of a directly positive character accrued, we must all admit that his masterly presentation of the case, and his own extraordinary personality, did an immensity during his stay in England to spread and strengthen that feeling in the old country. </para>

Of course, we are glad to know that any visitor to the old country from any part of this Empire, of which we are all so proud, and having any claim at all to distinction or representative character, is always received with the greatest courtesy and kindness, but the enthusiasm that our Prime Minister developed was not manifested in the case of any of the other delegates. That is no reflection upon them. It is a very high tribute to the ability and personal charm of our representative. </para>

Where such circumstances occur, the preferential trader or protectionist will say, &#34; Our own before any other part of the world, and in connexion with such items, preference to the members of our own Empire.&#34; That can easily be done, but to enter into details upon that issue would be extremely unwise. It would be wasting time, and could have no definite result, as we require to assure ourselves and to be assured that our kinsmen abroad are of opinion that, supposing it to be practicable, it is desirable that preference should be given. That is the first issue, and that absolutely and necessarily ignores details. It is quite possible that, after careful discussion of the matter, it might be decided that, if practicable, preference was desirable; and then, upon a descent to details, it might easily be discovered that, although desirable, it was not practicable. Honorable senators, therefore, will see that that presentation of the case emphasizes my assertion that details are not for the present time. The issue is the principle. </para>

                    <para>. - For the best part of a week I have been listening to the debate on the Address-in-Reply, both here and in another place. There is an old saying that &#34;in a multitude of counsellors there is wisdom &#34; ; but in this case I cannot find where the wisdom is. It means confusion, because every  speaker  I have heard has a scheme whereby the welfare of Australia can be assured. </para>

                <para class="block">This afternoon I heard here that I live in a land which previously I did not know existed. I have been in Australia for more than forty years, and wherever I have lived I have never known that things have been quite so bad as has been described. I do not doubt that such instances as the  speaker  mentioned do exist, but I take it that they are rare, and that there is not such a great number of them as we have been led to believe. Honorable senators on the other side have described the Opposition as Conservatives and anti-Socialists. We call, them Socialists, and therefore, we disagree with them. I do not wish to offend any honorable senators on that side, because they have as good a right to hold and express their opinion as I have. It has been stated that honorable senators on this side represent the employers; but that is not a fact. In one district I have lived for nearly thirty-five years. I have both worked for employers and employed men. That is a fair term of years in which to form an opinion. I am not afraid to go up to the district with any honorable senator, so that he may interview both my old&#39; employers and the persons who have been in my employ. I have always given satisfaction. I have paid the highest wages I possibly could, and tried in every way to promote the comfort of the men. When I go on a platform in the district no man, not even my strongest political opponent, can say one word against me. Honorable senators on the other side have stated only one side of the question. They have put the case in its very worst aspect. I admit candidly that people are not so well off as I should like them to be. I admit that in our social system there are many things which need to be altered ; but the only question is how they should be altered. I do not believe that any honorable senator, if he went to the Charters Towers district and traced my history for thirty-five years, would be able to cast a slur upon me, either as to when I was working for other men or when I was employing men. I know many more employers of that class there. We have been told by gentlemen associated&#39; with other parts of the State, and with honorable senators on the other side, that we are going to grind down the working men, to reduce their wages, and to do everything possible to injure them. That statement was made over a quarter of a century ago, but it has not yet been realized. We have had periods of depression in my district when we have not been able to find work for all the people. I am sorry to say that at the present time we have a period of depression ; but we do not hear any outcry about an attempt 4.0 reduce the men&#39;s wages. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with that point later on. During the last few months we have had a serious depression in our output of gold and quartz. We have had a like experience at various periods during the last thirty years. Owing to the present depression, a great number of men have gone on to the cane-fields in the North. We have had quoted to us letters which purport to have been written by a man looking for work in Australia. I do not hesitate to say that the writer of the letter did not live very far from a newspaper office. I do not say that that sort of thing has not also been done by men on our side. Unless a writer gives his name I take his&#39; communication to a newspaper with a grain of salt. Day after day in the press we see letters signed with <inline font-style="italic">nom de plumes,</inline> but persons who . live in the country know the . conditions a great deal better than &#176;da those writers. We have been told that Australia is in a very bad way, and that we need very strong protection indeed - in fact prohibitive protection. What then are honorable senators opposite going to do to raise the &#163;8,000,000 that we receive from Customs and Excise duties? It has been proposed, of course from their side of the Chamber, that we should impose a progressive land values tax. At the last Federal election every candidate on our side denounced that proposal, and we were returned on the distinct understanding that we should vote against its enactment. We pledged ourselves to that step, and we are here, I believe, to redeem the pledge. </para>

                        <para>-  That was done when the Constitution Bill was accepted. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator SAYERS.</inline> - I admit that, at that time, we did a great deal blindfolded, but our eyes have since been opened to a great extent, and I can assure the members of each House that there is a great amount of dissatisfaction expressed by the people of Queensland with the results of Federation. I was opposed to the * acceptance of the Commonwealth Bill, but still it was carried, and I loyally bowed to the will of the majority. I believe that, if certain portions of the State were polled to-morrow, instead of a majority, as there was in 1900, there would be a minority in favour of Federation. The same remark applies to the farmers in southern Queensland. Dissatisfaction with Federation is expressed in all the centres, even in the manufacturing centres. We have heard a great deal about sweating. I do not say that it does not exist. I am not in a position to deny the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> and I do not think that he would have made it unless he believed that it was correct. When I was in Brisbane I had occasion to look round and see- what was taking place in the way of manufactures. I visited a factory, and I found that, as regards sanitary conditions and accommodation, no man could wish for better treatment. When I asked the employers if they wanted higher protection, they said &#34; No.&#34; I know that they send goods as far south as Melbourne, and that they are employing as many hands as they possibly can, to conform with the Factories Act. If the factory were larger they could employ more hands. When I heard some of the questions put to me. I did not know what to answer. I said, &#34;We are told that if you had a higher Tariff you would be able to do more than you are doing.&#34; They replied, &#34; We are doing all we possibly can now, and we are quite satisfied with the Tariff.&#34; All the manufacturers in this great country do not want a. higher Tariff. In Tasmania there is a woollen mill which, I believe, is working up to its full capacity night and day, and is supplying blankets to Brisbane and Sydney. I do not know whether it is supplying any to Melbourne or not. The proprietors are quite satisfied with the existing conditions, and do not want an extra duty. They told <inline font-style="italic">me</inline> that they had as much work as they could do, and that if they had the means to extend the premises they could find still more work to do. That, I maintain, has been the experience in all the States. I  have met men who emigrated from Australia to the United States in order to better their condition. I know that from Charters Towers many hundreds have gone, and that a large number have returned. The other day I read a letter in which the writer said that, as soon as he had enough money to pay his passage, he would come back to Australia, because, with all its faults, it was, in his opinion, the best country under the sun. 1 do not like people to run down the country that has afforded them means to earn a good living. Personally, I have every reason to be grateful to Australia. I came here when I was a young man, and I have battled my way through. I know hundreds of others who have done the same. We are told that if we bring out immigrants to Australia there will be nothing for them to do. Well, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> we in Queensland have been endeavouring to satisfy the land hunger of the people. In that State only 4 per cent, of the land has been alienated. The rest of it is in the hands of the Government; and I am pleased to say we are now making strong efforts to induce people to settle. But really people expect too much in a new country. When I first came out to New South Wales, one would often seen a settler with his wife and his sons in a place where they had to drive forty miles to market with their produce. Since then we have opened  up the country by means of railways, and those people have become prosperous. Take the southern portions of Queensland. I remember that thirty-five years ago people whom I knew there lived under conditions of such discomfort that one pitied them. But today, owing to the developments which have taken place in the country, the people in those same districts are so happy and prosperous that I venture to say you could not find settlers better off in any part qf the world. They are not the people who go about preaching discontent, urging their neighbours not to be satisfied with anything, and maintaining that everything ought to be set right by legislation. We have had a great deal too much legislation. If the whole of the talking shops of Australia were shut up for five years I believe that the country would prosper just as well as it does under the present system. Very likely it would be better off. I want to know what good all this talk does? We have been here nearly a fortnight, and what have we to show for all the talk we have had ? If we have two or three inches of rain in Queensland* it does more good to the country than all the legislation that the one hundred and  eleven men sitting in Parliament House can&#62; pass. Owing to the seasons that we have had lately, I am pleased to say that Australia is more prosperous than she ever was before. Of course, in alt large cities you will find a good&#39;, deal of poverty and want of employment. It is especially so in Melbourne and Sydney. But if the States Governments will only try to put people on the land, as Queensland is doing, I&#39; think they will succeed in solving even* that problem. I saw a letter in a newspaper the other day from a man who had! been looking at land&#39; in the Roma district of Queensland. It is covered with prickly pear I admit, but it is good land. This man complained that the land available was thirty miles from a railway. But people cannot expect to have a railway at&#34; everybody&#39;s back-door in a country so vast: as Queensland, where there is a population of only half-a-million. But the whole country will be opened up eventually, and&#39; we have millions of acres of excellent land&#39; upon which people can settle. The only thing against the State that 1 represent is that it suffers from periodical droughts.. If Queensland had the climate that the southern parts of Australia enjoy our country would be one of the richest on the globe. I know people who came herein the sixties, when conditions were far harder) than they are to-day, and who1 now have excellent, comfortable homes and property of their own. But they are not the class of people who go round trying to disseminate strife, and doing all the evil they can. </para>

                        <para>- There are hundreds of them here -  Yarra-bankers.  In the sixties the Peak Downs copper mine brought out a great number of miners&#39;; under contract, paying them a wage that was fair and reasonable. At the present time many of those men are good citizens of the State of Queensland, owning (property, and with families grown up around1 them. I have never heard a word said1 against their being brought out under con- tract. I have talked to many of them; and have had some of them working for me. I am quite satisfied that by extending fair and reasonable treatment to people- we shall be able to get suitable immigrants. We certainly do need more population to occupy the vast territory which we have. Unless we encourage white people to come into Australia we shall be unable to keep out the coloured races. We have been told that it is necessary for us to take over the Northern Territory for the sake of the protection of Australia. Well, I know a little about the Northern Territory myself, and I know a great deal more about it from men who have been there, and who came back to Queensland by tramping across the country with their swags on their backs. The conclusion that I have come to is, that if we leave that country as it is, any army attempting to invade Australia by marching through it would die of thirst on the way. </para>

We have heard something about an agreement that has been arrived at as to the building of a railway. In Queensland we have built our own railways, and have asked no other State to help us. I think every other State should do the same. No State should ask the Federal Parliament to build lines to develop its territory. </para>

                        <para>- When this Parliament determined that the kanakas must go, it was only fair and reasonable to grant bounties to the sugar-growers. Unless something was done for the industry, it must have vanished after its labour had been taken away. Surely it was worth while for Australia to keep the sugar industry going. I do not say that bounties will be required for all time, but they were necessary until the industry obtained a firm foothold, and the growers became accustomed to the new system. Numbers of working men farmers cultivate sugar in Queensland. There are over 750 men in the Mackay district who ten or twelve years ago were working for wages, and who have since settled upon the land which they cultivate. It would be a very great hardship indeed if the people of Australia said to them, &#34; We wilt take away the bounty now that you have gone upon the land, and at the same time will not allow you to employ kanakas.&#34; I am prepared to support a bounty, on any industry that can be conducted in Australia at a profit - the bounty to cease by degrees. </para>

                        <para>- I think for myself, not for the honorable senator. Neither he nor any one else ever heard me say that I was a free-trader. I believe in a Tariff that will bring revenue to the country, and in <inline font-style="italic">bounties that will assist in</inline> developing industries, but I do not believe in putting on prohibitive duties for all time. I agree with very much that was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> who urged that the smaller States will suffer under an increased Tariff. I have not the slightest doubt that there will be a change in the sentiments of the people of the smaller States when they realize what the effect is. There is no country in the world where protective duties are higher than in America, but what have the working men of that country gained by high protection? It is an undoubted fact that the purchasing power of money in the United States is not equal to its purchasing power in Australia. A man earning &#163;4 10s. a week in America is not as well off as a man earning &#163;3 a week in Queensland. The reason is that the price of commodities has gone up as the Tariff has risen; and unless our conditions in Australia are going to be absolutely different from those which have prevailed in other parts of the world, our experience will be a repetition of what has happened elsewhere when a prohibitive Tariff has been imposed. We shall have a number of multi-millionaires- perhaps honorable senators opposite expect to be amongst them; I hope that they will be - and we shall have at the same time the deepest poverty. I do not suggest for a moment that there is any distress in Australia so bad as that in New York. But it certainly shows that the prosperity of a country is not increased by excessive duties. </para>

It has been stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> that, owing to the Federal Parliament being located in Melbourne, the people in the other States have been under no disadvantage. I maintain that we have been. If we go to make inquiries at the public offices about a post-office, we receive a letter which we forward to the persons interested. Then we communicate with the Department again, but it does nothing. Of course, I have seen this sort of thing in connexion with the States Governments, and we are getting a repetition of it down here. When the Treasurer, then Acting Prime Minister, was in Queensland, I interviewed him with reference to a matter of some importance to the people settled there. Some of them are trying to open up a cotton industry, and I asked the Treasurer if it was not possible, under the law, to allow those farmers to combine together to bring in a cotton gin, so that they might be able to test the value of their cotton. He gave me the usual gentlemanly reply, which I took for granted, and I left the papers with him. I subsequently got an answer from the Department, and I shall read some of the correspondence to show the difficulties under which we labour. This was the first answer - </para>

VI. (v.) for the purpose of freeing from duty a particular consignment of any article. Further, no evidence is tendered in support of the statement that cotton ginning machinery cannot be manufactured in the Commonwealth, and, in the absence of parliamentary authority, there is no power to comply with the request made by you that the particular cotton gins mentioned should be admitted free of duty. </para>
                <para>I maintain that had the proposal been one to start a new industry in Victoria or within 20 or 30 miles of Melbourne, the Government would have been waited upon by a large deputation. Fortunately for Ministers, they are not within easy reach of the people of whom I am speaking, as it would take them three weeks to get here from the north. If it had been a Victorian or a Melbourne matter, we should have had all the protectionist members of Victoria going in a bunch to wait on Ministers and saying - &#34; Unless you do this, we shall put you out.&#34; We in the North cannot do that. I propose now to read a letter I had in reply from the  chairman.  He is a man well known in Charters Towers. He was a mayor of the town at one time, and has been in business there for the last 35 years. I admit, of course, that he is acting in his own interest. I am not one of those who would say that one should do everything for the good of the people and nothing for himself. I admit that if the town progresses it will be to this gentleman&#39;s interest, and he will suffer if it does not. He is in this business for his own profit ; he is finding money and rations for these people who are to grow the cotton and if the venture is a failure, he will not be paid. He writes - </para>

We were told that what we desired could not be done. We were not told that there was no duty on cotton gins, and when we went to the Customs officials in Townsville, we could get no information. In what sort of a country do we live, and what kind of laws do we live under when the paid officials of the State are unable to give its citizens necessary information. Instead of assisting people to settle on the land, it is a case of tax, tax, tax. If honorable senators opposite had their way, a tax would Le imposed on machinery which would make it more difficult for people to settle on the lands in the country districts ; but not more difficult for them to settle around Melbourne. That would be all right. But we do not wish to establish huge cities like Melbourne and Sydney. We do not desire that people coming to Australia should remain in the capitals and seek for work from the authorities of the Trades Hall, or such people. We desire that the Government should help people to settle on country lands. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Findley</inline>puts the side which suits himself, as a lawyer does. I followed the honorable senator very closely, and I give him credit for putting a very good case before the Senate from his own point of view. If I represented the constituency which the honorable senator represents, I should try to put the best case possible forward in the interests of my constituents. But L suppose, that holding the opinions I do, I should have no chance to represent the honorable senator&#39;s constituency. I do not suggest that he made a single statement in which he does not thoroughly believe. I give him credit for honest intentions, though I could not agree with all that he said. I do not wish to suggest that any member of the Senate would, from improper motives, make any statement in which he did not believe, but it is possible that honorable senators may be prejudiced in their opinions. We know that different people view the same subject through different coloured spectacles. With regard to the naval subsidy or tribute I believe it should be continued. We pay the Imperial Government the paltry sum of is. pera head for keeping a fleet out here. Some honorable senators object that we have no say as to what shall be done with the vessels of that fleet in time of war, but if any member of the Senate held two shares in a syndicate or working party, whilst another person held one, he would not dream of allowing the man who held the single share to say what was to be done by the syndicate. The money we pay in the way of a naval subsidy is returned to the Commonwealth, because I suppose the expenditure of the fleet in Australia amounts to &#163;500,000 or &#163;750,000 per annum. If wc desire to be able to say where the fleet should go, we should pay a fair proportion of the cost of maintaining it. When we do that I shall be with those who demand that we should have some say in the matter. While we give comparatively so small a sum, we are not entitled to more than the expression of our opinion as advisors. </para>

                        <para>- We shall be creeping for a great deal longer yet. I should like 1.0 know where the money that will be required is to come from. So far as I know, only one scheme has been advocated, and I am pledged by my election speeches to oppose that scheme. If there is to be a land tax, every State should levy its own land tax. &#39; That would be a&#39; good thing, and if I were a member of a State Parliament tomorrow I should vote for it. But if the States once give the Federal Parliament the right to tax their lands, in a very short time &#39;we shall own them&#39;, and the States will have lost all control of them. I advise the people of the States at all hazards to keep the control of their lands out of the hands of the Federal Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. The honorable senator will find that it is not too late. Parliament can do nothing that cannot be annulled, and if the people are pushed too far they will annul our action. They have the remedy in their own hands. We are here in this Parliament ; but we do not know that we shall be here in the next. The people always retain the power of making and unmaking Parliament, and if we do not properly represent their desires, they will put us out. I wish to say a few words in connexion with the conduct of the last Federal elections. I have heard it said this afternoon that the Parliament of South Australia has just elected a member of the Senate. That is their business, not mine. </para>

                        <para>- I am not saying anything against  lune  gentleman. I do not know him, and I do not wish to hurt his or any man&#39;s feelings. What I was about to say was that the way in which the last Federal elections were conducted in Queensland was one of the most disgraceful exhibitions that any man who has had anything to do with elections could imagine. I am not going to speak of what happened in other States, because I was not there. As to what happened in the principal portion of Brisbane, I can prove every word I say by affidavits. I myself saw people turned away wholesale. They were not allowed to record their votes even though they were on the rolls. I know that sixty-seven men, and women, too, went to another place, over half-a-mile away from the polling booth, after being told at the polling booth that they were not on the roll, and sixty-three of them, got their numbers as being on the roll, and went back and demanded and got their ballot-papers. I do not know whom they voted for. I know of my own knowledge that there were dozens and dozens, and possibly hundreds, of people turned away. I asked some of them to do as those sixty-seven men did, but they, said, &#34;No; if we are not on&#34; the roll it is no use bothering.&#34; I believe that both sides suffered equally. I do not want to see that sort of thing happen again. I am very pleased to see that notice has been given of an amendment of the Act in the other House. I hope it will reach us later on. I have had over thirty years&#39; experience of the conduct of elections. I was returning officer for- several State elections, and for the first election for the Federal Parliament. I was also one of the returning officers when the referen dum was  taken,  and honestly and truly I believe that the last Federal election was conducted on very poor lines indeed. We were starved. When I wa.s returning officer I was always in hot water with the Government over my returns of expenses, because I always paid well and fed well those who were working for me for the day, and I used to have about a dozen. I simply did the same with the Government&#39;s  money as I would have done with my own, and at elections I always paid those working for me as much as I was able to. Those working at the last Federal election were not adequately paid. The expenditure was reduced by over one-third, and men had to work sixteen hours a day. I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> do not believe in overtime without payment. Neither do I, and I think we should see that those men are not asked to do two days&#39; work for one day&#39;s pay. </para>

I am sure honorable senators on the opposite side of the Chamber do not desire to do anything which they &#60;lo not think right. Some of them seem to think that we on this side are unanimous in our antagonism to them. We are not. If those honorable senators can prove to me that any measure they bring in is for the good of the people as a whole, I shall be prepared to support it. I do not mean a socialistic measure, for the benefit of one class. I am against class legislation tooth and nail, and if they bring in that sort of measure I shall vote against it. </para>

                        <para>- I am solid on any bounty to any industry that needs it. So far I have not said a word in the interests of the people in the town where I live. They are all miners. It is a town of 24,000 or 25,000 people, and they all exist on the mining industry. They are all right so long as they are let alone and are not harassed with too high a&#39; Tariff. The men S61 <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> a week, but what position will they be in if the cost of living is doubled to them? They will not get any more money from the mines, because if the wages were increased the mines would have to shut down. If the cost of living is increased, they will get the same wages nominally, but they will not be able to purchase the same quantity of articles. The people there are in a very peculiar position. Any man can go there and take up a piece of land, and not a soul in the world would say a word to him. </para>

                        <para>- Charters Towers, North Queensland. I have known men to start there as dairymen with twenty head of cows, and before the drought I have known them to run 2,000 head of cattle on the fields there and not pay a shilling for it. They take up a 40-acre homestead, for which they pay is. an acre. It is apparently imagined that on that 40 acres a man can keep 2,000 head of cattle, but there are I do not know how many miles of commonage which they use, and nobody interferes. Those who know of it simply wink the other eye. The great majority of the people in the town - the married ones - have their little homes. They take up a quarter of an acre of land, either under miner&#39;s right or by paying 5s. per year, and that entitles them to occupy it and regard it as their own. They have built their homes on these blocks, and all their savings are invested there. The reason why they changed their political opinions was that they did not want the mines to shut down, because they knew that if that happened they would have to go away, leaving their homes and savings behind them. That is one of the reasons why I hope that when an amendment of the Tariff is brought in the matter will be finally settled, so that the people will know where they are. A few years ago, at Mount Morgan, those who had settled there in the same way had to go away, leaving their homes and the savings of eight or ten years behind them, and not getting a shilling in return for them. Wherever you find people with their own homes on their own blocks of land you will find those people voting and acting right. That is one of the reasons why I want to see people settled on the land. Where people are not settled on the land you will always find that they are a dissatisfied class. In Queensland, we are trying to get people settled with homes of their own, and I believe we shall succeed. I know that some honorable senators have been up our way, because I met them, and also some of the members of the other House, when I was  Chairman  of the Water Board, and took them down to Burdekin to show them our water scheme. I believe that the leader of the Labour Party in this Chamber was there, and I do not think he can say that I did not do my best to treat them handsomely. The people up there wish to get fair play, and I hope they will get it, although they are so far -from Melbourne. The same thing applied iri Queensland before Federation. A man in </para>

                <para class="block">Brisbane could get a grievance remedied, whereas a man in Cooktown could not. So under Federation, Melbourne has the advantage of being the Seat of Government, and the people of Melbourne can easily bring pressure to bear upon Ministers, who would smile at a leading article in the papers of Northern Queensland. Ministers do not even see it unless somebody sends them a marked copy, but they see the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> every morning, and they are worried by deputations from all classes of people to do something in the interests of Victoria. Of course, the people of Victoria are quite right, and I do not find fault with them for one moment for protecting their interests, but I want some fair play for us in the North. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> asserted in this Chamber on Friday last that the Federal Government were the first to do anything to bring back Australians who were stranded in a distant land. I give the Federal Government every  credit for what they did, but honorable senators will all remember what happened a good many years ago, when a number of visionaries who believed in Communism were induced to sell their property and put their whole savings into a scheme for a communistic colony in Paraguay. I did .my best to dissuade some of them from going, and they were very sorry afterwards that they had not taken my advice. They went to Paraguay in the <inline font-style="italic">Royal Tar,</inline> and were stranded there. Their visionary schemes of Socialism were all knocked on the head. They found they had bosses over them worse than any bosses they ever had in Queensland, and that the state of society that existed there was worse than the one they had lived under in Australia. One man I know well had to leave his wife and family, there, and work his passage to London as a coal heaver in a tramp steamer. From London, he worked his passage to Australia, and found friends who helped him to bring his wife and family back. A lot of others, however, were stranded in South America, but the Government of Queensland did their duty towards them, and, although they had left Queensland cursing it, they were very glad indeed to be brought back. I was pleased personally to see the Queensland Government take that action. It was not a Socialist Government or a Labour Government. It was the old continuous Government in Queensland - the most Conservative we ever had. Honorable senators will, therefore, see that there are some bowels of compassion in other gentlemen than those who occupy the Treasury Bench. </para>

I want to show that it was not the first occasion on which \ Government in Australia took that step. Perhaps in South Australia it may not have been done, but on the eastern seaboard it has been done, and I hope that if ever the necessity should recur it will be done again. </para>

                        <para>- According to the Governor-General&#39;s Speech the mail contract to Europe has been cancelled. I do not think that it was cancelled a day too soon; I consider that it was done six months too late. Speaking as a North Queenslander, I can say that in none of the tenders which have been called for the carriage of mails have the Government done us fair justice. We only ask for fair justice at their hands. I trust that the Government will lay upon the table all the papers in connexion with the cancellation of the contract with the syndicate. I do not believe that any Minister has done anything which is wrong, but outside the Parliament there is an impression that something has been hidden from the public. If anything improper has been done the sooner that is revealed the better; in other words, the sooner honorable senators are in a position to answer questions which are put to them outside the better it will be for the interests of the country as a whole. I remember that when the Chambers of Commerce held their Conference in Tasmania, and I was representing North Queensland, a great many persons there were saying that there was something behind the scenes. I do not believe that there is anything which the Government need to hide, and therefore I trust that they will give us the fullest information on the subject. I desire tb refer to the mail contract for the carriage of mails from Brisbane to Vancouver. New Zealand has been taking every step it possibly could - by inviting the Commonwealth Government to pay a less sum - to do away with Brisbane as a. port of call and to make Sydney the only port of call in Australia. That, I submit, would not be fair to Queensland. We have been trying to open up a trade with Vancouver, and I believe that we have done some good to the people of Queensland. As regards a mail contract for the carriage of mails to Europe, I do not think that the Government are really serious in their tenders, because if they were, they would have specified that the mail boats should have to call at the various ports which the people of Australia require them to visit. Hobart is far better served by ships from Home than is Brisbane. All the vessels going to New Zealand call at Hobart, so that the producers in Tasmania have a boat by which to send their produce from Hobart at least once a month, and sometimes oftener. Of course, in the fruit season, they have boats calling at Hobart every week. It will be remembered that some time ago it was contended both here and in another place, day after day, that it would be impossible for the boats of the Orient Steam Navigation Company to carry the mails within contract time if. Brisbane were made a port of call. Queensland has not only to pay its proportion of the cost of that mail service, but also to pay &#163;25,000 or &#163;26,000 to induce the mail boats of that company to go to Brisbane. As soon as a tender had been accepted, and an inducement was held out, the company discovered that they could send their boats on to Brisbane. I do  not see how the Government can expect the representatives of Queensland, to assist them in carrying their measures if they do not intend to give fair play to its producers.. I hold that in calling for tenders for a mail service, they ought to specify the ports at which the mail boats shall have to call, and, if necessary, make a few hours&#39; difference in the speed. There is really nothing to prevent the Government from taking that course, but from the manner in which the tenders are called, I am very much afraid that Brisbane is going to be shelved again, as a port of call. The Government are giving the tenderers an option to tender under two schedules, namely, one for the carriage of the mails, I suppose as far as Adelaide, and the other for the mail boats&#39; to call at Brisbane and various other ports. It is well known to the people of Australia that the boats which bring the mails to Adelaide must go to Melbourne and Sydney. The trade of Sydney and Melbourne demands that the mail boats should visit those ports, in fact, the boats could not do otherwise, even if they wished, for they could not get enough cargo in Adelaide and Fremantle. Although Melbourne and Sydney may not be mentioned as ports of call in the conditions of tenders, the people of Victoria and New South Wales . understand very well that it is intended that the mail boats shall go to those ports. </para>

Between the port of Brisbane and Gladstone, there are millions of acres of land suitable for dairying purposes. It is nearly all Crown land. Some of it is held in small areas. In the Burnett district alone, there are millions of acres of Crown land available. </para>

                        <para>- They run up to 500 acres. I had a conversation a little while ago with the  chairman  of the Divisional Board there, a German, who knows the country well, and I obtained my facts from him. There is a demand for land close to* railways. The Queensland Government found that they could get people to settle on land of that description, although they are not so ready to settle at long distances from railway lines. The Government therefore did a wise thing in buying back such* land, so long as they did not buy too much&#39; at once, or pay too much for it. Although I am opposed to the present Queensland Government in some respects, I am satisfied that they are trying their best to settle people, and if they continue in the way in which they are going, in a few years we shall have many thousands more people settled than we have now. In . the country at the back of where I live, there is an immense territory of Crown land. You could put in a plough* for hundreds of miles without turning it, and the depth of soil is such that I do not think any portion of the country in the south of Australia is equal to it. </para>

                <para class="block">Australia. What we require is water, and I believe that in time water will be conserved by some scheme of irrigation. If that problem can be solved, there is room for millions of people. But Rome was not built in a day, and we cannot populate these vast territories without the expenditure of money. At present, many of our western holdings are too large. One year&#39;s drought will not hurt the grasses grown there. If we have one good season we can get along without a drop of rain for twelve months. If the people there learn to do as is done in Canada and America, when they have a good season, cut the grass and make hay or ensilage of it, they can carry on over a period of drought. But the areas will have to be smaller before that is done. Some time ago, I travelled in the train with a <inline font-weight="bold">Major of</inline> the United States Army, who was buying beef in Australia. He was going through Queensland, and as we went along in a railway carriage I asked him what he thought of the country. He said, speaking with the slight twang which is characteristic of Americans, &#34; If we had country like this in America we should reckon that we had the pick of Creation.&#34; I asked him how the grass that he saw from the train compared with the grasses in the great western prairies of America, of which we have read so much. He replied that one acre of such country as he saw in Queensland was worth more than five in America. He said, &#34; We have nothing like it there.&#34; That is the sort of country upon which we want to settle people. I do not want to bring out artisans and tradesmen to fill up our cities. We do not want any more people in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Adelaide. I admit that in the past the steps that have been taken to bring out immigrants have, to some extent resulted in failure. We had an immigration scheme under which thousands of people were brought out. </para>

                        <para>- Thousands of them now bless the day when they left the old country and came to Australia, notwithstanding the hardships they had to put up with. It is perfectly true that some of them did not remain in Queensland. Hundreds of people got their friends in England to come out on paying &#163;2 into the office in London, and when they got as far as Brisbane, their friends paid their passages to Sydney. We want to prevent that sort of thing in the future. It can easily be done. Many immigrants who were brought out under the old system were not inclined to go into the bush. The same sort of people may be found in Melbourne to-day. They would rather put up with two meals in a city than go into the bush and enjoy three. They say, &#34; We are not going to camp out away from civilization where there are no theatres and nothing else that we can enjoy.&#34; I am opposed -to any system of immigration that will bring out men who will merely remain in the towns looking for work. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say the honorable senator knows more about blackbirding than I do. The immigration scheme of that time, like a good many other matters of policy, was a little premature. Some people think we have &#39;been premature in entering into Federation; others think we have not gone far enough ; whilst some would revert to the old State system. I think that now we have gone in for Federation we have to make the best of it, and I believe that eventually it will turn out to be for the good of the country. Some honorable senators wish the Commonwealth to go in for a large Army and others for an independent Navy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> who moved the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, thinks we could carry out his ideas as to military defence for &#163;800,000 per annum. I believe in moving slowly in these matters. It would take years to build up a Navy sufficient to defend Australia. The Government should start in a small way. The States of Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia are not in a position to be taxed heavily to build up a Navy that would be of any use to us. &#39; We have not the means.. </para>

                        <para>- It is true that we spent money on our naval defence, but what did it amount to? Hundreds of thousands of pounds were spent which might just as well have been thrown into the Brisbane River. The same remark applies to New South Wales and Victoria. Ideas on naval defence change so rapidly now-a.-days, that almost before we could raise enough money to build a ship, it would become obsolete. This might apply to other countries, but it should be remembered that they can afford the cost. </para>

                        <para>- Order ! The honorable senator will please be seated. I do not wish to complain of the honorable senator for doing so, but I ask him not to continue to do so if he can avoid it, and I ask honorable senators generally to assist in maintaining the orderly character of the proceedings of the Senate by refraining from too frequent interjections. </para>

                        <para>- I am told that in connexion with our land forces we require forts and guns. I admit that, but I may say that since last session I visited one of the forts, and found that the men there were unable to hit an object. The reason they gave was that the Government starved the service, and owing to cost of ammunition, they were unable to practice with the guns more than three or four times in the year. It is impossible to have any efficient artillery force without considerable expenditure. When honorable senators say that we should have a Navy as well as an Army, I say that if we can manage to make one branch of our defence efficient, we should be satisfied with that for the present. I am prepared to assist the Government in making our land forces efficient. There is no possible hope that Australia will, for many years to come, be in a position to build a Navy which will be able to defend her coasts. I know of no country in the world that has such an enormous extent of coast line to defend as the Commonwealth has. </para>

                        <para>- It is of no use for us to acquire a toy for the purpose. So far, all our efforts in that direction have been only so much money wasted. When at Hobart I was on board one of the gun-boats, which at present belongs to the Commonwealth, and I found that when the ordinary boats engaged in the coasting trade between Sydney and Hobart could continue their voyage, the gun-boat to which I refer had to run up a creek for shelter, or the waves would have swept over her. What sort of a gun-boat is that to pay money for? Is that the beginning of a Navy? </para>

                        <para>- At that&#34; time, if we continue our connexion with the British Empire, we shall be perfectly safe. If in the meantime, as some persons might think it desirable, we separated from the Empire and became a Republic, it is probable  that we should be overrun by an enemy even though we had at our service such a Navy as honorable senators desire to establish. We cannot afford to build a Navy, and I hope the people of Australia and the good sense of the members of the Senate will prevent any large expenditure in that direction. We have started a system of land defence, and from all quarters I have received letters, with which I need not trouble the Senate, complaining that the service is starved. We might do something to forward a movement I have very much at heart by greatly increasing the number of our rifle clubs. I was  president  of the North Queensland Rifle Association for some time, and helped to start rifle clubs by offering cups as prizes for rifle matches. I found that sometimes men who had scarcely ever handled a rifle were with a little practice able to win a rifle match. Such a man came from Hughenden to Charters Towers. Another man, who had been only a few months in Charters Towers, won a cup that I gave, and I was very pleased to see him do it. But why should people outside have to put their hands in their pockets to assist this movement when it is the duty of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth, and not of a few individuals? I am sorry to say that at the present time, in order to keep the movement alive, many people have to give money and time to keep rifle clubs going. In connexion with our Cadet Forces, we are unable, for want of funds, to enrol all the cadets who are offering, and we can only enrol so many a year. One of the very best things we could do would be to see that our youths are trained and disciplined in the use of arms, but we are allowing our opportunities to slip by. Honorable senators desire that we should have an Army and Navy, and they shut their eyes to these things. Let us do one thing at a time, and do it well. There are thousands of lads of sixteen or seventeen years of age willing at the present time to join our cadet corps, and they cannot be enrolled for lack of funds. In a few years&#39; time these boys will be too old to join the cadets, and the opportunity to train them will have gone by. I do not say that the Government are not doing the best they can with the means at their command, but it is a great pity that we should have to starve the cadet corps and rifle clubs, because no matter how brave our people may be, it would be nothing short of murder to call out for service men who have never handled a rifle. They would be shot down as we might shoot wild horses. If we train our youths to defend themselves, in our time of need the man behind the gun will be of some use, because he will know that he has as good a chance as those to whom he is opposed. If we had to meet an invader, of what use would it be to call out men who had never handled a gun, and could not hit a hay-stack. Let us spend more money in encouraging rifle clubs, and in training the youth of Australia to handle arms that they may be able, when required, to defend their country. If we do not, we shall be inviting invasion. I am sorry to think that we are not taking the steps in this direction that we should take. </para>

                        <para>- Suppose we have our Navy, what will there be to prevent the landing of an enemy on any part of our coast-line at a distance from the capital cities? And if the enemy lands, we must have a land force to defend the country. Have we not been told that our railways have been constructed largely for the purpose of enabling us to move troops in resisting an invader? We cannot possibly hope to establish a Navy sufficient to .protect our coast-line from Perth to Thursday Island. Honorable senators should not forget that the people residing in the small towns of the Commonwealth have as good a right to be protected by the Federal Government as those living in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. If people are prepared to devote their time to drill and training, they should be given every encouragement, but we find that the maximum amount of ammunition allowed free to rifle clubs is not sufficient for ordinary practice, and members of such clubs have to buy their own ammunition. I can assure honorable senators that the presidents of rifle clubs are very often placed in an awkward position. All sorts of demands are made upon them. They are asked what they have done with this and  with that, and how many rounds of ammunition have been fired here and there. They are involved in a lot of worry and trouble, and all correspondence must go through the circumlocution offices in Melbourne. </para>

When the Estimates come before us I want honorable senators to assist the land forces, especially the rifle corps and the cadets, because in time to come, if we are to have war within any measurable distance of the present day, or if, as some honorable senators think, we are to be invaded by the yellow races in a few years&#39; time, we shall have to depend on the present generation of cadets to defend us. It should, therefore, be the bounden duty of every honorable senator to give the cadet movement his hearty support. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable senator who preceded me paid a very doubtful compliment to those who had already spoken in this debate in both Houses by saying that they had created confusion in the minds of most people. After listening to the honorable senator for about an hour, I was reminded that a son of the Empire once wrote the words, &#34;Confusion worse confounded.&#34; We have at last discovered why there is confusion. We have heard protectionists who are free-traders, and free-traders who are protectionists. We have heard those who are willing to give protection, but who do not own up to being free-traders, although they want a revenue which can only be derived from goods coming in here to the detriment of goods manufactured here. We have also heard honorable senators claiming to be Australians, but when they come to deal with Australia they seem to have great difficulty in getting beyond their own towns, let alone the bounds of their own States. Again, while they boasted of the prosperity of Australia, never attempting to back up their statements by statistics or any real facts, they claimed that the people were so poor that they could not pay even sixpence per month per head to defend their own country by the construction of an Australian Navy. The climax, however, is reached when an honorable senator announces the fact that he is not one of those who purpose doing everything for the people, but wants to do something for himself. That seems to be the attitude that a number of honorable senators on the other side have taken up. Their anti-Socialism, or anti-bogyism, seems to consist of the fact that they are always Socialists in coming to the Government whenever they want anything for their own States or their own towns, or anything that is likely to be beneficial to themselves, but the moment we on this side, who mostly represent the disinherited of this community, ask for anything in the way of State aid, we are met with the cry of Socialism ! When a definition of Socialism is asked for, one honorable senator wishes to credit us with mere Communism that his own intellect ought to have told him had no connexion with Socialism as defined by any authority on the subject. I have no complaint to make about the visit of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Trade and Customs to the old country, although I do not agree with all they did there. It can be said that the Prime Minister fairly represented the opinion of the majority of Australian citizens as expressed to-day. I do not necessarily agree with that, but I believe he represented Australia fairly and well at the Imperial Conference. It is quite possible that he reached out a little beyond his mission, or became a partisan at times, and attempted to commit Australia <inline font-style="italic">too</inline> far or to act as a schoolmaster in teaching other people their own business. I am very glad I am not bound altogether to the preferential trade mission, although I represent Victoria, which is supposed to be the home of it. Nor am I in any way allied to the Government or a supporter of theirs. I shall be always willing, as far as possible, to support any practical measure that can be brought down to assist people speaking a common tongue. I noticed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> when speaking to-day, said of preferential trade, &#34; If ic is practicable.&#34; That seems to be the exact position of the question. &#39; If it was practicable, if we could grant any concession to the old country, and if in turn it was willing to grant us a concession, I should be willing to assist in that direction ; but, as an Australian who wants to see Australia a self-contained country as far as possible, to see the natural resources of Australia developed, I want honorable senators or the Government to tell me what the old country produces that we cannot produce in Australia. It may be true that England manufactures many articles which we have not started to develop the manufacture of in Australia, but if it isa fair thing to allow them to have this market for those goods, when and where are we going to begin to develop those industries in Australia for ourselves? I am an Australian protectionist,, nor a revenue tariffist,. I believe in protection because I want to see two-thirds, at least, of the- &#163;50,000,000 worth of commodities which it is estimated that we shall import this year manufactured in Australia. I am not particular as to which State or what&#34; part of Australia they are manufactured in, but I want to see them made in a White Australia, where the employes are treated1 as white men, and receive sufficient remuneration for their toil to be able to lead&#39;&#60; decent white lives. For that reason, I am totally opposed to anything that I have heard so far in the shape of preferential trade, because I want to see Australia developed. I shall support any proposal to that end. With regard to the Navigation Conference, it will be a good thing if the shipping laws of the Empire can be made uniform. I have not had an opportunity of visiting the Northern Territory, but I have heard two opinions about it. One is that the country has a great future before it. The other is that it is absolutely useless. In the interests of Australia, that country ought to betaken over by the Commonwealth at the earliest possible opportunity, irrespective of the cost. If it is a good country, it will be a bargain to the Commonwealth whatever the cost is ; while, if it is a bad. country, surely we are bad Australians if we ask a mere section of the community to carry that burden on its back any longer. I agree with those who say it must eventually be one of the first points of defence in Australia. On that question I never shall at any time, unless the enemy is absolutely knocking at our door, support any system that will compel any man to become a soldier in Australia. The honorable senator who moved the adoption of the Address-in-Reply seemed very anxious that our young people should be given guns and taught to use them. I am a lover of peace, and I hope the day will never come in Australia when the gun will be put into the hands of any .young person who has not reached the age of reason. If there is one pitiful sight in Australia to-day it is the numbers of mere schoolboys, who have not reached the age of reason, who have nc* ideas of their own, and who do not really know the country they live in, carrying guns about the streets, and being taught, for the glory of the flag and the Empire, that they are to be ready to shoot anybody at the command of somebody else. We have heard a lot about what must be done in the interests of the Empire and the flag. That sentiment is very good, but we should not attach any weight to it in dealing with any proposal which is not of a practical character. Because the Labour Party and certain members of it have raised their voices at various times against bringing people to Australia, they are misrepresented as being opposed to immigration. As an Australian, I shall hail with joy the day when I see 50,000,000 people in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It may be a long time, but I shall hail it with joy when it does come. We have no room for any immigrants in Australia to-day, with our lands in their present condition. The one thing necessary for the development of Australia is the elimination of the landlord class as it now exists here. Take Victoria, for instance. It may be true that there are vast areas available in other parts of Australia. If that is so, I am glad to hear it. The Queenslanders boast that only 4 per cent, of their land is alienated; but I can scarcely believe that those early pioneers who selected land in the various States took all the bad land, and left the good for the people of to-day. I do not know of any State where a man can get land at a reasonable price with reasonable access to railways and shipping. If such land is available, it is strange that men should be willing to live in poverty in the cities. The estimated unearned increment in the value of land in Victoria is about ^100,000,000. Who has created that added value? </para>

                <para class="block">This shows that the head of the Government of the Commonwealth recognises that immigrants cannot be brought here unless the land is brought into fuller use for- the people. Then when we ask that the Federal power shall be exercised, and a land tax imposed for the purpose of bringing those lands into fuller use, we are met with the cry, &#34;Leave it to the States.&#34; I am one of those who would be glad to leave the land question to the States - I wish that were possible - but that would mean leaving the question unsettled. What hope is there of getting a land tax levied in Victoria, where we have a class-constituted Upper House? If we are to get a land tax imposed we shall have to get a better class of representatives than we have had in the States in past years. Many of the men who have not used their opportunities to fight for land taxation in the States, now that they are in the Federal Parliament want to shirk their responsibility by asking its members to continue to leave that question to the States. In regard to the mail contract, a remarkable position has been brought about. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said that there was never any sincerity behind the contract as the syndicate were practically a lot of bounders, who desired to use the Commonwealth for purposes of their own on the Stock Exchange. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> however, said there was a boycott against the syndicate by one of the strongest capitalistic rings, namely, the shipping ring. So that, on the one hand, we have capitalistic bounders trying to use the Commonwealth for ulterior purposes, and next, on the other hand, we have to face the shipping ring. The fact is that we are not between the devil and the deep sea, but between two devils, and the Government supporters come along with a proposal to benefit &#39; the shipping ring, which the Government supporters say boycotted the proposal made for a new contract. It seems to me that we are entirely in the hands of that section of the community who do not care for Commonwealth, God, or man, but care only for their own pockets. When things have arrived at that stage it is time for us to apply a little Socialism or a little Commonwealth enterprise in the direction of owning our mail steamers. I believe that the service could be performed better by the Commonwealth than by private enterprise, and I believe that it would be profitable to the community. I hope to see a practicable proposal made in that direction before the proposed new contract will expire. It has been stated here that there is enormous prosperity in Australia. There is no enormous prosperity in Australia for a large section of the people, but there should be, for the simple reason that for an average family of five persons about &#163;230 worth of wealth is produced. In Victoria, for instance, the factory returns show that the average income is about &#163;60, while the statistics show that in that State there was almost as much net profit in the manufacturing line last year &#39; as was actually paid in wages for the previous year. What does that mean ? It means that the men who do not do the work, but employ others, are getting as much for being the owners of the capital or the factory as are the men who do the work. </para>

If that is a living wage, New South Wales is all right. But if Australia is going to ask men to maintain families and live in reasonable comfort on that pay, it is about time that we did sing out, &#34; No more immigrants shall be admitted.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- In all those industries in which sweating is not carried on to-day that fact is attributable to socialistic legislation introduced by the Labour Party. In Victoria, for instance, we have fifty-five Wages Boards. Bui how many sweaters had we to chase before we secured those Wages Boards? We deplore the position of the starch workers and farm hands. Poor little Tasmania does not seem to be getting along too well. At the best, what have the men in Queensland to offer to persons coming from the old country? Take the food and rations which they are going to supply in addition to wages. The total does not amount to more than 34s. a week. Is that sufficient to maintain family life in Australia? Yet that is indorsed by a Liberal Government, and is backed up by the representatives whom Queensland has sent here. While a wage of 34s. a week is being offered to a man in Australia to maintain a wife and family I am opposed to any person, for any occupation, being introduced. lt has also been stated on the other side of the Chamber that this was mostly confined to young persons who lived in the city, and had no desire to go into the country to work. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> rather sneered at young people who are not prepared to leave city pleasures, such as are offered by the theatre, in order to go into the country to work. In Victoria there are a number of young men who are hanging about workless, and do not go into the country. What are the inducements to them to go there? </para>

                        <para>- Our fathers had the opportunity to make a living. It is all very well for the honorable senator to refer to our fathers as fine old pioneers. Let me point out the difference between the pioneers in Victoria - and it might be equally applicable to the rest of Australia - and their sons .to-day. Take any farmer  who secured land at the nominal value of &#163;1 an acre. He is&#39; fairly prosperous, but where can his sons get land under similar conditions to-day? When I was in Gippsland recently, I attended a sale, and agricultural land was sold there for &#163;5810s. an acre. Fancy an old pioneer out of his hard earnings trying to settle four sons, and saying to them, &#34;Go and do likewise &#34; ! </para>

                            <para>- We have this remarkable position, that when there was no Labour Party in Parliament, when we were all so liberal that we were alienating everything it was possible to alienate, when people were acquiring land under very good terms from the Government, we never heard any opposition to Parliament sitting; but to-day we heard a cry that it would be a good thing if it were shut up for five years. That is not very complimentary to honorable senators on the Opposition side, for never to my knowledge has a majority consisting of members of our party ever placed a measure on the statute-book of any State. Evidently the laws which the other parties have made have not been useful to Australia, and now when a lot of their work has to be undone, and the new legislation is likely to be effective in the interests of the whole of Australia and its great population, we are actually asked to close Australia&#39;s Parliament for five years. I hope that during my term of service I shall not be recognised as one who is a mere barracker for his State. I want to be an Australian in the fullest sense of the term. I am willing and ready to help in the development of every State, irrespective of whether it will be financially good for Victoria or not. When men have been advocating a policy or a proposal which in their opinion was good for Australia, I have regretted to hear on many occasions the interjection, &#34; Not if it means any more taxation for my State.&#34; Is that an Australian attitude? Is that the way in which to build up an Australian sentiment ? </para>

                        <para>. - I think that I may very well congratulate the Senate upon the speeches which have been delivered during the debate ; and without undue flattery, I&#34; may be permitted, perhaps, to pay a compliment to the new senators who have so well acquitted themselves in expressing their  opinions sincerely, although I am quite sure they widely differ on both sides. It is not my intention to deal very largely with the lengthy programme which is submitted in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. There is always a tendency, it seems to me, for the Government to promise for any session an amount of work which experience ought to have told them that it would be simply impossible to do. </para>

It seems to me that, according to the trend of politics in Australia for some years past, there has been a -desire that we should have the Tariff question settled. There is a large amount of uncertainty in commercial circles that ought ito be finally dispelled. If people knew that we are going to have a Tariff that would remain in operation for a good many years they would probably be satisfied with it. Although the present Tariff is a mass of incongruities and inconsistencies, and is neither fish, flesh, nor good red herring, it would even be better to have one like it than leave the country in a state of uncertainty. The Government being determined to propose an alteration of the Tariff, the sooner it is settled the better. Therefore, I think it would have -been wise if they had come down to Parliament, and said: - &#34;We are going fo make this a Tariff session.&#34; As they would have to furnish work for the Senate while the other&#39; House was dealing with the Tariff, they could have placed before us -some such measure as the Navigation Bill until the. Tariff was ready to come up to us. There is one unfortunate issue that must present itself to the mind of a Tasmanian senator, and to which I must refer. It is a question in which a Tasmanian may reasonably claim a large amount of sympathy from the Senate. Perforce, we must look on every proposal that is made to Parliament first of all from a financial stand-point, not because we are inclined to view questions from a selfish aspect, but because the financial point of view necessarily touches our constituents vitally. As a result of our joining the Federation, Tasmania has suffered in a financial sense very severely. As a matter of fact, some of our more far-sighted public men in Tasmania predicted an utter disorganization of our finances as the result of our coming into line with the other States, no matter what Tariff was adopted. They urged that it would be wiser for Tasmania to remain out of the Federation until she was better able to bear the change. Tasmania, however, did the right and the loyal thing, in agreeing by a substantial majority to become a member of this great partnership which is destined, we all hope, to ripen into a great southern nation. But, unfortunately, owing to many causes, Tasmania has suffered greatly and is still suffering, from the effects of the Tariff. Notwithstanding the exercise of the greatest economy, and in spite of the starvation of our public works policy - even to the neglect of ordinary repairs and renewals, which, indeed, there is an obligation upon us to keep up, as our public works represent security for loans - our finances have been reduced to the severest straits. I regret to say that my State has the most underpaid Public Service in Australia. But, in spite of retrenchment and rigid economy, Tasmania is barely able to make both ends meet. It is quite true that in the present financial year the Treasurer anticipates a surplus of something like &#163;60,000 or &#163;70,000. But it has to be admitted frankly - and frankness is always best in connexion with such subjects - that that surplus is not due to money which reaches the Tasmanian Treasury from ordinary sources, but is due to the existence of Tattersalls institution within our borders. </para>

                            <para>- I am not aware that I am dismal. I hope to see the day when Tasmania will become relatively to Australia what Great Britain is relatively to the continent of Europe. A request has been made by the Government of Tasmania directly to the Commonwealth Government. I must frankly say that the request ought to have been made through the Tasmanian representatives in this Parliament ; not that I think they have been ignored intentionally, but because the Tasmanian Government probably thought that the best course was for them to approach the financial authorities of the Commonwealth directly. They did so in order to point out the injustice done to our State under present financial relationships. I do not say that injustice has intentionally been done, but let me point out what has happened. It is well known that within the last few years Bass Strait has .practically become a ferry. Steamers cross from Tasmania to the mainland one day and return the next. There has been a large increase in the passenger traffic. Numbers of people come over to Melbourne to buy in larger or smaller parcels, sometimes for wholesale purposes and sometimes for private use. Indeed, it has been said that the northern part of Tasmania has in a sense become simply a suburb of this great metropolis. The goods purchased in this manner cannot be traced by the Customs officers. It is impossible to follow a passenger who takes a parcel over from Melbourne to Tasmania, and ask him to go to the trouble of passing a Customs entry for what he has purchased. In most cases, perhaps, the amount would only be &#34;a few shillings. But in the aggregate Tasmania loses a considerable amount of revenue. I am not prepared to give an estimate of my own, but it has been calculated that the loss to the Tasmanian revenue in this way amounts to something like &#163;20,000 or &#163;25,000 per annum. . That is to say, that amount of revenue is collected and goes to the credit of Victoria, whereas, inasmuch as the goods are consumed in Tasmania, it ought to go to the credit of my State. lt is perfectly true that a large proportion of the goods purchased in this manner might be traced if the Customs officers insisted upon examining the baggage of all passengers crossing over to Tasmania. But that would be a very vexatious thing to do. </para>

Practically, speaking, it is impossible to do it. </para>

I frankly admit that there is a difficulty, because although Tasmania loses, the Commonwealth as a Commonwealth does not gain. It is Victoria that mainly benefits, and if the Commonwealth Government were asked to restore to Tasmania what has virtually been gained by Victoria, it might be represented to be an injustice to the rest of the States. But the fact remains that Tasmania is losing revenue which is an important item to her. How we are going to overcome the difficulty I do not quite see. </para>

                            <para>- But it does not affect the other States to such a large extent, because, as I have pointed out, Bass Strait has practically become a ferry. Only a sea journey of ten or twelve hours separates Victoria from the north of Tasmania, and the number of passengers who travel is rapidly increasing. Now, Melbourne has pursued a protective policy for many years. At times she has been very selfish. But through her protective policy, when the Customs barriers between the States were abolished, Victoria was in a position to step in and supply Tasmania with large quantities of goods, which were formerly imported from abroad. For instance, under the Tasmanian Tariff we had a duty of 20 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> on drapery goods. In spite of that, we used to buy considerable quantities of stuff from Victoria, because our people liked the cut of it - perhaps because it was more stylish, or mote &#34; Colonial,&#34;  1  might say, than that which was imported from abroad. We also used to buy large quantities of boots from Melbourne, But the point is that when the Customs barriers were removed, Victoria was able to supply us with goods in a still larger measure, and Tasmania lost the 20 per cent, duty on the goods which she used to import &#34;from this State, as well as the duty on similar goods imported from abroad. All credit to Victoria for being ready to take advantage of the enlarged market. </para>

                            <para>- We do not get some of them cheaper. I have never held that the change has not been beneficial to a certain extent to our people. Before leaving this phase of the subject, I should like to direct attention to the deplorable fact that in Tasmania we are losing our natural increase of papulation. Some of my honorable friends will probably attribute that to the low wages paid. Low wages in Tasmania may be a consequence, as well as a cause, of our young people going away. </para>

                            <para>- Land monopoly is not greater in Tasmania than in the other States, but I have no wish to deal with that subject just now. I wish to refer to the actual fact that we have not in Tasmania maintained the ordinary natural increase of population which we should maintain. For a little over six years, ending in 1906, the excess of births over deaths in Tasmania was, in round numbers, something like 20,000. We had something like 170,000 people in 1900, and we should have had 190,000 in 1906. As a matter of fact, we had in 1906 only 178,000. So that, instead of having our ordinary natural increase of population to the extent of 20,000, we got only 8,000, and so 12,000 Tasmanian people must, during that time, have gone elsewhere. These have not been infants or old people. </para>

But when cities like Melbourne and Sydney were being built, mechanics were wanted, and higher wages ruled in the other States, and they found that, well as they might be doing in Tasmania, compared with what they could do in the old country, if they came over to these States they would do better still. Notwithstanding the fact that they came out to Tasmania under an obligation to remain in that State for a certain time, they left and went to the other States. </para>

                            <para>- If I were always practising thrift, I should not be here. I should like to say that the speculator who invests his money in mining ventures is, above all other employers, entitled to absolute fair play. I might say a few words about the mail contract, although the subject has been nearly done to death. It was a thing of big promise and small performance. When the contract was entered into at first, it seemed to me that a very astute Postmaster-General had made a remarkably good bargain. I might mention, by the way, that the same astute Postmaster-General was very much more in evidence at the time when the contract was regarded as a good bargain than he has been lately. It seemed to be a good bargain, and for a long time I was under the impression that the contract had been undertaken by a powerful firm of shipbuilders, who would be able to carry it out. I was also under the impression that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> said this afternoon, those who undertook the contract were called upon to fight a very powerful combine. To speak quite honestly, I do not think that the syndicate received fair play. I believe their enterprise was condemned as far as it could be by the action cf the authorities of some of the large shipping companies at Home. However, it. has all ended in nothing, and we are now inviting fresh tenders. In connexion with the subject I wish to refer to a matter which I think has not been touched upon by previous speakers. I noticed that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth approached a Conference of States Premiers and asked them to do something, which it seems to ,me, should have been done by the Commonwealth if done at all. He virtually asked the States Premiers to guarantee debentures for the syndicate. In view of the fact that the States possess equality of representation here, I hold that, if it were necessary that the debentures should be guaranteed, the guarantee should have been given bv the Commonwealth. It should have been treated as a Federal matter, and dealt with bv this Parliament. </para>

Although, perhaps, there was no intention to be offensive, one of the most extraordinary things they have done has been to offer what seems to be an&#39; insult to. the Senate. This is the States House elected by no section, but bv the whole of the people of the different States. Every honorable senator occupying a seat in this chamber has the right to say that he is here to represent the voice of the people of his State in a way which cannot be claimed by any State representative. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. I do not, in these remarks, desire to belittle the State Premiers or their Conference in any way. I give them every credit for trying to bring about a better state of affairs, and that, so far as Tasmania is concerned, is verv sadly needed. But we must never forget that we have entered into this partnership, and must stand loyally by it. We have established a Federal Parliament, and it is the fault of the people of the different States if they do not send to it men who are capable of protecting their interests. It would be wrong for any member of this Parliament, or for any one else, to belittle the States Governments, for I believe that, properly considered, the responsibilities with which they are charged are really of more importance to the progress and prosperity of the individual States than any legislation we can enact in this Parliament. I may be allowed to say a word about the proposed transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth. This great question has been very fairly dealt with by previous speakers. I regard the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth as a national obligation imposed on us under the Constitution. T regard it as a duty that we should take over the Northern Territory, but I do not think that it should embrace merely the northern portion of the State of South Australia, which is commonly referred to by that title. It should not be forgotten that there is an enormous area of unoccupied country in the north-western portion of Western Australia, probably as large as the Northern Territory of South Australia. I hope I shall not offend our friends from Western Australia if I say that it seems to me that the handful of people in that State will require to seek the intervention of the Commonwealth to enable them to deal proper&#93; v with the enormous area of country at their disposal. This is therefore a much larger question than the mere dealing with the Northern Territory of South Australia. While I am prepared to look at the matter honestly in a national spirit, and to recognise that there is an obligation on the Commonwealth to take over the Territory, still, if we are going to take it over at South Australia&#39;s price, and even then have to submit to conditions laid down by South Australia for her own benefit alone and not for the benefit of the Commonwealth, those terms will not be acceptable to me. Besides the &#163;3,000,000 or &#163;3,500,000 of indebtedness on the Territory, we shall also have to pay for the line of telegraph running from South Australia to Port Darwin, because that is not included in the transfer. </para>

                            <para>--It will not come over as part of the Territory for which we are to pay. . If we have to take over the responsibility of constructing a railway along a particular route to suit a particular State, without regarding what will best benefit the Commonwealth as a whole, or the Northern Territory - if we are to be tied down to that and have to take over and work a railway which is at present nonpaying - then we must have better terms. Those are the terms we shall be asked to discuss this session. If they are not modified very largely, I cannot at present see my way to support them. We have had dissertations from both sides of the Senate on the Tariff. One thing on which I can honestly congratulate some of my freetrade friends, especially those on the other side of the Chamber, is the fact that it has dawned on them, after nearly seven years, that the spirit of the Australian people is in favour of protection, and that it is really a national instruction to this Parliament that the fiscal policy of Australia, shall be a protective one. It should be sufficient encouragement and excuse to those honorable senators, if they feel that they are abandoning their principles, to know that after all they will only be doing what the people have sent them, or at any rate the majority of honorable senators, here to do. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard very interesting arguments and comparisons from several honorable senators about the great prosperity of Great Britain, but to compare an old country, densely populated, and with a limited area, with a young country of the size of a continent and containing at present only a miserable population of 4,000,000 people, is to compare things utterly unlike. If we talked pure economics, possibly those honorable senators opposite me who argue on &#39;the free-trade side might have the best of it. But we take something more than economics into account. Wisely or unwisely, according to the opinions of different people, we are trying in various States to establish a standard of living or of payment for services rendered above that of other countries, to enable the workers to live decently and in comfort. If we are to have such a desirable standard established we must protect it. We must look forward to the development in a truly national sense of this continent. We have to recognise its great isolation, and the fact that we possess many resources. The Almighty has been very bountiful to us in Australia. We have every variety of climate, soil and minerals, and our young people do not lack ingenuity. Young Australians have already made names for themselves throughout the world. We shall in time become a nation, not merely of wool-growers or of miners, but I hope of manufacturers, supplying our own needs. We may, therefore, well depart from pure economics for a little while, with such a goal before us. That is really what the people of Australia are doing. Although I am a protectionist, I shall not support anything in the nature of prohibitive duties. I believe in sufficiently high duties to enable us to keep up our standard. </para>

                            <para>- I hope the honorable senator will not think me offensive if I say he is a political bigot. A man must believe absolutely the whole of what the honorable senator believes in to be orthodox in his eyes. There are a good many things upon which he and I do not see eye to eye. I do not believe in absolutely prohibitive duties. I think that a Tariff can be evolved, and I hope the Government will produce it, which need not be too discriminating. If we pay particular attention to those larger industries which we already possess, and for the growth of which this country is particularly well adapted, and put on sufficiently high duties on the ordinary goods coming in, we shall by that means avoid immediately depleting our revenues - no doubt in time we shall deplete them to a certain extent - and be able to supply the States with the necessary revenue to carry on, while at the same time we shall be giving incidental protection to a large number of manufactures that are hardly worth giving specific protection to at present. I know from actual experience what incidental protection will do. I have seen industries grow from very small beginnings in Tasmania in consequence of a duty which was not put on for protective purposes at all, but which had a protective operation. When we started an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> Tariff and began with 10 per cent, we had no woollen factories in Tasmania. We had some previously, but they had done? little or nothing. When the duty was increased from 10 to 12 J per cent, the woollen industry began to get a little stronger. At 15 per cent, it was stronger still, and when the duty reached 20 per cent., we began not only to supply ourselves with woollen goods, but to export them to some of the other States. </para>

                            <para>- Surely it is a matter of national courtesy to the State of New South Wales that we should do so if we can. Why should we not? It makes no difference to us. I have always regarded as a squalid blot on the Constitution the wretched provision by which Sydney will not allow Melbourne, or Melbourne allow Sydney, to have the Capital in its immediate neighbourhood - I mean the provision in. the Constitution that the Capital Site must be 100 miles away from Sydney. But we have made the compact, and it is certainly right that we should -be expected to carry it out, but no Federal Parliament or Federal Government can be blamed for not complying with the condition in the Constitution, seeing that we have tried to do so. The greatest difficulty, particularly in another place, has arisen from the rivalry of different sections of New South Wales politicians. </para>

                            <para>- The question seems likely to be re-opened, or why is it referred to iri the Governor-General&#39;s Speech? I do not know what is meant by the reference to preferential voting in me Governor-General&#39;s Speech. There are two kinds of preferential voting, or, rather, each kind has the same machinery, but they .aim at different purposes. In the one case, the preferential system of voting is -designed to enable the candidate who is supposed to represent the majority of the constituency to get the seat, no matter how many candidates there may be. This system was in operation in Queensland, but it does not seem to have been understood by the people there. It was not used very much there, at any rate. We .have had instances, particularly in the Commonwealth elections, of men being returned time after time on a pure minority vote. Even the measure of preferential voting to which I have just referred would be an infinite advance on our present method, but if we could go further and adopt such a system of preferential voting as would insure the representation of the various States in accordance with the political convictions of the majority, regardless of geographical divisions, we should do something effectual towards bringing about a much fairer and more honest representation of the people as a&#39; whole in the Australian Parliament. We must wait to see what is in the Bill before we can discuss it. Another dish of which we have had a taste every session since I have been here, and which there is to be another effort to thrust before us again, is the question of the propriety of committing ourselves to the construction of a railway that may cost anything from four up to eight or nine million pounds, to please our friends in Western Australia. They know they have had to meet with most strenuous opposition in the past, and I am afraid they will have to meet it again this time. I should like to say a word or two of personal explanation before I sit down. The fact that I have occupied a seat on your right, sir, is sometimes taken to indicate that I am a supporter of the Government. </para>

                            <para>- We are all Socialists when it suits us. I hope that these names will no longer be bandied across the floor. Since I entered the Senate I have never allied myself with any party. I happen to be a protectionist, and honorable senators who sit on the opposite side and form the Opposition are nearly all freetraders. Much as I believe in many of the principles they &#39;are advocating, I could not associate with them. On the other hand my friends in the Ministry are carrying on a system of what I call irresponsible government. I do not believe in the situation - I never did - and, although&#39; I have the greatest respect for many, members of the Government, particularly for the Prime Minister, who we all regret is ill, still, I cannot consider that their position for the last two sessions has been a sound or even a tolerable one. Therefore, while I have continued to sit in this seat, I hope that no honorable senators will rise and taunt me with sailing under false colours, with  sitting  apparently with the Government and not voting with them. I do not believe that the Senate should be made a party House in any way. That is my chief objection to the Labour Party.  I do not consider that a Labour Party - as I think I said once before - is necessary in the Australian Parliament&#39;. It seems to me to suggest a doubt as to whether the democracy of Australia can be trusted to return to Parliament men sufficiently democratic in their tendencies to carry put all or most of the reforms which not only our labour friends, but a good many others also, desire to see carried out With that explanation, sir, I thank honorable senators for their courtesy in listening to my lengthy, remarks. </para>
