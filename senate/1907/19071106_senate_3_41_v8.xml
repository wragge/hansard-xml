                        <para>. - In moving the adjournment of the debate on Friday last, I took into consideration the very great importance of this Bill. There was another motive which actuated me, and that was the very good attendance on the Opposition benches when any measure of. this description is before the Senate. When the report of the Disputed Returns and Qualifications Committee was under consideration, all the members of the Opposition were" present. The great majority of them were present on Friday last, and I am very pleased to see a large array of them here to-day. I was not in a hurry to see the Bill disposed of last Friday, because I thought that probably if it were allowed to pass through all its stages then the Opposition benches might be empty until such time as another question of an extremely party character should . arise. I know that honorable senators on the other side, as well as honorable senators on this side, are actuated by the best motives. </para>

                            <para>- So far as their lights lead them they are actuated by the best motives. They all want to do what they think best for their party, but they do not like to say so. There are some honorable senators, however, who really do not know what party they belong to, nor does anybody else. Viewing the matter in that light, I thought that it would be well to adjourn the debate on the second reading of this Bill until today. I know that if it had been another measure of equal importance, its second reading would not have been allowed to pass without a word' of counsel from the leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> or whatever other leader might have been in power at the moment. There was no attempt on the part of any one to say a word. They intended to allow the question for the second reading to pass, and the Bill to go through, no matter how important the occasion was. </para>

                            <para>- Oh, no. It was a case of rushing the Bill through as quickly as possible, and yet the members of the Opposition are vieing with each other now in the declaration that they are actuated by no party motives. How absurd such a declaration is must appear to those who have been taking notice of what has been going on in the Senate. It has already been clearly pointed out that in connexion with this matter the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> was imbued with party bias at the commencement of the session. At the same time we had ample evidence that the mind of the great leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> was also afflicted in the very same manner. </para>

He was at the time away in Sydney, engaged in connexion with this same unfortunate incident, and when the Judge asked when he would be present, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> answered that he did not know, but that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piper</inline> was in Sydney, and he hoped he would come back crowned with triumph. </para>

                            <para>- I dare say that it has puzzled others as well as myself. In connexion with the Bill at present before the Senate, I should like every honorable senator to be absolutely outspoken that we may know where we are. We should not be invited to believe that honorable senators do not feel a deeper interest in this measure than they do in many other measures that come before the Senate. Whenever that sort of thing is attempted, I shall always ask how it is that honorable senators manage to be present on such occasions. Looking at the whole position from the date of the general election in 1906, I am forced to the conclusion that it is not a Bill to amend the Electoral Act in order to deal with this matter, but a Bill to amend the Constitution, that we ought to have before us. How has the difficulty arisen? An Electoral Act has been passed under which every conceivable contingency, so far as ordinary elections are concerned, was dealt  with, and powers were given to a Court of Disputed Returns to deal with matters arising under it. ' When the Electoral Bill was before the Senate, the only thing we omitted to do was to give the Court of Disputed Returns the power to deal with elections under section 15 of the Constitution. That brings me to the Constitution itself, and although I said very little when the matter was before the Senate in connexion with the report presented by the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications, I had a good deal in my mind. It was tiresome to listen to the protestations of honorable senators with respect to their party attitude and their desire to get rid of the whole question and send it away from Parliament altogether for decision. I believe that in this Bill the Government are making an honest attempt to do that; but the Bill has a retrospective effect that I do not at all approve of. Instead of passing proposed legislation for an amendment of the Electoral Act, we should be amending the Constitution in order to make section 15 so clear that he who runs might read. </para>

                            <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> by his interjection, invites me to make good my contention I will do so. The question has been. already argued, and I suppose it will be argued hundreds of times again, until the Constitution is made more perfect than it is at the present time. Section 7 of the Constitution provides for the representation of the States, and that there shall be six senators for each State. Section 9 gives the Parliament power to direct how senators are to be elected, but so that the method shall be uniform throughout the Commonwealth. Under the Constitution and the legislation of this Parliament, the States have power to do certain things. Under section 9 they can fix the date for the holding of an election, and they can do a great many things of which we have very little idea until we come to consider the matter closely. We do not know at what time, under the operation of that section, a conflict may arise between the States and the Commonwealth. That is one reason why I say that something should be done to amend the Constitution, in order to moke the power of the Commonwealth absolute, or to provide some arrangement which would prevent friction between the States and the Commonwealth in connexion with the election of senators. Then we come to the section out of which all the difficulty has arisen - section 15. It provides for casual or extraordinary elections, elections held out of the ordinary course of events, and which do not take place periodically. I hold that every election that is not held at the proper time comes under section 15. If it does not, the Constitution should be amended to repeal that section, or to make every election for the Senate or the House of Representatives an election by the whole people. Why was section 15 embodied in the Constitution? It was because the members of the Federal Convention, having adopted section 7, thought it would be a very expensive proceeding if one or two senators had to be elected by a whole State. They therefore adopted a different plan to deal with such elections, which took shape in section 15. I should like to ask whether in the present circumstances there would be any greater or less expense than if the right man - the man who really was elected and was declared elected - had taken his seat and then died? Under section 15, the Parliament of South Australia would have had to fill the vacancy in the manner therein prescribed. No one can doubt that for a moment. I say emphatically that on the 1 2th December last somebody was elected, although the seat was afterwards declared void. It was not the election that was doubted, it was who was elected. It was either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby.</inline> Either of those gentlemen was elected. There was no tie, and if there had been a tie the difficulty could not have been overcome in that way. I' declare that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby</inline> was elected. He received a majority of the votes. </para>

                            <para>- Let us take all the circumstances into consideration and see who is most justified ,in the opinion he holds. The election took place on the 12th December. The counting of the ballot was completed, and it was found "that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby</inline> had a majority of votes. No one can deny that. I wish honorable senators to believe me when I say that I have no personal animosity, antipathy, or even dislike to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon.</inline> I consider him a straightforward, honest gentleman, and I have always been on most friendly terms with him. But 'in a mysterious manner information seems to have come from somewhere to somebody. There is so much mystery about the matter that it is impossible to thoroughly understand it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> himself repudiated the charge that he was the prime mover. He said he wa.s forced to the position of asking for a recount. But on his application a recount was granted. Strange to say, there was only one polling place the votes for which were asked to be recounted. That was in Hindmarsh. It was found that the result of the recount entirely upset all former calculations. At this time the poor man who had really been elected was lying on his death-bed. No news of what had taken place was conveyed to him. He did not even know that there was a dispute about the election. But a friend took up the case. It was brought before the .Court of Disputed Returns, when, lo and behold ! one quarter of the ballot-papers of South Australia were found to have disappeared. It is a well-known fact that the ballot-papers in that particular district could not be said to be in favour of the candidates put forward by the Labour Party, but there was certain knowledge that many of the ballot-papers in certain polling booths in that district were set aside because the returning officers neglected to initial them, or initialed them on the wrong side. It was said that the ballot-papers  which disappeared had been burnt. The returning officer responsible was taken to the Court, and was, I believe, fined ;£io for burning them. But the mysterious workings went on. The Parliament of South Australia then took it upon itself to return a representative for the State. That representative is here to-day, and I believe that he will remain here, because I think that the people of South Australia, even if there were a fresh election, would return him again. But from my reading of the Constitution :he has no right to be required to submit to a  fresh election. A great uproar was raised in certain quarters, and the case was brought before the High Court again. An application was made for a mandamus. Every confidence was expressed as to the result. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> himself expected <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piper</inline> to come back to Adelaide crowned with laurels. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is magnanimous towards his enemies when he has them under his feet. As a South Australian, I have a certain pride in him for his ability and dexterity. I admire the way in which he can work people to act upon his own lines. He has been able to work <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> in- that way - honest gentlemen who are prepared to swear by everything which the honorable senator does. But while these proceedings were going on the ballot-papers supposed to be burnt were found. They were not burnt at all. They are in existence now. I have not the least doubt that if it were within the power of the Senate or the Court of Disputed Returns to have the papers investigated, it would be found that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby</inline> was duly elected. </para>

                            <para>- Why did not the honorable senator stay in Queensland, where it is . warm ? How could I move to that effect? I did not find the ballot-papers. There is so much mystery connected with the whole affair that I am like Doubting Thomas ; even if I had the papers -in my hands, with a witness or two present to certify to their correctness, I should have some difficulty in believing in them. But I can  easily imagine that if any other gentleman than Senator O'Loghlin had been here filling the seat he occupies to-day scarcely a word would have been said about what occurred. Everything would have been hushed up. But <inline font-weight="bold">'Senator O'Loghlin</inline> is here, and I hope that he will remain here until the proper time for an election comes. Now I wish to return to section 15 of the Constitution, and to show that the members of the Convention, in framing it, although they might have been a little bit vague in their ideas, had a very good intention. Their intention was in the first place to save money to the States, and in the second place to protect the interests' of the electors. How did they do it? In one part of section 15 it is provided that if a vacancy occurs - and it does not say how that vacancy is to occur - the Parliament of the State, if then in session, is collectively to choose a person to represent the State, who is to hold office until the next election. It does not matter when that election may happen. Then he is to go to the people, even if he has been a member of the Senate for only three weeks. The people at the first opportunity are to be able to express their approval or disapproval of the selection made by the Parliament of the State. But if the State Parliament is not sitting the Governor in Council may nominate or select somebody to represent that State. Till when? Till the Parliament meets, or until an election takes place, whichever first happens. This shows that the intention of the members of the Convention was to save the expense of a Senate election under extraordinary circumstances, and to protect the interests of the people by giving them the very first opportunity to ratify or confirm what had been done by the Governor in Council or by Parliament. I hold that everything of that kind was done and complied with so far as the State of South Australia was concerned. The Governor of the State was notified that a vacancy had occurred. He took the only action that he could take under the circumstances, and the Parliament of that State took the only action they could take. They were perfectly justified in what they did. Was not that an extraordinary election? </para>

I wish to direct the attention of honorable senators to what took place in Victoria when there was a dispute in reference to the Echuca election. On that occasion the  President  of the Court of Disputed Returns - the very same Judge - declared the election null and void, and decided that there must be a fresh popular election. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad that the honorable senator does recognise it. because I shall now have his sympathy when I need it. The Constitution sets out, to some extent, what the circumstances are that will bring about a casual election for the Senate. If honorable senators turn to section  19  of the Constitution, they will find that under it a senator has power to resign. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> could send a letter to the  President  or to the Governor-General resigning his seat. Possibly that resignation would be accepted. I do not see how the Governor-General or the  President  could do other than accept it. The resignation would take effect. Then section  20  provides that if a senator stays away from 'the Senate two months without leave of absence his seat shall become vacant. That would cause a by-election if it happened three months after a general election. If we turn to sections  44  and  45  we find that they provide for the disqualification of senators and members of the House of Representatives. Under those sections, a number of things may happen that may render a seat vacant, and, in accordance with which a casual election may take place. I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger declare in this chamber, with all the wisdom of a Solon, and the emphatic denunciation of a Draco, that everything was provided for in the Constitution. </para>

Everything is not provided for in the Constitution. There' is not a syllable in it about the death of a senator. Collectively speaking, senators may die as often as they like, but the contingency is not mentioned in the Constitution. </para>

But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, when arguing this question <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> a previous occasion, said that sections  19, 20, 44,  and  45  of the Constitution provided for everything. Then he declared that this particular instance- - the declaring of a seat vacant bv the Court of Disputed Returns - was outside of the Constitution, . because it was not specifically mentioned. If the honorable senator was right in that argument, no casual vacancy could take place, and no casual election could follow, after the death of a senator, as that contingency is also not mentioned in the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator will find if he reads section  47  of the Constitution that the Senate had, and still has, the power to decide .questions of the qualifications of senators. The Senate will still have that power until this Bill becomes an Act, if it ever does. Where we find ambiguities in the Constitution, or any difficulty in interpreting any section of it, it is the duty of Parliament and of the people of Australia to amend the Constitution so as to make it clear, in order that there may be no necessity for the High Court or any other body to interpret it. Of course, under certain circumstances, unavoidable difficulties may arise: Then, if the difficulty is one that can be removed by the amendment of the Constitution, the proper course is to amend the Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> agrees with me in that, because not very long ago, when a certain Bill was before the Senate, he declared emphatically that, instead -of passing legislation of that description or this description, it was the duty of the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the people to amend the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- What is the difference? The Bill to which I refer was the Judiciary Bill. I agreed with the honorable senator on that occasion that the proper course to take was to amend the Constitution. In fact, the honorable senator said some very nice things about me because I agreed with him. I hope that he will do the same this time because I disagree with him. I know that the honorable senator is able, and that he is magnanimous enough to an opponent to be willing-- </para>

                            <para>- I do not. I think that they were for some time under the subtle influence of the honorable senator. I have a very good idea what that influence is. I dare say if I had been associated with the honorable senator for the same length of time I should have had very great difficulty in disagreeing with him. But I think he would give me credit for trying all I knew to disagree with him. The Senate has decided that in future the Court of Disputed Returns shall have the power to deal exclusively not only with the elections or qualifications of members of the House of Representatives, but also with those of senators, even so far as to deal with the qualifications of a senator chosen under section 15 of the Constitution. That is what I object to. I object to patching up the Constitution by passing this kind of legislation, when we could make everything right by amending the Constitution. </para>

It is not fair for honorable senators to expect the electors of Australia to understand the Constitution, when they do not understand it themselves, and have to get the High Court to interpret it. </para>

                            <para>- Then it is also the duty of Parliament and the people of Australia, in the interests of themselves and also of the High Court, to make the Constitution as easy of interpretation as possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and other honorable senators on the opposite side, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, with his great legal knowledge, are always endeavouring to make ordinary Bills so clear that the Courts will have no difficulty in interpreting or understanding them. They declare that that is their motive, at any rate, whether it is a fact or not. If they say so with regard to simple Bills, why should not they believe so in connexion with the Constitution, which is the instrument of Government of the whole Commonwealth? When they find any difficulty in its interpretation they ought <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> do everything possible to make it clear. Clause  2  of this Bill would satisfy every honorable senator opposite. They have very little interest in anything else in the Bill. I believe honestly and sincerely that if clause  2  were not in the Bill, if this trouble had never arisen, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> was not here, and if the Bill had been introduced merely to amend the Electoral Act so that in the future no difficulty of this kind could arise, honorable senators opposite would be perfectly indifferent about it. But they desire clause  2.  They wish to settle a matter about which they are not satisfied at present. </para>

                            <para>- That is all I was doing, sir. I was telling <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and other senators that objections were taken, . and that it would have been a good thing if some of them had been here when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was speaking. They would have known that very substantial objections were raised to the whole question, and particularly to the report, which was torn to pieces in an able manner. That is all I have to say about that matter. The object of clause 2 of this Bill is to take away from the Senate the power which it possesses under section 47 of the Constitution, not in respect of anything which may happen, but in respect of something which has happened. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that the honorable senator will when he gets an opportunity, and I trust that an opportunity will arise very soon. But the point to be considered now is the expense which would be entailed upon the people of South Australia. As the members of its Parliament were elected by a majority of the people, cannot the inference be justly drawn that they would be satisfied with the selection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin?I</inline> am sure that if a similar difficulty occurred in Victoria or New South Wales, the majority of the people of the State would be perfectly satisfied with the selection made by their own Parliament. We raised no cry here when senators were chosen in that way. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robert</inline> Reid was chosen by the Parliament of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mackellar</inline> was chosen by the Parliament of New South Wales, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Saunders</inline> was chosen by the Parliament of Western Australia. Nobody heard a word of objection raised to the choice of those gentlemen. The selection was made constitutionally then, and the selection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> was accomplished just as constitutionally, only that honorable senators on the other side are trying to find loop-holes. </para>

                            <para>- The Opposition have shown the strongest party feeling in this matter. I do not deny that I have party feeling, but I am declaring that the Opposition have stronger party feeling, and it is they who are making all the bother. I hold that the personal convenience of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> should be considered. Why, sir, the legal profession are driving <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> nearly <inline font-style="italic">crazy by</inline> sending him, first to the Court of Disputed Returns, . secondly to the High Court for a mandamus, and now to the Court of Disputed Returns. The poor man can hardly get a wink of sleep, and it is all owing to the intervention of lawyers. I wish that in this instance there were no lawyers in the case. ' I object to the retrospective character of clause  2  of the Bill, but I have not the slightest objection to the provision for the removal of any future difficulty of the kind from the arena of party politics. The position is very simple, with the exception of the interpretation of section  15  of the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- The fact that there is a doubt may justify that, but it would justify to ' a fair greater extent an amendment of the Constitution so . as to remove . the doubt, when there would be no necessity to refer to the Court of Disputed Returns. Probably, under existing circumstances, we shall be compelled to give a silent vote, as we had to do on a motion to adopt the report of that generous body, the Disputed Returns and Qualifications Committee. We could not do anything else then, and we may not be able to do anything else now. At the same time, I have a right to object to the enactment of retrospective legislation. In the near future, I may hear some honorable senators on the other side objecting to a proposal of that kind, and very probably I will taunt them with their inconsistency. I hope that they will not turn round and say, " No, no," or " Yes, yes " to anything I may then say. The remaining clauses of the Bill deal with future elections and the amendment of the Electoral Act in certain respects. The proposed amendments are all very simple, and will, I believe, be very effective. The first amendment is only of a trifling character. It is to bring section  2  into conformity with the other amendments in division xvi., which is amended from section  192  to section  206.  I think honorable senators will find that they can all agree to the proposed amendments of those sections. After section  206,  there are six machinery amendments proposed by the Government, and I believe that, with very little variation, they may pass. I shall conclude by stating that, although I object strongly to the principle embodied in clause  2  of this Bill, yet I shall willingly support the remaining provisions with very little modification. At the same time, I should have much preferred if the Government had brought in a Bill to amend the Constitution in the direction I have indicated. </para>

                        into all the ramifications and irrelevancies with which he has entertained the Senate upon what is really a very simple issue and an issue in. conformity with the resolution passed unanimously - at least in the sense that there was no division called for - by the Senate on a very recent date. Nor do I intend to follow the efforts of the honorable senator to make this Bill a serious party question. Undoubtedly, if it became a party question, it would be largely, if not entirely, due to the vehement efforts

                        has made in that direction. I had thought that we had to some extent escaped from the atmosphere of party. It is only the other day that I moved the adoption of the report of the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications on the question as to whether

                        is not a stranger in this Chamber. At that time I and the other members of the Committee, with, perhaps, two exceptions, were accused of being influenced by party bias, and everything else that is mischievous in the direction of party, in spite of my personal protest and my strong appeal to the Senate to settle the question itself. Honorable senators will recollect that I appealed to them as a Court.

                            <para>- I felt that it was not quite a fair interjection to make, when there was no occasion for my presence, seeing that no division took place. When imputations of party feeling and bias were made at the stage at which I desired the report of the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications to be adopted by the Senate, and after I had counselled the Senate as emphatically as I could to decide the matter for itself with the full authority which the Constitution gives it, I feel that it is an extraordinary thing that now when the course which I opposed and protested against is being -adopted at the instance of the Government, and not of honorable senators on this side, an endeavour should be made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> to inflame party feeling in connexion with it. We were accused of party feeling when opposing the course now proposed. We are accused of party feeling when we support it. That is all I desire to say on that point. On another point to which the honorable senator alluded I think he was equally unjust, because, in order to bolster up his insinuation of party feeling on this side - and I hope that I may use that expression - he said that honorable senators on this side mustered in their places in numbers upon this question, although they did not do so on other occasions. I am exceedingly sorry, but it does not happen to be so to-day, and did not happen to be so on Friday last, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> acting quite within his rights, moved the adjournment of the debate. There was no occasion for the honorable senator to make an elaborate or abject apology for doing so. I felt then, as I feel now, that there was no reason for postponing the second . reading of the Bill, and I shall tell honorable senators why. It was because this Bill was introduced by the Government whom my honorable friends opposite support, and whom they supported the other day in refusing to allow the Senate, on my motion, to adopt, the report of the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications. The Bill is introduced' by the Government in conformity with, and in obedience to, that resolution of the Senate; every word in clause 2 .of the measure is in conformity with it, and framed with a view of carrying it out. I felt that in carrying that resolution the Senate had practically agreed to the second reading of this Bill. We may discuss its provisions in Committee, but the principle of the Bill has already been affirmed. I say that without any fear of contradiction. What is the position? In connexion with this unfortunate question everybody concerned is more or less entitled to our sympathy, but those most entitled to our sympathy are the people of South Australia, who have never had an opportunity to elect, and have not elected, their third senator. It is all very well to make a pathetic appeal about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin.</inline> He is entitled to every courtesy, just as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> is; but the people whose interests we have to protect in dealing with this question are the people of South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; but I wish to keep to this concrete, case, and I say that in connexion with this question the people whom we are bound to protect are the people of South Australia, who attempted on the 12th December, 1906, to elect a third senator for their State, and who are declared not to have succeeded in that attempt. How can my honorable friends opposite go to the people of South Australia and say that they trust them, and that it is always right <inline font-style="italic">ko</inline> allow them to exercise their franchise if they resist the present proposal ? The position in this matter is that there was no election on the 12th December, as the Judge declared that it was a void election, and the people of South Australia had not had ah opportunity to exercise their franchise. That is the situation, and if ever I made an effort in' any direction ki- my life that is the situation which I shall take care that the people of South Australia shall understand, and I shall further take care that if they are deprived of the exercise of their franchise they shall know how it is and by whom they have been so deprived. The question having been raised as to whether the people of South Australia elected their senator under clause 7 of the Constitution, and as to whether the gentleman sent here by the Parliament of the State is a stranger in the Senate - not an usurper in the sense that his presence here is due to himself, but . in the sense that he is standing in the shoes which can 'only be filled by the people of the State. That question having been raised, and the Senate having been apprised of it by means of a petition - and it did not matter whose petition - it was referred to the Committee of. Disputed Returns and Qualifications constituted by the Senate. That tribunal was trusted by the Senate to make a report. I do not condescend to repudiate the imputations made upon the work of the Committee as to party feeling, bias, or anything of the kind.- I say that the members of that Committee absolutely cast from their minds everything in the nature of party feeling or bias in their investigation and consideration of the question. I say that of all the members of the </para>

                            <para>- It is not a fact, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is joining in what is a disgraceful and unworthy imputation. If I had been here, of what use would it have been to call for a division on the motion for the adoption of the report when honorable senators on the other side, and the Government, as they were quite entitled to do, had made up their minds that they would not adopt the report, but would take a course which honorable senators are now seeking to repudiate? What is the gist of the long and vehement rigmarole we have had from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor?</inline> Is it not a repudiation of what the Senate did the other day? Is not that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> desires? When he refers to clause  2  of the Bill, and says that he objects to it as a retrospective clause, what is that but inviting the Senate, in view of what took place, to pursue a path which, if it be pursued, can only be described as a path of political dishonour? It would place an indelible stain upon the Senate if, in the face of the resolution which was adopted, we refused to send this case to the High Court for decision. What are the facts?  The Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications entered upon their investigation. They brought down a report, on which the Government seem to have felt that they had to adopt an attitude which it was not for me to question. The time has gone by now for debating the report from the point of view of one side or the other. The Government adopted a course which they were perfectly entitled to take if they 'thought fit. That report, when presented, had been agreed to unanimously. The minutes of the proceedings of the Committee are before the Senate, and they show that no amendment was moved, no dissent, no question, and no qualification. </para>

                            <para>- I am not dealing with that matter now. I shall deal with it presently. I declare, as  Chairman  of the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications, and with the minutes of its proceedings before the Senate, that there was in that Committee absolute unanimity with regard to the conclusions which were arrived at. I do not say that a man is not entitled to change his mind. I do not say that when he has arrived at a conclusion he is not entitled to reconsider it ; but I do say that that report was, as a report, unanimous, and so it appears on the records of the Senate. I am sure that my honorable friends, Senators de Largie and Turley, will say, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie said in seconding a vote of thanks to me as  Chairman  of the Committee, that I did everything that was fair, and that it would have been impossible to have shown greater impartiality as to every view of the question than I showed during the conduct of the investigation by that Committee. My honorable friends, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, felt - if, now that the report is a thing of the past, I may use an expression that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> employed - that it was impossible to dissent from the conclusion of the Committee; but, as I put it to them, they would feel happier if some one else decided the question instead of ourselves. Accordingly they suggested that there should be an addendum to the report, to the effect that the petition should be dealt with by the High Court. They therefore moved what subsequently appeared as an addendum. As some observations have been made with regard to that addendum, may I say that when it was moved I knew perfectly well what the Standing Orders were. I pointed out that it  was  n6t a dissent from the report of the Committee, that it was not a protest against the report, and that it really ought not to appear in the report at all. But I also said that I thought it would be only fair as those honorable senators entertained the view that the question was one that should be referred for decision to the High Court, that that view should appear upon the forefront of the document. </para>

                            <para>- It was christened an addendum in the Committee. It was not intended to be part of the report at all, but, as a matter of fairness - because of an excessive desire that everything bearing upon the report should be published - the addendum was attached to the report. When I moved the adoption of the report, I commended it as best I could to the acceptance of the Senate. I entered at some length into my reasons for thinking that the matter should not be sent to the High Court. I then hoped that the Senate would deal with it. I said that if it had been intended that it should be referred to the High Court, I thought that steps for that purpose should have been taken when the petition was first presented to the Senate, instead of the matter being referred to the Committee at all. But the Senate, in its wisdom, took the other view, and adopted the suggestion of the addendum, namely, that as the question of the validity of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin's</inline> right to sit in this Senate involved a matter of constitutional law, the transcending question of whether or not the people of South Australia had chosen their third senator, it was proper that the whole matter should be dealt with- by the High Court. Accordingly, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> one of the signatories to the addendum, in fulfilment of it, and in the best of faith - he would have been a recreant to his own addendum if he had not done it - moved the amendment which -was subsequently carried to the motion for the adoption of the report. </para>

They wished this petition, which had been under the consideration, of the Committee, to be referred to the High Court. They put an addendum on the report for that very purpose. As honorable men, they moved and' supported  an  amendment to carry1 out that intention. The Senate adopted  it.  This is the resolution which was adopted  - </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that ; that would, perhaps, be rude. But this resolution was adopted, without any opposition, as the best and most proper way of having the question involved in the petition determined. But what does the honorable senator say now ? I confess that I am amazed at the tortuous way in which he has sought, as he says, to get round this question. He speaks of the resolution ot the Senate as meaning that " future questions " of this sort are to be so determined. </para>

                            <para>- Not at any time. When I was first elected to the Senate I was on nobody's ticket. I should have been pleased had I been accorded the support of the Labour Party, but they did not put me on their ticket, nor did the National League put me on theirs. But I was elected in spite of all their tickets, as I shall be again on the first opportunity when I go before the electors. But that is not the question now. The question is whether we, as a Senate, are <inline font-style="italic">going to</inline> pursue the honest course, or whether we are going to repudiate our own resolution by which we requested the Government to bring in a Bill for the purpose of referring this petition for decision to the High Court. The question is whether we are going to throw over the Government, repudiate our own request, and deny the expression of our own will. It is the most extraordinary position that any legislative body has ever been invited to take up. I do not wonder that the honorable senator should, as he has said, have gone round the question, and tried to obscure it by raising a number of other issues which have no bearing upon it at all. We passed a resolution that this petition should be referred to the High Court, the highest tribunal in this country. </para>

                            <para>- As I said the other day, if the Government had taken that course I should have supported them through thick and thin with the object of referring the petition to the High Court. It was no pleasure to the Committee to deal with it. But they were obliged to do their duty to the Senate, and they did their duty. I felt that it was better that the Senate should deal with the matter in accordance with the report of their own Committee, but as honorable senators, like my honorable friends on the Committee, had qualms or doubts and would prefer not to have the responsibility directly on their own shoulders, I shall say nothing to the contrary. But the Senate having done this, and the Government having, in obedience to the  resolution of the Senate, brought in legislation to have this question decided by the highest tribunal in the land, it is the business of the Senate to support the Government. There is no middle course. I am not saying that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> wishes to protest now he may r.ot do so, but the time to have done it with effect was before. At all events, the course of the Senate seems to be perfectly clear - to carry out its own resolution. It cannot be denied that strongly different opinions have been expressed all round this chamber and outside the chamber. Is it right that any gentleman should sit in this Senate with a tainted title? </para>

                            <para>- I respect the honorable senator for his loyalty to his opinion, if he entertains that opinion, but the question is one that has yet to be settled. We thought that we were going to settle it bv the instrumentality of our Committee. Unfortunately, we did not. The petition is in this chamber at this moment, pending and undecided. The report of the Committee has been rejected. The petition is still here and unsettled. The Senate has said, "We are not going to settle it. We are going to hand it over to the High Court for settlement." The Government have brought in a Bill for that purpose. It is our duty to give our assent to that Bill. If we are to be loyal to ourselves, to be honest, not to repudiate our own resolution, npt to enter upon a path which would involve us in political dishonour, it is our duty to ask the High Court to decide this question. We have asked them by that resolution. Are we to repudiate it? Are we to say in the face of Australia that, doubtful as a large number of people may consider the honorable senator's title to sit here, we are going to let him sit here, just as we might invite a stranger to sit here, without having his title verified, made good, and cleared of these doubts, in a way which would be satisfactory to him, to us. and to the people of South Australia? If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> prediction is good, that the High Court will decide against the Committee's report, and declare the choice by the Parliament of South Australia to be good and valid, what are honorable senators opposite afraid of? Why are they objecting to this Bill? I give the honorable senator credit, for believing that statement. To me, it is a matter of the most perfect indifference, for if the High Court reverses the Committee's view, I shall accept their decision as any person of any manliness would accept it. I regard this really as an appeal from the decision of the Committee, and I welcome it, not because I believe that the High Court will agree with us, but as I should welcome any appeal if I were deciding any case in a judicial way. No Judge with a spark of manliness or judicial feeling in his composition hesitates for a moment to welcome an appeal from his decision. Treating this matter in . that way, I cannot understand why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> should not be ready and anxious to have the case referred to a tribunal which he believes will decide as he wishes and hopes.- I, on the other hand, equally welcome it, not because I have any belief or feeling as to which way the Court will decide, but in order to have the petition settled, and to have it determined either that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> 'Loghlin is rightly here by as good a title as is any other honorable senator ' against whom there is no object - tion, or that, if he is not, proper steps under the Constitution shall be taken to send a man here to fill the place which the people were asked to fill on the 12th of December last year, and which, through no fault of their own, they did not fill. They made no choice under section 7. I do not care two straws as to casual elections, and all the rest of it. All I say is that, before there can be a casual vacancy by death, resignation, or anything else, there must be a valid election by the people. That is the sheet-anchor of the Constitution. It is the people's sheet-anchor. It is to us an overwhelming duty to see that the electors get fair play. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has sought to obscure the issue by talking about an amendment of the Constitution. The Constitution requires no amendment, but if it required fifty thousand amendments, the time to determine what amendments were required would be after the High Court had decided. The Senate rejected the opinion of its own Committee. Good. I make no complaint. We do not expect, when we sit on Committees of this kind, that our views will be swallowed, without question. A man would be a fool to think anything of the kind. The Senate said that it wanted another tribunal which would not  be susceptible to bias or party feeling. The Senate chose the High Court of this country as that tribunal. The Senate could not have chosen a better or higher tribunal, or one more completely fulfilling the conditions which the Senate laid down. The Senate desires the view of the High Court on this concrete case.. We could not send a case to them unless it was a concrete case. They will take no cognizance of an abstract question. We have a concrete case undecided here now. If, from the High Court's exposition of the subject, it appears that an amendment of the Constitution is . necessary, that can be dealt with. But, at this moment, there is no necessity for any amendment of the Constitution. The Constitution is clear that senators are to be chosen by the direct vote of the people. , If the people do not choose, who is to make the appointment ? If the election which they have made is no election, and is void as though they had never made it, surely they are entitled to have another try at it ? Surely they are not to be told that somebody else is going to send a senator here? If the view of the Committee is correct - and that is the point to be determined - the Houses of Parliament of South Australia had no more right to send <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> here than this Senate had, or than the House of Representatives had, or than you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> would have had to call in a few men from the street, and make them draw lots as to who should come into the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- The "if" is the point to be decided bv the High Court. If the people have not made their choice, the first elementary cardinal condition of the Constitution has not been fulfilled. If a man is chosen in the proper way, the application of section 15 is perfectly clear. The question in this case is whether, where the people have not made a choice, the Houses of Parliament can make one for them. Is not that a proper question to determine? There is all the more virtue in the strong view which the Government take, from the fact that their own Attorney-General, before the judgment of the High Court in the mandamus proceedings, took a view which any man, even of his eminence, might fairly take. But the judgment of the High Court, in those proceedings, unsettles at least one of the main foundations upon which the Attorney-General's opinion rests. It is all the more creditable to the Government that they took on this question an excellent stand, although it is not the stand which I invited them to take the other day. They took a constitutional stand. They said, " In spite of the view which we entertained, we accept the resolution of the Senate, and adopt at once what we have felt all along was the proper course - to have the matter decided bv the highest tribunal in the country." Then why must there be an amendment of section 15? "There is no need for any amendment of it at all. If the people have made a choice, and there has been a subsequent . casual vacancy, then section 15 applies, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> is properly here. If the people made no choice, and there was no election, then section 15 does not apply, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> is not properly here. However difficult it may be to arrive at a solution of it, that is, after all, the whole simple issue. But its simplicity does not consist in what I think would be a stain upon the honour of the Senate in refusing to carry out its own resolution, which they have invited the Government to provide them with legislation to carry out, so that the High Court may determine the matter. I do not wish to allude to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> gibes. I suppose he thought that that was the proper way to garnish his speech. He is rather a master of gibes. When he said that clause 2 would satisfy every one on this side of the chamber, I expected him to add that it satisfied every one on his side also, because it is merely a clause which the Government were directed to frame in order to carry out the undivided resolution of the Senate.  His  statement was meant for a gibe, but I did not accept it in that way.  As  I have candidly said, I thought that the Senate  ought to have decided the question, and naturally decided it in conformity With our report. But when it has decided the question otherwise, I loyally adhere to its resolution and intend to assist the Government in carrying it out. I am not going to discuss - not even in a four hours' speech - the question which I discussed when I was moving the adoption of the Committee's report. Why should I go into the question again? What are we asked to do? We are asked to refer the discussion and decision of the question to another tribunal. Why should we open it up again? </para>

                            <para>- -That is exactly what I think. I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that I did not mean to speak on the second reading "of this Bill. No second-reading debate was necessary, and no division on the second reading is necessary, because it goes without saying that the principle of the Bill has been affirmed by the resolution. For reasons which were satisfactory to the Senate, it was felt that the report of the Committee should not be adopted, and that" a higher tribunal, which would not be open to the suggestions, however ill-founded, which were made in regard to the Committee, should deal with the question decisively. From that point of view it was determined to lay aside the report and to send the petition for settlement to the Court of Disputed Returns. This Bill is introduced for the purpose of enabling that course to be followed and that result to be achieved. I think it is a course which will give satisfaction to the people of this country. I believe it is one which the people of this country, as well as the people of South Australia, expect to be taken. I have no doubt whatever that, from one end of Australia to the other, wherever this question has been understood and considered, the people are looking forward with some eagerness to having the determination of the High Court as the Court of Disputed Returns on the right of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> to be here. I think, moreover, that if we in this Senate by some strange moral obliquity, should in defiance of our own resolution refuse to send the petition on for determination to the Court, the people of South Australia, the people of all Australia, will be bitterly disappointed. I think that if such result should come about we in this Senate, on reflection, will gravely regret and bitterly re pent the inauspicious and unfortunate course which we shall have taken. </para>

On the last occasion., I, a humble representative of labour - a farmer taken from the plough -  came within 1,802 votes of the honorable senator. I was well satisfied with my position. I am- sure that I do not need to tell the Senate why I am satisfied. Speaking, with his great eloquence, as a! party man, and fighting, as he did, with wealth in his pocket and with the National League behind him, is it not a wonder that labour came so near to him? </para>

Many a person in South Australia would have been hanged if it had not been for his grand eloquence.

                            <para>- Will the honorable senator allow me to proceed ? He also had four senators behind him when he made a fervent appeal for justice and on behalf of South Australia. When he moved the adoption of the report, what did he say? Practically he said that if the Senate did not accept the recommendation it would be treating the Committee with insult. I always like to be fair. If I stand up " here to submit a motion for a certain purpose, or to make any statements, I like to stay .until the question at issue has been threshed out, because the mover of a motion has the right of reply. On that occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> did not stay to exercise that right. I presume that he realized that the numbers were against him, and so he cleared out. If cannot be too extensively published that the report, as approved by five members of the Committee, was not- accepted by the Senate, but rejected, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> the leader of the party, "turned his back in the day  of battle. I wish, sir, that he would be quiet. It is most trying that he, my leading. opponent, should sit in front of me, practically on the Treasury bench. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator often does that. He speaks here as if he was one of the greatest men whom God had ever made. Among lawyers he is asking. When he expresses an opinion no little dog dare to bark. What did the Commonwealth Government do in this matter? The Attorney-General was consulted, another leading lawyer was consulted, and the Governor of South Australia, through you, sir, was advised as to what had happened, and the necessary steps to be taken to fill the vacancy. What did the Government of South Australia do then? The Price Government thought it wise and safe that the leading legal luminaries of South Australia should be consulted. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray, Mr. Glynn,</inline> and the Crown Solicitor - unbiased men, we presume them to be - were asked to give their opinion on the question; and' they, unknown to each other - at least' so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> was concerned - came to the same conclusion, and that was that the proper way in which to fill the vacancy was for the Houses of the State Parliament to sit together and choose a senator. The State Government - having no axe to . grind, I presume - took that course, and what happened then? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin,</inline> who. never put himself forward to ask for the nomination of any party, was written to and asked to allow  himself to be  nominated.  He consented, and so did the petitioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> was elected by an overwhelming majority by the two Houses of the South Australian Parliament sitting and . voting together. The result was communicated to him, and he is consequently here to-day. He has been pestered practically with the opposition of the Conservatives. It is the Conservatives, and not the other side, who complain that he is holding his seat illegally. I have not a word ta say against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon,</inline> but if it had fallen to his lot to have been elected by the South Australian Parliament, everything would have been all' right. There would have been no need to get a mandamus, and nothing would have been said about bringing back a -crown of victory from New South Wales. All that would have been knocked on the head. We are always being accused of being afraid to face the people. But we have nothing to fear. If there had been an election to the House of Representatives for the four districts of Adelaide. Hindmarsh, Boothby and Grey, Labour would have scooped the pool, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> would not be where he is to-day. I believe that the people of the State are still of the same mind. I mingle with them as well as does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> although the honorable senator would have us believe that he is the only representative of South Australia in the Senate. There are five other representatives of that State in the Senate, and we are all of one opinion in reference <inline font-style="italic">U&gt;</inline> this matter. We do not need to fear the people. The people are satisfied with matters as they stand. They recognise the special and wonderful efforts that have been made by the Conservatives to gain a seat. I do not wonder at the course which has been adopted. I have been in politics before. I know what takes place, even in this Senate, where party spirit should not be so strongly exhibited. The numbers on each side are so nearly equal that we can recognise the great difference it would make for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and the party he leads so grandly at times, to have one vote taken from this side and given to the other. We know that the result might be to give honorable senators opposite a majority instead of a minority in many divisions. We must consider that. We know that this party warfare is " all in the game," and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has said, the persistence of honorable senators opposite in attending when they expected this matter to come up for consideration has been most noticeable. </para>

I concluded my speech on the last occasion, in referring to the attendance of honorable senators, by a reference to a statement from a Presbyterian pulpit. I mentioned that a certain reverend gentleman attended a sitting of the House of Representatives, and there was such a poor attendance of honorable members that he went away disgusted, and never came back again. But if the Rev. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Rentoul,</inline> who is himself a champion, had been here when this matter was being discussed, I am sure he would have changed his opinion. </para>

The Senate had the power to deal with this matter, and was supposed under the law to deal with it. A majority ' of honorable senators refused to do so. The leader of a certain party turned his back in the day of battle and went off to Adelaide, and the honorable members of his party did not call for a division because they knew that the numbers, were up. Those who have been in politics for some time or know anything of political methods must be aware that once the numbers are up it is useless to divide the Senate. I believe, with other honorable senators on this side, that an injustice will- be done if this Bill is made retrospective. I need not say that I shall oppose any such proposal.

But I point out that in doing so they at least showed that, so far as labour is concerned, there was no interference by the caucus. If they had been true - I will withdraw that expression and sav that if they had seen otherwise, and had contented themselves with protesting against the motion instead of moving an amendment, and had stood by the party on this side- </para>

I think that I have put my position clearly. I was not prepared to make a speech on this question this afternoon ; but when a legal luminary and a colleague of my own. in the representation of South Australia, tries to trample on me as a mere worm, I. object, and I remind him that worms are known to turn. I stand here in the interests of the people of South Australia, and though I should be mistaken, I at least express what I mean. I am satisfied that I can speak for the democrats of South Australia, whom I have been sent here to represent, when I say that they are satisfied with the election of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin,</inline> and that if it should be necessary for him to appeal to the electors, they will remember the good services he rendered to the democracy of South Australia years ago, when, as a member of the Kingston Government, he helped to carry the banner of Liberalism, and will undoubtedly return him to the Senate with an overwhelming majority. </para>

                        <para>. - Two speeches to which we have listened this afternoon afford material, on the one hand for instruction, and on the other for very keen regret. The speech just delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell has been instructive as showing something of what we may assume to be the inner workings of the Labour mind. We have witnessed the spectacle of the honorable senator deliberately stating it as his opinion that- certain members of his party should have trampled on their principles and views in order to give a vote that would serve the interests of the party. </para>

                            <para>- I refuse to think that they would for a moment indorse the rebuke which the honorable senator has administered to Senators de Largie and Turley, when he said that they ought to have been loyal to their party, and could only have shown their loyalty in the way he wished by trampling on their principles and conscientious views. </para>

                            <para>- I should be the last man in the world to wish to do the honorable senator any injustice, but I can appeal to honorable senators who listened to him to say whether I have not correctly stated the views to which he gave expression. 1 now turn to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> extremely regrettable speech. The honorable senator declared, with a frankness which was rather unusual, that so far as he was concerned this was a purely party question. In view of the speech he delivered that statement was entirely unnecessary. It was obvious, both from the tone' and the argument of the honorable senator, that, so far as he was concerned, the merits of the case were never placed in the balance at all. It is merely a question of securing a party advantage by hook or by crook. The honorable senator said that the only difference between himself and those who sit on this side of the Senate was that we were equally animated by party feeling, but were, not frank enough to admit it, whereas he admitted the same party feeling, but claimed a measure of frankness, inasmuch as he acknowledged it. The honorable senator did me - and I believe others also, on this side of the chamber - a great injustice. I can place one or two facts before the Senate, and appeal to some of those who are present to justify the statement that, so far as I am individually concerned, I was absolutely free from any party feeling when I first approached the question. When- the Committee's report was first printed and circulated, I - as I assume that every other honorable senator did - gave it -such careful study and thought as I was capable of. I came to the conclusion that the report was unanswerable, and that the conclusion at which the Committee had arrived - that the seat was not properly filled by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> - could not be refuted. I felt that the only right thing to do was to support the adoption of the report. But, having arrived at that conclusion, I came to the Senate when the debate was in progress. I did not take part in it, but I listened carefully; and I had not listened very long before it became apparent to me that party feeling was gaining a hold on honorable senators, and was likely to lead the Senate to an exhibition which would not redound to its dignity and its credit. Seeing that, and being above all things desirous that party spirit should be kept out of this matter- - although I believed the Committee's report to be well founded, and that it should be adopted - I set to work to impress upon other members of the Senate that it would be better for our credit, however we viewed the Committee's report, to send the matter to the High Court. Now, I ask, was that an evidence of party spirit on my. part? </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend has done that. I prefer to keep straight on one side. I consulted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> while the debate was in progress, and before I knew that he intended to move an amendment. I submitted to him the draft of an amendment which I had drawn out with the view of giving effect to an opinion which had. formulated itself in my mind. I thought it better that the Senate should avoid an exhibition which would not have a tendency to strengthen this Chamber in the view of the public. It was then that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> showed me the amendment which he had prepared ; and as he aimed at the same thing as I did, and his proposition expressed my own intentions, I determined to support it rather than to proceed with my own amendment. In view of those facts, I think that a member of the Senate may reasonably claim that he has given some evidence of a desire to approach this matter free from party feeling. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> also assumed that the Opposition was animated by party feeling, because when the subject was last before the Senate the Opposition was present in some strength. If the presence of the Opposition in strength is evidence of party feeling, where was the party feeling last Friday when the second reading of this Bill was moved, and when there was no member of the Opposition ready to take up the debate? I knew that this matter was coming on. I was not present on Friday.

                            <para>- The honorable senator can take my assurance that they we not about. If there had been anything like a party whip, there would have been present members of the Opposition who. as a matter of fact, are many miles away today. I need refer only briefly to the main principles, because they have been amply dealt with by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> Every speech that we have heard has shown the absolute necessity of referring this matter to the High Court. Honorable senators on one side and the other have emphatically expressed their opinions as to what section 15 of the Constitution means, and as to whether or not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> has a right to sit in the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> was absolutely confident that section 15 bears the construction that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> is entitled to sit here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> .was equally emphatic in the opposite direction. Both of them, as a matter of fact, were just as emphatic as were many good citizens of this Commonwealth before a certain event took place yesterday. We know the way in which many of those citizens took the opportunity of indorsing their opinions. The very fact that these contradictory opinions do prevail - and we assume that they prevail in all honesty, and that they are <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> opinions - are evidence of what? </para>

                            <para>- But the honorable senator has said that it is as clear as day light. What are we to do with a section which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> says that he has no difficulty in interpreting, when others interpret it in quite an opposite direction ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is in absolute agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that the section is clear. It is clear to both of them, and it is clear to me. But it is only when we come to draw deductions from the pellucid depths of' this section that we find there is a conflict as to what it really means. Under these circumstances, there is, in my opinion, but one course to follow, and that is the course which has been taken by the Government with the approval of the whole Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> argued that if the section were not clear we should submit to the people an amendment of it. But can the honorable senator show me ai single section that was ever drafted, or a single sentence or phrase dealing with a legal question that was ever written, in which there was not the possibility of doubt? If it were not so, we should not need Courts of justice or any of the legal machinery which to-day we find to be absolutely essential. The founders of the Constitution and the electors to whom it was submitted knew perfectly well <inline font-style="italic">'that,</inline> no matter what ingenuity or subtlety or capacity might be brought to bear in adapting the sections of the Constitution, doubts would be bound to arise. For that reason they called into existence the High Court, which is at once the interpreter and guardian of the Constitution. That brings me to this conclusion - that the very fact that these differences of opinion prevail shows that a question has been raised which can only be finally and properly determined by the High Court. If we adopted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> suggestion, provided a new section 15, and sent it to the electors for their approval, we should still be faced with the possibility of a doubt arising when the new section came to be interpreted. </para>

                            <para>- There might be a mistake even then. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> does not propose to make every election a popular one. I judge that because I do not think that he would be foolish enough to plunge the whole of the State into an election for the Senate perhaps within a week of a general" election. But if we were to follow out his line of argument a little further, and because some doubt has arisen as to' a section, instead of referring it for decision to the High Court, seek an amendment of the Constitution, we might as well refer every section of the Constitution to the electors when a doubt arose. There is hardly a section of the major working sections of the Constitution about which there is not some measure of doubt - some reasonable opportunity for legal minds to see some difference of construction or interpretation. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> proposes would apply to every section about which there is dispute. Surely he will see at once that when a doubt arises the proper authority to determine it is the High Court itself. Such a doubt did arise in this case. The matter was brought before the Senate in the form of a petition.I should like to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that that petition still lies upon the table of the Senate. If we adopt his suggestion, and strike out clause 2 of the Bill, what does he propose  to do with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon's</inline> petition, which is still current and undecided? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> when the matter was last before the Senate, by his silence gave assent to the proposition that we should refer it to the High Court. If he now proposes to go back upon that view, what does he propose to do with the petition? I observe that the honorable senator is too busily engaged to answer my question. </para>

                        and those who think with him, joined in that request to the Government to bring in legislation to enable the matter to be referred to the High Court. What did they mean by the request, if lurking in their hearts there was a determination to defeat and destroy that legislation when it was brought forward? Such an attitude was lacking in common honesty. The honorable senator then sought to get rid of his major difficulty by appearing to lend countenance to this reasonable and wise alternative course.

To give effect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> views, would not settle the matter. The petition would still be here, and we should have to fight over again the question which I thought we settled a fortnight ago. I am as certain as a man can be that, if the petition did come forward again, the Senate-would pass another resolution directing that it should be referred to the High Court. Are we going to travel round in a circle in that way, acting like a lot of children, or inmates of a lunatic asylum? </para>

                            <para>- Then I gather that the honorable senator is going to make a vigorous whip to defeat the Bill. I know nothing about the probable numbers. When the first Electoral Bill was before us we strove as well as we were able to provide that all matters of this kind should be lifted clean out of the parliamentary arena and transferred to a Court within the judicial atmosphere of which they could more properly be determined. Apparently we did not succeed, although I and a number of others, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and,  I  believe, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> had that end in view. - All that this Bill seeks to do is to give effect to that policy. There might be some force in the argument about the Bill being retrospective if the petition had teen dealt with. But it is still here - a current, live petition. If we destroy clause  2,  we shall still find ourselves face to face with the problem, " What are you going to do with Vardon's petition ?" This Bill opens up, at this stage of the proceedings at any rate, the only reasonable and satisfactory prospect of disposing of the petition. We send it to the Court, with the full knowledge that the Constitution will be respected, that every party to it will stand upon an equal footing, and that the decision will be given without fear, favour, or bias. </para>

                        (South Australia) [5. 53]- - I have not spoken on this matter previously, for obvious reasons, but now that the report of the Committee has been dealt with and we have before us a Bill which proposes to transfer the power to deal with the question from the Senate to the High Court. I may be permitted to say a few words. I entirely approve of the proposal to transfer this matter to the High Court. There will be no material opposition to that proposal in the Senate, although some honorable senators have very natural objections to what is, if not retrospective, at any rate
                        <inline font-style="italic">ex -post facto</inline>
                        legislation, dealing with a particular matter after the events which have led up to it have already transpired. I did not understand

                        remarks to bear quite the construction which some honorable senators have put upon them. The honorable senator's argument about the amendment of the Constitution was pertinent to this extent, that if section 15 is not amended, the objection raised so emphatically by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline>
                        - that the people of any State may be deprived of  their right of representation - will still remain. While section 15 remains in the Constitution that contingency may occur at any moment. It has occurred on three previous occasions. I am not the only senator who has held a seat, not by the popular will, but by another means provided by the Constitution, and therefore approved of by the people of Australia, just as' much as the popular election of senators was approved of by them. It matters little to the people whether they are deprived of their right through some mistake in the first place, or whether, immediately after they have made a choice, that choice is rendered void by resignation, death, disability, disqualification, or any of the numerous means that are provided for in the Constitution, and if then the right of electing a senator devolves upon what
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline>
                        has very properly described as an inferior body. But that disability arises under the Constitution itself. I do not think it is any greater hardship to the people of any State to be deprived of that right by the blunders of some official, than by the dishonesty or disability of the senator elected. What difference does it make to the people? In either case they are deprived of their right. In this particular case, apart from the numerous blunders and difficulties that arose, the (people of South Australia would have been deprived of their right by the hand of Providence in any case. The man who was elected - I was astonished to hear

                        <para>I am satisfied that I must look at this as another set of instances in which votes have been thrown away through the fault of officers in not doing as the Act ordains. Here there were no initials at all, in face of the express and unmistakable requirement in the Statute. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piper's</inline> argument as to authenticity is ingenious, but I cannot help remembering that there is no suggestion that even one person who was not a qualified elector was allowed to cast any of the -votes under review. As they were all honest attempts to vote, it is clear I can look at them for the purpose of seeing whether they would have affected the result had the Court allowed them as valid. It is manifest that they would have done so, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon's</inline> majority of two over <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby</inline> would have been converted into a minority of four. Therefore, unlike the <inline font-style="italic">si</inline> votes in parcel A, they certainly must have affected the result, and so I cannot apply sec. 200. </para>

                    <para class="block">That means section 200 of the Electoral Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton held that he was entitled to consider the effect of those votes upon the election. If there had been no mistake of any sort, if every official concerned in the election had done his duty, those votes would have been properly initialed and counted, and the late lamented Dugald Augustus Crosby would have been elected as senator. He would have been declared to be a senator. He died, unfortunately for South Australia. Section 15 of the Constitution would clearly have applied, and the result would have been exactly as it is to-day. Therefore, if the people of South 'Australia have been deprived of any right, it was by the hand of Providence and by the wording of the Constitution, which provides that casual vacancies are to be filled in a certain way. The Bill practically  consists of two parts - one dealing specially with the petition which is- still before the Senate, and the other making some general alterations in the Electoral Act. There are different means of deciding disputed elections in different States. In some cases Committees of the Houses act as a Court with full powers to decide. In South Australia, with whose Constitution I am most familiar, there is a Committee which has given very general satisfaction, and which combines the advantages of a Committee of 'the House with the constitution of a. Court, inasmuch as it is presided over by a Judge of the Supreme Court. The very greatest care is taken in the selection of that Committee to see that it is as fairly representative as possible. It is held that no member of the Government is entitled to a seat on it, for fear of party bias, and, for the same  reason, I think that the leader of the Opposition should certainly not have a position on it. It applies in exactly the same way. The members practically constitute a jury ; the Judge conducts the proceedings, and lays down the law, and the decision of the Court, whatever it may be, is final. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that the decision of these questions should be removed from the arena of party feeling, and intrusted to an independent and impartial Court. That view has been strongly emphasized by the proceedings on the petition of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon.</inline> The Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications was composed of a preponderating number of senators from one side of the Chamber. That may have arisen, not from any party motive, or with any ulterior idea of securing party advantage, but merely from the fact that very little attention was paid to the nomination, and also from the fact that it was generally understood that the decision of such questions had been transferred to the Court of Disputed Returns. </para>

Another objection to the trial of these questions by a Select Committee is that its members, coming, as in this case, hot from an election contest, may be called upon to sit in judgment on a political opponent, or, what is quite as objectionable, on the claims of a candidate who has run on the same ticket and under the same party banner. </para>

I have no means of ascertaining the views of its members, except from the report, the addendum - which, according to our Standing Orders, had no right to be attached, as it is only permissible for a member of a Select Committee to enter a protest or dissent from a report - and the speeches. Every honorable senator can read plain English. The report, signed by the  Chairman,  and acquiesced' in by five of its members, recommended that the Senate should accede to the prayer of the petitioner, and an addendum, signed by two "other senators, suggested that another tribunal, and not the Senate, should decide the question. If that is not a direct negative, I do not know what is. </para>

                                Largie stated distinctly then that he did not agree with the main proposition laid down in the report namely, that

                                had never had a term in- the Senate. Did he not put this question to the Senate : " Have we not seen with our own eyes that he did have a term of service here ?" Surely

                                will admit that a remark of that kind shows that

                                Largie did not agree with the report ! Later on,

                                said that he could not vote for the adoption of the report. If he had agreed to the draft report, that was a somewhat extraordinary statement to come from him.

I was pointing out that, in the cases of disputed returns and qualifications an inquiry by a Judge, as in South Australia, is more judicial and much less open to objection than is an inquiry by a Select Committee composed of members of the House concerned, because in the latter case party feeling must necessarily, I think - and, probably, honestly - come into play, and instead of getting ;in impartial and unbiased report from a Judge, after summing up the two sides of the case and drawing his own conclusions fairly and judiciously, we may get, and I must honestly say that in the present case we did get, a one-sided report. </para>

                            <para>- I shall revert to my plan of putting a hypothetical case. Where party feelings come into play, we get a report of a one-sided nature, where assertion and assumption take the place of argument and demonstration, and where, instead of getting an impartial summing up by a Judge, we have a partisan statement. There is before another place a measure to remove the decision of these cases from the Court of Disputed Returns to a SelectCommittee of the House concerned.I have not seen a copy of the Bill, but I have heard the proposal commented upon a good deal, especially since this case has come before the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- It is a bad principle, I think, but it is advocated on the score of economy. I was rather startled to learn from a statement by the author of the Bill, who has gone through the turmoil and difficulty of a disputed election, that it cost him£1,000 before he succeeded either in securing the seat or getting the other party unseated. I am not familiar with the particulars of the case, but I have heard that part of the cost of each party was defrayed by the Government. For a time there was a feeling amongst some members of Parliament, both here and elsewhere, that it would be desirable to transfer the decision of such questions from the Court to the House concerned. In my opinion, the Bill is as dead now as a door-nail, because I am satisfied that the proceedings on this petition must have convinced every one of the danger that is run in allowing such cases to be decided according, to party feeling and prejudice. I know that a good many senators, who were rather inclined at first to support the proposal, are now of an entirely opposite opinion. I believe there is very little probability of a Bill of that sort becoming law. I desire to enter an emphatic protest against attempts which have been made, particularly in South Australia, to discredit and misrepresent the attitude of the Labour Party on this question. At the time of my selection by the State Parliament it was stated in a portion of the Adelaide press that the Labour Party were resorting to a dodge to secure a seat; that, although they had at all times stated that they favoured the principle of popular election, yet, in this case, they arranged to have a different procedure adopted. It was reported that the election of a senator by the State Parliament was the result of the machinations of the Labour Party. It has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, who was deeply concerned in the whole matter, that neither the Labour Party nor any other party had anything to do with the adoption of that method. In the first place, it was intimated by the Attorney - General, who had looked into the matter with a view to seeing whether it was necessary for the Department of Home Affairs to prepare for an election, that a casual vacancy in the representation of South Australia had occurred, and that the procedure for the filling of that vacancy was laid clown in section 15 of the Constitution. The State Government were not content to act upon that intimation. They consulted the Crown Solicitor, and had his advice fortified by the opinion of two eminent counsel in South Australia, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray,</inline> K.C., who is one of the highest constitutional authorities we have - a lecturer on constitutional law at the Adelaide University, and a man who, if he has any leanings at all, are probably towards the party with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> is associated rather than towards the Labour Party. Fortified by the unanimous opinion of all the counsel whom they consulted, the State Governor summoned the Parliament to meet to elect a senator to fill the vacancy. The members of both Houses had nothing to do but to obev that mandate. They had no voice in the adoption of the method: Neither House had an opportunity of expressing an opinion or passing a. vote on that subject ; it would have been utterly unconstitutional for them to do so. When the two Houses sat together, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> and myself were nominated, and I was chosen. From that time until the present day a portion of the local press has persistently taunted the Labour Party with having thrown awav their principles with regard to popular election, and brought about the choice of a senator by the State Parliament. In its issue of  2nd  November, the <inline font-style="italic">South Australian Register</inline> refers to this Bill, and after explaining its provisions, it concludes with this passage - </para>

He is a neighbour of mine, and I have had many friendly chats with him on this matter during the time it has been <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> I believe that our mutual feelings are those of esteem and friendship; but the fact remains that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was not elected by the people. On the authority of the High Court <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby</inline> was elected. It is not fair to say that I hold my position here at the expense of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> or any one else. Should the decision of the High Court, to which I hope and believe the question will be referred, be against the validity of my occupancy of the seat, I shall have been only in the same position as that occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> for five months, when he, in the words of the <inline font-style="italic">Register</inline> paragraph, " enjoyed the privileges, emoluments, and voting power of a senator." It is quite unfair when a man has been elected to a seat in the Senate in a manner provided for by the Constitution to say that he holds his position at the expense of any one else. I rather resented <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> 's expression that I hold " a tainted title " to the seat. I hold my position here exactly as other members of the Senate hold theirs, since, in common with them, I have been elected in a manner provided for by the Constitution. </para>

I quoted from authorities to show that, according to the practice of the House of Commons in the case of a disputed election, even the death of one of the parties does not prevent the matter from being carried on to a final settlement. It will be admitted that that is only fair, because in such a matter the interests of others are involved as well as those of the parties to the petition. I came across a record of a case which occurred some years ago. in South Australia, which illustrates the point I wish to make.

                            <para>- I have no doubt that this Bill will be passed by both Houses of the Federal Parliament, and that we shall have the decision of the High Court on the matter. That decision I am willing to accept. I may say just as honestly that if the decision on the report of the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications had been against me, I should not have been satisfied to accept the verdict given by a majority of my political opponents in the Senate. I shall, however, be prepared to accept the decision of the High Court, which will settle the point involved in this case for all time. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell has alluded to the matter, I wish to say in regard to my own position in connexion with it, that I have not in any way sought the position I occupy. My name was not mentioned in connexion with the vacancy up to within a day or two&gt; of the date on which the two Houses of the State Parliament met to make their selection. I do not mean- to say that I had not been approached in the matter.. As soon as the vacancy occurred I was approached by prominent members of - different parties in the State Parliament, and urged to allow myself, to be nominated. I persistently declined.  I can assure the Senate that, as my colleagues from South Australia know very well, I had no desire at that particular time to enter the arena of active politics. It was not without some sacrifices that I consented to allow myself to be nominated for the vacancy. I was approached not only  by members of my own party, but by members of the Independent Party and members of both Houses of the State Parliament, to allow myself to be nominated. I may here point out that the Labour Party in the South Australian Parliament were not 'able of themselves to secure my election, since at a joint sitting of both Houses of the Parliament, and of over sixty members, they represented  only  about one-third. It was only by the conjunction of the Labour and1 Liberal  Parties  in the State Parliament that my election was secured. As I have said, I had to make some sacrifices to accept the position. I had to give up mv position , : a. trustee of the Savings Bank, with which I was connected for several years, and ir» which I took a deep interest. I had also to give up the position of-  Chairman  of various Wages Boards iri connexion with which I think I may without undue modesty claim that I did some good and successful work in reconciling conflicting views of employers and employes, in connexion with cases on. which I was called upon to adjudicate. It was also inconvenient for many private reasons that I should take the position. I can only say in conclusion what I said at the first public gathering that I attended after my election, that while I considered it "a high honour te* have been elected by a majority of the members of the State Legislature, of which I had myself been a member for many years, I recognised that there was a higher tribunal than the High Court or the Parliament of the State, and that was the people, the highest tribunal of all. I said also that if the matter was to be decided by the High Court, and it was then as I understood going before the High Court, and the decision of that tribunal was that there should be an appeal to the people, I should welcome it, and be prepared to abide by the result. </para>

Prior to dealing with them, I may state that I should not have risen in my place had it not been for the accusation made from the other side that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> is here with a " tainted title." Now, I consider that those words used concerning a senator who is" here as the representative of the people of South Australia, were an absolute slander upon the people of that State and upon their representatives in Parliament, who would not have been guilty of sending to the Senate a person with what might fairly be described as a " tainted title." The honorable senator who made use of those words did not employ them at random, because no member of this Senate is more capable of choosing his language. </para>

Suppose that a petition was lodged against his return. In that case, would there have to be a fresh election, or would not the new senator have to be chosen by the Parliament of the State concerned?

                            <para>- He would not be eligible, but the fact might not be discovered for a considerable time after. Would not such a case be dealt with under section 15 of the Constitution, and the substitute be elected by the Parliament of the State? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> stated that the bed-rock on which he based the whole of his argument was that the senator must be chosen by the people. I have instanced a case where a man might be returned by an overwhelming majority, and yet be ineligible to sit in the Senate. Again, suppose that a senator during his tenure of office became insolvent. . My opinion is that section 15 of the Constitution was inserted expressly to deal with such cases. At any rate, I am quite sure that the framers of the Constitution, when explaining it to the people, and urging them to accept it, did not tell them that in the event of the seat of a senator becoming vacant, the country would have to go to the expense of a fresh election in every case. Had they done so, a very large number of those who voted for the acceptance of the Constitution would have hesitated to do so, because they would have felt that to hold a special election for the choice of a senator would be altogether too expensive a matter. Again, it is possible that a person attainted of treason in some part of the British Dominions might come to Australia and be elected to the Senate. It is possible that the fact that he had been attainted of treason would not be discovered for a considerable time afterwards. What would happen in such a case ? Would there have to be an election by the State? We have- had, in, some of the States, cases of Americans who have come to Australia, have failed to renounce the oath of allegiance to the Republic of America, have been returned to a State Parliament, and have had to vacate their seats. The same might occur in relation to the Senate. In such a case, I maintain that the people would have chosen, but chosen wrongly. At the last Senate election in South Australia, the people made their choice, but through the blundering of officials the election was upset. The Crown law officers of the Commonwealth and of the State, fortified by the best legal opinions that could be obtained in Adelaide, advised that there should be an election by the State Parliament.. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> is here with that title. If there is a flaw in the Constitution, let us have it amended,  and" make the meaning clear. </para>

Probably the honorable senator himself may, in Committee, move or support an amendment. I hold that I have al perfect right, even " though a resolution has been passed by the Senate in a certain direction, to express my opinion on this Bill, and as to what I thinK is the right course to adopt.

                        <para>-5Sl- - I should not have taken part in the debate except for the tenor of the remarks made this afternoon by an honorable senator, who, I thought, had a very good innings when this matter was last under consideration . When the report of the Disputed Returns and Qualifications Committee was submitted to the Senate, the  Chairman  made a very strong speech of a partisan character. Halving then exercised his opportunity to present the question from his own stand-point, I should have thought that he would have been content to allow the present Bill to go through without indulging in any more of that kind of advocacy. For my own part, I have tried from! the first - to deal with this matter apart from party considerations. I recognised that if the party element were introduced into !the question, it would be very hard indeed to do justice to it. But because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Turley</inline> and I took up that attitude it has been said that we recognised the soundness of a report which from the first we were wholly against. Those who have made that charge against us would have done us and themselves much more credit if they had omitted any reference to us. If we had been disposed to treat this matter from a party aspect, we knew all along. that we had the numbers behind us, and could have settled the question in our own way. But we refused to take advantage of our numbers. We have, however, received no credit for that, and an attempt has been made to foist upon us an adherence to a report to which every member of the Committee 'must have known that we were entirely opposed. Because we refused to take up a partisan- attitude, we have been charged with giving countenance to a report which could not be looked upon as other than a purely partisan document. </para>

The most regrettable aspect of to-day's debate has been the personal references to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin.</inline> Very few could take exception to that honorable senator's conduct in this Chamber.  His  attitude towards those who are in opposition <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> him has not been that of a bitter partisan, and, in view of the position which he occupies at present, it was a great mistake on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> to make the personal references to him which he made to-day. I am convinced that a satisfactory solution can only be arrived at in this case by sending the whole question to the High Court, in order that it may obtain there what apparently it cannot obtain in this Chamber. When a question of this kind has to be fought out on the floor of any legislative Chamber, it is settled, not according to the merits of the case, but according to the numbers of the political parties there represented. </para>

                            <para>- Whether it is a reflection or not, I am sure that nine-tenths of the members of this Chamber will agree with me. I hope that this will be the last we shall ever hear of petitions of this kind coming before the Senate. When the Electoral Act was passed I was under the belief that we had so arranged matters that disputes of this kind would no longer come before the Senate, and I must confess that when the Disputed Returns and Qualifications Committee were appointed, I wondered what they were appointed for, because I understood that the Electoral Act had entirely done away with their functions. I hope that this Bill will be effectual in referring all such disputes to the Court, and that the Senate will have no more of these regrettable incidents. to settle. </para>

                        <para>. - The more this case is discussed, the more extraordinary it appears to be. Any one who knows its history will agree that, while the petitioner may have the- law on his side, the Parliament of South Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin,</inline> who is here as their choice, have all the facts on their side. It is admitted that, but for the negligence of the returning officer, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby</inline> would have been declared elected. Seeing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby</inline> died, and that the people had declared, so far as they were able to do so, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby</inline> was their choice, his opponents, the National Defence League, ought to have been satisfied in the circumstances to let the matter stand where it did. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> declared this afternoon in very strong and eloquent terms in favour of an appeal being made to the people to enable them to choose their man. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby</inline> was unmistakably the choice of the people. </para>

                    <para class="block">He was not defeated because the people did not vote for 'him. He was defeated, I will not say because of an intentional oversight, but because of neglect on the part of the returning officer. I hope that that man will never again be placed in charge of an election. In any case, the very thing which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> seems to desire so anxiously had been done. The people had declared their preference for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby</inline> by a majority of votes. As he died, it was unmistakably the duty of the South Australian Parliament, under the Constitution, to fill the vacancy ; but, of course, the National Defence League took advantage of a technicality. The returning officer did not initial' certain ballot-papers. A number of electors were deprived of their votes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby</inline> was fourth on the list, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was declared elected. That was the position . up to a certain point. We know the history of the affair since, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> is here to-day, but not with a " tainted title." That epithet came with a very bad grace from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon. Senator O'Loghlin</inline> has been duly elected by the South Australian Parliament according to the Constitution. That Parliament took action only after the South Australian Government had been fortified by the opinions of eminent legal authorities, and believed that it was doing what was right under the Constitution. Its action was perfectly constitutional, and, so far, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin's</inline> right to sit here is without taint. I intend to vote for the second reading of the Bill. As the Senate declared on a previous occasion that the whole matter should be referred to the High Court, it is not at all desirable that we should go back upon that decision now. Previous to that decision, however, I was prepared to take my stand upon the validity of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin's</inline> election, and to vote for declaring his election to' be perfectly valid. I have given notice of an amendment upon the Bill involving a matter which has relation to the principal Act, but not to the subject-matter of the Bill itself. Before I can move that amendment I must give notice of an instruction to the Committee. But I shall not be able to do so if the second reading is carried to-night, except by leave of the Senate. If honorable senators feel that I ought to have an opportunity of ventilating the matter, I shall be very glad if they will give me leave to move that instruction. </para>

                        <para>.- If any justification was required for the introduction of this measure, it has been completely supplied by the debate which has taken place this afternoon. Even at this attenuated stage of the debate, when feeling has become more or less exhausted with regard to the question, Ave find that we could not deal with it without the introduction of a heated party conflict and even of the personal element. This shows conclusively, no matter how we may seek to disguise it, that neither this Senate nor any other political body is judicially qualified to deal with a matter of the kind. We felt that that was so when we passed the Electoral Act. We recognised then, that in fairness to ourselves and in justice to the parties concerned these questions could not be judicially dealt with by any branch of the Legislature, but should be remitted to a judicial tribunal which was free of partisan feeling. Even if that was the only ground, the introduction of this' measure has been completely justified. But the position goes much further. After deliberate and lengthy discussion, the Senate resolved that complicated questions of constitutional law were involved, and that the petition should therefore be remitted to the High Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell have delivered very heated speeches this afternoon. . </para>

I should, have said that they, amongst others, delivered heated speeches, but it is only fair to them to say that I was aware of their personal views. They most strongly protested to me against the introduction of a Bill which they considered was of a retrospective character, and they pave me notice of their intention to oppose it. I accept their intimation, not as an indication of an intention to seek to defeat the Bill, but as a protest, recognising, as they are obliged to do, that they must yield to the almost unanimous resolution of the Senate that this question should be referred to the Court of Disputed Returns. I do not believe for a moment that they intend to oppose the Bill at any stage with any degree of bitterness. Indeed, having regard to the fact that they are practically alone in-, active opposition to its enactment, I do not see how in decency they could do so. </para>

There have been one or two objections made, which I am somewhat at a loss to understand. The first objection is that the proper course to follow is to alter the Constitution. I assure honorable senators that that is not the proper legal course to pursue, because under the circumstances an alteration ot the Constitution is not required. That is not a mere dictum on my part, but is part and parcel of the judgment of the High Court in the mandamus case. Under section 47 of the Constitution we have the power to deal with this matter, and the High Court gives us guidance and assistance in its judgment, where it says - </para>

Parliament can, no doubt, confer authority to decide such a question upon this Court, whether as a Court of Disputed Returns or otherwise.

                            <para>- I am very much obliged to my honorable friend for his remark. I trust that I am at liberty to vote as I think proper. I voted for an adjournment of the debate, and therefore it does not lie in the mouth of my honorable friend to reproach me for having given that vote. The measure carries out the wish of the Senate, and I hope that, having made their protests, my honorable friends will see fit to withdraw their opposition so that the Bill may be passed with the same unanimity as that with which the Senate came to its resolution. I desire, in conclusion, to mention that so soon 'as the words were struck out of the motion of the leader of the Opposition for the adoption of the report of the Committee, I was only too glad to fall back upon what, as was known to honorable senators, was my original idea, and that was that this constitutional question should be referred for decision to the Court of Disputed Returns. I trust that throughout it's stages the measure will receive unanimous support from honorable senators. </para>

Standing order  31 ob  provides specifically that an instruction to a Committee of the Whole requires notice.

This Bill has a specific object, and it has its limitations. It was brought in in deference to the express resolution of the Senate. I do not see how it could be done this session, but certainly next session it is the intention of the Government to introduce a Bill to amend and consolidate the electoral, law. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> should attempt to introduce his amendment, and other honorable senators should submit any amendments, he will see that the object of the measure would be to some extent frustrated, and that it would lead to an unwarrantably lengthy debate. In view of my assurance that we intend to introduce an amending Bill next session, and also in view of the scope of this measure, I ask mv honorable friend, if he can see his way, not to- press his proposal. </para>

                        (South Australia) [8.36]. - Before we pass from clause 2 I should like to have the question cleared up as to who is to bear the expense of this appeal to the High Court. If there is any excuse at all for unprecedented and extraordinary legislation of this character, it is that which has been advanced by honorable senators in expressing the general desire that the high constitutional question involved should be settled by the highest Court in the land. But it is hardly fair that individuals should be put to expense  in the settlement of a constitutional Question in this way. For myself, I have only to say that I have no money to waste in feeing lawyers in appealing to the High Court to settle a principle of this kind. I do not think that it would be fair to myself, to
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon,</inline>
                        or to whoever else might test the matter before the High Court, that we should be put to the expense which would necessarily be involved in the argument of the matter before the Court. I think the "Vice-President of the Executive Council pointed out that the High Court indicated that they are prepared to deal with the matter. I am inclined to infer from that that the honorable senator meant that the High Court was prepared to give a decision on this particular point at the time the mandamus proceedings were before it, but, recognising that it was a matter for the Senate, they refrained from doing so. ' I think the words they used were that they reserved judgment upon it. If that be so, and they merely reserved judgment, is there any reason at all why further expense should be incurred in connexion with this case? I. should like to hear the Vice-President of the Executive Council on the subject. If important sections of the Constitution require to be authoritatively interpreted, it should not rest upon individuals to bear the expense involved.

                            <para>- What suggested itself to my mind was that the High Court, having had the whole matter before them, and having, as they said, reserved judgment, there should be no reason for further expense in connexion with the case. Of course expense has been incurred already. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was put to expense, and the case was decided against him. A harder case still was that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blundell,</inline> who lodged the original petition, successfully established his case, and still had to bear considerable expense. I think this is the proper time to raise the question. When the mandamus proceedings were before the High Court there was some question as to who should defend the matter, and I told the Attorney-General and the members of the State Parliament that as I was not made a party to those proceedings I did not intend to intervene, and was willing to. let the High Court decide the question raised without argument. I was not prepared to take any steps to prevent the Court ordering an appeal to the people or deciding the case in any way they thought fit. I do not think it is fair that individuals should be called upon to bear the expense of testing such a matter before the High Court. </para>

                            <para>- No. I point out to the honorable senator that within forty- days after the election of any member of the Senate it is competent for any one to challenge his right to the position to which he claims to have been elected. So in the case of any election under section 15, it is competent for any one to challenge the election in the ordinary way. Persons do not as a rule care to have their right to a position challenged, their property claimed, or any rights alleged against them involving them in litigation. But that is their misfortune, and for us to attempt to provide for this specific case by proposing the adoption, of some out-of-the-way course with regard to the payment of costs would be a very unusual proceeding, and one which I think the Committee could hardly entertain. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend will see that the same may be said of a large percentage of law cases. The decision in one case after another follows on some decision in a case which may have been tried at a very remote period before, in connexion with which the original litigants had to be at the expense of securing the interpretation of the law and the ascertainment of rights. In this particular matter, I think we may be permitted to express the opinion that the High Court will be very fully seized of all the arguments having regard to the fact that the mandamus proceedings took place before the Full Court of five Judges of the High Court, and was argued for a period of five days by learned counsel representing, not only <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon,</inline> but also the intervenant, the Attorney-General. and, of course, the Governor of the State of South Australia. In all the circumstances I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> will see that so far as any parties interested in the case are concerned, there should be occasion for but little expense, having regard to the full knowledge which the Court has of all the legal aspects of the case. </para>

                            <para>- No, I do not take that view. I take the view that I have . expressed before, that this is not special legislation. It is merely the means by which the Senate refers a case to the High Court which individuals could refer to that Court without legislation. There is nothing special about it. I sympathize with much that 'has been said. The origin of the whole proceedings was the blundering of officials acting under the Commonwealth. Then there was a petition which brought' the matter before the Court of Disputed Returns, upon which a certain order was made that was the foundation of subsequent proceedings before the Senate. In consequence, steps were taken which I think were erroneous, but which other honorable senators think were quite right. Those steps were taken upon an opinion given by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth - that is to say, practically at the instance of the Government. We have a precedent in relation to the matter in Chanter's case. I believe I am correct in saying that in that case a vote was subsequently passed by Parliament reimbursing the parties for the expense incurred. </para>

That matter could not be settled until the case is disposed of. We do not know what parties the Court will direct to appear before it. The whole procedure is very properly left in the hands of the Court. I think the Government have acted wisely in so providing. When the matter is disposed of it will be for the Government to consider, as in the former case, the question of reimbursing the parties whom the High Court may direct to appear before it. It would be out of place to provide for that matter here. We cannot provide for the expenditure of money. </para>

There ought to be an understanding that when the matter is finally determined an adjustment of expenses with the parties shall be made by the Government. Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon, Senator O'Loghlin,</inline> nor the electors of South Australia are responsible for the position in which we find ourselves. But suppose another election is ordered. Who will have to bear the expense of that? Would it be the petitioner? If so, it will be very unfair to him. If, on the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> were involved in expense it would be very unfair to him. I suggest that progress might be reported in order to give honorable senators an opportunity of seeing an amendment in print to carry out <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> suggestion. </para>

                        <para>. - I have no particular objection to the amendment,  but I think that we have been rather drawn off the line of thought to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin's</inline> remarks directed us. I would point out that this amendment aims at the limitation of expenses. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin's</inline> point was not as to whether the expense would be great dr little, but as to who was to bear it. We  have drifted from that into the discussion of quite a minor point. We appear to be moving a mountain, and, possibly, producing a mouse. The parties who admitted before the Committee of the Senate the facts in the petition will, in all probability, be equally ready to admit them before the Court, and the expense of summoning the  Clerk  of the Senate to carry the documents to the Court is not worth talking about. As the whole trouble has arisen through the blunders of officials, who were the agents of the Government, the Government ought, when the proper time arrives, to shoulder the expense, as has been done in other cases, both Federal and State. </para>

                            <para>-  I do not propose to put it forward as an amendment, but it is reasonable to voice my views before the time arrives to "foot the bill." It is better, to make this statement before we know who the parties are whose expenses will have to be reimbursed. The view that the Government should pay the expenses is, I think, supported by a majority of honorable senators. </para>
