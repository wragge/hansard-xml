                        <para>- I desire to ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, without notice, a question with regard to proposed additions to the post office at Port Pirie. I desire to ascertain whether, instead of patching up an old building, which is in an exceedingly inconvenient and dangerous position, the Government will consider the advisability of getting a report on the question of obtaining a new site in a more convenient place, and that will be less dangerous to the public ? </para>

                        <para>- If I remember rightly, the Director of Public Works for Victoria was sent to South Australia for the express purpose of reporting on that question. Originally, I think there was an idea of procuring a fresh site and erecting a new building, and it was on his recommendation that it was decided that it would be possible to make the necessary alterations and repairs to the present post office building, and avoid additional expense. </para>

                            <para>. This is a motion which should hardly be passed without receiving a little consideration. It is a well-known fact that in past, times documents of this kind have been&gt; printed, and that on a definite motion by one House or the other have been printed' again. An enormous expense has been unnecessarily incurred in that way. The Printing Committee of the Senate has agreed to hold a joint meeting every week with the Printing Committee of another place, when all these questions will be properly considered. I can assure honorable senators that so far as the Printing Committee is concerned, every necessary document will be published, but at the same time care will be taken to prevent any duplication of printing. </para>

                            <para>. - For two or three reasons I must ask. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to withdraw the motion. If it were negatived it would mean that a member of the Printing Committee would have to come to the Senate and! move that the paper be printed. As a matter of fact, it has already been printed in Brisbane, and it is probable that an arrangement will be made whereby the necessary number of copies of the report <inline font-style="italic">wilt</inline> be obtained from that source. These are all matters for the consideration of the Printing Committee, who, I feel sure, are fully alive to the importance of their duty. They have arranged, very wisely I think, to hold a joint meeting with the Printing: Committee of the other House every week,, so that every expedition may be expected. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> in order not to jeopardize his own object, to withdraw the motion. </para>

Yesterday we heard a great deal about the Printing Committee not desiring to invade any of the rights of the Senate, and I thought I would just put the matter to the test to-day. Seeing that the document is already in print, and I suppose will be circulated in due course, I ask leave to withdraw the motion. </para>

                    <para>. - As honorable senators will recollect, when this clause came before the Committee yesterday I submitted amendments which were designed to meet the criticism that had been addressed to it by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and others upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill. Those amendments took the form of an alteration of sub-clause 2, and the addition of a new sub-clause 3. I have had them printed, and they would, in the ordinary course, have been circulated the first thing this morning. But my colleague, the Attorney-General, who is responsible for the drafting of this measure, and who has gone very much more fully into the clause than I could hope to have done, has urged that if it were open to objection in its original form, still greater objection can be levelled against it in its amended form. I have not yet had an opportunity of considering the matter with him. Consequently I intend to ask the Committee to agree to the postponement of the clause. If that course be adopted, I shall be able to state more fully at a later date the position as it appears to the legal mind of the Government. It was for that reason that the amendments, though in print, were not circulated this morning. </para>

                        <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> who is an authority on banking, reminds me, "stale" cheque is the proper term to employ. While the clause represents an effort to overcome the difficulty, I am afraid it will add largely to the work of the lawyers, and for that reason I am strongly opposed to its adoption in its present form. To many, people it would prove a distinct inconvenience. Cheques are often sent to persons living where there are no facilities for presenting them within a reasonable time. Many mining companies, for example, make it a practice to write out cheques in payment of wages and to forward them to the mine manager, who distributes them. To my own knowledge, in many cases the men who receive these cheques have often no facility to present them, and they have frequently to remain outstanding for months. The rights of men so situated might be seriously prejudiced under this clause, and I doubt whether a court of law could be expected to decide with satisfaction to all concerned what under such circumstances, is a reasonable time within which presentation should be made. </para>

                    <para>- In England, many years ago, it was the practice to regard a cheque drawn on a bank within a certain distance of London, as being " stale " when not presented fifteen days after being drawn. In Australia, however, the circumstances are very different. I do not think that the banks would object to our fixing a time limit that would enable a cheque to be sent from one part of Australia to another and returned for clearance. Sometimes a cheque that is a year or two old is presented, and in such cases the usual practice is for the bank concerned to regard it as " stale," and to refer it to the drawer. If it were possible to fix a time limit, no inconvenience would be suffered by the banking companies, and I think that the general public would be advantaged. </para>

                    <para>. - I must candidly admit that there is some ground for the criticism offered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> The conditions ruling in Australia are very much different from those appertaining in Great Britain, and certainly wholly dissimilar from those that were under consideration when the Imperial Parliament passed the Act of 1882. I am inclined to think, from my recent study of that enactment and its effect, that the Parliament in passing it had largely in mind what may be described as the transactions of traders. The section corresponding with this clause was not in the original Bill as submitted to the British Parliament, but was inserted in the Lords by way of amendment on the motion of Lord B ram well. The difficulty which traders at home had to encounter was that the common law rule applied with regard to cheques, and drawers remained liable up to six years in respect to cheques that were not presented. That was a most awkward situation, for in many instances persons who had received cheques in payment of an account were in the habit of failing to present them f&gt;r a considerable time. The drawer of a cheque on a bank which subsequently failed, was held not liable at all to the holder, if the cheque had not been presented in a reasonable time; he was discharged for the full amount, although the bank might in the interim have compounded. The decisions of the English Courts as to the question of time would seem to show that this section was regarded as being more applicable to the trading community. Here, however, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has pointed out, cheques are used for the payment of wages in localities somewhat remote from banking institutions,, and where few opportunities offer for their early presentation. It has been seriously considered in Great Britain whether a delay of six days in presentation does not make a cheque " stale." In the circumstances, I am willing to allow the clause to be postponed in order that at a later stage we may submit a proposal designed to meet the varying conditions of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline>LEDGER (Queensland) [11.26.] - There is a conflict of interest with regard to the working of this clause between what may be termed the functions of a bank on the one hand, and those of its customers  on the; other, and difficulties might arise in the determination of what was a "reasonable time." I am inclined to think that the object of the clause is to provide that when a cheque is drawn and despatched to the payee, the onus shall be thrown upon the latter of presenting it within a reasonable time. That rule is found very convenient both for bankers and traders,, and my experience is that the term "a reasonsl:le time " is a very useful one. A jury is sometimes the best judge of what is a reasonable time. The clause is designed to do away with "stale" cheques, and by providing that cheques shall be presented within a reasonable time, we shall give notice to holders that it is their duty to present them as soon as possible. The practice is good for traders, bankers, and their customers. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly I do. Unfortunately for us, we have never had anything but a Tory Government in Queensland, and Tasmania is in just the same position. These people have the most tender care for the banker, but very  little for the public. What may arise if we include this provision is that the customer of a bank may be imposed upon, not because of his own negligence, but because of his ignorance of certain business methods. There are comparatively illiterate people who have banking accounts. We have, known of millionaires who were comparatively illiterate. People of this character do not always, perhaps, write the figures on their cheques exactly where they ought to be. There may be collusion between a person getting a cheque from a man of this description and the bank teller. The person to whom the cheque is payable may insert figures and words, take the cheque to the bank, and, with a little collusion with the man behind the counter, be able to defraud the unfortunate customer of the bank. If this Bill became law, it would be held that the customer was responsible, and had to bear the loss. If the clause is to be passed, it should be in the form adopted by the Tasmanian Parliament, providing that the negligence of the bank's customer must be gross. But is there any good reason for affording extra protection to bankers which is not afforded to them by the English law or by the existing law of four States of the Commonwealth? Is there any good reason for affording banks protection in such a form that it will be possible for unscrupulous individuals, in collusion with bank officers, or even without collusion with them, to " take down " an innocent customer? It is the people who require protection, not keen business men like bankers, who are up to every dodge, and who, indeed, are usually the greatest dodgers in the community. It appears to me that the existing law is a good one. Honorable senators opposite are fond of conservative ideas.  Here  is a good old conservative idea. Let us stick to it. Let us retain the law as it exists in England and in four of the States. At any rate, when we do make an amendment in the law, it should  be  in a progressive, and not in a reactionary, direction. It is abundantly clear to me that it is the unfortunate customers of bankers who require protection rather than the banks. Bankers are knowing individuals, whose wits are continually sharpened by attention to the details of business. It is for them to look after their own interests. As a matter of fact, many thousands of the customers of banks are not keen business people. Many people who live in the bush may be fairly well off and have banking accounts, although they may not have enjoyed anything better than an ordinary education. It is no act of negligence on their part if they do not write a cheque in quite the proper manner. It may be a mere act of simplicity. </para>

                    <para>. - The clause before us requires grave consideration. I do not think we ought to pass it in its present form. With regard to the law on the question, it appears, from the exposition of the Minister, that the Courts formerly held that, in cases such as are contemplated by the framers of the clause, the drawer of a cheque was liable, but the highest Courts, both in Australia and in England, have more recently decided in the contrary direction. The decisions of the highest Courts were, I presume, based on justice as well as on legal technicalities. We are now asked to transfer the responsibility from the one party to the other. Of course, it maybe held that the question of negligence in any particular case is for the Courts to determine. But I do not think that the customers of banks should be put to the trouble and expense of legal proceedings. I am inclined to think that if I were concerned in a case in which a matter of <inline font-style="italic">£,500</inline> was involved, owing to the alteration of a cheque, rather -than contest it with the bank, with the possibility of having to go before a State Court, then to the Full Court, and then, it might be, to the Privy Council or the High Court of Australia. I would lose the money. Possibly it would be cheaper to do so than contest the case with a rich banking corporation. It behoves us to realize, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has properly put it, that it is our duty to protect not' only banking interests, but the public generally. I am of opinion that some provision should be inserted in the Bill defining more clearly what negligence is. As the law stands, banks have to take, as a trading risk,  a  certain amount of responsibility in relation to cheques, which may be altered. It is a fair thing that that should be one of their trading risks, and I do not see why we should relieve them of it by imposing upon the person who draws a cheque a greater responsibility than he now has to bear. The drawer of the cheque may perhaps be a person who has not had the advantage of a good commercial education, and the. facilities for determining nice points which might be construed as negligence by a court of law. We should be careful before deciding to transfer the onus from one party to the other. </para>

The question involved is, I think, one of contributory negligence. <inline font-style="italic">Prima facie</inline> the object of the clause is that a banker shall not be punished because the drawer of a cheque has been guilty of negligence. In spite of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has said, I think honorable senators will agree with me that it is desirable that bankers should not be punished because of the negligence of the drawer. We ought, however, to be particularly careful to allow no loophole for a banker to be guilty of contributory negligence and yet escape. Our object is to protect both persons - the drawer of the cheque, and the banker upon whom it is drawn - against the man who is ready to commit a fraud. </para>

                        <para>- Not altogether. It is, I think, possible to pass legislation that to a certain extent will safeguard both the drawer and the banker.

                <para>The cheque as so altered has, in good faith and without negligence, been paid by the banker. </para>
                <para class="block">To my mind, that is the pith of the whole clause. The question arises - what is negligence on the part of a banker when he pays a cheque which may have been altered? I should say that we might in the clause itself define negligence on the part of the banker as being negligence that is shown by his abstaining from taking any steps whatever to communicate with his client the drawer. I do not think that the hardship would be great upon the payee or upon the banker if we inserted a provision compelling the banker to refer to the drawer in case the banker had any serious doubts about a cheque. </para>

                        <para>- If the Court holds that the banker might have suspected a cheque, and might have referred it to the drawer by asking him by telegraph, by telephone, or otherwise, what was the amount of the cheque, the responsibility for negligence should, I consider, rest with the bank. The banker can protect both himself and the drawer at the same time, and it is not impracticable to insert a provision to that effect in, this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> said just now that the banker did communicate with .his client, the drawer, when he had any doubt about a cheque. Let me remind him of this circumstance to show how little a banker does refer to the drawer. Take a cheque which, as is often the case in Australia, is made payable to order. The bank incurs no liability, and takes no trouble whatever to ascertain whether the indorsement on the cheque is a forgery or not. If I draw a cheque payable to " John Smith " or order, and John Smith does not happen to be a client of the bank, and if any one else chooses to write " John Smith " on the back of that cheque, the banker will pay it, because he will have no liability in respect of the correctness ot the indorsement. In practice, bankers never pay the slightest attention to such indorsements, and in the case I have cited any signature of " John Smith " makes the cheque valid so far as the bank is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- Of course not; and when I spoke of the desirability of altering the law with regard to indorsements, I had such a case in my mind. It would be vastly to the interests of the community generally, and to the convenience of bankers, if we made such a thing as a cheque payable to order no longer possible. Every man who has to deal with cheques knows that the common practice of making them payable to order gives no security to any one. </para>

                        <para>- It would save the community from being deluded, as is often the case, by the idea that making a cheque payable to order is a safeguard to some extent. We should be making a great stride if we enacted that there should be only two descriptions of cheques - one payable to the bearer, and the other crossed as not negotiable by either drawer or holder. I should like to submit an amendment in order to carry out that idea, but it is rather difficult to see where to insert it. I am hoping that the Minister will postpone the clause with a view to considering whether we cannot introduce in sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> some words which will throw upon the banker the obligation to communicate with the drawer. Such an amendment would operate as a safeguard to the banker, the client, and the public. I should further be glad if the Minister would give consideration to what reay be regarded, perhaps, as a great innovation in banking practice, namely, the desirability of defining and limiting cheque's. In my judgment such a restriction would be of considerable benefit to the whole of the mercantile community - to every drawer, every banker, and every holder of a cheque. </para>

In country districts especially the banker is frequently asked for his assistance and advice; and bankers really, in one sense, are a philanthropic body of men. </para>

                    <para>. - It will require a great deal of care so to word this clause as to do justice between the customer - whose case has been so strongly put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -</inline> Givens - and the banker. I am inclined to attach a great deal of importance to the views of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> considering the circumstances of Australia. The difficulty we have before us is to do absolute justice to the bank on the one hand and to the customer on the other. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has pointed out the dangers that might arise in the case of ignorant or illiterate persons, or others not familiar with banking business, in that, through no fault of their own, their banking account might be very seriously ' depleted. A customer of a bank is entitled to have his account well protected both by the bank and by statutory enactment ; but we cannot disregard recent litigation, which shows that banks have suffered considerable loss. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> rather weakened his argument - which appeared strong to me at first - by conveying with it an implication that bankers are very well able to take care of themselves, and that they, to some extent, exist for the purpose of fleecing the community. Banks could not exist if that were the case. I hope the consideration of the clause will be postponed, because I should like to consider fully the elaborate judgment in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Marshall</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Colonial Bank,</inline> in which the whole banking law in this connexion was reviewed bv the highest tribunal in the Empire. As to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons'</inline> remarks about " negligence " and " gross negligence," I think I am correct in saying that there is no difference, practical or legal, between the two. One of the most eminent of the law lords - Lord Bramwell, who was in his early days a noted banker - characterized the difference by saying that the word " gross" was simply a term of vituperation, and had no legal effect. This clause is most important, and it would be well for honorable senators to have time to consider it in order that they may be able to frame a provision to meet the circumstances. We shall not be doing our duty to the community unless we carefully consider the position of the customer. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> said, bankers, like all other business men, take a certain risk, and we cannot make ourselves absolute insurers against those risks ; but my hope is that we may be able to evolve some clause which will be just to both parties. Honorable senators will doubtless give due weight to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens'</inline> arguments on behalf of the customers, and also to the representations of an eminent authority like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> in regard to the protection of bankers. The proper course would, I think, be to postpone the consideration of the clause. </para>

                    <para>. - While not desiring to push on the consideration of the clause at this sitting, and, ready as I am to accede to the wish generally expressed that it should be postponed, I would like, even at this juncture, to say a few words on some of the arguments already adduced. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> was hardly as fair as he might have been when he imputed that I had practically asked the Committee to accept this Bill because it was wholly a transcription of the Imperial enactment of 1882. As a matter of fact, the Imperial enactment does not contain any provision similar to that now before the Committee ; and in my speech on the second reading I plainly pointed out that there was, amongst others, this divergence. I then gave, as fully as I could, the reasons for incorporating this particular clause in the Bill. ' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has pointed out that in only two of the States has a similar enactment been passed since the decision in <inline font-style="italic">Marshall</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Colonial Bank.</inline> I can hardly think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> could have been present when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> spoke on the motion for the second reading. The honorable and learned senator, who has had an opportunity to read carefully the judgment delivered in <inline font-style="italic">Marshall</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Colonial Bank</inline> - an advantage which neither the last  speaker  nor I have had - pointed out that the decision there given does not alter the law, but simply declares what the law has been and is - that, in effect, what was determined in that case was that there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the plaintiff, and, that being so, the loss should not fall on the plaintiff but on the bank. If that is the correct interpretation - and I have no reason to doubt that it is - the reason for there having been no enactment of the kind passed in any of the States but two, since the judgment was given, may be that those in authority regarded such an enactment as unnecessary. There are provisions in the Bill, being as it is a code, which are really ° in one respect not necessary for the purpose of enacting the law; they simply declare in a convenient form what the law is, so that anybody who desires may find the law in the Statute itself. For instance, bills of exchange, and so forth, are defined in the earlier clauses ; but whether these definitions appeared there or not the law would be as expressed there. </para>

                        <para>- It is immediately available whenever we proceed to codify the law. Many enactments in a  code are not the original foundation of the law itself. They are rather expressive tha.ni  enactive.  That may be the reason why in some of the States no such provision has been made as in Queensland and Tasmania. They may have thought, "As the Court has only declared what the law is, and as that will be the law whether we enact it or not, there is no necessity for us to put it on the statute-book." All honorable senators who have had to do any reading of law will admit that it would be very difficult to set out in the form of an enactment, as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin,</inline> what constitutes negligence in such a way as to cover all possible cases that might arise. There are very bulky treatises on the law of negligence, and when one has read them most carefully he comes to the conclusion that negligence can only be determined by the most careful consideration of the facts in every case in which it is alleged. With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons'</inline> suggestion to have something in the nature of a definition of negligence, definitions in matters of that kind are rather dangerous. </para>

                        <para>- I am offering my criticism of the honorable senator's suggestion in the same friendly spirit as criticisms of the Bill have been offered, because I know we want to arrive at conclusions fair to banker and customer. If we imposed upon the banker, in cases where he might suspect that everything was not right, the obligation of referring, to the drawer - not of marking the cheque "Refer to drawer," as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> seemed to imagine, but of referring to the drawer for his own information, guidance, and protection - the banker might find himself between Satan and the deep sea. He might suspect that a customer's cheque was not all right, and refer to the drawer, feeling in fact bound to do so to protect himself. This would hold up the payment of the cheque, and the drawer might demand to know from him what business he had to delay the payment of his cheque and so affect his credit, as in those few hours the other parties who expected the cheque ta be honoured immediately upon presentation would perhaps be wondering whether he had to make good the funds in the banker's hands in order to meet it. Consequently a banker might be placed in a most awkward position through attempting to comply with the requirements of the law, and the customer might take his account to another institution. </para>

                        <para>- That, also, is quite possible. A provision such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> suggests might seriously hamper banking operations, to the prejudice both of the banker and the customer. In making provisions of this kind, although we mav not be departing from the existing law, we should express them in such terms in respect  of each of the parties affected that neither would gain an undue advantage over the other. I am prepared to postpone the clause, but, in the meantime, I ask honorable senators to give to ray representations the same consideration as I intend to give to theirs. The proposal which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> contemplates submitting to the Committee, to confine cheques to those payable to bearer and those not negotiable, would involve a very radical departure from the existing state of affairs, and we should1 require the very fullest justification before we adopted it. I know the delusion prevails in the minds of many people, that by issuing a cheque payable to order they thereby  protect themselves against its being cashed by somebody who is not properly entitled to it. </para>

                        <para>- I know that opinion is held very widely. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> held it myself until some years ago, when, in reading up the matter, I found it was necessary.  in order to protect myself, to exercise much more care in issuing a cheque, especially when sending it through the post, with a chance of its miscarrying. Still we might not meet the whole of the difficulties, even if we enacted that there should be issued only cheques payable to bearer, and cheques which would be regarded as not negotiable. The law is, and the Courts have held so, that there is a distinction between the negotiability and transferability of cheques. It has been held that, although a cheque may be marked " Not negotiable," it is still transferable by delivery, but there is some distinction as to the measure of right which the transferee of a cheque which- is marked " Not negotiable " holds, and the measure of right possessed by the transferree of an ordinary cheque, payable to bearer. Transferability and negotiability are not synonymous terms, and before making any provision restricting the classes of cheques to open ones payable to bearer and others that are not negotiable, it will be necessary to pay considerable attention to the recognised distinction between those terms. I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> will bring in any such amendment at a later date. I will offer no objection to his submitting it when the clause is brought up again for consideration. I hope that in any amendment the honorable senator does propose, due regard will be first paid to the distinction I have indicated. </para>

                        <para>- Surely if fraud is patent the banker should not be relieved of his liability. Even the strongest advocate of the rights of banks would scarcely contend that. If, however, a cheque is fraudulently altered owing to the negligence of a customer, and that alteration is not easily discoverable, then the banker should be relieved of his liability. As the Government intend to postpone the clause, they might take into consideration the question of reconstructing it in the way I have suggested. </para>

First of all, the cheque must be drawn by the customer with negligence, that negligence must have afforded facility for fraudulent alteration, and the cheque must be fraudulently altered, and then paid in good faith without negligence on the part of the banker. Consequently, all four of those conditions must concur, and if any one of them was not shown to exist, this clause would not be, nor should it be, of any value to the banker. It is only in these cases that the banker should be relieved of responsibility. </para>
                <para class="block">
          <inline font-style="italic">I</inline>think that any court would construe the clause to  mean that the four conditions must have been complied with to relieve the banker of responsibility. I understand, however, that it is thought by some honorable senators that it may be desirable to make an alteration in the principle of the law, and there can therefore be no objection to the postponement of the clause for further inquiry into and consideration of the existing practice, and an examination of the cases which have been referred to. I believe that the result will be that the contention of the Minister as to the propriety of the clause will be indorsed. </para>

                    <para>. - To my mind a mistake is being made in this clause in allowing the banker to be the first judge of the customer's negligence. If a customer draws a cheque for .£50, and the banker pays out £250, the latter can, when the customer complains, say to him, " The mistake was due to your negligence; but if you think that we were to blame you have your remedy at 4aw." A poor man would not be able to proceed to his legal remedy in such a case, because all his money would have gone. </para>

To make it impossible to draw cheques to order would cause a great interference with ordinary business arrangements. There is the risk of a cheque being wrongly indorsed ; but a similar risk is run when a cheque is made payable to " John Smith," because any John Smith can then present it. </para>

                    <para>. - The term " good faith " occurs in various parts of the measure, and the clause practically defines its meaning. The term is used chiefly in regard to the taking of cheques or other negotiable instruments in the ordinary transactions of business. Ordinarily a man in passing a cheque on to another cannot pass with it a better title than he himself possesses; but this provision is modified in some instances, where the receiver takes the cheque in good faith. </para>

By good faith is meant the absence of dishonesty. We wish that there shall be no confusion between dishonesty and negligence. </para>

Where a bill is drawn by A on B in some distant place, and the bill is forwarded to be accepted by B, it may be that B has gone on a trip to Europe, but his agent or the person who is appointed by him to carry out his transaction may still sign it on his behalf, and then A will not be entitled to turn round and say to B, "I drew upon you, and expected you to accept, but you have not accepted, and somebody else has accepted in your name." The clause relieves him of any responsibility for any alleged breach of contract. It enables the agent simply to sign for a party, and that to be just as effective so far as the other party is concerned, so long as the agent had authority to sign. Sub-clause 1 says - </para>

                        <para>- In this clause I have an amendment to move which I think will be necessary to give effect to an amendment which I intended to move in schedule 2. It is one which I believe will specially commend itself to honorable senators on the other side. At all times they have railed against the tyranny of trade unions, and declaimed for the utmost liberty to their beloved free  labour. I want free labour in law. If I am able to do an act, why should  1  be compelled to go to a lawyer, and get him to do it for me? I ask the Committee to consider what need there is to retain that portion of the clause which would compel a man, in protesting a bill, to obtain the services of a notary public if the services of such a person are available. Why cannot a man be allowed to do the thing for himself in the ordinary way of business, and with the assistance of any witnesses whom he may be able to obtain ? </para>

                        <para>-Yes; and in schedule 2 the Bill very properly provides a form which a man has. to fill, in order to enable him to do the thing legally, but he is first compelled to make a declaration where there is no notary public that the services of a notary public are not available. In other words, that a lawyer is not available, because I understand that all notaries public are lawyers. </para>

The amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> would interfere in a matter of which he has very little practical knowledge. No banker wishes to put any person to 'unnecessary expense, but he naturally desires to be in a position, if necessary, to take proceedings in London against the individual who has negotiated a dishonoured draft. </para>

                    <para>. - If I were not a member of the legal profession, I should say it was highly desirable that the amendment should be adopted. I can- scarcely conceive of a more fruitful cause of litigation than to deprive people of the protection afforded by this clause. Instead of protecting the public, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> imagines his proposal would do, it would simply add to the work of the lawyers. It is an old maxim that the less we have to do with lawyers the more work we make for them. </para>

                    <para>. - I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> that, while it may be very desirable to have certain work within the Commonwealth which is usually performed by a notary done by householders, the work of a notary is very often for the purpose of authenticating a document drawn outside our own borders. If under the law of this country we did not require him to attest these documents, it is just possible that we might endanger the rights of our own citizens in respect of international transactions. The law of other countries requires in cases of dishonoured bills that notaries shall attest the particular dishonour, and those countries look to us to make a corresponding provision in our law, in order that there may be that reciprocal recognition of those proceedings which must exist if international financial transactions are to rest upon a good basis. I would like to draw the attention of honorable senators to <inline font-style="italic">Wharton's Law Lexicon,</inline> in which, under the heading of " Notary Public," the following appears - </para>

They recognise that we require the authentication of a notary in precisely similar circumstances to those in which they require it in their own country in connexion with documents which come into Australia. It would not be well to persist in the amendment, because it would have the effect of disturbing this uniformity with the legislation of Great Britain and other countries where they have mercantile codes, and thus might lead to an abridgement of the rights that we reciprocally enjoy with those countries in transactions of this character. Although I recognise that - as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has pointed out - the amendment would leave the clause permissive, and that under its operation it would still be open to those who wish to employ a notary to do so, it would nevertheless disturb the harmonious relations which exist' between the Commonwealth and other countries where this reciprocal arrangement obtains. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is a very fair one - indeed it would constitute quite a refreshing departure from the practice of most people in running to a lawyer upon the slightest provocation, with a view to getting them out of trouble either real or imaginary. While the honorable senator was speaking, an example came prominently before my mind of the way in which lawyers are prone to fleece their clients. In this case a lawyer in a good way of business sought to rob a client merely because he was called upon to sign his name to attest a document. It happened in this way : A young fellow from this State - who, by the way, is a very eminent lawyer to-day - went to Western Australia, where he was engaged in effecting a transfer of his mother's property In the course of the transaction, a lawyer's signature was required under the Act. The young man visited' a lawyer, and, after obtaining his signature, inquired what was the fee. The lawyer replied that it was two guineas. The young man, who had already qualified for the Bar in "Victoria, knew exactly what the lawyer should be paid, and accordingly asked, " Is that the usual fee here?" Thereupon the lawyer turned over the pages of the document he had signed, and said, " Oh, we will make it 2s. 6d." He suddenly reduced his fee from two guineas to 2s. 6d. To mv mind it is about time that we made a violent departure from the practice which we have hitherto followed. For the sake of achieving uniformity, it is quite clear that, in this Bill, we are making a distinction between the man who is so situated that he can avail himself of the services of a notary and the individual who cannot do so. As was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin,</inline> every person is expected to be able to look after his own affairs, and if a man is dealing with bills which must go to foreign part's he is very likely, for his own security, to have it attested by a notary public. </para>

                        <para>- I do, but I do not believe in tyrannical unions, the members of which will not permit the free admittance of men who are capable of doing the work done by themselves. A man cannot join the legal profession unless he becomes an articled clerk to one of the legal sharks who has already been in business for a number of years, and until he has paid a considerable fee. We sometimes hear talk of the entrance fees charged by labour unions, but they are not a circumstance to the fees which must be paid to legal sharks before a man can join their union. </para>

In the circumstances, is it desirable that we should depart in this radical manner from the recognised provision of the law for the purpose of a few bills of exchange, and possibly deprive our own people trading with foreign countries of the advantage of the recognition they have in those countries if these protests are so authenticated ? </para>

As a matter of fact, most of the foreign bills relate to international transactions - if I may so describe commercial transactions between residents of Australia and residents of Great Britain as well as of European countries - by persons in a large way of business, or great financial corporations, who can very well protect themselves so far as the lawyers are concerned, and ,are not likely to be imposed upon because of lack of experience.

                    <para>Honorable senators will recognise that this is practically a transcript of a Bill passed by the Senate in the last Parliament. An honorable senator, as a private member, introduced a measure relating to this question in October, 1904, and after it had been read a second time it was referred by the. Senate to the Standing Orders Committee. That Committee, having considered the Bill, brought up a report, the effect of which was that as it stood it was not in the complete form in which such a measure should be submitted to and passed by the Parliament. The Standing OrdersCommittee made some suggestions, and submitted with its report a Bill prepared by the parliamentary draftsman, incorporating the amendments which it considered necessary. The report is a very brief one, and I propose to refresh the memory' of honorable senators by reading it. It simply states that- - </para>

                        <para>The Committee, after due consideration, advise the Senate to proceed with the consideration of the Bill, but that its scope should be enlarged by the addition of clauses dealing with the whole matter of the summoning and examination of witnesses. </para>
                        <para>To do this clauses will have to be inserted for the punishment of witnesses - </para>

                    <para>The following paragraph of the report is important, as showing the necessity for a measure of this kind, although our powers, rights, privileges, and immunities are declared by the Constitution to be those of the British House of Commons until we otherwise declare - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Although the Committee consider that both the Senate and the House of Representatives and the Committees of either House have power, under the Constitution, to administer oaths, and that the Senate and the House of Representatives have power respectively to deal with any witness who refuses to attend, to be sworn, or to answer questions, they do not consider that the time of Parliament should be taken up by matters of this nature, but that the Courts are better constituted to adjudicate on such matters. </para>

                    <para>The parliamentary* drafting office has prepared a Bill embodying the necessary amendments, which is herewith submitted. </para>
                    <para class="block">That Bill took the place of the original one submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> It was discussed on the second reading, and passed through Committee. It went to the House of Representatives where its first reading was moved, but I think it got no further. As iL is impossible to deal with this as a lapsed Bill owing to the intervention of a general election, the measure is again submitted to the Senate. It is practically a transcript of the Bill formerly passed. 1 say "practically," because there have been two verbal alterations in clauses 9 and 14. In the concluding words of the first paragraph of each of those clauses occurred the words, "he shall be guilty of an offence against this Act." In this Bill we use the words " he shall be guilty of an indictable offence." The amended form has been adopted in conformity with the general wording of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- This clause provides that the warrant may be executed by a person to whom it is addressed, but it also gives him power to appoint another person. We ought to be careful about giving such powers to irresponsible people. I see no objection to giving the power to the person to whom the warrant is addressed, but there is a danger in enabling him to hand over the power to another. «. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree that the penalty imposed for escaping from custody is rather severe. It is quite a natural thing for a man to desire to escape from custody, and if he succeeds in escaping, I do not see why he should be penalized to the extent suggested. While it is proposed to impose a penalty of two years' imprisonment on an apprehended witness who may escape from custody, no punishment is provided for any laxity there may be on the part of the custodian whose duty it is to keep his prisoner secure. If a witness succeeds in  escaping,  then I say, " Good luck to him ! " I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> ' that, although two years is to be the maximum punishment, it is possible that maximum may be imposed. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it -is evidently a standard. We ought not to pass clauses the meaning of which is not quite clear. If a person who escapes from custody has to suffer some penalty, let us say what that penalty shall be. At any rate, in my opinion, two years' imprisonment is too severe a, punishment; and we might well consider the wisdom of modifying this provision. </para>

                        <para>. - What is provided in this clause is a penalty for the offence of escaping from custody ; and such an offence may be just as grave whether the matter in respect of which the witness is desired is of much or less importance. It may be only natural to feel a certain amount of sympathy for an individual who escapes from custody, but the case in which the witness is required may be of the gravest importance to the Commonwealth or to the individual ; and it must be remembered that he will be in custody under warrant.  His  escape, although satisfactory to himself, might be disastrous to those concerned in the completion of a particular inquiry, because, while he may escape for his own benefit and pleasure, his absence might prove a serious disadvantage to the community generally. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly ; and he rebels against the sifting of a matter of, perhaps, great public or private importance. I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that, according to section 3 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1904, any penalty set forth as in this clause, in relation to either a fine or imprisonment, is the maximum penalty. In the States Acts the ordinary form was to state that a penalty shall be " not exceeding " such an amount, or so much imprisonment ; but the form adopted in this clause has been used in Commonwealth Acts ever since the Customs Act was introduced. Cases of escape may be so slight in their nature, that imprisonment for a few minutes or an hour might vindicate the law; but, on the other hand, there may be cases of the greatest gravity, and the maximum penalty must be made commensurate with the possibilities, leaving those who have the duty of enforcing the law to impose a penalty in proportion to the offence. </para>

                        <para>, - The offence here indicated is one of the most serious that we can conceive. It is a refusal on the (part of a witness, called by Parliament, or a parliamentary Committee, to give evidence on matters which may be of the most vital importance to the whole Commonwealth. There is sometimes great difficulty in inducing witnesses to attend inquiries of the kind. For instance, we might appoint a Select Committee to inquire into the advisability of unifying the industrial legislation of the Commonwealth, and it might be desirable that witnesses should attend, and reveal the conditions of their businesses. The evidence of those witnesses might be absolutely necessary for the perfect fulfilment of the duties of the Committee, and if they refused to attend, and resisted the execution of a warrant, they would practically place themselves in the position of rebels and traitors to their country. There was an instance recently in the United States of the wealthiest man in the world refusing to obey a summons to attend a Court. That was an <inline font-style="italic">enormity</inline> that should have been considered intolerable, and have led to some effort to secure his attendance at the Court. It did not do so in America. We are taking steps here to insure that we shall have that control in questions of national importance. To provide two years' imprisonment only means that if a man will not comply with the laws made in the interests of his country he shall be so punished. There is no need for him to resist or to assault the officers who are executing the law, or for any other person in his interest or behalf to resist the law. If they do, we must take sufficient power to make it dangerous for them. </para>

                        <para>Commonwealth News. - A New Scheme</para>
                        <para>It is understood that members of the Federal </para>
                        <para>Cabinet do not favour <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne's scheme for advertising Australia by supplying Commonwealth news to the London papers. It is thought that news supplied in that way by a Government journalist would be looked at askance by the British public as being biassed in favour of the Commonwealth. It is most unlikely, therefore, that the scheme will be persevered with. </para>
                        <para>An alternative proposal has, however, been made in the Cabinet. It is known that the chief obstacle in the way of publishing Australian news in the London papers has been the great cost of a cable service. It has been suggested, therefore, that if the rates for press messages over the Pacific cable were considerably reduced, the amount of news sent to London would greatly increase. The difficulty in the way is the cost of transmitting messages over the Canadian land lines and over the Atlantic cables. It has accordingly been decided to approach the other Governments interested in the Pacific cable, with the view of inducing them to agree to a lowering of the press rate, which at present stands at1s. per word. The new rate, if adopted, would, of course, apply only to press messages containing Commonwealth news. An arrangement of this sort already exists with regard to press telegrams within the Commonwealth. </para>
                    </quote>
                <para class="block">If that statement is correct, the proposal referred to is of such importance that the Government, before committing itself to it, should consult both Houses of Parliament. Probably I shall be told that the Government is responsible to Parliament, which can censure it for its actions. But Parliament often hesitates to censure Ministerial action, not because it does not disapprove of it, but for other reasons. If the Government proposes to increase the burden of the taxpayers in connexion with the working of the Pacific Cable, it should see that the public interest is safeguarded. Since I have been a member of the Senate there has been a reduction of the rates for press messages between Western Australia and the eastern States; but the whole benefit has gone to newspaper proprietors. The Western Australian public get only as much eastern news now as they got when the rates were higher. No doubt, the reduction spoken of in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> is suggested in the interests of the Commonwealth, so that the people of Europe may have more Australian news. This object will not be achieved merely by reducing rates for press messages, and I trust that the Government, as we have a " say " in the management of the Pacific Cable, will see that no reduction is made unless steps are taken to provide for the sending of more news to Europe, and news of a reliable character. I admit that that will be a difficult thing to do; but we know that in the past press messages have been sent which have defamed this country, and considerably damaged our interests. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">.- Senator Macfarlane</inline>spoke this morning about the chartering of special trains to convey mails to catch outgoing steamers at Adelaide. On two or three occasions, when I have been journeying to South Australia, I have been informed that the express train was being followed by a special. One night, when at Stawell, I was desirous of knowing who were on board the special, and for what purpose it was running, and I was informed that it was a special mail train. It was running only a few minutes after the ordinary express. I wish to know how often trains are chartered for the sole purpose of conveying mails, and whether the Government bears the expense. If the delay in the despatch of mails from Melbourne which necessitates the chartering of special trains is the fault of contractors, they, and not the taxpayers, should pay for these trains. I trust that full inquiries will be made into the whole subject. </para>

                            <para>- No; but surely the honorable senator will see tha[ the principle applies in one case as well as in the other? We have already decided to make certain concessions to the proprietors of newspapers, on ' the ground that they are disseminating news which we desire to have disseminated. In the newspaper business, as well as in any other, we must trust to natural competition to set things right. If there is one newspaper which sends Home one presentment of news, there is always another newspaper which sends Home the other side of the question, and we must leave the public there to discriminate between the newspapers and to judge for themselves. If the Government do contemplate making any reduction, T think it is very desirable indeed that more news should be sent to England concerning the condition of things, especially politics in Australia, than is now transmitted. If that is what in proposed, I think it is commendable, but it would not be wise for a Minister to make a hasty reply to any objection before the scheme has been submitted to the Senate in a substantial form. With regard to the question of the payment for a special train, the amount which is at stake is not very large, but a principle is involved. As I happened to be a passenger on the <inline font-style="italic">Coogee</inline> on the trip on which she was late, it is only fair to her owners that I should say that it was not owing to the fault of their officers that she arrived so late. She left Launceston punctually to time, and was delayed simply by stress of weather for eight hours. The captain of the steamer tried bv every possible means to get into Melbourne in time, but he failed, and so the Tasmanian portion of the outgoing English mail missed the ordinary express train, owing to her late arrival. If it is intended to make mail-carrying companies responsible for the act of God, then we are going rather too far. </para>

                        <para>. - The question of the reduction of the rates for cable messages has not been under the consideration of a Cabinet at which my honorable and learned colleague and myself have been present, but it may have been under the consideration of a Cabinet at which the writer of the paragraph in question may have been present. From time to time the Government have had under general consideration the desirability of supplying to Great Britain further news concerning the affairs of Australia. I happened to be in London about two years ago when the present Government was formed, and the only intimation we got there was a paragraph of about three or four lines, stating that a want of confidence motion had been carried against the Reid Government, and three or four days afterwards that a new Government had been formed. It is a most unusual thing to see in the English newspapers even a solitary cablegram concerning Australia. Consequently, we feel that it is highly desirable that some improvement should be effected in order to do justice to us, and relieve us from the unfortunate discredit to which we have been so unworthily subjected in the past. Whatever policy the Government may decide to invoke in order to achieve that object, it will, of course, be announced in the usual way, and we shall be responsible for our action. I had no opportunity of seeing the reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane's</inline> question concerning the cost of the special train until about three seconds before I read it here this morning. In the meantime, I have been able to see the officers of the Department, and also a file. It seems that on the date in question the <inline font-style="italic">Coogee</inline> arrived some hours, late. An explanation was called for, with the result that it was mentioned that she arrived late by reason of stress of weather, over which, of course, the shipping company had no control. The <inline font-style="italic">Coogee</inline> is bound, under ordinary arid reasonable circumstances, to maintain an average speed of fourteen knots an hour. But on the occasion in question it was quite impossible for her to run to time. </para>
