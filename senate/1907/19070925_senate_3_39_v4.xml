                        <para>The price of Australian-made starch has been considerably increased recently, but prior to the introduction of the new Tariff proposals. For instance, bulk starch rose from 31s. per cwt. tn 33s., then to 38s. 6d. All manufacturers acted in unison in the matter of increase of price. The rise is attributed locally to the award of the Wages Board. It will be remembered that the <inline font-style="italic">Lone Hani</inline> (Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> publication) published a rather severe article in June or July issue on &#34; Robert Harper,&#34; not attacking him individually, but as a good example of the starch manufacturing industry, laying a charge of sweating. In the following issue the <inline font-style="italic">Lone Hand</inline> stated that the condition of the laborers had commenced to improve. Retail prices have not gone up. </para>

                <para class="block">I am moving in this matter not in a hostile spirit to the Australian Industries Preservation Act, or, indeed, to the Government, but because, in common with every other senator whatever shade his political opinions may be, I have recognised as one of the developments of latter-day commerce the growing aggregation of capital, or a tendency of capital to work in larger bodies with the. natural consequence that, as unionism in capital begins to develop, there is a tendency to eliminate competition. I wish briefly to remind the Government of their declaration of a whole-hearted belief in the provisions of the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, and their strenuous affirmation that so far as they could they would see that both the letter and the spirit of. the measure, if enacted, were adhered to. It will be recollected that both at the general election and since then the Government have re-affirmed their belief in the principles of that law, and have taken no little credit to themselves for having the temerity to grapple with one of the admittedly great problems which have to be faced today. I shall now refer briefly to the incidents connected with the alleged coal combination, and then submit to the Government suggestions for their consideration. Honorable senators probably have read in the press a report that a firm styled Scott Fell&#38; Co. had applied to one of the colliery proprietors, who are included in the Coal Vend, for coal to be shipped to New Zealand in a steam-ship called the <inline font-style="italic">Ennerdale,</inline> and that the application was refused. The statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline> Fell, and published in the Sydney press, was that he was refused coal, and that a member of the Coal Vend told him that Scott Fell &#38; Co. were not in the </para>
                <para class="block">Shipping Combine, and that for that reason a cargo of coal would not be supplied to him. That statement has been amplifier! by one or two others to which I shall refer. But, first of all, in order to make that point quite clear, I shall take the liberty of reading from the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of the 2 1 st September, an extract in which the Sydney agents for the vessel make a statement, and, of course, the persons named can be called upon to substantiate the remarks which apparently they volunteered to the press. The extract reads as follows: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Ennerdale,</inline> which belongs to the Maoriland Steam-ship Company, a New Zealand corporation, which has no connexion with the &#34; vend,&#34; brought a cargo of timber from Kaipa&#39;ra to Sydney, and was under charter to the Ii firm of S. Brown, of Wellington, to return coal laden. This firm has been a regular customer for Newcastle coal for some years. In the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Ennerdale ,</inline> there was no question of short notice with respect to the coal cargo required. At least three months&#39; notice was given of the intention to despatch the steamer. The cargo, however, was absolutely refused. The agents were told distinctly that as the vessel was outside the &#34; vend,&#34; it was no use trying to get a cargo, and the Union Company, when asked to accept the charter, had plenty of bottoms of their own. &#34;We can, of course,&#34; said the agents, &#34; get coal at any time from the vend, provided we ship it through the Union Steam-ship Company, or we can get it from some of the collieries that are outside the Combine ; but it so happens that in the present instance, other coal would not suit the firm which gave the charter. They had certain contracts to fill, and required the coal, which they had been accustomed to. get. Arrangements have now been made to ship certain quantities through the Union Company. &#39; </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That statement amounts to a double affirmation. One affirmation is that the steamship was refused coal merely because it was outside the Coal Vend and the Shipping Combine, and the other affirmation is that the coal, which was refused when it was to be carried in the <inline font-style="italic">Ennerdale</inline> , was supplied when the Union Steam-ship Company was to have the carrying of it. In the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the same date appears an interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline> Fell, who makes the following statements - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>There is no denying the fact that the <inline font-style="italic">Ennerdale</inline> has been refused coal. The&#39; vend objects to any one getting coal for New Zealand, except the Union Steam-ship Company and a few sailing  vessels  which have been trading for years to that country. I would not be surprised if in the course of time these sailors will get the kick-out. Our firm has applied for coal over and over again, and we cannot get it. They want to know why we should expect coal. And for coasting requirements, they refer us to some of the steam-ship owners - members of the Com bine. These owners say they cannot supply us, or that they have sold out. Or they ask us a price or stipulate conditions which make it impossible for people to trade. &#34;You claim to be practically boycotted?&#34; &#34; You have just struck it. Some of the proprietors are working in with the shipping ring to endeavour to drive us out.&#34; &#34; The Inter-State Shipping Combine should now have a large amount of money invested in the collieries,&#34; he went on. &#34; The- object is the controlling of the whole of the Australasian trade, and the prevention of any opposition while the people have to pay the piper. That, indeed, is the boast of the Combine.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking more than personally, and I believe that I am entitled to do so, knowing the opinions of my friends on this side. In the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of the 23rd the manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wheeler,</inline> of the Newcastle-Wallsend Colliery, which is outside the Vend, was interviewed. He was asked if he had any objection to state the reasons why the company remained outside of it, and said - &#34; We believe in freedom of contract. We object to being bound down to supply only certain vessels with coal.&#34; </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para class="block">If the statement that that company remains outside the Vend because it objects to being bound to supply only certain vessels with coal, means anything, it is a fair inference that those who are inside the Vend are so bound. I admit that it is not conclusive, but to my mind a very strong inference to be drawn from the statement is that one of the conditions of the Vend is that they are only to supply to certain people, and under certain conditions. I wish to make it quite clear that in reading these extracts I am not affirming anything other than the fact that these statements have been made publicly. It is not competent for me to vouch for the accuracy or inaccuracy of any one of them, but they appear in public print, as made by men with some standing in the commercial world, men who are get-at-able, and who can be called upon if necessary to substantiate or withdraw their remarks. The sole object of the action I am taking to-day is to bring them under notice, in order to point out to the Government that to my mind, at any rate - and I trust that I shall have the sympathy of the Senate in this matter - sufficient has been disclosed to show that there is a very serious obligation upon the Government to probe this matter to the bottom. If there has been no harm done, and no infringement of. the law, no one, not even the members of the Vend themselves, will have any cause of complaint, or be in any way injured. On &#39; the other hand, if there is something being done - it may be only in its initial stages - which is to the detriment of Australian trade, the sooner we discover the whole truth of the matter the sooner shall we be in a position, if the present law is not strong enough, to arm the Administration with a more effective legislative enactment. It is not at all necessary to remind honorable senators of the great importance which the coal trade is, and always must be, to Australia. It is one of our big lines of export, and we should watch very carefully that no firm or combination of firms shall? be allowed to take any action which may, perhaps not immediately, but in the future, tend to the serious diminution or restriction of the export of one of our staple lines of industry. I should like to summarise the statements which can reasonably be founded upon the newspaper extracts that I have read. They are, first of&#34; all, that a Vend exists. Upon that I do not: think there can be the slightest possible doubt. The second is that this Vend works with, and in the interests of, a Shipping. Combine. The statements are clear that it will only allow certain trade to pass through certain shipping people. The third point is, that it will not sell coal unless it first ascertains the destination. The fourth is that it will not sell for coastal purposes or to New Zealand unless through the Shipping Combine, thus securing a monopoly of freight to that combination. These are all definite statements which, if borne out by further inquiry, to my mind bring the people responsible for this condition of affairs clearly within the four corners of that Act, or, to put it in another way, clearly within the four corners of what this Senate, when it was passing that Act, thought it to be. </para>

If the Government contend that the Act is effective for the purpose and that under its provisions they are fully competent to reach any injurious  combinations, then the Government must themselves take action or admit that they only passed the Act for the mere purpose of making a little political capital. I am. not going to make that accusation against the Government at this stage, but the obligation is upon the Government to justify their action in passing that piece of legislation. I recognise that it is necessary to prove something more than a combination. <inline font-style="italic">It</inline> must be proved also that that combination is &#39;acting in a way injurious to the general public or in restriction of trade. </para>

I am not affirming anything more than that, to my mind, a case has been made out for complete, minute, and instant inquiry. I am mot at all satisfied, and I doubt if the Senate is, with the nature of the inquiries which the Government have been making in similar matters. We had an instance of that to-day. I brought under the notice of the Government the evidence given on oath by a witness before one of the Victorian Wages Boards that -certain things had taken place, and inquiry was promised. That inquiry appeared to proceed from the Attorney-General&#39;s office and Ave get back the reassuring statement that the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> Proprietary, which at one lime made an accusation against a certain firm, had later on modified it. </para>

                        <para>- I think it highly probable. An inquiry of that kind would be scouted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council as a lawyer if he were conducting a case before the Courts. An admission is made that the articles have been raised in price, that the- proprietors had raised them in combination, but absolutely, so far as one can judge from that  reply7  there has &#39;been no inquiry to determine whether that rise was justified or not. We want some further inquiry than that; &#34;but whenever the Government have been pressed, in the matter they always .plead - and&#39; I can understand and sympathize with the plea - the difficulties! of obtaining information. Naturally, if people are working in contravention of the law, we do not expect them to come forward and volunteer the information upon which they might be indicted. I doubt whether even the Government, when they framed the law, expected to get much assistance from those against whose operations the law was directed. </para>

                        <para>- I should be rather inclined to say that the Government were in - the right there. I have pointed out that there are certain specific statements made by individuals who are well known, and with whom the Government can get into touch at once. I admit freely and fully the difficulty of getting information which would entitle the Government to take any legal proceedings. I do not know that there is even any need for legal proceedings, but I do say that, with that Act in force, and with a Government and Parliament which . profess to be anxious to enforce its provisions, to conserve trade in all its branches against the unfair operations of any combination, it is impossible to pass this matter over in silence. If the Government are unable to get information in the ordinary &#39; course of events, I will make a suggestion to them-. I am not at  all  favorable to the) indiscriminate appointment of Royal Commissions, nor do I believe that Parliament is. Certainly in suggesting the appointment of a Royal Commission I do not for one moment advocate that it should include any members of Parliament. The Royal Commission I speak of, would be of a different character, such  as  was appointed in New South Wales to deal with &#39; the land troubles, or the one which conducted an inquiry into the administration of the railways of that State. </para>

                        <para>- I am . not so familiar with the <inline font-style="italic">.personnel</inline> of that Commission, as with that of the Commissions appointed in my own State. But I put the suggestion forward, if the Government repeat the plea as to the difficulty of obtaining information. A Royal Commission of that kind might consist of one gentleman of the rank of a Judge, or if thought desirable&#39; there -might be associated with him men of commercial training, whose reputation would be a guarantee that the Commission would discharge its duties .faithfully and without bias. The Royal Commission would do two things, if information was not obtainable otherwise. It would enable us to determine how far this combine is or is not acting detrimentally to the public interest, and it would enable us to ascertain whether the present law is sufficient or not. </para>

                        <para>- I am&#39; not at this stage advocating the appointment of a Royal Commission, but I point out that the Government should not be permitted indefinitely to shelter themselves under the plea that there is difficulty in obtaining information in these cases. It is competent for the Government, if they experience difficulty in obtaining the necessary information through the ordinary channel of inquiry by their officers, to constitute a body possessing ample powers to obtain the information we seek. If a Royal Commission should be appointed, and should determine that no infringement of the spirit or letter of the Act has taken  place, I suppose every one will be .well pleased. I think, further, that it is quite probable that such a Commission would, if a weak spot exists in the law, be able to indicate the way in which it should be strengthened or recast. I repeat- my assurance that I have taken this action without any feeling of hostility to. the spirit of the Act, because I am a believer in its principle, and in no sense with any feeling of hostility to the Government. I believe that if it be proved that an evil does exist, the Government would receive the support of. every political party in making an honest, fearless, and impartial effort to give effect to the law which is to-day on our statute-book. </para>

                        <para>- No, I do not say so, but I point out that those who are directly injured have the matter, to some extent in their own hands, and can prosecute themselves in the way I have mentioned, or display a little activity in assisting to secure the necessary evidence to enable the Government to undertake a prosecution. There may, in this case, be better opportunities to secure the evidence required than in others, but I am giving the Senate the experience which the Government Departments have already had in connexion with inquiries at present proceeding. It is all very well to say that a charge would lie, and to point to the general statements appearing in the press as showing that an evil does exist, but honorable senators will realize that something more direct is required. For instance, it is necessary, in the operation of the law, that in certain circumstances evidence of a contract should be secured, and will honorable senators believe me when I state that, in certain notorious cases, we have found the greatest difficulty in procuring an original contract, and then in obtaining the necessary evidence to prove the signatures to the contract? While people admit that there are certain contracts, they will not give them up, and, what is more, they are unwilling to come forward and prove the signatures to a contract. </para>

I quite admit that in some of the cases that have been referred to, there might be better opportunities of securing direct evidence; and the case brought under our notice by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> may be one. I think this matter has already been mentioned to the Acting Prime Minister, and. that he has promised consultations with the Attorney-General to see whether, under the present law, the necessary evidence can be procured and a prosecution take place. I am in full accord with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to this extent: that if it is found that the present law is not sufficient and effective to achieve the object for which it was passed, we have a clear duty cast upon us to make it effective. </para>

In connexion with rebates, for instance, a matter of a Kindred character, in some cases there is no direct contract entered into in writing. But, if certain things are done, there is an understanding that rebates will be given. </para>

To return to the case immediately under notice, there can be no doubt that the evils complained of are distinctly detrimental to the public, and are such as we should seek to remedy by some means. -I shall bring the matter under the notice of the Attorney-General, and will ask him to exercise every activity for the purpose of procuring evidence&#39;, with the object of initiating a prosecution if it is considered that an offence has been&#39; committed. </para>

In the second place, the view that my honorable friend the Vice-President of the Executive Council takes is that this matter is surrounded with such, serious difficulties that although we have placed on the statute-book a law to prevent such troubles, it is practically ineffective.

                        <para>- My honorable friend has laid his finger on the real point. Why do not the Government test the matter? When we were discussing the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, my objection to part of it was that it would be very difficult to put it into operation, and that so far as regarded a certain class of corporations - those formed within the States - we were interfering with the rights of the States to provide for the transaction of their own&#39; business. But I always held the view- and I adhere to&#39; it most strongly  - that monopolies of this character, which are supposed to be struck at by the Australian Industries Preservation Act, are of a most dangerous and iniquitous description, and ought to be put down as public nuisances and public evils. </para>

                        <para>- I am not sure that they could be dealt with by the common law now. But we have passed an Act specifically dealing with them. There are three sections in that Act which are of a most drastic description. Sections 4, 7, 8, and 9 seem to me to meet every possible case. I join - with my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in not liking to reflect in the slightest degree upon the conduct of the Ministry of the day. I would not do such a thing on any account ! I think my honorable friend was even more tender than I am in that regard. But still I think that the Government are neglecting their duty in not bringing into operation or trying to bring into operation the provisions of the Act. There is nothing so mischievous as timidity in legal proceedings. The Government are neglecting their duty when they fail to make an effort at all events to deal with this public evil. At least it is said to be an evil ; we have no right to prejudge it. </para>

                        <para>- An honorable senator made an interjection relating to the discovery of documents, the obtaining of information and all that sort of thing. Honorable senators will recollect that there is a section in this Act of the most drastic description which not merely enables every possible information to be obtained and documents to be procured, but which prevents any one, who is concerned in a matter of this kind, from refusing to discover all documents or to answer questions that may be put to him in respect to the matters at issue on the. ground that they are likely to incriminate him. Everybody concerned in any proceedings that may be brought in respect . of an infringement of the Act is liable in respect to the discovery of documents, and is compelled to reply to all questions, even if the result of his answers may be to render him liable to a criminal prosecution. It is the most absolute and unrestricted power of discovery that can be given in any form of legal procedure. </para>

                <para>My honorable friend the Vice-President of the Executive Council, very properly said that members of the public who are interested, can take proceedings. But there is this great difficulty : . Under this Act, no one can take proceedings without the written consent of the Attorney-General. A barrier is imposed to any member of the public taking proceedings - the barrier of: the consent of the Attorney-General having to be obtained. Therefore, I was glad to hear the Vice-President of the Executive Council say that he would bring the matter under the notice of the Attorney-General. So far as I can judge, under that Act, which we framed with the greatest possible care to bring everything within it, there is no reason in the wide world why proceedings should not be instituted by the Government at the earliest opportunity, if there is such evidence as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has brought forward, on which they can frame a prosecution. </para>

                    <para>.- Senator Millen has done a valuable public service in bringing this matter forward, because there is no industry that has such a direct bearing upon every other industry in the community as has the coal industry. It affects the whole of our manufactures, and every other industry we possess is wrapt up in it. Most of us have had some knowledge of transactions which have been going on in the coal industry for some time past. We have known that its proprietary was gradually becoming a trust, and was adopting the methods with &#39; which we have become familiar in connexion with trusts in America. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that the Government may rightly be accused of timidity in this matter. Those of us who have watched the. history of trust transactions in the United States must recognise that the American Government have had to take a good deal &#34;on trust,&#34; if I may use that term, in regard to some prosecutions which they have instituted. They have had <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> start prosecutions in most cases practically without any direct evidence. . It would be extremely valuable if the Crown Law officers of the Commonwealth would study the methods that have been adopted in connexion with the successful prosecution of trusts in the United States within recent years. </para>

In the case brought under notice by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> a statement has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline> Fell, of Scott Fell and Co., which is a well-known firm of ship-owners. I take it that that gentleman was sure of his facts before he made such assertions for publication in the press. If the Government are hesitating about instituting a prosecution because they think that the Australian Industries Preservation Act is not sufficiently stringent, it will be far better in the public interest to state frankly that that is the reason, and then Parliament can alter the law. </para>

                        <para>-. - If newspaper reporters can get evidence why cannot the Government do the same? If firms write to the newspapers making such statements as I have read and those statements are false, the writers will be liable to prosecution for libel. Surely firms would not be prepared to make such statements and to sign their names to them if they were false. </para>

                        <para>- In that case the information was given to a newspaper reporter by the head of a well-known firm. It seems to me that the case of the Coal Combine is infinitely more pressing than any other that has been mentioned, because the coal industry affects so many other industries. I urge upon the Government that the Crown law authorities should be. instructed to undertake a little bit of experimental prosecution. It will be very valuable to take advantage of the opportunity to test the efficacy of the Australian Industries Preservation Act as enabling us to ascertain whether an amendment of the law- is required. </para>

                    <para>. - I am very pleased that the Opposition have moved in this matter. If ever the Government are to be justified in trying an experiment with the Act, it ought to be when it has the almost unanimous support of the Sena&#39;te. There seems to be little doubt that even if the Government were to fail in attempting to locate the business which this combine is doing, they would not be humiliated if they  did  not meet with success. I believe that the Senate, as a whole, would indorse their action. At all events, it would show whether the legislation was effective or not. If it were found to be ineffective, I believe that the Opposition would be ready to co-operate with the Government in taking even more drastic steps to deal with the situation. </para>

                        <para>- Can any one imagine that a combine which was formed for the purpose of raising the price of an article, and extracting more than a fair profit on its capital, is not unfair in its  operations ? I understand that the explanation of the Government is that they have not been able to get sufficient evidence to bring the Coal Combine under the Australian Industries Preservation Act. </para>

                        <para>- Well, the other Combine. I do not think that any one will question that a combine is formed with a distinct object. It seems to be quite clear that there are thirty-seven collieries in the Coal Vend. What is their object? I take it that their object is to secure a larger profit, which, of course, can only be gained by forcing down wages or by increasing the price of coal. The Combine have not been altogether successful in reducing wages. On the contrary, they have, been inclined to grant a slight increase, which. I interpret to foe the affirmation of a principle. </para>

                        <para>- Any one who works out the figures will ascertain that for every increase of is. in the price of coal the colliery proprietor gets an additional advantage ais against the miner. I desire to refer to some statements which are rather remarkable, particularly from at Victorian point of view. In an interview with a representative of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. York</inline> Syme said the reason that agreements had been come to with Howard Smith Company Limited, the Adelaide Steamship Company, and Mcllwraith, McEacharn, and Company, by the Vend granting them exclusive rights of carriage for certain States, was probably that those three companies are very large shareholders in some of the Vend collieries. </para>

Reid, who, I understand, is  chairman  of the Melbourne Steam-ship Company, informed the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> that of forty collieries in Newcastle all, were in the Vend except the Wallsend Colliery. He mentioned that they had an annual output of 6,000,000 tons, of which 1,000,000 tons were used in Victoria, and about 2,000,000&#39; tons in the rest of the Commonwealth. He added that, computing Victoria&#39;s 1,000,000 tons at an increase of 2s. per ton - with every prospect of the price being much higher - it meant an additional expenditure of &#163;100,000 in coal per year. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, he was against an increase in the parliamentary allowance, but not against an increase in the shipping charges. We have every reason to believe that the Coal Combine will extract &#39;the &#39; highest ! possible price which they can get from the consumers. Assuming that it is equivalent to a tax of not less than ,&#163;100,000 upon the manufacturers of Victoria, it means that many a small manufacturer, not only in that State, but in other States, will be absolutely crushed, or forced to relinquish his industry. </para>

                        <para>- Another remarkable thing is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hugh</inline> R. Reid affirmed the fact that if he were to ask the Coal Vend to quote a price for 150,000 or 250,000 tons of coal, they would not make a quotation until he named the destination of the coal. What does that mean ? It means that if the coal is required, for delivery at a port which is under the control of the monopoly, it will not be supplied. Otherwise they will offer to supply the coal at a price which is so high that it will not pay a steam -ship to handle it. It seems to be quite clear that the only object of the Coal Combine is to gain a profit, no matter who may suffer. There is more than one interest in the Commonwealth at stake. The very success of the manufactories depends upon a cheap, as well as plentiful, supply of coal. What is the good of a Tariff if the Combine is to come along and, by a peculiar method, secure the benefit of that protection? </para>

I desire coal to be produced in Australia at the lowest possible price provided that reasonable conditions obtain in the industry and that the owners get a reasonable profit. Will any one affirm that the Coal Combine was only formed for the purpose of securing a fair profit on its invested capital ?

                        <para>- It was stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that the Coal Combine is a form of unionism, but if I understand unionism the Coal Combine is not a union. &#39; A union is formed for the purpose of defending a weak individual or a weak section of the community against such institutions as the Coal Combine. Now the Coal Combine was formed, not to protect any one, but to extract all the additional profit which it could secure from the users of coal. In my opinion, the Government have every justification for taking action. If they are not willing to move they ought to announce that, under existing legislation, there is no method of dealing with Trusts. If the Government would only make that admission or prove by an experiment that the law is a failure, I think that the Opposition would co-operate with them in passing a satisfactory amending measure. I feel, however, that the* only remedy lies in the nationalization of the coal industry. </para>

I feel that if the Scott Fell case is a reflection of what may be- termed reality, there may be a very great necessity for the Government to take immediate action, that is, if it is a fact that a firm has to announce to the Coal Combine the destination of a cargo which it wants to buy. Apart from that, I do not regard the .combination of the coal owners as the dire evil which has been depicted by some speakers. Foi twenty-two years I had as close a connexion with the coal trade of New South Wales as has any man who is now connected with it. If ever an industry has been bled to the very, core for the welfare of the public of Australia, and probably to the advantage of other parts of the world, it has been the coal industry of New South Wales. For years I advocated the formation of just such a. combination of the coal trade as exists in that State to-day. </para>

I do not want honorable senators to be goaded into a false position by the influence or cry of the manufacturers in connexion with this matter. vW,he Coal Combine of New South Wales has done, up to the present moment, a laudable work. It has already very materially increased the output of New South Wales. It has f materially increased, not only its selling  |H  price, which I candidly believe it was entitled to do, but also the -wages paid to the men who are producing the coal. </para>

                        <para>- I am talking about the miners. The Coal Combine has done very great service up to the present moment Whether it has also done the injury that is indicated by the Scott Fell case I am not prepared to say. That matter is certainly worthy of every man&#39;s inquiry. I have seen the time when it was the prayer of every man working in&#39; the mines that the employers would come together  and deal honestly with one another in the selling of their coal, in order that they - the men who were producing it. - might obtain an honest livelihood. For years the practice was for one coal-owner to go to a ship and offer coal at 8s. a ton, and then for another to come along two hours afterwards and say, &#34; I will load you for 8s. too, and give you 500 tons for taking the load.&#34; That condition of things existed in New South Wales for years to my knowledge. When the produce of a hard-working man is being trafficked with in this way, and he is not obtaining sufficient wages to keep body and soul together, it is the precursor of a happier condition of things when a combination takes place to raise the price of coal to a fair figure. From my life&#39;s experience, I will not say for a moment that the Newcastle Combine has raised the price of coal one penny higher than its fair value. My complaint has always been that the coal has been sold far below its market value, as can be easily proved by statistics from other parts of the world, and by a comparison of the quality of the different coals. I do not oppose a careful inquiry into anything that is wrong, but, up to the present moment, apart from the evidence given in the press of the one act complained of , I am with the Coal Combine, and will only exercise my best endeavours towards getting the highest distribution of wages possible to the men who are producing the coal. </para>

                    <para>. - I can largely agree with what has just fallen from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson.</inline> The Navigation Commission inquired as fully as possible into the question of shipping rebates. In their report they said, &#34; We recommend that the Government should take action to abolish the giving of rebates,&#34; but on the other hand they also recommended that the Australian shipowners should have a right to the Austra- , lian coastal trade. They practically said to the ship-owners, &#34; On the one hand we will give you the right to the Australian coastal trade, but on the other we prohibit you from giving rebates.&#34; The position in the past was that the very cheapest labour that could be found in the world was brought into competition with Australian seamen on the Australian coast. The manufacturer was protected right up to the hilt, but the shipping industry was left to paddle its own canoe, and, as Australia would not give them any protection, the Australian ship-owners, as business men, naturally decided that they must take means to protect their own trade, with the result that they agreed to give rebates to people who shipped by their vessels, and who refused to ship by the cheap lascar and Chinese manned steamers. I believe that the operation of that scheme has been absolutely in the interests of the people of this Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- It applies to no other ships that were paying the same fair wages, and giving the same fair conditions as the Australian ship-owners. Every ship which came into competition with them was paying wages 50 per cent. at the very least less than they were paying. I remember, very much to my loss, when the six companies in Australia to-day were cutting one another&#39;s throats by running in competition. They included the Australian United Steamship Navigation Company, the Howard Smith Company, the Adelaide Steamship Company, the Melbourne Steamship Company, and Huddart, Parker and Company. One firm would advertise a boat to leave the Melbourne wharfs at 12 o&#39;clock. Another would advertise a vessel to leave at 2, and a third would fix 4. The result was that those ships often went away with less than a third of a cargo. They had to be fully manned. The result was that in 1893-4, not a shipping company in Australia was paying a single shilling in dividends to its shareholders. Wages were reduced to the extent of 33 per cent. to the whole of the men manning those ships. </para>

                        <para>- The public were not gaining a single penny. Freights were as high then as they are to-day. On one day, because three boats were leaving, and the companies were anxious for cargo, the public might be able to get cheaper freights, but the next day, when only one boat was going, freights were doubled, and passenger fares were in exactly the same position. I agree absolutely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that we should have the most thorough investigation into the question he has brought forward. There may be Trusts or Combines that are detrimental to the public interests. The way to secure the fullest investigation, however, is not by the Government dropping down on one poor individual and making him bear all the expense of a defence, while leaving some rich combination alone, when evidence can be got to prove that it is acting detrimentally. I disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> contention that the inquiry ought to be made by some person or persons outside Parliament. We who have been elected on the votes of the people have no right to delegate our duties to any one outside. </para>

                        <para>- It has been done, but that does not prove that it is right. The inquiry ought to be made by Parliament itself, and I shall support any proposal for a thorough investigation as to which of the combines or trusts are detrimental to the public. I believe that there is room for an investigation. The position taken up bv the Government is absolutely right in this regard - that if a firm feels itself aggrieved at being cut out of the trade, it and not the Government should start an action against those of whose conduct it complains. </para>

I shall support an inquiry into this matter, but not in the way indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> It should be an inquiry by Parliament. I will agree to the appointment of a Judge of the High Court to preside over the inquiry for the purpose of having some one to hold the balance. I shall strongly oppose any proposal to go outside Parliament to secure a Commission of business men, or any outside persons. When a Royal Commission is appointed, its members have a right within their Commission to do as they please, and they are independent of Parliament and of the people. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel NEILD</inline>(New South Wales) &#91;4.32&#93;. - I seconded the motion for the adjournment of the Senate, and I own that I did so with some feeling of curiosity to know what the Government was prepared to do in connexion with yet another inquiry. For months past they have had their hands pretty full with inquiries of a somewhat similar character. It is only the other  day that we had from the Vice-President of the Executive Council another promise of the most prompt action by the Attorney-General&#39;s Department. We have had such promises so often that I should imagine that the Ministerial reply to such requests has become stereotyped in the brain of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. We have had promises from the Government to supply information with reference to matters relating to starch, tobacco, a secret society, the coal combination, and I think we are on the brink of another promise in connexion with matters relating to shipping. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I thank the honorable senator for reminding me. We are getting along at the rate of about one promise a week, and I do not know what is to become of the Attorney-General. With the exception of one case connected with a certain witness in the tobacco trade, no result has followed the promised Government action in these matters, and in the case referred to the Government took care to make no inquiry, and to furnish a report evolved from the inner consciousness of the gentleman who wrote it, or of some one who wrote it for a certain gentleman to sign. That is the only result we have so far had from the multitude of Ministerial promises. I own that I am interested in adding a few more to the list of unfulfilled obligations on the part of the Government. I seconded <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> motion for that reason, and for the further reason that if there is anything wrong in this matter it should be inquired into speedily. I beg that the Government will not allow charges based apparently on fair grounds to remain open indefinitely, as they have done in every other case. I beg that there may be a change in the policy of referring matters to the Attorney-General, and then letting them &#34; rip &#34; because in colloquial phrase that is just about what has happened in every other case. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has added to the respect entertained for him by every member of the Senate by the speech he has made on this question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell would appear to be unaware of the fact that in the Newcastle district of New South Wales, the great opal mining district of Australia and of the southern hemisphere, there is an agreement that when the price of coal goes Up the wages of coal miners are increased&#39; proportionately. When the honorable senator makes an eloquent address in favour of cutting down the price of coal to the lowest possible limit he clearly overlooks the fact that wages in the coal mining industry would have to be reduced in the same wav. </para>

                        <para>- The wages question in this connexion is a very important one, because there is a very large number of men engaged in the industry. Although coal is an article of the greatest consequence to the manufacturers of Australia, a living wage is a matter of equal importance to those engaged in the industry. As for the capitalists, I do not think that coal mines in Australia have for many years paid sufficient dividends to make them more than a subject of keen interest to see whether it is possible to get any dividend from them. I support the request for a speedy inquiry into this matter with pleasure, but I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> inthinking that, if an inquiry is to be made by a Commission or a Committee it is the duty of Parliament to do its own work. We should not eternally abrogate the functions of responsible Government by handing everything over to Commissions. In New South Wales government by Commission has been far too rampant for many a year, and State Ministers and members have, I am afraid, very largely lost the sense of responsibility that should attach to those intrusted with the duties of responsible government. If we are to make an inquiry, we should be able to do the work ourselves. It is absurd to suppose that we cannot have an honest and unprejudiced* inquiry by members of the Legislature. No more severe reflection could be cast upon the Legislature than to say that its members are incapable of conducting an honest and unprejudiced inquiry. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with that. The Combine, now that it has been formed, will eliminate the middlemen, because they mean less profit for the Combine. The middlemen could not exist twenty-four hours if the Combine said, &#34; We do not want you.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> as a practical miner, must know that many of the expenses incidental to the working of collieries in the Newcastle district might be, and will - in the course of a very short period of time - be considerably minimized unless action be taken by the Government to curb the operations of the Combine that has been formed. The mining companies could dispense with the services of numbers of the miners to-morrow, because they could limit the output. </para>

                        <para>- We are dealing, with the Coal Combine for the moment, but if I am permitted to reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray&#39;s</inline> interjection, &#39; I would say that the doors are open to all workers to come into their combination, whilst the doors of the Coal Combine are closed. They will not admit all and sundry, and they have all-ready closed their doors against certain shipowners, and will not permit certain ships to be loaded at Newcastle with coal. It is mainly because of these facts that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has brought this matter under the notice of the Government. From the labour point of view, combines are inimical and hurtful, not only to the workers, but to the general community. The companies in the Combine will economize in every conceivable direction, and in a very short period will eliminate the middlemen. They will pick their own boats to load with coal, and, as a matter of fact, we know that certain shipping companies are working in conjunction with the Combine. They will boycott those who will not be prepared to come within their fold, and when they  have done this, what position will the miners be in? They will be no better placed after the combination has been perfected than they were before. </para>

                        <para>- &#39;A short time ago many of the collieries in the Newcastle district were being worked as independent concerns, and there was engaged in them a number of overseers arid foremen whose services can be dispensed with by the Combine. I should not be at all concerned about mining magnates, who have plenty of friends inside Parliament and outside. </para>

                        <para>- None of the mine owners are living in benevolent asylums as many old miners are. They are not carrying on the coal industry for philanthropic purposes. Many of them are living abroad in luxury. In regard to the miners, the probabilities are that they are gaining an advantage momentarily on account of the action of the Combine, but the Combine will have no more considera-&#62; tion for them in the future than has been the case in the past. But there is another aspect of the case, and that is the public aspect. .Are we to sit quietly by and not take into consideration what the Combine is attempting in regard to our manufacturers, and in regard to shippers? This consideration affects not one State only, but the whole Commonwealth. It is a very serious matter indeed. I have yet to learn that high prices for coal mean high wages for the workmen. In Victoria, for a considerable time, a coal industry was carried on successfully from the mine-owners&#39; point of view. As a matter of fact, considerably more was paid away in dividends than the shareholders originally paid on their shares. For some time the men were working under fair conditions. </para>

                        <para>- The debate is limited by the motion itself which alludes to the alleged existence of a Coal Combine in New South Wales in contravention of the Australian Industries Preservation Act. It may be perfectly true that other combines are undesirable, but that is not the question that we have now to consider. The question is the existence of the Coal Combine in New South Wales. While I am willing to give honorable senators the fullest possible latitude in debate, there must be some limit. The honorable senator is now transgressing that limit. </para>

                        <para>- I bow to your ruling. Evidently the line of argument that I intended to pursue would be out of order. I am not here to speak approvingly of the coal-owners. Oh the contrary, while I have been a member of the Senate, I have not shown any consideration for combines, whether in the coal industry or any other industry. I believe them to be injurious to the public interest. It was because we desired to prevent such evils as have sprung up in America that we passed the Australian Industries Preservation Act. If the Act cannot be made operative in regard to the subject brought under notice by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> the sooner it is amended the better for all concerned. In my opinion, stringent inquiries should be made as to the operation of the Coal Trust, and matters incidental to it. The evidence elicited should be submitted to the Attorney-General. I was told on a former occasion, when I raised a similar point, that if I would procure evidence the Government would in it it ate a prosecution. But I think that my duty begins and ends when I bring such a matter under the notice of the Government. It is for the Government, not for an individual, to take action. I trust that the subject which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has brought under our notice will receive full and serious consideration. If these companies are carrying on their business in contravention of the Act, I hope that the Government will not hesitate to put the law in motion. </para>

Nay, I will go further and say, that if what is going on at present in regard to legislation affecting trade continues, it will be almost a necessity for combinations in some shape or form to be brought into existence to a greater extent than is now the case, or than has been the case in. the past. I emphatically protest against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> assertion that combines are necessarily evils and are unjust to the public at large. </para>

                        <para>- I contend that just as. workmen combine in unions to defend themselves against the difficulties they would have to contend with if they had to fight singly, so manufacturers have a right to combine to protect themselves against what they regard as unfair competition. As to the coal industry,  1  feel that it is the duty of the Government to institute an inquiry. It may be found that the Combine is conducting its business on legitimate lines and is acting equitably to the public. In that case there would be no need for further proceedings to be taken. But at all events there is sufficient reason for the Government to institute an inquiry so as to ascertain what the Vend has done. We shall then at all events be satisfied that the Government have done their best to put the Act into operation. </para>

                    <para>. - It is a matter of great satisfaction that honorable senators in discussing this question, which has been very properly raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> have treated it from a non-party point of view. I say that not only because of the opinions expressed on this side of the Chamber, but also because of those enunciated by honorable senators opposite Honorable senators hold various opinions in reference to combines. Some contend that they are good up to a certain point, and that then they become social pests. Others may consider that they are not good at any time. I am not one of those who think that they are not: good at any time; but I do think that whenever they become social pests it is time not only for Parliament to talk about them, but for the Government to take steps to put in force the law that was passed for the protection of the public, which is generally known as the Anti-Trust Act. In the course of the debate I interjected &#34; What about the sma I man ? &#34; and an honorable senator replied, &#34;The small man has to go.&#34;&#39; I venture to think that the small man has not to go to such an extent as some honorable senators think. I shall connect these remarks with the matter that has been brought under the notice of the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> We know something about a Shipping Combine on the coast of Queensland. It may not be absolutely the same Combine, or on all fours, with that which operates in other parts of Australia, but it is based upon the same principle of action ; and the matter to which I refer should be carefully inquired into. Not so very long ago - I think within the last two years - an attempt was &#39;made by the shipping trading companies along the Queensland coast, or on a certain part of the coast in the vicinity of Mackay, absolutely to debar their customers from employing the small cutters which they had been utilizing. This maybe said not to have anything to do with the Coal Combine, or the Coal Vend, as it is called, but I use the case to show how the perfectly legitimate trade of small men may be cut into by a combine. </para>

                        <para>- lt was not fair because the ship-owners refused to pay certain rebates to people who used these cutters. That case goes to illustrate what can be done by a combination to the detriment of the public. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that this matter should be dealt with promptly, thoroughly, and at once. The least that the Government can do is to take every energetic step in their power to make investigations and obtain information, even going to the cruxial point of putting the Combine on their defence in &#39;the law Courts. The power is conferred by the Act, and I ask the Government why they do not use it. Why should we have to come forward and urge the Government to enforce the Act which they themselves asked Parliament to pass ! The Government did not then say, &#34; If you pass an amendment we will drop the Bill, because that would make it useless.&#34; On the contrary, they accepted such amendments as were carried, and the Bill became law. The least the Government can do now is to take every possible step to make full inquiry, and if they find that any combines are operating to the detriment of either traders or the general public to immediately intervene. It is more than ever necessary that this action should be taken in connexion with shipping, in view of the fact that before long we shall be asked to extend a monopoly to a certain class of ship-owners. </para>

                        <para>- No. This, is the first occasion on which the Coal Combine has&#39; <inline font-style="italic">been</inline> mentioned here. I presume that in other cases, where it was thought that the law could be invoked, the Government have found a difficulty in getting men to substantiate their statements. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> stated that under one section of the Australian &#39;Industries Preservation Act &#39;the Court has power to compel men to divulge information, and in reply to my interjection, he added that the section applied to -witnesses for the prosecution. It is an extraordinary thing to me if the Act contains that power. If witnesses for a prosecution can be compelled to come forward and give evidence, we are breaking fresh ground in legal procedure. In reference to the Coal Combine, I can fully appreciate the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> although they may have surprised certain honorable senators. I can quite realize that in Australia there has been such a thing ais suicidal &#39; competition amongst companies engaged in carrying on industries. Np doubt that competition has been carried on to the absolute detriment of the people engaged in the industries, especially to the workers.  -I can remember the competition which prevailed in the maritime carrying trade fifteen years ago. The shipping companies were running against each other in every direction, contending in an unfair and unwarrantable way for a small trade. Ultimately they were forced to reduce wages-. Our standing counsel to them was to wipe out the suicidal competition. They could not do that unless they combined. ^1 can understand circumstances arising which would warrant the formation of a combination of coal-owners for the purpose of putting an end to suicidal competition. That brings me to the point that if combination amongst the workers is necessary  and justifiable, it is equally  necessary  and justifiable so far as the employers are concerned. In season and out of season it was pointed out that in the maritime carrying trade it was owing to suicidal competition that the steam-ship companies were unable to pay a decent living wage. We urged them to combine, and they were very tardy in taking our advice. I do not care if certain persons wonder at my remarks. I can see as great a necessity for combination amongst employer&#39;s as amongst employes. That brings me to a point mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> and that is that it is only through combines that evil can exist. Take our experience in Melbourne in connexion with the production of coal and its use. We find that the evil steps in immediately the Combine has finished its contact with the product. Although coal can be delivered on&#39; the Melbourne wharf at 15s. per ton, yet it costs &#34; 28s. or 30s. a ton to the consumer in a suburb. The price of the product is doubled for the mere purpose of conveying it from the ship&#39;s side to the &#34;consumer&#39;s premises. </para>

                        <para>- It causes a person to reflect seriously where the evil really lies. The Coal Combine is not getting that fat slice of profit from the supply of coal to the consumer which we are led to believe it gets. The lion&#39;s share goes to those who are distributing the product in Melbourne, who are apparently making a profit of 100 per cent. I cordially support the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and I think that a Royal Commission, if appointed, might devote their labours - not without some benefit to the community - in ascertaining why 15s. is added to the price of coal after it is landed on the Melbourne wharf. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree in the main with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> object, and. would not have risen to speak to-day only that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> directly referred to opinions expressed by me some time ago. He might have mentioned  that I had expressed the opinions frequently some time ago. I have  always  held that if &#39;the workers combined in any direction, the employers also should combine in that direction, and for the same purpose - that is, to protect their own and their common interest. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is wrong, as usual, in expressing an  opinion  with respect to either &#34; the lion or the lamb. He ought to know that his most treasured ideal cannot be accomplished  without combination. I have always maintained that up to a certain point, combination is in the interest of the workers, the employers, and the public, but when it becomes monopoly, it is in the public interests that drastic action should be taken. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> had listened to the debates on the Australian . Industries Preservation Bill when it was before the Senate, he would know that  1,  with many other members of the Labour Party, repeatedly declared that it would be of no use, and that other action would have to be taken in order to protect all sections of the community. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> ought to keep his mind easy, and should not object to combines. When, however, a combine becomes a monopoly, then is the time for the honorable senator to act, and I am sure he will always find me ready to co-operate with him. </para>

He knows well that there would be no chance. It is only when a combination becomes injurious to the general weal that honorable senators on the other side will join with us in taking action to protect the public. If the Government can indicate any direction in which the Act can be amended so as to protect the interests of the public, we shall always be willing to assist them to achieve that object; but, as we have already indicated, we have very little faith in legislation of that description. Until something is done to bring about the scheme which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has advocated, we must put up to some extent with the combines. </para>

I will mention one speech as an example - that delivered by yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> You pointed out at that time that the Bill was not in demand by anybody, and that all the Chambers of Commerce in Australia, who, I. take it, represented pretty well the commercial opinion of Austrafia, were absolutely opposed to the measure, lock, stock, and barrel, as introduced. Therefore, what I am saying does not refer only to one particular aspect of it. I myself am not opposed to combination. I think it is absolutely necessary. But when a number of men like the coal owners, who control a natural product, get into such a position that they are able to say, either to those whom they employ. &#34; You will have to work for so-and-so,&#34; or to the public &#34; You will have to pay so much for this commodity,&#34; it is the greatest possible argument that can be advanced to forward the platform of the party with which I am associated. There can be no stronger argument for what we advocate than to say &#34; These people are a menace, not only to the commerce of the community, but also to the interests of the community as a whole.&#34; We have an object lesson in this matter in what has taken place in New </para>

                <para class="block">Zealand. A few years ago the coal magnates there were in exactly the same position as the coal owners in New South Wales are in to-day. They . were able to combine to regulate the output, to say to the public, &#34;You shall pay a certain price for your coal,&#34; and to say to the miners whom they employed &#39; &#39; Your wages shall be so much, &#39; &#39; thereby victimising on the one side the men whom they employed, and on the other the consumer. The only means by which it was found possible to deal with those people was for the Government of New Zealand to step in and open up coal mines of their own. The Government did so, employed the men at a fair wage, put the commodity on the market at a fair price to themselves- </para>

                        <para>- There has been an honest profit on the enterprise. What the honorable senator is probably thinking of is the fact that two mines were opened up in different centres, one of which did not pay, but the other paid more than sufficient to &#34;cover the loss on the other. By means of that undertaking the Government were able to control or regulate the price which the private coal-owner could obtain for the coal he produced in New Zealand. </para>

                        <para>- I did not read the debate, but the report laid on the table of the New Zealand Parliament I did see, and I have stated the impression which it conveyed to me. 1 say nothing about honorable senators opposite seeking to get protection from the Australian Industries Preservation Act, the passage of which&#34; they opposed. I think it is a fair thing that they should. They were honestly of the opinion that the passing of that law would be detrimental to the interests of the people of Australia. Since then they have wakened up, and have come to the conclusion that the Government were perfectly justified in asking Parliament to pass that kind of legislation. They hold now the reasonable opinion that the law was passed, not to do any injury to the commerce of Australia, but with the object of protecting the interests of the producer, the wage earner, and, possibly, the consumer. I congratulate honorable senators opposite on at last arriving at the conclusion that the law, to which they were so strongly opposed, is a fairly good one to have on the statute-book. They go further, and say that, if it is not sufficiently strong in its present form, they will be only too glad to join with honorable senators on this side in having it amended and made effective enough to deal with any case like the one before us. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> like myself, does not object to Combines, but he does object to a Combine who say, &#34;We fix the price of the commodity that we produce at 10s. per ton, but we will not supply it to every person who comes along.&#34; . So long as the Combine which is the subject of this motion has coal, it should supply it to every person, to the utmost extent to which it is able to produce it, at the price which it has fixed. I think that the Combine is doing good, for the reasons pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson.</inline></para>

                        <para>- That was probably because the miners&#39; organization was net sufficiently strong, and had no power to demand that a fair portion of the price which the coal was bringing should go to pay those who hewed it. The same condition as obtained in New South Wales also obtained to a very great extent in Queensland. Men at&#39; the Bundamba collieries were living a life, in many cases, which was not fit for a decent man to live, because the price at which the coal was being sold was so low that there was always friction between the men and the mine-owners regarding the wages. For the last four months we have had men out on the Queensland coast for the very same reason, the coal-owners contending that they are not able to pay more, and the miners saying that they  aTe  not able to obtain a decent living at the rates at which, they were paid. I am in sympathy with the object which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> seeks to attain, but, at the same time, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> and a number of other honorable senators belonging to the party which sits on this side, I had no particular faith in the Australian Industries Preservation Act when it was passed. I shall have no particular faith in it even if the honorable senator succeeds in making it as strong again as it is, but what has been stated by honorable senators opposite is the strongest argument in favour of the control of the trade by an authority which will see that a fair thing is done to the consumer, and also to those who are employed in obtaining the commodity. The party which will bring that about, so far as I understand it, is the State, and the State only. </para>

                    <para>. - I have every reason to be thankful to honorable senators for the way in which they have received the motion, and I am pleased also that they have, apparently, in no sense misunderstood my object in bringing it forward. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has referred to the beneficial action of the Combine in keeping up prices at what he says, and probably rightly, is only a fair rate to enable reasonable wages to be paid. I wish to remind him, as T have already done by interjection, that I in no sense question that aspect of the. doings of the Combine. I did not wish to raise it. I did not wish to complicate the question which I brought before the Senate. I simply dismiss it now with the remark that I am not affirming that the Vend itself is injurious. The only matter which I brought under the notice of the Senate was that the Vend was alleged to be doing something injurious. All the good acts of that combination will secure approval. If the allegations are right, it was one of their wrong-doings to which I directed &#39; attention. I ask the Senate to consider the two matters as quite distinct and separate. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in his reply to my opening remarks, practically told the Senate that the Government had, in similar cases, made many inquiries, and that the information obtainable was quite useless. But he promised the Senate, in all sincerity, that further inquiries would be made. If he believes that such inquiries are useless and ineffective, and lead us nowhere, there is not much satisfaction in his saying that the Government will again go through the performance. Inquiries such as the Department is in a position to ma&#39;ke will always end, as those have ended, in nothing more than a repetition of a. very tame farce. What is the nature of them ? The information which the Vice-President of the Executive Council read to me this afternoon has been largely obtained from interested parties, who are the only parties that appear on the surface. The tone and character of that reply showed that it was instigated by somebody connected with the industry which was nominally on its trial. That is not the sort of inquiry we want. I affirm the opinion, expressed  by several honorable senators, that there is only one form of inquiry which will enable us to get at the truth of the matter, and that is&#39; an inquiry before the common law courts of the country. If the Government find that they are unable to secure sufficient evidence to bring an action of that kind1, I repeat my suggestion that a Commission should be appointed to ascertain the facts of the case, and to discover wherein our law is defective. I need hardly remind the Vice-President of the Executive Council that for the purposes of such an inquiry a Royal Commission has a better chance of obtaining information than a court restricted by the laws qf evidence which do not apply to an inquiry by a Royal Commission. I hope that the appointment of a Commission will not be  necessary, and I believe the law should be given a fair chance that its efficacy may be proved. But if it is found necessary to have an inquiry by a Royal Commission, I do repeat my very fervent hope that it will not be constituted of politicians. Nothing has served to bring the work of Royal Commissions into discredit more than the fact that there have been appointed to them men whose views have been known, and have been strongly expressed. It should not be necessary to say that in suggesting that the appointments to such a Commission should be confined to persons outside Parliament, I do not reflect in anyway on the honesty and capacity of members of Parliament. I take the Tariff Commission as an example in point. It was constituted of four gentlemen holding one fiscal view and four holding the opposite fiscal view. They were all equally honorable men, and perhaps of equal intelligence, and, after listening to evidence, they arrived at directly opposite conclusions. </para>

                        <para>- That points to the hopelessness of doing anything, but I do not believe that our civilization is going to be so easily defeated. I make the suggestion, not because I think the Act is ineffective, but because I say that if it is ineffective we cannot stop where we are today. Unless it is clearly shown that it is the intention of Parliament to prevent them taking action injurious to the public interest, these combinations will multiply and will extend their ramifications. I hold the opinion that it is not in the public interest that we should allow that to take place. I believe that public sentiment is strongly opposed to it, and that Parliament is determined to take all necessary action to protect the interests of the public. It is for that reason, and for that alone, that I have brought this matter forward. I now ask leave to withdraw my motion. </para>

                    <para>. - On the second reading of the Bill I said that I thought it quite consistent with free-trade principles, in certain circumstances, to be in favour of a bounty for an industry which, with slight assistance, might be likely to become a success. I have listened to the arguments for and against this particular item, and have given a. good deal of consideration to it during the last few days. I propose to read a few extracts from an article appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Agricultural Journal</inline> for August of this year. This publication is issued by direction of the Secretary for Agriculture of Queensland, and is edited by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> J. Boyd, a gentleman whom I have the pleasure of knowing as a very old Queenslander and a man of great intelligence. I, therefore, listen to what he has to say with a good deal of interest, and I propose to quote from an article appearing in this journal to show why I think there is something to be said in favour of this bounty. The bounty proposed is id. per lb. for eight years, and the maximum amount to be payable in any one year is ?1,500. Should the maximum be paid in each of the eight years, the total amount involved would be ?12,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boyd,</inline> in his article respecting coffee-growing, makes the following remarks - </para>

                    <para>Why do so few farmers, especially in North Queensland, take up coffee growing, not as their only crop, but as subsidiary to a main crop ? Is it because other crops pay better, or because they are deterred by the supposed scientific methods adopted in rearing the plants? No doubt every agriculturist will agree that the quicker a crop can be raised the sooner it can be put on the market, and the less handling required to put it in marketable condition the better it will pay. There are some crops which can be sold straight from the field, such as sugar cane, potatoes and root crops, lucerne, arid oaten hay, <inline font-style="italic">Sec.</inline> Others, again, require a certain amount of preparation before they can be sold. Grain crops, for instance, rubber, tea, coffee, cacao, or fibre plants, &#38;c. Sugar cane has to be crushed, but the farmer has nothing to do with that. All he has to do is to grow the cane and cut it at maturity when it is a saleable commodity. Now, it is the same with coffee. When the berries are picked they can be taken to the State  pulper  at Kamerunga, and there they are reduced to a marketable article, when the farmer has nothing more to do with it except receiving the value of his crop when sold. As far as growing the coffee trees is concerned, there is no more difficulty about it than there is in growing orange or apple trees. Furthermore, wherever frost is absent coffee will thrive, given, of course, a reasonably good soil and rainfall. Some of the best coffee in Queensland is grown at the Buderim Mountain in the  Maroochie  district, and from one end of the State to the other the plant thrives luxuriantly on the warm coast lands. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I may say that the Buderim Mountain is situated between Gympie and Brisbane I see, also, by reference to debates elsewhere, that coffee can be grown in the coastal districts of New South Wales, as far south, I believe, as Grafton. With regard to prices, the writer of this article quotes <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Newport,</inline> who is an Instructor in Tropical Agriculture, as follows - &#34;It is difficult to arrive at the cost of producing coffee in Queensland, but it is a great deal more than &#39; it ought to be. To get proper statistics on the industry it must first be firmly established ; and secondly, well organised, and exact accounts must be kept by the growers. Ir? Queensland the industry is still young, and in, very few instances are accounts kept at all.&#34; </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Newport</inline>writes further &#34; I can say that coffee ought not to cost more than 4d. per lb. (in parchment) to produce here. I do not think coffee can be or ever will be produced at 24d. to 3d. per lb., as American coffee is, but we have in our favour the protective Tariff, and the quality of the article.&#34; </para>
                <para class="block">The protective Tariff may have that effect,, but I understand that hitherto the Tariff has been imposed for revenue purposes, and, unfortunately, on this occa&#39;sion the Government have not brought forward their Tariff Bill before the introduction of a Bounties Bill. I am one of those who prefer to give a bounty on the production of coffee to increasing the Customs duty on the article, because we should know what the bounty will cost. I am not in favour of increasing the duty on coffee, whilst I am prepared to support the small bounty here proposed. The article continues - </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline>Hepburn, who grew coffee on the Hambledon Estate, near Cairns, set down the cost of picking at ?d.  per lb. of cherry. At this rate, the dry parchment would cost under 24d per lb., and when milled - parchment and silver skin removed - the cost is brought up lo 3d. per lb. on the commercial coffee bean. </para>
                    <para>Some planters, says <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hepburn,</inline> plant I,000trees per acre, and he gives the average production at 2d. per parchment cured coffee pe.r tree. From this it is to be deduced that at /d. per lb., the price obtained by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> D. Lewis, Cairns, for his parchment coffee, each tree would? yield is. 2d., or at the rate of ^58 6s. Sd. per acre. The cost of production, irrespective of planting, and care of trees, thus amounts to <inline font-style="italic">$d.</inline> per, tree, leaving a profit of gd. per tree, from which to deduct working expenses up to the time of harvesting the crop. These  figures  are, of course, of old date, and we have not at hand any very late similar particulars from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Newport.</inline> The latter puts the cost of picking, however, at <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> per lb. In a&#39; later article (1900) Ml Newport says that &#34; In Queensland we have a-  very  possible (and frequently reached) 20 cwt. per acre, a probable 15 to 16 cwt., as an aver  age,  and an easy and ordinary 10 to <inline font-style="italic">12</inline> cwt. per acre, with very little attempt at cultivation. . .  . Now, as to paying : Picking a 10-acre block, giving 10 cwt. or 5 tons, means some 15 tons of cherry, which, spread over three months or so, would keep two men or boys hard at it. This 5 tons, off 10 acres, if sold at ^&#39;50 Per ton (I am purposely quoting figures so low that even the most pessimistic cannot cavil at on the score of  over-sanguiness),  would give a gross income &#176;f <inline font-style="italic">&#163;25&#176;-</inline> Deducting, say, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> per week for the owner&#39;s  living,  a balance of about ^150 remains, out of which to pay for the two helping hands for a few months, transport of crop to town, and interest on or part repayment of the initial cost, spread over the first three or four years - surely a fair margin,  lt  will thus be seen that whilst  coffee  is practically an &#39; impossibility  as  an industry for a  large  capitalist with thousands  of  acres, it undoubtedly offers a very comfortable living for the working farmer, precise! v <inline font-style="italic">ft</inline> was, is, and will be to a still greater extent, in the case of small areas of cotton. </para>

They think that coffee can be grown successfully in some parts of Queensland. Indeed, I hold in my hand an illustration showing coffee growing in West Moreton. It is largely cultivated by Germans. If coffee will grow in such luxuriance in West Moreton, there is an excellent reason why this assistance should be given. At the end of the eight years coffee producing will probably be ah established industry. It gives employment to families, and will do a great deal to bring about the settlement of the country in one of our most northerly centres. </para>

                    <para>. Personally, I know very little about coffee cultivation, but after listening to the discussion, I am somewhat surprised that one or two honorable senators who have expressed their intention of voting against the item should do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson&#39;s</inline> objection to it is that, so far, coffee has only been cultivated in Australia in small areas. But we have been looking for industries capable of profitable application to small areas. This appears to be such an industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> is also opposed to the item because, he said, cotton-growing is merely an amusement for those engaged in it. Surely the complaint of those interested in labour is in that, in many instances, the work of the labourer is painful, arduous, and disagreeable. If we can establish an industry that will give profitable employment to our people, and which is in itself interesting and almost delightful, that is an argument for establishing it. Again, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> objected to the item on the ground that children are employed in coffee cultivation. He very properly objects to the exploitation of child labour. If the child labour used in coffee production were of an arduous, continuous, and painful kind, I certainly should protest against it. But there are some industries in connexion with which the family of a cultivator can be profitably, helpfully, and unobjectionably. employed. In most small orchards the orchardist avails himself of the services of his children for a few weeks in the yea.r.  Their work is not at all disagreeable or injurious. It is rather beneficial. </para>

There is nothing arduous about it. Further, coffee is an article of commerce which we in the Commonwealth use somewhat extensively. It is not used here so extensively as in some other countries, but still a considerable quantity is consumed. </para>

                        <para>- It has had a great deal of assistance, and has achieved some degree of development. The probability is that coffee has not been extensively cultivated, because many of our people have not thought of growing it. Their attention has been directed to other crops. One of the special advantages of bounties is that they direct public attention to the desirableness of cultivating the products for which the bounties are given. Very often it happens that an industry to which a bounty is given would have been successful if the bounty had not been paid. Indeed, I should say that an industry that would not succeed if some person applied capital to it without a bounty, would probably not succeed with a bounty. But the object of bounties is to tide over the difficulties attendant upon the initial stages of an industry. The more we direct public attention to industries which we seek to develop, the more likelihood there is of their being successful. I trust that the item will be agreed to, in order that coffee may be grown here on White Australia principles. Nearly all the coffee that we now consume is grown outside Australia by coloured labour. We object to coloured labour entering into competition with us internally; and we ought to object to its competition with an article which we can successfully grow within our borders. It may be proved that the bounty will not develop the growth of coffee to any large extent, and that we shall still have to import a considerable quantity. </para>

But, although the industry may not succeed, the bounty will direct public attention to coffee growing, and it is probable that through its means much more coffee will be grown in the future than has been grown in the past. It is a light, cleanly occupation. If our efforts do not succeed, the money will not be wasted, but if they do succeed, we shall establish the production by white Australian labour of a commodity that is consumed in considerable quantities by our people. We shall thus be doing a good thing for Australia. </para>

The ordinary coffee that is chiefly imported into Australia now under a duty of 3d. per lb. costs1s. 6d. per lb. That is not Mocha coffee, the best quality, which would probably cost about 2s. per lb. It is a coffee which any person who understands that commodity will admit to be, if anything, inferior to the coffee that is now being produced in Queensland. The Queensland coffee is now being sold in Australia at the rate of  is.  31/2d. per lb. net, as against1s. 6d. per lb. for coffee from abroad. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The business of roasting coffee is practically an expert one. At present the coffee growers, operating on a comparatively small scale, roast their coffee on their own plantations. At all events, a large number of them do. The coffee is roasted on a comparatively small scale, with the result that we get various qualities. I believe that if the coffee which is grown in Queensland and elsewhere, and sold in the bean green, after it has been hulled, were sent to Melbourne and roasted on a large scale, the green coffee would realize about1s. 11/2d. per lb. to the grower. The cost of roasting is estimated at1d. per lb. when it is done on a reasonably large scale. If Australian coffee can be sold in a populous centre at not more than1s. 3d. per lb., it will compete on level terms with imported coffee. The industry only requires the assistance of a bounty to be able to compete with the imported article. If the method I suggested for carrying on the industry be adopted, as I believe it will be, then in every large centre factories will be established where coffee will be roasted, ground, tinned, and labelled. In that way a large quantity of work will be given to men or women, as the case may be, in every large centre as an absolute corollary to the establishment of the coffee industry in other parts of Australia. That will be additional to the benefit which will be derived from carrying out our policy of settling white people in the tropics. That is a point which honorable senators should bear in mind. I hope that in voting on the item they will not be carried away with the idea that it will be the means of suddenly raising the price of coffee to the poor man. There is every reason to&#34; suppose that Australian-grown coffee will be able to compete with imported coffee on the terms I have mentioned. </para>

He desired that the Committee should not agree to the passage of one or two other items on the ground that Papua is more suitable than Australia for the encouragement of those particular industries; as a matter of fact, on the ground that they were natural industries to that Territory. Now, coffee &#34;nas been a natural industry to Papua for the last four or five years. </para>

                <para class="block">It is evident that the industry is being, successfully carried on in Papua. But, apart from that statement, we have each received a return showing the imports from the Pacific Islands during 1905-6 and 1906-7. In the former year, no coffee was. imported from Papua, but in the later year we imported 44,656 lbs. of coffee, valued at &#163;1,197. According to the experts and the reports which have been placed at our disposal, Papua is more suitable than any part of Australia for the coffee industry. My first consideration, however, is for the Commonwealth. I am not seriously concerned whether the coffee industry is a success in Papua or not. I am aware that for a considerable time coffee has been grown successfully in some parts of  Queensland.  As a matter of fact, the industry has passed the experimental* stage in that State. I also learn from experts that the Northern Territory- is very suitable for coffee cultivation. Last year, we imported- 1,693,990 lbs. of raw coffee, valued at &#163;46,780; and roasted, ground, and liquid coffee to the value of &#163;17,835 &#62; making a total value of nearly &#163;65,000. If we encourage the growth of coffee for consumption in the Commonwealth alone, we shall be doing a good work in its interests. It is .said that there is a Customs duty of 3d. per lb. on coffee, and that that is sufficient encouragement. </para>

From the Australian point of view, it certainly deserves encouragement. Those who argue that coffee can be produced more cheaply abroad than in Australia take a very narrow view of local affairs, and have a very restricted vision from the protectionist point of view. </para>

I hope that those who have expressed themselves as against this item, but have not absolutely committed themselves to vote against it, will reconsider their position. I know that some honorable senators would like to see coffee eliminated from the schedule for the purpose of substituting another item. I ask them not to be carried away by their own false reasoning, because two or three of them art protectionists. </para>

Coffee and tea are largely consumed in the Commonwealth, particularly tea, and I remember that when the first Tariff- was before the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> strongly advocated the imposition of a tax on tea, on no other ground than that everybody drank tea. It was not because he was desirous of encouraging the tea industry in Australia. We were told that the coffee industry was on the decline in Queensland. </para>

These are the figures : In 1897 there were 311 acres under coffee cultivation in Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- 4d. a lb. In 1898 the area under cultivation was 432 acres; in 1899, 495 acres; in 1900, 537 acres; in 1901, 547 acres. The latter was the year of Federation. Let honorable senators listen now to these figures, because they confirm my statement: In 1902, 396 acres; in 1903, 394 acres; in 1904, 342 acres; and in. 1905, 279 acres. Consequently to-day, mainly because of the reduction of the duty to 3d., there is only half the area under coffee cultivation in Queensland that there was when the duty was 4d. The industry can be carried on successfully bv a man in a small way. It &#39;can be conducted as a subsidiary industry, while those who desire to devote their whole time and attention to it can also make a success of it. It is said that the returns per acre amount to about &#163;10. If that be true, it can be made a profitable industry. </para>

                        <para>- That reminds me that in Victoria some years ago the Government gave a bounty for the encouragement of the raisin industry, although at that time - and as a matter of fact the same is true now - sufficient raisins were grown in parts of the Mediterranean and&#39; elsewhere to supply the markets of the world. But the Victorian Government were not concerned about what was being done abroad. They gave a bounty of, I think, &#163;5 a ton for the encouragement of the industry in this State, and to-day it is one of the most successful of the industries that have been brought into existence by a bounties system. The raisins grown at Mildura find a market abroad. They have brought the highest price in the London market against all competitors. That instance shows that the arguments with regard to the coffee industry in Brazil are not sound. I hope that one or two honorable senators who have not absolutely committed themselves against this item will reconsider their position, because, as protectionists, they are in duty bound to support the Bill. </para>

I am correct in salvingthat coffee growing in Queensland was referred to at some length in those second-reading speeches. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> attributed the decline in the industry in Queensland to the reduction in the Federal Tariff of the duty on coffee, which had previously been imposed by the Queensland Tariff. But at least one Queensland senator gave us a history of the growth, the very small rise, and the decline in the coffee crowing industry in that State, and he certainly did not attribute its decline to the reasons to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> referred as responsible for it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> gave us to understand that coffee growing in Queensland declined because sugar growing was found to be more profitable. </para>

                        <para>- Whatever ma y be said of this industry it has, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway&#39;s</inline> statement, existed in Queensland now for a period of over twenty years, and it has been nursed and coddled in such a way under the State or the Federal Tariff that it must Have succeeded if there were any reasonable prospect of its success. I have no objection to a moderate Tariff, but I am not prepared to say blindly, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> does, that if coffee cannot be grown with the assistance of a duty of 1:50 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> we should make the duty 300 per cent. I am not so blind as that. If I can see a reasonable prospect for the success of an industry on fair lines, I am prepared to encourage its development. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway,</inline> in dealing with the question of prices, quoted coffee imported at is. 6d. per lb., but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> reading, I think, from the Customs returns, stated that 44,000 lbs. of the same quality of coffee had been imported at a cost of &#163;i&#62;i97, or at the rate of 6Jd. per lb. That, I presume, is the average value of the coffee imported, reckoning the importations for the whole of the year. </para>

                    <para>. - One or two honorable senators have spoken on the amendment I have moved, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> in his effort to justify the retention of the item has apologized for the. industry. The honorable senator admitted that despite the high protection afforded to the industry during past years it has not thriven. He further &#39; admitted that he doubted whether, even if this bounty were granted it would be sufficient to cause the industry to thrive. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has supported the item in a very able speech, in which he has accused honorable senators who are opposed to it of acting contrary to their fiscal opinions. It is not the business of the Committee just now to discuss the fiscal issue; but let me say, as one who is opposed to the item, that I do not give way, even to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> in my desire to encourage and foster the development of Australian industries. When I spoke on the item on Friday afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> interjected that what I said showed that if the outside world could supply Australia with iron there was no reason why we should give a bounty to the iron industry ; but I point out that the coffee industry in Australia has received ample protection in the past, and yet has failed to thrive. I find from the Customs returns that in&#39; 1906 we imported 1,677,853 lbs. of raw and kiln-dried coffee the duty on which was 3d&#34;, per lb. The people of the Commonwealth consequently paid during that year &#163;20,973 on the importations of raw coffee. On roasted or ground coffee and coffee in a liquid form, the importation was 342,999 lbs., and the duty received at the rate of  sd.  per lb. amounted to &#163;7,146. So that on the total, importation of coffee during 1.906, a sum amounting to &#163;28,119 was paid by the people of the Commonwealth in order to protect and foster this industry. If the payment of such a sum in one year has not been sufficient to encourage a further development of &#34;the industry, I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> to tell me whether a bounty of &#163;1,500 a year is likely to save the industry from ruin. Will this bounty represent the difference between success and failure in this industry? I say that it will not. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has referred to reasons for the decline in the coffee growing industry since the inauguration of Federation. The industry has received ample protection under the Tariff prior to and since Federation. I suggest as another factor in the decline of the coffee industry that when the duty imposed by the Queensland Tariff was reduced by id. per lb. under the Federal Tariff, tea was at the same time placed on the free list, and, consequently, since that time more tea and less coffee has been drunk in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It must &#39;be admitted that the proposed bounty of &#163;1,500 a year represents but a very feeble attempt to develop an industry which has not been successful with the aid of a duty representing &#163;28,119 a year. Whilst I make these statements I can say that I have been fairly consistent in my support to the Bill, since this is only the second item I have opposed. If we are to encourage industries they should be such as have a fair chance of success. We should not forget that the  object  of the Bill is not merely to foster industries already in existence, but to create new industries.1 Speaking as a protectionist, and one who, when the Tariff Bill is before the Senate, will prove his right to be so called, I say that this industry has received ample protection and has failed to thrive, and I am, therefore, opposed to this item, as likely to be of no use whatever. </para>

There is reason in all things, and a duty of 3d. per lb. on coffee ought to be quite enough. Coffee must be regarded as a necessary of life, and it is possible to go too far in protecting such commodities. I noticed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> who is in charge of the Bill, did not quote from the report of the experts on this item.

                    <para>It is undeniable that coffee of a good qua-lily can be produced over large areas of- the tropical* and sub-tropical areas of the Commonwealth. The returns, however, of the plantations are not alluring, while the consumption of coffee by the people of the Commonwealth is on a- very slender scale. The experience of the chief coffee producing countries of the world, and these are countries where an abundance of cheap labour is obtainable, does not afford much hope for the extensive and successful exploitation of the industry under Australian conditions. In Brazil, for instance, sufficient coffee is produced to meet, the requirements of the whole world, the figures being as under - Year, 1901-2, world&#39;s consumption, 15,500,000 sacks; year, 1901-2, Brazilian production, 15,496,000 sacks. It is also an ominous fact that according to the <inline font-style="italic">Tropenflanzer,</inline> a recognised authority on all tropical matters the planters of Brazil have not only destroyed large quantities of coffee berry because of the low prices prevailing, but have also pulled up the bushes growing on large areas of coffee plantations, and are using the land for other purposes. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>These producers must have been a little bit &#34;off their chumps&#34; to pull up the bushes if they we&#39;re producing a payable commodity. They pulled them up because coffee production did not pay. We have heard a great deal about risky enterprises, but&#39; could anything be riskier than this? I hope honorable senators will not think that I object to this item because it principally concerns Queensland. I have no prejudice against Queensland. But coffee has been grown for years in that State, and the experiment has failed.&#39; At one time, there were 500 acres under coffee. The production has been on the decrease ever&#39; since. The fact that it did not pay to cultivate coffee is a proof that it is a risky industry. I am certainly a protectionist, but when it comes to taxing the people&#39;s food in this way, it is quite another matter. </para>

                    <para>  The records available of Australian experience in coffee growing are by &#39; no means encouraging. In the year 1903 there were 318 acres under coffee in Queensland, the total yield being 83,632 lbs. Valuing this at gd. per lb., which is allowed to be a fair average price, the return would not be more than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> per acre. Considering the labour involved in clearing and preparing the land, in picking and cleaning for market, and bearing in mind the fact that the plantation does not become productive until it is four years old, this return appears totally inadequate. </para>

                <para class="block">Yet the experts - I do not know whether by order of the Government or not - recommend a bounty of id. per lb. There is nothing in this report to encourage any one to go into the industry. The fact that there is already a duty of 3d. per lb. ought to be sufficient if coffee growing in Queensland were capable of being conducted successfully.  But the fact is that those who have engaged in coffee, growing have found the experiment unremunerative. Looking at the matter from a broad point of view, can we say that the industry is a promising one? Can we recommend it to the working classes, who have to earn their living by the sweat of their brow? </para>

                    <para>. - It is extremely difficult to account for the aberration of intellect to which the discussion on the item &#34;Coffee&#34; appears to give rise. We have honorable senators getting up and protesting in words of the strongest character that they are protectionists and are desirous of encouraging Australian industries. But when we put them to the test they draw the line at coffee. If there is any plant which can be grown profitably in the northern portions of Australia - and in that term I include the Northern Territory, the north-western portion of Western Australia, as well as the northern portion -of Queensland - it is coffee. Both the climate and the soil are suitable for its production. Coffee is an extremely healthy beverage. I recomend it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> as being much better than tea, which is a nerve-racking beverage. If it has been over-boiled and the tannin extracted, it gives rise to a great deal of indigestion. It is also the product of coloured labour. That is a kind of labour which honorable senators who are so strongly opposed to this item are always decrying. Yet when they have the opportunity of assisting in the production of a better beverage than tea in their own country by means of white labour they fail to avail themselves of it. I am at a loss to account for the extraordinary twisting which seems to have taken place in the minds of some honorable senators in connexion with this subject. Again, we find honorable senators pouring ridicule .on the reports of the experts. &#34; What do these experts,&#34; they ask, &#34; know about the subject?&#34; - that is, of course, when, the experts  do not agree with their own ideas. But now we find them getting up and treating the&#39; report of the experts with all the reverence which is usually accorded to Holy Writ. The last  speaker  actually trembled when he read their report. </para>

                        <para>- The fact that the duty fails to protect is to me overwhelming evidence that it is not high enough. If it protected &#34;we would not be importing annually 2,000,000 lbs. of coffee, raw and liquid. If coffee were an article like tea, which could not be grown in Australia, commercially speaking, I would not be at all  surprised. But it has been proved that coffee of the best quality can be grown here. I am not sure that it is not superior to Arabian coffee. In Queensland the industry was flourishing until Federation was accomplished, and the duty was reduced from 4d. to 3d. per lb. There maybe something in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley&#39;s</inline> claim that a number of persons deserted coffee growing for sugar-growing when the sugar boom was on. Federation gave a much wider market than previously existed, and the consequence was that men rushed into the sugar industry until now we are producing almost enough for our own requirements, and will speedily, unless something happens, be placing that commodity on the world&#39;s market and competing with the cheap coloured labour of other sugar countries. In face of that fact is it not desirable that the Commonwealth should) do something to establish a new industry ? Here are we importing annually 2,000,000 lbs. of coffee value.d at &#163;64,000, and yielding a duty of &#163;28,000, so that in all our coffee costs us &#163;92,000. I claim that it would be much better to grant a bounty of 6d. or 7d., or even 8d., per lb. upon the production of coffee than to continue to import it in such large quantities. Every one who votes against the bounty for coffee must, if he wishes to be consistent by-and-by, vote for the abolition of the Customs duty of 3d. per lb. on coffee. Why ? Because it has been proved incontestably that it isa revenue and not a protective duty. </para>

Some honorable senators seem to run away with the idea that I am &#34; barracking &#34; for this item simply because coffee is a Queensland commodity. That is not the reason. I believe that we ought to try to develop the northern portion of Australia. Here is one commodity which will grow there, and why should we not assist its production ? </para>

                        <para>- We have heard it said of thousands of things that they would not pay. Those people who know beforehand what will pay and what will not, are, like the poor, always with us. To sit down and say in a feeble-minded fashion that a  particular thing cannot be clone, or is not worth doing, is a habit which&#39; it is extremely undesirable to foster in Australia. We want here men who do not see difficulties, who go out into the wilderness to blaze the track of progress, prospect the country, establish industries, and increase our population - men who have some faith in their country. Some honorable senators have said that it is not possible to grow coffee profitably in Queensland. In the <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Agricultural Journal</inline> of 1st August, 1898, there was published a paper read by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bromiley</inline> at an Agricultural Conference held in Queensland in that year. He was a coffee grower, and said - </para>

                    <para>I thought, perhaps, the experience gained in six years by myself might be of use, particularly as I started feeling very gently into it. I did not invest a very great amount of money in it because I was not at all sure how it would do as a plantation. I had seen it grow under all sorts of conditions. I had seen it grow in all aspects, in various qualities of soil, and at various altitudes above the sea ; from just a little above the tide water to where I am now, and so far as I know I have the highest point growing coffee in our district. I have seen it doing well on hungry granite. I have seen it growing on almost a stone quarry, where fifteen or sixteen year old trees gave splendid crops ; only in one case have I seen it fail, and in that case it was right on the sea-beach, or nearly in the sea-sand, but certainly not more than twenty feel above tide water, and exposed all the time to the northerly winds. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose for various reasons. Why have men failed in potato growing in Tasmania? Every man who tackles that industry in Tasmania does not make a fortune. It took some time to establish even apple growing in Tasmania. I &#39;believe that the foundation of every Tasmanian industry was laid in the convict days, when, if they had not bounties, they had very cheap labour. I do not propose at this stage to read any more from this article. I do not think that anything I might quote from it would influence honorable senators, because they appear to have made up their minds. But I would make this last appeal : We are trying to establish industries in the tropical portions of Australia. It may be admitted at once that coffee growing is not a big industry. We spend only  &#163;64.000  on the 2,000,000 lbs. of coffee that we import, but, small as that quantity is, if we were producing it here, the expenditure of that amount of money within our own boundaries would give employment to quite a number of families. Coffee growing is eminently a family industry.  It  can be more advantageously carried on by a man with a young family, than by any other kind of settler. Those are the very people we want to encourage in the northern parts of the continent. We hear a great deal about the empty north, and about the need to populate it, but when the Government,  in  good faith, bring in a proposal which, if carried, will encourage the settlement of men with families there, a number of so-called protectionists - they must be a new brand of protectionists - bitterly oppose the idea. </para>

                        <para>- It is protection that does not protect. We pay &#163;64,000 for the coffee we import, and &#163;28,000 in duty on it, or almost so per cent. It is protection run mad, because it is not- protection at  all.  If it were protection, we should probably pay only &#163;2,000 or  &#163;3,000  in duty. I shall never be satisfied until the whole of the coffee consumed in Australia is grown upon Australian soil. The arguments for this item have been sufficiently strong to induce any man who is truly Australian in sentiment, who desires to see the north populated, and who above all, is a protectionist and not a revenue tariffist, to vote for it. I hope that even at this eleventh hour, some of our friends will find grace, and return to the protectionist fold. </para>

                        <para>- Or businesslike reasons, but I shall tell honorable senators a few facts that are within my own knowledge, and that have convinced me that coffee can be grown in Australia, that it is better for the people of Australia that it should be grown in Australia, and that even if we have to impose a higher duty and give a bounty as well, we ought to grow it in Australia. I intend to give some reasons why coffee growing in Australia is not so successful as it ought to be. I do not need to go to experts or statistics for proof that coffee can be grown here. While living in Melbourne, I thought, on account of the various statements I have heard about the adulteration of so-called coffee, that it would be better to get the coffee beans, have them roasted, and grind the coffee myself. I thought that I would then be sure to get the real, genuine article. I went to a shop, and found that I had to pay at least1s.5d. per lb. for raw coffee, and1s. 7d. for another kind. I asked for Queensland coffee, and they had not such a thing in the place. I have gone to the same kind of shop and found that they have not Australian currants, raisins, or dried fruits. I asked for South Australian cheese, and some of them did not know that such a thing was made in South Australia. </para>

                        <para>- They did not want to know. Anything Australian has never received the encouragement in Australia that it ought to receive, because the people connected with these businesses are not as patriotic as some honorable senators appear to be at the present time. I thought the best thing to do was to consult a Queensland senator, and I spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> on the subject. He got me some green coffee beans from Cairns, and some roasted coffee beans from the same place. According to his statement, this coffee was worth1s.  2d.  per lb. It would appear from the prices which have been quoted, that that is a sufficiently high price to pay for coffee on the plantations, but it is much below the price at which other coffee could be bought here. I can assure honorable senators that the coffee made from the beans supplied to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> was good coffee, and was the genuine article. I can tell the Committee why coffee is not so largely used as it ought to be. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> was1 speaking, I interjected something about boots and crusts. It is a well-known fact - and I heard the statement made from the platform of the Adelaide Town Hall by a gentleman in the business - that coffee is very often adulterated with sawdust. I know that at the present time a very large proportion of the coffee that is consumed by the people of Australia is. more than  50  per cent. chicory. It is well known that chicory has no beneficial qualities whatever, and gives only a bitter taste and a colour to the liquor. </para>

                <para class="block">Brazil, we should not grow sugar, because in Java and portions of China, and in Jamaica, all the sugar necessary for the world&#39;s consumption could be grown. We can grow anything if we care to pay for it, and I say that since we commenced to grow sugar in Australia the consumers of the article have not been called upon to pay an appreciably increased price for it. It is the same with coffee. If we give sufficient encouragement to the industry by means of a protective duty, a bounty, and the effective administration of our Foods and Drugs Acts and the Commerce Act, we shall find in a very short time that we will be able to get genuine coffee grown in Australia, that will be beneficial to the consumers and profitable to those engaged in producing it. If we desire to populate this country and make it worth living in, we shall not ask ourselves what articles can be produced in other parts of the world where cheap labour can be obtained. The people of Great Britain could manufacture a sufficient number of boots to pave the whole world, but that is no reason why we should not establish the boot industry in Australia. The same thing applies to the manufacture of iron, steel, woollens, and everything else. There are other parts of the world, the inhabitants of which could supply the world&#39;s consumption of these commodities; but it is to our advantage tp establish these industries in Australia, open up avenues of employment, and secure the settlement of the country. It is better that we should do that than that we should be always considering what can be done profitably or unprofitable in other parts of the globe. I hope that honorable senators will support this item, and many others. </para>

                        <para>- That still further strengthens my argument Something like 300,000 lbs. of roasted coffee was imported, and the duty imposed on that was 5d. per lb. I have stated facts which cannot be disputed. Now we are being asked not to increase the duty, but to add to the advantage conferred upon the local grower of coffee by taxing the community to the extent, not of 40 per cent., but of about 60 per cent, on the cost of the raw article. All the facts are decidedly against the retention of this item, however strong the protectionist proclivities of honorable senators may be. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing of the kind. With respect to the support which this article has already received from the taxpayers of Australia, it has been urged that, owing to the reduction of the Queensland duty under the Commonwealth Tariff, the coffee-growing industry has been very seriously affected. But those who favour the item have not informed the Committee of the effect upon the industry in Queensland of the imposition by the State Parliament of the duty of 4d. per lb. We have not been told what was- the consequent increase in the acreage devoted to the crop, or how long the duty of 4d. per lb. on coffee was enforced in Queensland. That duty was reduced by id. per lb. under the Federal Tariff, but since the local &#34;producers have not been able to supply the local demand for coffee, it must be granted that the assistance afforded in the shape of the import duty has &#34;been added to the price of the product. It can be relied upon as an axiom that if a country cannot supply its consumption of the dutiable article, the amount of the duty is added to the value of the article. </para>

                        <para>- According to this report,, the imports for last year were 1,693,000 lbs. At 3d. per lb. the bounty paid amounted to&#39; &#163;21,162. That is to say, that amount of money was paid by the taxpayers of Australia by reason of the enhanced price of the article. Multiplied by six - because the Commonwealth has been established six years. - we find that the total amount of &#163;126,000 has been paid in bounties to enable the industry to be carried on. If, after the payment of this amount of money, which is equivalent to a 50 per cent, import duty - we have no prospect of coffee cultivation being&#39; successfully established, it is idle for us to think that a paltry &#163;12,000 will enable the industry to be resuscitated. </para>

But I was struck by the remarks just- made bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> who seems to be under the impression that the coffee industry has languished, notwithstanding strenuous efforts that have been made to maintain it in a state of solid prosperity, since the establishment of Federation. Although I think that the figures have been quoted by a previous  speaker,  I wish to point out that from 1895 to 1905 the cultivation of coffee was carried on successfully in Queensland. In 1895 there were 60 acres under cultivation; in 1896. 138 acres; in 1897, 311 acres; in 1898, 432 acres; in 1899, 495 acres; in 1900, 537 acres; in 1 901, 547 acres. Honorable senators will observe the steady increase from 1895 to 1901. </para>

                        <para>- I consider it very good indeed. In 1902, the first year in which the reduced duty was in operation, . the acreage dropped from 547 to 396. In 1903, there were 394 acres under cultivation ; in 1904, the acreage dropped still further to 342 ; and in 1905 it dropped again to 279. Small though the acreage may seem in comparison with the area under cultivation for coffee in other countries, I think it is abundantly evident that the reduction of the duty by id. per lb. under the Commonwealth Tariff made all the difference. </para>

                        <para>- No, because the consumption of tea in the Commonwealth has always been disproportionate to the consumption of coffee. It is abundantly evident that though the industry started in Queensland in a small way the acreage under the. duty of 4d. per lb. from 1895 to 1901 was steadily increasing. It increased in the progression indicated by the figures T have quoted. But from 1901 the acreage has gone steadily down. Under these circumstances, we can rightly ask ourselves whether any reasonable area of the Commonwealth is capable of economically producing this requirement of our people, granted that the growers receive some stimulus and encouragement in the early days of the industry of the nature proposed in this Bill. I think honorable senators will see that there is every hope that we can establish an industry that- will gradually overtake the requirements of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- That is a point which I submitted in moving the second reading of this Bill. The same argument applies to many articles in the schedule in respect of which it is proposed to grant bounties. The production of these commodities is connected with the settlement of the tropical portions of this Commonwealth, where we are most open to attack from coloured races - attack by force of arms or attack industrially. It is our bounden duty to see that, having formally laid down the principle that Australia is to be a white man&#39;s country, we shall use every possible means of diversifying the employment of our people, securing increased population, and giving that population an opportunity to cultivate the soil of this country . profitably to themselves, thus enabling them to work out their own individual destiny, whilst conserving the interest of the Commonwealth at large. We may safely rely upon that increased population to aid in defending our White- Australia policy, and to defend the Commonwealth from attacks from abroad, whether they be  military, naval, or industrial. It has been stated in the course of the debate that in Brazil many of the planters of coffee have rooted up their plantations. But one has to recollect what has taken place in that country. A reference to the <inline font-style="italic">Statesman&#39;s Y ear-Book</inline> shows that within the last few years there have been some extraordinary political developments in relation to this crop in Brazil. It is stated that - </para>

                    <para>The  Taubate  Agreement signed by the Presidents of San Paulo, Minas  Geraes,  and Rio de Janeiro, February 26th, 1906, provides for the purchase of coffee. by Government at a minimum, price, the floating of a loan of ^15,000,000 guaranteed by surtax of 3 francs per bag of coffee exported, and the issue of currency convertible at a fixed rate  irrespective of the currency now in circulation. </para>

                <para>That means that a loan has been floated, and the Government of Brazil have actually put a tax on the export of coffee to guarantee it. Naturally the coffee-growers would say, &#34;Why should we be singled out to bear a tax on the product of our industry to guarantee a loan for general purposes?&#34; Is there any wonder that the growers of coffee in Brazil should in many instances have uprooted their plants?

                <para>Australia?. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has suggested that tea, having been placed on the free list, has largely displaced coffee as an article of consumption in Australia. But honorable senators will see, if they consult the report of the experts, that our consumption of coffee relatively to other countries in the world is very small. I see no reason, any more than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> do, why more coffee should not be consumed in Australia. I believe the small consumption is largely due to the fact that many people realize only too strongly that they cannot get honestly pure coffee in this Commonwealth unless they pay a very high price for it. Various honorable senators have made reference to their experience in purchasing coffee. I believe that there is a strong impression amongst very many people that it is almost hopeless to expect to get absolutely pure coffee from the ordinary retail establishments. </para>

                        <para>- It may, but it is generally understood that if you pay a higher price you do get pure tea, but that there is more adulteration , in connexion with coffee. Our consumption of coffee in Australia is very small. Coghlan shows that in Great Britain the consumption is only  . 07  lb. per head of the population. In some other countries, the consumption is very much greater. In France, the people drink  3.25  lbs. per head; in Germany,  5.25  lbs. ; the &#34;United States,  9.95  lbs. ; in Belgium,  11  lbs. ; in Denmark,  15  lbs. ; and in Holland,  23  lbs. per head. &#39; The consumption in Australia is about1/2lb. per head of the population. Reference has been made to the amount of coffee imported. In  1906,  we imported into Australia  1,693,990  lbs. I believe that in the future Australia will take to this beverage to a far greater extent when the people believe that they can get pure coffee. Having regard to the fact that the production has fallen off in Brazil, for the reasons that I have stated, and that it has fallen off both in quality and&#39; quantity in Turkey, there is. every reason why we should hope that by means of a bounty our people will be encouraged to grow coffee to a greater extent, and that our consumers, when they are assured that coffee is grown in the Commonwealth, and that there is a guarantee that it is pure, will consume it in far greater quantities. The production of this article will increase the employment of our people, and will turn the lands of our tropical areas to profitable uses, so tending to increase not only the productiveness of our soil but also our population to our industrial and military advantage. </para>

                <para class="block">I have already explained that in some parts of Queensland the growers pulp the coffee on the plantation, and sell it in the pulped condition, that is without the cherry to the merchants, who afterwards do the hulling. In other places, the growers both pulp and hull on the ground. In order to meet the position as nearly as possible, I ask the Committee to alter the wording of the item so as to enable the Government by regulations to meet the varying conditions of those who sell pulped coffee and those who sell hulled coffee. This is very largely a technical question, and I understand that the Minister will offer no objection to the amendment. Its. object is to give the Government a discretionary power to enable them to meet the different conditions in the coffee districts. </para>

                    <para>. - In his speech on the second reading of theBill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> indicated his intention to move this amendment. Since then, I have been in consultation with my colleagues, particularly with the Attorney-General, who had charge of the Bill in the other House. I believe that there is some force in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has said The coffee is treated differently, and, if we simply use the word &#34; raw &#34; to characterize the article, the item may be somewhat ambiguous. Both this evening, and on previous occasions, the honorable senator has referred to the pulping and the hulling of the coffee, and given some information about the parchment coffee. I do not see any objection to the amendment. In regard to the interjection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> I would point out that the words &#34; as prescribed &#34; have reference only to the describing of the coffee. The period for which the bounty would be operative, the rate of the bounty, and the total amount are not affected by the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - Ordinary coffee, as it is taken off the tree is known as &#34;cherry,&#34; and has a coating of pulp like a plum. In the pulping process that pulp is taken off, and a large number of farmers then sell the coffee clean with a very thin skin. That is known as parchment coffee, and is sent to the towns. In many cases, it is sent to a merchant who has a hulling machine. He may hold that coffee in hand perhaps for months before he hulls it. It is dry, but it has a parchment skin on it. If we decide that the bounty is only to be paid after the merchant has taken off the parchment skin, the grower, who will want the bounty as soon as possible after he has put his crop on the market, will obviously have to wait until the coffee has been hulled. The object of the amendment is to enable the Government to provide by regulation that the grower shall be paid on the coffee in the parchment. As soon as ever the parchment weight of the coffee can be ascertained, the grower can get his bounty. </para>

I do not suggest that they shall be paid on the weight of the cherry, because that would include a lot of pulp, which would afterwards be thrown away as useless. </para>

                    <para>. - Under the amendment, it will be possible for the Government, if they like, to pay the bounty when the coffee is in the cherry stage. That is not the desire of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway.</inline> He is quite content that the bounty shall be payable when the coffee is in the parchment stage, in order that the grower may get the benefit of it. It is quite obvious, however, that if the amendment is made the Government can prescribe that&#39; the bounty shall .be paid on the coffee when it is in the cherry stage. Does the Committee want that to be done? I do not believe that those who voted for the bounty in the division just taken intend that it shall be paid upon the coffee when it is in that initial stage, but we leave it optional with the Government to prescribe that if they like. I make that suggestion, and it is for .the Ministry and those who are supporting the bounty, to act on it. The Ministry naturally have ample confidence in themselves, because that is a very necessary preliminary to inviting other people to have confidence in them. But such a thing as the downfall of a Ministry has occurred, and another Ministry might take their place. I protest, in the interests of good sound legislation, against&#39; leaving to be prescribed by Ministers those things which ought to be set out by Parliament. </para>

                <para class="block">Chataway has said, after the coffee cherry has been grown, it has to pass through certain processes before what may be called the &#39;ordinary coffee of commerce is obtained. It is desirable that the bounty shall be paid only in respect of the actual coffee produced, and at such a time in the process of manufacture, under such conditions, and in such circumstances, that it must necessarily go to the grower and not to any subsequent manipulator. It will probably be necessary to make half-a-dozen regulations to insure that result. I take it that that is the object of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway&#39;s</inline> proposal to insert the words &#34; as prescribed.&#34; He has probably been motived by the item, &#34;Fish, Preserved as prescribed,&#34; which appears lower in the schedule, where somewhat analagous conditions would prevail, because, when the fish has been caught, various operations have to be gone through before it is preserved, and it is desirable that there should be regulations as to the particular stage and circumstances at and under which the bounty shall be paid. No doubt that would be left to the Government in the first instance to prescribe, by providing regulations, but I need only remind honorable, senators that whenever any Act of Parliament provides that anything may be prescribed, the regulations must be tabled in Parliament within a certain time after they have been made,&#39; if Parliament is sitting, and, if Parliament is not then sitting, then within a limited period after Parliament next assembles. It is perfectly competent for either House to veto all or any of the regulations. We had an experience of that in the Senate a few weeks ago, when a Public Service regulation was amended on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline> The Public Service Commissioner has since brought down a regulation amended in accordance with the wishes of the Senate. Even if Parliament were sitting, and exception was not taken in time to the regulations after they were tabled, it would be quite possible for the Minister, on his own initiative, or on representations to which he considered that proper weight should be attached from those conversant with the industry, to amend them. </para>

                        <para>- As prescribed. But. the present proposal limits the bounty to cigar leaf, and high grade cigar leaf at that. It is to be assumed that the object of the bounty is to stimulate the growing of tobacco leaf. In proposing to assist the industry, we say to the growers, according to the Bill, &#34; You must start right off by producing the very highest grade of tobacco leaf. Instead of starting at the bottom of the ladder, you must start at the top. We can only give you a bounty when you have reached a stage that it has taken other countries, which produced at first leaf suitable for plug tobacco, a long period of tobacco-growing to reach.&#34; Leaf suitable for making plug tobacco will not do for making cigars. There may be hundreds of localities where tobacco leaf good enough for plug tobacco can . be produced, but where people would not succeed in growing leaf good enough for cigars. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite another question whether there should be a bounty for any kind of tobacco. But if we intend to give a bounty, it ought to be for that kind of leaf in producing which growers have the best chance of succeeding, and for which there are the greatest number of suitable localities. Australia has many districts suitable for growing leaf for plug tobacco, and there are in Australia people who can cure that leaf successfully. </para>

                        <para>- I should not like to say that, because it requires peculiar conditions of soil and climate. But in the Wangaratta district in Victoria, the Tumut district in New South Wales, and the Texas district in Queensland., we know for a fact that there are the soil and climate conditions for growing leaf for plug tobacco, but not for cigars. The evidence given before the Tobacco Commission convinced me that you narrow the district very much when you come to cigar leaf, which requires certain conditions not only of soil but also of climate, that do not obtain anything like so generally as the conditions suitable for the production of leaf for plug tobacco. It is of plug tobacco that there is a great consumption, and surely that is the article of which we ought to encourage the growth. If we are going to encourage the industry by means of a bounty, surely we should select that article in the production of which our people have the greatest chance of success. If they cannot succeed in growing leaf suitable for plug tobacco, they have no earthly chance of growing leaf suitable for cigar making. The curing of cigar leaf is eminently more difficult and delicate a process than the curing of leaf for plug tobacco. The trouble in Australia has been that they have not thoroughly succeeded&#39; even in the latter. This bounty, if the amendment is agreed to, might stimulate them to try to a greater extent than they have in the past to succeed, but surely we ought to endeavour first to encourage them in the A B C of tobacco leaf growing, before we ask them to pass the university course. </para>

                        <para>- I should like the honorable senator to give his. authority for that statement. I have watched the business very closely for some time past, and I may say that 8d. per lb. is not the average price paid for Australian leaf, but the price paid for the highest grade of Australian leaf. Therefore to limit the bounty to leaf bringing10d. per lb. would mean that we should pay no bounty at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temple</inline> Smith and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Neville,</inline> who are tobacco experts, the one in his evidence before the Tobacco Commission, and the other in evidence given before the Tariff Commission, directed their remarks principally, and in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temple</inline> Smith almost wholly, to the question of encouraging the growth of leaf for plug tobacco. They both drew attention to the necessity for the  adoption of proper methods in the curing of the leaf. I take it that the payment of this bounty is intended to encourage not so much the growth of tobacco leaf as the adoption of proper methods of curing the leaf grown. It seems to be comparatively easy to grow tobacco, but very often when a good leaf has been grown it is spoiled as the result of ignorance of the proper method of curing it. I have moved my amendment with the object, if possible, of giving the growers of tobacco an opportunity to obtain the bounty. My amendment, as I now desire to submit it, will read - </para>

                    <para>. - I am very glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has seen  His  way to adopt the suggestion I threw out by way of interjection. It seemed to me that the. object aimed at in offering this bounty is to promote the cultivation of tobacco leaf superior in quality to that which is being grown to-day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will remember that he has himself informed the Senate on various occasions that there is a considerable quantity of leaf grown in Australia, which is practically a drug on the market, since it is a low-grade tobacco. We do not desire to offer a bounty to stimulate the production of an article w hich.it is already difficult to sell. We should therefore offer a bounty, if at all, for a more highly-priced article. By adopting the suggestion I made, and making the bounty payable only in respect of the higher grade leaf for plug tobacco, we shall stimulate the production of that particular quality of leaf which will pay the growers best, and which we should all desire to see cultivated in Australia. There is a very serious objection to making the bounty payable in proportion to the price obtained for the commodity. I point out that leaf which this year might be worth10d. per lb. might only bring 8d. per lb. next year. Quite apart from the difficulty to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has referred as to the limited number of buyers, it is possible that if we had a dozen buyers the fluctuation of the market outside of Australia would necessarily affect prices here, and a man who had grown tobacco this year in anticipation of the bounty might fail to get it because of some slump in the world&#39;s market. He might have honestly earned the bounty, and through some cause over which he would have no control he would not be entitled to receive it. For this reason I think it would be better to pass the item as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> now proposes, making the bounty payable for a high-grade tobacco leaf, but irrespective of the price which the commodity would bring. Whilst I propose to support the amendment, I need hardly inform honorable senators that I shall vote against the item as amended should the amendment be accepted. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the item will be allowed to remain as it appears in the schedule. I do not care anything about the production of leaf for plug tobacco, because it can be made from almost any kind of leaf. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had dealt with leaf for strand tobacco there might have been something in his proposal. I have seen strand tobacco made from Australian leaf, which was pronounced by an experienced twister to be as good leaf as he ever saw. The greatest difficulty experienced in Australia up to the present time has been to get our tobacco growers to go in for the cultivation of a leaf suitable for the manufacture of cigars. </para>

                        <para>- No, but it would include so much more that the amount left over for cigar leaf would not be sufficient to encourage its cultivation. There is a great quantity of leaf used in the manufacture of cigars that is not of the quality intended to be encouraged by this bounty. It is only the leaf that is used for cigar wrappers that we need to encourage the production of. </para>

                        <para>- It is grown, but only to a very limited extent. To encourage the production of a leaf suitable for the manufacture of cigars the United States imposed a duty of  9s.  per lb. on imported cigar leaf. As a result, growers of tobacco in the United States produced large quantities of cigar leaf of avery excellent quality, but they did not produce&#39; a sufficient variety of dear leaf, and in order that the manufacturers might avail themselves of the resources of every part of the world for the manufacture of first-class cigars, the duty of  9s.  per lb. on cigar leaf&#39; was reduced to  4s. 6d.  per lb. That should give sufficient encouragement, but I am afraid we are not enterprising enough in Australia to do anything of that kind. Under the item as it stands in the schedule we are offering a bounty of only  2d.  per lb. for the production of. a superior class of leaf suitable for the manufacture of cigars. I point out that the great difficulty here has been that all our growers planted their tobacco in the richest soil, and thus produced a gross quality of leaf. Much of the leaf thus produced was more like cabbage leaf than cigar leaf. </para>

                        <para>- No ; a leaf suitable for the manufacture of cigars grown in a very rich soil will assume this character of grossness. Senators Story, Guthrie, and myself interviewed <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Holtze</inline> on this particular question, and he informed us that, to produce a leaf suitable for the manufacture of cigars, the plants should be grown in a more sandy soil, and in soil of a poorer character than that usually devoted to the cultivation of tobacco. He further said that, instead of growing a whole bunch of leaves, only three or four should be left on each plant, and particular attention should be given to them to secure the production of a leaf suitable for cigar wrappers. </para>

                        <para>- Some of it was grown in Sumatra. It was shown in evidence before the Tariff Commission in Western Australia, that cigar leaf can be grown successfully in that State and in South Australia. A <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Schmidt</inline> in Western Australia gave evidence to that effect. But high-grade leaf requires very careful treatment both in cultivation and curing, and the yield per acre is not one-tenth the yield of tobacco for pipe smoking. If we extend the bounty to the production of black or twist tobacco, we shall distribute the amount to such an extent that nothing will be left for the high class of tobacco which we ought to do everything possible to induce the growers to produce. That high-grade leaf can be produced in Australia was testified to by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Schmidt,</inline> whohad had experience, not only in Australia but also in Germany, United States, and the Philippines. </para>

                <para class="block">Government did not give him the assistance to which he was entitled. His explanation was quite reasonable. In Australia, if you clear land and plant tobacco, the leaf produced will be tainted with the eucalyptus flavour, and consequently it will not be so good as it ought to be. The land has to be cultivated for a number of years before it produces a high class of tobacco. For these reasons., we ought to confine the bounty to the very highest class of cigar leaf. Other tobaccos can be grown under present conditions with the protection afforded by the Tariff. The increased duties on imported leaf stemmed and unstemmed and cut into strips will be quite sufficient to encourage the. growth of tobacco for the manufacture of plug and twist. We wish to encourage the cultivation of cigar leaf - that is to say, not of the leaf that is used for filling cigars, but for wrappers, after the filling has been finished. If we are wise, we shall leave the item as it is, and leave the encouragement of other classes of tobacco to the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- It would be a mistake to pay a bounty for tobacco that was not high grade. The other tobaccoes will be amply protected bv means of the Tariff. In any case, the). Government do not propose to give bounties on all tobaccoes. We should require to have a very much larger sum  at our disposal to give any effective inducement to growing high-grade tobaccoes if any portion of the sum allocated were to be applied to ordinary tobacco. Later on, if an opportunity occurs, I shall submit an amendment to the effect that the words &#34;of 1 quality to be prescribed &#34; be omitted, with a view to inserting the words &#34;of a market value to be prescribed, not less than is. per lb.&#34; Even that is too little. An excellent cigar leaf will fetch a very much higher price than is. per lb. I suppose there is no product in the world for -which prices are higher than cigar leaf. The prices range from1s. per lb. to10s. in parts of the world where good leaf is required for making the most expensive cigars, such as are smoked by my honorable friends opposite. I therefore strongly urge that the bounty may be left applicable to cigar leaf, and later on, feeling very strongly that we should establish a high standard of quality, I shall submit, if I can get the opportunity, an amendment to prevent the Government from lowering the standard. </para>

                        <para>- No, because it will get encouragement under the protectionist Tariff. From that time there was a gradual increase in the production of tobacco leaf until 1896, when 4,925,544 lbs. were produced. Then there was a gradual decrease in the quantity produced, and for the period from 1900 to 1903 the average production was 710,344 lbs. In 1904 it was 1,479,680 lbs.; in 1905, 2,090,824 lbs. ; and in 1906,1,387,500 lbs. According to the item as it stands, the maximum amount which may be paid in any one year is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4,000.</inline> We can only pay a bounty on 560,000 lbs. of tobacco leaf. In other words, we shall not be able to subsidize the production of more than that quantity in any one year. It is provided that we pay the bounty which is considered necessary to induce persons to grow high grade tobacco leaf. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the proportion is small. The aim of the experts has been to induce persons to engage in the industry with the object of growing a tobacco leaf of high value, which will be suitable for the making of cigars. They have also been teaching people, as far as possible, the best methods of curing the tobacco leaf when grown. Lately I came down from Sydney with the Queensland expert, from whom I learned that last year there had been paid to a man at Bower* 1s. per lb. for tobacco leaf which he had grown, and which was really cigar leaf. I know that for some years past attempts have been made to induce persons at Cardwell, Bowen, and the southern part of the State, to go in for growing high-grade tobacco leaf. I was given to understand by the expert that a considerable amount of success has been attained, and that not only in Coomera, but also in Bowen, persons are prepared to engage in the industry with the object of producing a tobacco leaf which can be used in making the wrappers of cigars. I think that the Committee will be acting rightly in rejecting the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> because what is sought to be attained is to induce persons to grow tobacco which will take the place, to a very large extent, of the tobacco which is mentioned in the report. The experts say that the importations into the Commonwealth are already very heavy. They give the figures for the manufactured and unmanufactured tobacco, and state that as regards cigars &#163;108,000 worth - cigars and cigar leaf, I take it - was imported. These must be tobaccos of fairly high grade. If we can induce persons to engage in the industry with the knowledge that they will get some assistance from the State in addition to the education which is being imparted, we shall be proceeding in the right direction if the payment of the bounty is limited, as I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> pointed out, to tobacco leaf of high grade; that is, not below the standard which is recommended by the experts in their report. </para>

                    <para>. - I adhere to the reply which I gave to my honorable friend this afternoon, that the Commonwealth is not going to be committed to the purchase of a site in London except with the consent of both Houses. I do not pretend to say whether the report in the press is accurate or otherwise ; but, according to the information which I have since obtained, the only cablegram which has been sent has been . one to Captain Collins to secure further information which it is desirable we should have to enable us to proceed with negotiations. That is the position of the matter. The Senate will, of course, have an opportunity of dealing with this item in the usual way when the Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Bill comes on. I am anxious, if possible, to proceed with that Bill first to-morrow. I admit that in the very limited time at my disposal, I shall have very great difficulty in securing as much information as I should like. If, however, I can get a reasonable amount of information to enable me to submit the matter to the Senate I shall do so. There isa degree of urgency about it, and I simply mention that incidentally. Of course, the Senate will have the fullest opportunity of discussing every item, and securing all the information which is available. </para>
