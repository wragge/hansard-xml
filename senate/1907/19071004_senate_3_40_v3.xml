                        <para>- In relation to the contract for the construction of ammunition waggons, which was, mentioned &#34;in the debate on the Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Bill, can the Minister representing the Minister of Defence tell the Senate the length of time which the contract has to run, and if Messrs. Robison, Sons, and Company, of Melbourne, are the successful tenderers as stated in the press? Has he noticed in this morning&#39;s newspapers that the firm are discharging&#39; from forty to fifty employes on the ground that they have not sufficient employment for them? In view of his own statement that it would take the firm from twelve to fifteen months to supply the ammunition waggons, will he make inquiries as to the reason for the discharge of those men? </para>

This was a somewhat strange departure from the attitude which the same honorable senator took up a few days ago in discussing, other items of the schedule. He then said that we could grow anything in&#39; Australia, and of the very best quality. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> said that if any honorable senator professed to be a protectionist, and opposed any item in the Bounties Bill, he was not really a protectionist, and that, so far as he was concerned, he would like to build a wall right round Australia so high that if any products entered the country it would have to be by balloon. He has taken up an entirely different attitude on the item now under discussion. It is true that the honorable senator speaks with u certain amount of authority on the subject of tobacco, because he was a member of the Tobacco Commission, and if he has failed to convince himself as to the way in which he should vote on this item, he has at least convinced me that I should vote against it. The Tobacco Combine has a monopoly in Australia of the machinery for manufacturing cigars.. It, ,perhaps, would be well for me to refresh the minds of honorable senators by reading an extract from the report of the Tobacco Commission, which proves conclusively that even if Australian leaf could be grown suitable for the manufacture of cigars, the small man could not compete with the Combine. If I believed that the granting of this bounty would mean that assistance would be given to the small manufacturers, I should be prepared to support the item. I take this from the evidence given before the Tobacco Commission by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hirschman.</inline> at question  7090 - </para>

                        - What information do you wish to give to the Commission? - I desire to complain of the  way  in which the tobacco trust work machines to make what is called the inside of a cigar, but which, in the trade, is known as the bunches. The trust use, on an average, ten machines a week,  putting it at the lowest estimate, but the capacity of each machine permits it to make about 3,000 bunches per diem.
                    </para>
                    <para>Where are those machines used? - In Melbourne, in the States Tobacco Company. I  produce, for the information . of the Commission, what is styled the bunch before becoming, a cigar: It is made bv hand, or by block. The ten machines would turn out 30,000- bunches a day, which would be at the rate of 150,006 per week. A boy or girl is employed on each machine, and is paid, at most, 15s. per week to work it. That shows the cost of making the quantity I have named in a week would be <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7</inline> 10s. The  cigarmakers  of this city have lately had a case before the Arbitration Court, and from the particulars given there, it is seen that the  very  lowest at which I could make the  cheapest  cigar would be 2s. 6d. per 100; that is, to finish it right out. The rolling means putting on the covers after the bunches are made, and whether they be Sumatra,  Havanna,  or Mexican, the cost is is. 8d., or two-thirds for rolling, and  10d.,  or one-third, for making the bunches. So  that   to manufacture 150,000 by hand at  10d.  oer 100 would mean <inline font-style="italic">&#163;62</inline> 10s., as against the cost by machinery of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7</inline> 10s. The &#39; rate I have mentioned is as fixed bv the Arbitration Court, and is the same as in Victoria for block-work cigars. If taken on the basis of 50 working weeks in a year, it would mean a total wage of ^3,125, as against machinery wage of ^375, giving the trust an advantage of j&#163;2,75&#176; Per annum. </para>

                        <para>- That is just the point I wish to make, because all the Australian leaf used in the manufacture of cigars is used in the manufacture of the low-grade cigars, since it is inferior leaf. If we decide to grant this bounty, the Combine will secure the whole of it, because they are the largest buyers, and it will be utterly impossible for the small manufacturers to compete with them. It is worth our while to compare the amount of imported leaf with the quantity of Australian leaf used in the manufacture of cigars. In an appendix attached to the report of the Tobacco Commission, I find that in  1904  the quantity of leaf imported was  407,234  lbs., as against a production of  31,099  lbs., of - Australian leaf. The quantity used in the manufacture of cigars in the same year was  251.189  lbs. of imported leaf, as against  9,680  lbs. of Australian leaf. It has been contended that if we grant this bounty it will assist the cigar industry. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know whether it is because the Bill has been so long before honorable senators, but some of them would appear to view the later items in the schedule differently from the way in which they viewed the earlier items. I again point out that underlying this Bill are two principles : the -first, that it is desirable that the Government should, by means of bounties, attract attention to productions in Australia which have not yet been listed amongst the productions of the Commonwealth ; and, secondly, the principle of confidence and belief in the capacity of &#39;the Commonwealth to produce almost anything that is required  for the sustenance or comfort of man. Since this item has been under discussion it has been contended that Australia has not produced and cannot produce tobacco leaf suitable for the manufacture of cigars. It has to be remembered that in the past there has not been much attention given to the cultivation of tobacco leaf of this kind by the ordinary grower of tobacco. Apart from that fact, I do not think that the attention bestowed upon the subject has been commensurate with its importance, and the possibilities of the business. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend referred last evening to the fact that when it was considered desirable to encourage the manufacture in Victoria, the bounty was given in such a way that a number of Chinamen went in for cultivating the plants, and that they studied quantity but not quality.. I think&#39; the same has been the practice in different parts of Australia where attention has been given to the growth of tobacco. I will quote an extract from a report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill,</inline> the Queensland expert to the Agricultural Department of that State. Reference is made in it to the growth of the leaf, and he says - </para>

                    <para>There is now a demand for a limited amount of cigar tobacco, and at satisfactory prices : and farmers in the coastal districts are inclined to go in for growing this character of tobacco, and some 30 or 40 acres will probably be planted the coming year, divided between the Upper Coomera and the Cardwell districts, with a small lot at Bowen. For the small experimental lots grown this year very satisfactory prices were obtained. The  samples  have elicited most favorable comments from the purchaser, with the opinion that an expert demand can be created ; should this be so, the demand for these tobaccoes will be a large one. I believe it is true, for some of the samples show considerable merit, which will be greatly improved as the growers become more expert in the growing and handling. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>These tobaccoes should prove very profitable, as in the country north of Bowen two crops per year can be grown, and should yield a ton to the acre - say 12 cwt. for the first crop, and 8 cwt. for the second one. At  7&#189;d.  per lb., this would yield  &#163;70  per acre. This crop can thus be made a very profitable one to small farmers with growing families, as children of either sex, from twelve to sixteen  years  of age, can be employed to great advantage. I consider the outlook for the future of the tobacco industry in this State as most promising, and, if farmers can be induced to take the necessary care both in cultivation and handling, we will gradually displace much of the imported article. </para>

                <para>It has been urged that if a bounty be given for the growth of cigar leaf of high grade as prescribed - the proposal under notice - the benefit will go to the Combine, which is the greatest manufacturer of cigars in Australia. It has also been said that no bounty car be claimed under this  proposal, because Australia cannot produce tobacco of &#34;the quality that would entitle the grower to it. With regard to this item, as with regard to others, I am not in a position to speak as an expert, and therefore I shall have to call to my assistance, and to the assistance of the Committee, the advice and testimony of those who may be looked upon as authorities. I have here a letter which, singularly enough, actually anticipates both of those objections. It was not written in contemplation of the present debate. It was received by the Department of Trade and Customs within the last few days from a distributor of cigars and tobaccoes in Sydney. The writer is neither a grower nor a manufacturer. </para>

                    <para>Doubtless you have been observing the colonial cigar manufacturers&#39; remarks regarding colonial leaf, which leaf they allege is unsuitable for manufacturing cigars. As a retailer of long experience in Sydney, and previously in England, I want to draw your special attention to certain important facts ofl the colonial trade, more especially those concerning colonial leaf. When I was iri Brisbane in June this year, I was introduced to a cigar by one of the leading hotel proprietors there. </para>

                    <para>This cigar- was made in Australia from leaf grown in Australia, and I found it to be the equal of any cigar made in Australia from imported leaf. That is. this cigar completely contradicts the statement made by New South Wales manufacturers that colonial leaf is not sufficiently high grade for cigar making. As a matter of fact, however, our local manufacturers practically boycott the colonial leaf; and the only way that they can be made to use the colonial leaf is to put a heavier duty on imported leaf. In the past, the duties have been imposed to suit the local manufacturer who uses imported leaf ; the duty on imported manufactured tobacco, having always been very high, while that on imported leaf is comparatively low. Consequently the local manufacturer is drawing all his materials from other countries and crying &#34; stinking fish,&#34; or to be literal, &#34; stinking tobacco &#34; to all leaf grown in Australia. Thus the local manufacturer has got the trade on an altogether wrong basis, that is wrong from the public&#39;s point of view, because present conditions keep the trade in a few manufacturers&#39; hands, keep up the  prices of  tobacco and cigars, vet prohibit the growing of colonial leaf. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>You will at once* perceive that if a heavier  duty  were imposed upon imported leaf, the local manufacturer would thereby be forced to use locally grown leaf : to publicly acknowledge its good qualities and potentialities, and to encourage and support its production. Thus tobacco-growing as an industry in Australia would be placed on a reasonable and equitable basis, the more so since one immediate consequence would be that other manufactories would spring up and compete with those at present existing. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">What this gentleman advocates is an alteration of duties, so as not to differentiate between imported and Australian cigar leaf in favour of the former, but whether it be by abolishing or reducing the differentiation of Customs duties, the fact that stands out prominently is that, in his opinion, local cigar leaf can be used with advantage in the manufacture of cigars, in Australia, and that such cigars are equal to, if not better than, those produced from imported leaf. He points out as another consequence, that this policy would lead to an increase in the number of manufacturers in Australia. Both of those conclusions are in direct opposition to what has been urged by honorable senators who are opposed to this item. I say again, that I do not know the writer of this letter. I did not see it until yesterday. It came within the last few days to the Department of Trade and Customs. As far as I know, it was absolutely unsolicited. It had no bearing, so far as the writer knew, upon this debate in the Senate. But it brings prominently before us the opinion of the writer that Australian cigar leaf can be grown successfully, and that the consequence of promoting its growth will be the establishment of a number of manufacturers, and thereby an increase of employment. He goes on to say - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>In the present position of the New South Wales tobacco manufacturing trade, the tobacco-grower labours under every possible disadvantage. His market is so restricted that his price is kept at an unpayable level, and he is not humanly able to develop and improve his output. In a word, he is being crushed down by overwhelming forces. Consequently, it is only by a heavier duty on imported leaf that his market can be opened up and facilities and opportunities given him for growth and expansion, not only in regard to cigar leaf, but also for tobacco-growing in general. Tobacco made from Australian grown leaf is not recognised to-day. This is most unjust to colonial leaf, because I have experimented with tobacco grown and manufactured in South Africa, and I have found a ready sale for it here, although in aroma, colour, and smoking qualities the South African leaf is much inferior to the Australian. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Honorable senators are probably aware that quite recently South African tobacco has been exposed for sale in considerable quantities in the shops of the retail tobacconists in Melbourne. It is an important opinion coming from a source of this kind - a gentleman who is engaged in handling Havana cigars and Egyptian cigarettes and the best class of tobacco goods - that cigar leaf can be produced in Australia suitable for making good cigars. He does not, it is true, suggest a bounty, but the alteration of Customs&#39; duties on Australian and imported leaf. </para>

                        <para>- He is as independent, so far as I know, as any other witness produced. <inline font-style="italic">Prim&#226; facie,</inline> the fact that he is a handler of high-grade cigars should lend some value to his opinion, which was absolutely unsolicited, and was not given in connexion with this Bill. However, it has such an important bearing upon the Bill, it has been received so recently, and touches so exactly the very views that have been put forward here both this morning and yesterday, that I should have been neglectful of my duty and of the interests of the tobacco-growing industry in Australia if 1 had not submitted the information to the Committee. If honorable senators choose to attach no value to it, and nurture a suspicion that it is given for sinister or personal reasons, that is their own affair. All that I wished to do was to submit to honorable senators the information furnished to the Government, and point out that it was not obtained to order. The communication came, so far as I know, absolutely unsolicitedly from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prescott.</inline> It was not prompted by any letter to him, or by any other action on the part of the Government. I draw attention to the fact that this man&#39;, who has probably handled more cigars than the whole of the members of the Committee will do in their life-time, has given an opinion to which I attach, at any rate, some weight and importance. Apart altogether from that, the fact that there has been very little cigar leaf grown in Australia in the past, or the further fact that what has been grown has been comparatively inferior, does not conclude the question as to the possibilities of Australia. We offer in this Bill a certain sum for a certain period as a bounty to encourage people to produce more and better cigar leaf. Can they do it? If they cannot, we do not incur a halfpenny of responsibility. If they can, and do, we pay them the bounty, and, no matter what our previous opinions were as to the possibility or otherwise of establishing the industry, they will be paid the money, and Australia will be repaid in the fact that it has been demonstrated that such leaf can be produced here. </para>

                    <para>. - I should not have risen again but for some of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> statements. I believe that if he were convinced that the bounty would be beneficial to any industry in Australia he would support it.  His  objections were of two classes. The first was that the Tobacco Combine would reap all the benefit and the small man would get none. In that view he is considering the manufacturers of cigars, but the bounty is not supposed to directly affect the manufacturers, either in combines or as small men. It is proposed, not for the manufacture of cigars, but for the production of cigar leaf. We should consider whether the production of cigar leaf in Australia would not beneficially affect the small manufacturers, because, if the manufacture of cigars is confined entirely to imported leaf, it plays directly into the hands of the combines&#39; or larger men, inasmuch as it will not pay to import small quantities. Consequently, a small man would have very little chance if all the cigar leaf had to be imported. On the other hand, if, by a bounty or increased duties, we encourage the growth of the leaf in Australia, we put the small man in a much better position, because then he will be able to get his cigar leaf as required, and will not be at the mercy of the Combine or of larger manufacturers, as he is now, and always will be if he has to depend entirely on imported leaf. I have shown that there is no possibility of the bounty going into the pockets of the Combine to any greater extent than into the pockets of the small manufacturers. The principle laid down in the Bill is that the money shall be paid to the person who produces the cigar leaf. That ought to satisfy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that he is in error in imagining that the bounty would&#34; operate in the interests either of the Combine or the small manufacturer, although its effect would undoubtedly be to assist the small manufacturer in Australia. I have not the least doubt that with the production of cigar leaf in the Commonwealth, the number of small manufacturers would increase, and the competition would, to a great extent, help the grower. With respect to the next point, as to whether cigar leaf of a good quality can be grown in Australia or not, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> will not take the evidence of anybody. </para>

                        <para>- It should be another point in his favour in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray&#39;s</inline> eyes that he comes from the &#34;ma&#34; State. I have repeatedly heard the word &#34; farmers &#34; used in connexion with the growth of leaf for tobacco and cigar making. Tobacco growing is not farming, but gardening. At one time it was said just as confidently that it was impossible to produce good wine in Australia. I heard that when I came to Australia first. People used to say that we could not grow good wheat, and, in fact, that we could not do anything right in Australia ; but one by one those fallacies have been disproved, and Australians have made a success of almost everything that they have undertaken in earnest. I have not the least doubt that the same will apply to the growing of leaf, not only for tobacco, but also for cigars, in the very near future. About twelve months ago a Science Congress was held in Adelaide, and at that time I had the pleasure of travelling to Adelaide with, and also receiving a visit in this House from, one qf the largest tobacco growers in the tropics. He gave me considerable information about tobacco growing, particularly cigar leaf growing.  His  name and address is R. Parkinson, Raoul, Bismarck Archipelago. It is impossible to say what his nationality is. One would take him to be a German, but his name is English. Any one, even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> can write to him. He confirmed my previous impression that tobacco growing is not farming, but gardening, and gardening of a high class. The tobacco seeds have to be properly selected,&#34; and the beds properly prepared. The plants have to be properly selected, and properly planted out, and properly attended to afterwards. Moreover, if they are for a particular purpose they have to be attended to from the selection of the seed to the final gathering and curing of the leaf for the ultimate purpose for which they are intended. All this proves that there is more in the cultivation and growth of tobacco than is covered by the simple term of &#34; farming.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkinson</inline> informed me that with all the care that is taken in the growing and preparation of tobacco mistakes may sometimes be made. He gave me an instance where a crop worth ^40,000 was spoilt through the action of one- night. That shows the difficulty that there will be in inducing the growers in Australia to go to all the necessary trouble. I object  to the constant reference to plug tobacco, because there is better tobacco than that in use in Australia. I would like honorable senators to speak of it as pipe tobacco, instead of plug tobacco. </para>

                        <para>- It is very likely that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkinson</inline> sells any quantity &#39;of his tobacco here. To show the great care and attention which must be paid to the production of tobacco leaf, I mav mention that for the greater portion of his tobacco leaf he gets from 2 s. 6d.. to 5s. per lb. It will .not be until the growers in Australia strive- to produce an article of similar quality that they can hope to succeed in the industry. I am strongly in favour of the bounty being paid only upon the production of the highest quality of cigar leaf, so as to induce our growers to make a more perfect selection, to adopt more perfect methods of cultivation, and to devote greater attention to the curing and other handling of the leaf. If we succeed in encouraging the growth of cigar leaf, it will undoubtedly be of great advantage to Australia. This industry has brought millions of pounds to other countries, and it will do the same for Australia if proper attention, is paid to the cultivation and curing of the leaf. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> of course, &#39; takes up a strong at,titude on this question, but his strength of opinion  seems to approach more to  bigotry  than to true conviction from a consideration of honest facts. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite true. In the United States, as in every other tobacco-growing country, it was found that for the production of the best brands of cigars a variety of leaf is necessary. Some leaf has the texture which is necessary ; other leaf possesses the approved aroma, while other leaf has the right flavour. From evidence which has been given in my presence, I know that great stress is laid upon the quality of the Sumatra leaf. The greatest merit of that leaf lies in its texture, because it is considered to possess very <inline font-style="italic">little</inline> flavour or aroma. Its texture, however, is of the best quality, and the leaf is admirably adapted for the outside wrapping of cigars. It is the same with cigar leaf grown in every other country. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkinson</inline> said that if Australia engaged in this industry, as it ought to do. undoubtedly it would establish a reputation for Australian leaf equal to the character of the leaf which is grown in almost any country. He said that it would be sought after to be used not alone but in combination with the productions of other countries. In America, they found that they could not produce the necessary variety of cigar leaf and the local leaf had to be blended with cigar leaf from other countries. Did the Congress abolish the duty on cigar leaf? No. The duty was reduced by one-half, and at the present&#39; time it is higher than anything which has entered into the mind of a member of this Parliament. Even with a duty of 4s. 6d. per lb. the Americans import a large quantity of cigar leaf for the purpose of being blended with the class of cigar leaf which they produce themselves. If we keep in view our destiny, we shall endeavour to make perfect everything which can be produced here. We ought to give even possible assistance to this industry. The time may come when not only Australia will toe using Australian cigar leaf, but America and other countries, recognising its difference, and in many respects its superiority to other cigar leaf, will be eagerly seeking after it. It is for those reasons that I, with much earnestness, advocate the granting of this bounty. </para>

Since the debate on the second reading of the Bill, I have not spoken. I would not have risen to speak to-day if this matter had not cropped up. I intend to support the item. Since the Bill was brought to the Senate, the Customs duties on tobacco have been altered in another place, and further protection has been given to tobacco.

                        <para>- Yes; but I do not take much notice of the manufacturer. I assume that, we want to encourage the production of high-grade leaf for the purpose of making better cigars and better tobacco than we can get at the present time. I wish the grower , to get the benefit of the bounty. The manufacturers are well able to protect themselves, and I believe that, if necessary, they could raise the price of tobacco on the market. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I doubt. I have not yet gone into the matter, so that I am not able to offer an opinion. The Minister of Home Affairs quoted a letter from a gentleman in Sydney ; but if I caught its tenor correctly, the writer contradicted himself. He tried to make out that it is from mere prejudice that the manufacturers do not use colonial leaf. If they can get colonial leaf at a much cheaper price, and of equally good quality, it is to their interest to use it, and I believe that they would study their own interest in using it. But we know that all over the Commonwealth there can be procured a tobacco called Perfection tobacco, which is not made by the Combine. How many senators or persons outside will smoke that tobacco? </para>

                        <para>- I am a very heavy tobacco smoker. I would prefer to smoke Perfection&#34; tobacco if it agreed with me, but, unfortunately, it does not. I intend to support the item. I would not mind if we gave an additional id. per lb., and required that the leaf should be worth at least is. per lb. I believe that there is land on which it can be grown. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> mentioned that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkinson,</inline> of the Bismarck Archipelago, has said that cigar leaf can be grown in Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> asked why that gentleman did not engage in the industry here. My opinion is that when he can get labour at from 3d. to 6d. per day, he will not come to Australia to try to grow tobacco leaf. Let us, by means of a bounty, induce persons to come here and see whether they cannot make a success of the industry. Once it is made, a success, we shall be able to produce all the grades of tobacco required for home consumption. Our labour will be protected against the cheap labour in the Bismarck Archipelago, Java, and Sumatra, by the import duty. I want inducements to be held out to the planters to make experiments. If we can make a, success of the industry, &#163;4,000 a year will be a mere&#39; bagatelle. If high-grade cigar leaf cannot be produced, the bounty will not be paid, but I hope that it can be produced. The matter has been very fully threshed out, and if I thought that this bounty would be squandered on the manufacturers, I should vote against the item. . I believe the intention is to encourage the growth of a better quality of tobacco leaf iri Australia in order that the people of the Commonwealth may be induced to smoke Australian tobacco. We have heard that manufacturers have a prejudice against Australian leaf, but I think it is reasonable to suppose that they would not stand in their own light, and that if it was good leaf, they would use it, when they could get it so much more cheaply than imported leaf, the duty on imported leaf being taken into account. Locally manufactured tobacco made from Australian leaf can be purchased at as low a price as 2s. 6d. per lb. I believe that if we grant this bounty we shall encourage Australian growers of tobacco to produce a leaf as good as that produced in other parts of the world, and for that reason I shall vote for the item. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to support this item ; but, on looking through the evidence given before the Tobacco Commission, I find that the Tobacco Combine, having a monopoly of high-class machinery for the manufacture of cigars, and being the largest purchasers of leaf for this purpose, would be able to secure the entire bounty. That is something which we have sought to guard against by a special clause in the Bill, and in connexion with which we have made only two exceptions, in tinned fish and dried fruits. The Tobacco Combine, having&#39; the exclusive use&#34; of cigar-making machines, must be in a position to suppress competition, and would have the growers of cigar* leaf in Australia completely at their mercy. The- evidence given before the Tobacco Commission shows that manufacturers of cigars in Australia, by hand labour; are very much handicapped by the competition of the Combine. A witness named Arthur Hirschman, in explaining the difference between the cost of manufacturing cigars by machinery, and by hand, stated that at 10d. per hundred, it cost &#163;62 10s/ to manufacture 150,000 cigars by hand, whilst the cost of manufacturing the same quantity by machinery was only &#163;7 10s. This -witness had been engaged in the manufacture of cigars in the old country-, and in Australia, for seventeen years. He considered the position so serious that he suggested that the Commission should recommend an Excise duty equivalent to the difference in wages paid for the manufacture of cigars by hand and by machinery. At page 33b of the report of the Commission, he gave this evidence - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>I would ask that the Commission recommend that the Excise be made equal to the wages paid, and it should be levied on all machine-made bunches. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>So that unless there are more buyers in the market, the witness suggests that an Excise should be imposed, which .at present would not be thought of. He makes if plain that it is impossible for those manufacturing cigars by hand to compete successfully with the Combine, having the exclusive use of cigar-making machinery. With such an advantage, the Combine would be able to prevent competition, the bounty could not find its way into the pockets of the growers of the leaf, and so the intention of the Bill would be frustrated. I do not know what the duties imposed by the Tariff will be by the time it leaves this Chamber, but I notice that, at present, it provides a very reasonable protection to the growers of Australian leaf. A duty of 3s. 3d. per lb. is imposed on unstemmed leaf, and of 3s. on stemmed leaf. Assuming cigar leaf to be worth is. per lb., that represents a duty of at least 300 per cent. In view of that ample protection to the local growers of cigar leaf, and in view of the fact that it is likely there would be only one buyer of the leaf when it was produced, and there would be no chance of the bounty finding its way into the pockets of the growers, I must oppose the item. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> incidentally mentioned that at the Science Congress held in Adelaide last year, he had the pleasure of meeting a gentleman who was largely interested in tobacco culture in various parts of the world, and who assured him that in parts of Australia .cigar leaf of the very highest quality could be grown. I venture to say that if the gentleman referred to was a business man he would, have embarked in the business of growing cigar leaf in Australia himself, or have induced others interested in the matter to follow the advice he tendered to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> What has been the result in connexion with the growth of tobacco in Australia? I am not here to decry Australian industries. Far from it; but experience has shown that the consumption pf plug tobacco, or &#39;-pipe &#34; tobacco, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> thinks &#34;it should be called, manufactured from the leaf most extensively, grown in Australia, is decreasing. What is the reason for this? It is because Australians, the great majority of whom are protectionists, prefer to smoke tobacco made from imported leaf. It is evident that the imported tobacco suits their taste best. Whatever opinions men may have on the subject of free-trade and protection they prefer to satisfy their own tastes, even though they should have to pay a .little higher price in order to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has mentioned that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prescott,</inline> whose place of business in Hunter-street, Sydney, I have visited, has stated in a letter that recently when he was on a visit to Brisbane, a cigar made in Australia, entirely from Australian leaf, was given him, and that having smoked it, he found it equal in quality to any cigar made in Australia from imported leaf. One swallow does not make a summer, and though <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prescott</inline> may have been told that the cigar was made from Australian leaf, he had no absolute guarantee on the point. Last night, during the debate on the Tariff in another place, a member of the Labour Party produced a cigar which he said was made in Australia from Australian leaf. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> said that if it had been an Havana cigar it would have been smoked long ago, and it was subsequently discovered that whilst the cigar was made in Australia it was made from imported leaf. </para>

                        <para>- I am satisfied that if. a good cigar leaf can be grown in any part of Australia there is an immense market for it. The manufacturers of cigars have no prejudice against a good article, no matter where it is grown. They have to cater for the requirements of the Australian people. I am a protectionist, but looking at this matter seriously, even the most ardent protectionist would hesitate to support this item. I mentioned yesterday that the grower in Australia of cigar leaf was given an advantage under the Tariff of 3s. per lb. on unstemmed tobacco. .That, however, is only . one side of the question, and as a matter of fact those who desire to manufacture cigars in Australia entirely from Australian leaf ale protected to the extent of 7s. per lb.&#39;, without taking into consideration the charges, incidental to the importation of cigars. The Tariff, as originally introduced, imposed a duty of 7s. 4d. per lb. on cigars. Last night, in the House of Representatives, that duty was altered to 7s. 6d. - a fixed duty. The recommendation of the Government is that there shall be an Excise of 6d. per lb. So that there would be a protective duty of 7s. for the man who wanted to engage in the growing of tobacco suitable for the making of cigars in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- There is, first of all, a fixed duty of 7s. 6d. per lb. on cigars. Then there is an Excise- of 6d. That gives the local grower a preference of 7 s. Under the new regulations the manufacturer of imported leaf will have to pay 2s. 6d. on unstemmed tobacco, and 3s. on stemmed. He will also pay an Excise of 6d. That ought surely to be sufficient protection to the grower of Australian leaf. Tobacco, we know, varies in price as well as in quality, but if the growing of cigar leaf cannot be made a success under that increased protection, a bounty of 2d. per lb. will not make a success of it. </para>

If we are going to pay away ,&#163;20,000, how are we to determine what quality of cigar leaf is to receive the bounty ? I am not satisfied that a high-grade cigar leaf will be grown in Australia as a result of this proposal. In the absence of information on that point, and fortified to a large extent by the assurances of men who are better able to form an opinion than myself, and who tell me that Australia is not suitable for the growing of high-class tobacco for cigar-making, I have . decided to vote against the item. </para>

                    <para>. - The main objection raised by honorable senators who have opposed the item is that the bounty will go into the pockets of the Combine. There is evidence to the contrary. The Combine does not provide the only market which would be open to the growers of cigar leaf. I received yesterday the annual report of the Department of Agriculture and Stock, Queensland, for 1906-7. On page 92, under the heading- &#34; Cigar tobacco,&#34; I find that the following report is made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill.</inline> Of course it was written some time ago, and before there was any question of this bounty being proposed.

                    <para>We have progressed far enough with our efforts to stimulate the production of cigar tobaccoes to have every confidence in the future. The prices realized have 3&#39;ielded an average of something like <inline font-style="italic">&#163;60</inline> per acre, and there is now a prospect of several farming centres becoming principally tobacco-growing. If we succeed in producing as good an article as our efforts indicate, these tobaccoes will return handsome profits to growers for export, and they will not have to depend altogether upon local markets. </para>

                    as honorable senators are aware, has been in the tobacco growing districts of America, and is an authority second to none in Australia upon this subject. He points out that, not only can cigar tobacco be grown in Queensland, but that it can be grown profitably for export. So that, if any attempt is made by the Combine to cut down prices-, the grower will be able to export his leaf. So far as concerns the ability of the country to grow good cigar leaf, I may remind honorable senators that when this item first came before the Committee, I drew attention to the fact that 200 lbs. or 300 lbs. of leaf from Bowen had been sold at a price equal to is. a lb. Of -course, that is not a very high price, but I am satisfied that higher grades of leaf can be grown, especially in our more tropical climates. The proposal as it stands is that the bounty shall be given for tobacco leaf for the manufacture of cigars &#34; high grade, of a quality to be prescribed.&#34; I do not know how it will be possible by regulation to prescribe a quality. I take it that the Government will have to act upon the market price. If we can export cigar leaf so as to prevent the Combine from knocking down the price, there will be no difficulty in arriving at the value of the leaf upon which the bounty is to be paid, any more than there would be a difficulty in arriving at the value of ginned cotton, New Zealand flax, or a number of other items in the schedule. But an effort should be made to see that the Government does not &#34; throw too low a main &#34; in giving the bounty. I should like the value to be placed at a high figure, but I do not expect that the Committee would be prepared to go as far as I would. Possibly it will meet the views of honorable senators if I propose to leave out the words &#34;quality to be prescribed,&#34; and insert &#34; market value to be prescribed being not less than is. per&#39; lb.&#34;

                    <para>. - I should like to direct the attention of protectionist senators, who, I am sure, do not wish to injure in any way the prospects of tobacco growing in Australia, to the fact that the duty which has been proposed in favour of Australian-grown tobacco leaf will probably be reduced. We know that the small cigar manufacturers of Australia have raised a great outcry about the proposed protective duty, and I think it is reasonable to anticipate a reduction. We should therefore take this opportunity of making up for it by means of a bounty. I urge that consideration upon honorable senators, because I am quite sure that tobacco growing in Australia has not .yet had a sufficient test for us to know really what we can do in this regard. I am prepared to give reasonable weight to the opinions of experts, but no expert evidence has been quoted to prove that tobacco leaf cannot be grown in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> repeatedly referred to what he called &#34; experts in the making of cigars.&#34; Their opinions may be entitled to every consideration, so far as regards the work of manufacture, but I fail to see what weight should be attached to their views about the production of the raw material. This young country of ours has too short a history for any one to say  that he knows exactly what it can produce. The area is so enormous, the varieties of soil so great, and the climatic conditions so varied, that anything is possible in the way of production in Australia. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> was speaking, he asked me if I could change natural conditions so that cigar leaf could be produced. I do not propose to attempt to change nature by means of a bounty, but we know that in the case of products which require more expensive methods of cultivation, bounties are of great assistance. We do not intend to alter the whole face  of nature by proposing a bounty. ; our object is to assist growers &#34;in taking advantage of natural conditions. The basic principle of bounties or protection is to help any industry that can be reasonably expected to show favorable results. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that his own State has great possibilities in the production of tobacco leaf, a very high quality of which has actually been grown there. On page 616 of Coghlan&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">The Seven Colonies of Australasia,</inline> for 1901-2, it is stated that - </para>

                <para>The quotation of such prices shows the possibilities of tobacco culture in Australia. No man &#34;can afford to take up a cocksure attitude and say that we cannot do this, that, or the other. The statement I have quoted on the authority of that very careful statistician shows what can be done in Western Australia, where very little encouragement has been given to the cultivation of any tropical or semi-tropical product. If we can produce a high-class tobacco, bringing so high a price- </para>

                        <para>- The bounty, of course, is in the nature of an experiment. The whole of these proposals may be said to be experimental. If it is wise to give bounties for articles which we have no evidence have been produced in Australia at ail, we ought to give encouragement -to this industry, for we know that tobacco has been grown in Australia with varying degrees of success. We have as many advantages for the production of tobacco leaf of a good quality in Australia as any other country. I cannot understand the arguments of those who are prepared to give a bounty for the production of inferior leaf and yet are against giving a bounty for cigar leaf. I was quite prepared to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> amendment, but, having failed to secure that, I see no logic in the attitude of those who say that, because they cannot get a bounty for the production of inferior leaf, they will not vote for a bounty for the production  of a superior  article. &#39; We are making altogether too much of the Trust bogy. I know that the Trust have enormous power, but i!t is going too far to say that the whole of the bounty will probably go into their pockets. If there is any danger of the bounty for cigar leaf going to the Trust, there would be a great deal more danger of a bounty for tobacco leaf generally going to them, because they are the sole makers of tobacco in Australia, whereas there is an enormous number of small cigarmakers </para>

I said that in either case I thought the Combine would get the benefit, but that if there were a majority of the Committee prepared to give a bounty, I believed that it would be better to give it on plug tobacco leaf than on cigar leaf. I added that in either case I would vote against the item, no matter which way it was put. That is the position which I still take up. I happen to know a little about the company referred to in the quotation used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie from <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan.</inline> That glowing report from <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> is the report which appeared in the prospectus of the company floated in Western Australia. The company was formed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> M. Speed was one of the directors. They proposed to grow tobacco, of the kind described, at Hamel, a district which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> knows well. After one season, the company went into liquidation. That was the end of the tobacco-growing industry in Western Australia. No tobacco leaf has been grown there since. Of the whole of the tobacco leaf used in making cigars in Australia for the last year - 1905 - of which we have any returns, 251,189 lbs. was foreign or imported leaf, and only 9,680 lbs. was Australian leaf. </para>

It does not necessarily follow that a man needs to be a grower in order to understand the position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> quoted a witness as saying that cigar leaf can be grown in Australia, but he was cautious to stop where he did. What was the next question which was put to the witness. He was asked, &#34; Do you think that is a payable price for cigar leaf&#34;? and his answer was &#34; No.&#34; The price quoted was1s. per lb. The next witness quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith,</inline> of Wangaratta, who is a buyer, and not a grower. He stated that cigar leaf can be grown in Australia. He was asked,. &#34; Would you consider that price satisfactory &#34; ? and he said &#34;Yes.&#39;&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> quoted that answer, but he did not quote the answer of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thompson,</inline> and in that respect I think he showed great diplomacy. The tobacco leaf referred to by both witnesses was tobacco leaf grown on the Edi State Farm. That is the only place where cigar leaf has been grown in Wangaratta. </para>

                        <para>- The climate in the Southern States of America is similar to that which prevails in Queensland and the Northern Territory. With regard to the sample which has been paraded so much before the Committee, the very men  who ought to be able to express an opinion say that a fair price was not given for it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie seems to think that the Combine will not have so much chance of getting this bounty as they will have of getting the other bounty. If he will turn to page 377 of the Tobacco Commission&#39;s report, he will see a table showing the quantity of tobacco leaf which is used in the various factories. The Customs Department are not allowed to make public the names of the various manufacturers, but I am in a position to inform the honorable senator that the quantities of 1,136,471 lbs. and 402,361 lbs. represent the totals of leaf used by two firms in the Combine in the first six months of 1905. The smaller quantities were used by small cigarmakers. The sixty cigarmakers to whom the honorable senator referred, used 300 lbs. each. Furthermore, if he will look through the report of the Tobacco Commission he will find that ever since the formation of the Combine the number  of cigar manufacturers has been rapidly dwindling. We gave the number for each year and showed that it has been rapidly decreasing. If he will look through the list which I have just indicated he will discover that in Victoria in 1905 no less than five cigarmakers closed their establishments. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and in the Senate I supported the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> because I thought that he proposed a better way by which to assist tobacco growing. If we had adopted his proposal there would have been no possibility of money being handed straight to the Combine. In my opinion it is only a question of time when, with a monopoly of the machines indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> the Combine will control the whole of the cigar-making trade. It ls rapidly tending in that direction now. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> said that this bounty is for the grower, not for the manufacturer. What has the grower to do with his leaf? He is obliged to sell it to the manufacturer. There is only one buyer, and when the grower comes along this  buyer  says - &#34; Last year I gave you 10d. per lb. for the leaf.- You are now getting a bounty of 2d. per lb., and this year I will give you 8d. per lb.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I cannot at this moment refer to the particular statement in the report, but I know that an expert witness stated that Sumatra leaf is very bitter and altogether unfit for the body of the cigar. He said that its principal virtue lay in the fact thai it had a very silky texture, and therefore it made an excellent wrapper, giving a nice appearance to the cigar. Very few cigars are made entirely from one kind of leaf. As a matter of fact Sumatra cigar leaf is only used for the outside covering of cigars. In Australia we have produced the cigar leaf which is used in the body of the dear, the bunch and the inside _ wrapper. That, I think, is of great importance, because a very much larger quantity is required for that purpose than is needed for the making of the outside covering. The arguments which have been used against the grant of a bounty  upon the production of cigar leaf were used years ago, when it was contended that we could not produce good wool or good wheat. What are the facts to-day? Owing to experiments having been made in the growing of wool and wheat - certainly at the expense of private individuals, and without very great encouragement from the State - to-day we are producing better wool and better wheat than can be produced in any other part of the world. That result has only been achieved by the prosecution of experiments at the expense of the persons who were interested in the industries. </para>

                        <para>- Even suppose that the Tobacco Combine possesses great power, it will be to the advantage of Australia if we can induce persons to devote their capital and their time to the production of a superior kind of tobacco leaf. The potentialities of the industry are immense. If we can succeed in inducing persons to produce cigar leaf by offering a bounty, it will be a good thing indeed. I do not like to hear persons saying that Australians cannot produce certain things, when, as a matter of fact, they have not had a fair chance. So far, those who have attempted to grow cigar leaf have not received the slightest encouragement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has said that cigars made of Australian&#39; leaf are abominable. But, as a matter of fact, the leaf which has been used in the manufacture of those cigars has not been cigar leaf. A factory in Adelaide purchases a large quantity of ordinary tobacco leaf, for the purpose of making ordinary plug tobacco. I have been informed on the best authority that about 7 per cent. of the leaf is picked out by an expert, and used for the manufacture of cigars. It is not cigar leaf, and, consequently, the cigars made of that leaf are nothing like equal in quality to the imported cigars, which are made from cigar leaf. The object of the bounty is to induce persons not to grow tobacco leaf for the manufacture of plug tobacco, but to devote their attention to the production of a different variety of tobacco leaf, which, as a matter of fact, weighs only one-third of the plug tobacco leaf. We want to induce persons to grow a smaller quantity of tobacco leaf, with a view to obtaining a higher price. I do not think that the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> would be in the best interests of the industry. During the experimental stages a number of persons might be induced to grow cigar tobacco in the hope of earning the bounty. Possibly, for a year or two they might grow a leaf which could be used only for the manufacture of cigars, and for which they might not be able to get more than11d. per lb. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway&#39;s</inline> amendment were carried they would be unable to obtain the bounty on that leaf ; they might then become discouraged, and give up the cultivation of cigar leaf. But if the item is allowed to stand as it is in the schedule, and the Government prescribe the conditions on which the bounty is to be paid, the regulations will have to be submitted to Parliament, and, if necessary, honorable senators will be in a position to object to them. We may assume that in drafting the regulations prescribing the conditions the Government will act on the best advice they can get, and in the interest of the people whom we wish to serve, by granting this bounty. </para>

I wish to see the tobacco manufacturing industry nationalized, because I believe that that is the only way in which we can get it out of the hands of the Combine ; but, in my opinion, the Combine are here to stay for a few years more, and their existence is no reason why we should not endeavour by the assistance proposed to encourage the growers of tobacco leaf to cultivate a superior article. I hope the item will be passed as it stands in the schedule. </para>

                    <para>. - A strong argument in favour of my amendment is that, to some extent it would act as a check on the people whom every one seems to fear, and would prevent them cutting down the price of leaf to the grower. There is not the slightest doubt  that the largest local manufacturers of cigars have done their best to encourage the growth of cigar leaf in Australia. They have hired men to give instruction to farmers, have distributed seed, and have done a great deal of work in this way, for which they are deserving of some credit. If the minimum value of the leaf on which the bounty is to be paid were fixed by Statute it could not be altered from day to day by regulations, and the buyers of the leaf would know that they could not reduce the price below a certain figure, as the moment they did so the grower would lose the bounty and would cease the cultivation of cigar leaf. I omitted to mention that cigars have been made in Queensland from leaf grown in that State at the Texas Station, controlled by the Queensland Government. I  had the pleasure the other day of enabling several gentlemen to smell a Queensland cigar whilst I smoked it myself. Those who had the advantage of testing its aroma described it as an uncommonly good cigar. I may be asked why we do not continue to manufacture such cigars. The reason was explained to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill,</inline> who really manufactured the cigar at the Texas Station. He explained that unless it was possible to obtain considerable quantities of leaf of that quality it would be impossible to establish a brand, and as honorable senators are aware, a great deal of the success obtained in the sale of certain cigars is due to the establishment of a recognised brand. It is because people are not growing sufficient quantities of cigar leaf of good quality in Australia, to establish a_ brand that we have not first-class Australian cigars now on the market. I think that my amendment would promote rather than interfere with the intention of the Bill. . </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that even at this late hour <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> may be induced not to press his amendment, but that if he does press it the &#39;Committee will not agree to it. It is proposed that the bounty shall be given for &#34; Tobacco leaf for the manufacture of cigars, high grade, of .a quality to be prescribed,&#34; and I point out that, while we could fix the minimum market value of the article on which the bounty was to be paid, that might be provided for in the regulations. I think it would be more desirable that the regulations should prescribe the quality, and, if necessary, determine it by the market value of the leaf. In the regulations justice might be done to the other considerations to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> referred in submitting his amendment. There might be reasons for a fluctuation in the value of the article from time to time, and let me remind honorable senators that by leaving the words &#34;of a quality to be prescribed &#34; in the schedule the Committee would not give the Government of the day an unfettered or uncontrolled right to fix the minimum value of the article, or impose any other condition, since the regulations must be tabled in Parliament, and would be subject to the veto of either House. If Parliament is sitting, they must be tabled within a &#39; certain period after they are made, and if Parliament is &#34; not sitting they must be tabled within a certain period after the next assembling of Parliament, and it is open to either House to negative or modify any particular regulation. I am glad to have an opportunity to hear what honorable senators think the method of determining the quality and the minimum price of the leaf should be, but I point out again that any regulations prescribed would be open to the review of honorable senators. For this reason I ask the Committee not to support the amendment, and I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> will see the wisdom of withdrawing it. </para>

                    <para>. - &#34; intend to support the amendment. I assume that the Government propose to offer this bounty to encourage the production of a high-class tobacco leaf, suitable for the manufacture of cigars. The intention is to encourage the growth of leaf of the very best quality, and it is not intended that the bounty should be paid for leaf of an inferior quality. I propose to vote against the item, even though it should be amended, but if it is to be carried, I would prefer that it should be in the form suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway.</inline> I think that those who have any knowledge of the subject recognise that the weak feature in connexion with Australian leaf is not in the cultivation of the leaf, but in the curing of it, and the details of production, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has referred so fully. The honorable senator gave the Committee a very good idea of the peculiar conditions connected with the production of tobacco leaf. We wish the growers of Australian leaf to bring their production up to the highest possible standard. It has been proved beyond doubt that tobacco can be grown in many parts of Australia. In fact, it has been grown to such an extent at times that the supply has been more than equal to the demand, and a great quantity of leaf has been destroyed. It is, therefore, clear that the bounty is not necessary to discover whether we can grow tobacco or not, and it is only necessary to induce our growers to grow leaf of a high quality. The Minister suggests that we should leave it to the Government by regulation to prescribe the conditions under which the bounty is to be given. I object to that. I think that we should fix the minimum price of leaf in respect of which the bounty shall be payable. To do that would enable the grower to know what he would be likely to get for his crop, and the manufacturer to estimate the price that would have to be paid for the article. </para>

                    <para>. - The second-reading debate took place so long ago that I almost forget what occurred. I think that a question was put to me referring to pearl shell, and I pointed out that this item dealt only with fish, as the word is generally understood. Whether pearl shell could be brought under the definition I am not quite sure. </para>

If there are valid reasons why the collection of pearl shell should be supported by a bounty, they will be considered.

                    <para>.- Before we give a bounty for preserved or tinned fish, we should try to obtain a better supply of fresh fish for local use. There is no article of food which should be cheaper or more easily obtainable, but there is no article which at present is dearer than fish. The price of ordinary fish for ordinary people is very high indeed. I think the proposed bounty is entirely premature. If it were intended to encourage the catching of more fish, and the putting of it upon the market in a better way, I should be inclined to support the item. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator must know very little about fish if he takes that view. It is a palpable fact that in every place where fishing is carried on to any extent not only are the local requirements supplied, but a surplus is obtained which is disposed of elsewhere. In various parts of Tasmania fishing is carried on. They catch flounder, trumpeter, and barracouta, for instance. If they catch more than is sufficient foi the local supply, they have a surplus on hand sufficient to enable them to go in for preserving on a certain scale. That is what we want to encourage. </para>

                        <para>- A good deal of it is sent away from Hobart. It is only caught on a certain portion of the coast. It would be futile to think of establishing a fishing industry for the supply of the home market only. Considering the extent of the waters around our coasts, there is no doubt that we can obtain sufficient fish of an excellent kind to support a considerable industry. I think that it is. proper to endeavour to establish an industry for preserving what may be called our surplus fish. </para>

                        <para>- There would be a surplus if the industry were conducted on a considerable scale. If there is no proper industry established for preserving, people will not be induced to embark upon fishing extensively. Take the case of Canada, where a large number of people are engaged in the fishing industry. If they simply fished to supply their own home market, the amount of money and the number of men employed in the industry would be lessened in the ratio of Canada&#39;s own demand to the actual provision that Canada makes for herself and sending fish abroad. </para>

We hope to uncover possibilities that were not thought of before. If we do establish in the Commonwealth an industry for the preservation of fish, either for home consumption or for export abroad, there will be a very much stronger inducement for our own people to go into the fishing industry. They will have, not only the market in our own country to supply, but also the opportunity of turning over their surplus fish to the canning factories. </para>

                    <para>. - I had ho particular hope that this item, even if  passed,  would do anything to stimulate the preserving of fish, but what little hope I might have entertained has been entirely dissipated by the Minister&#39;s remarks. Whilst he does not dispute that at present the home market is not sufficiently supplied, he says that, if the bounty  is offered, and the fish preserving industry started, men will catch more fish, and thai the surplus over and above the supply required for the fresh fish market will be utilized by the factories. Surely the Minister knows that no factory can afford -to pay for fish for preserving purposes, the price which that fish will fetch in the fresh fish market? </para>

                        <para>- They can, at certain times. I know that large tracts of country in England are manured by no other process. If the fishermen to-day are not prepared to catch the quantity which they can sell locally at higher prices, they are not likely to be stimulated to catch a larger quantity to sell at lower prices. If it is correct that no factory can afford to pay as much for fish for tinning purposes as it will fetch in the fresh fish market, it is idle to talk about stimulating the preserved fish industry until we know that we have a surplus available. I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> that the real&#34; trouble at present is that the fresh fish supply of Sydney and Melbourne is entirely inadequate. The big establishments may have a supply, but the ordinary suburban householder in both cities can only get a most intermittent supply of inferior quality at exorbitant prices. </para>

                        <para>- While it may not come within the province of the Federal authority to look into that question, it is within our province to consider whether or not we have a right to support this proposal until we know exactly where the seat of trouble is, and until some effort has been made to remedy it. I know, of no matter to which the municipal or State authorities  could better devote their attention than that of the position presented by both the fish and fruit trades. There is something wrong in the case of both those trades. The producers are producing an insufficient supply, and ought, therefore, to be getting high prices, and yet they are not ; while, on the other hand, the consumers are unable to satisfy their own requirements at anything like a reasonable price. The difficulty is in that direction, and the proper remedy can only be determined upon by a thorough examination of the details of the trade. I have no knowledge which enables &#39;me to say where the trouble is, but I know that this bounty is not going to put it right. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire some information from the Minister before I give a vote on this item. Does the term &#34;fish&#34; include beche-de-mer? That is a very important fishing industry along the Great Barrier Reef, on the eastern coast of Australia. The trade has been developed very considerably lately. The beche-de-mer, or sea slug, as it is called, is secured, split open, and dried in the sun. A large quantity goes to China even now, and I see that a good deal of it is consumed in Australia. I noticed quite recently that it is finding its way to Melbourne, and. is used in the form of soups, and what l may call &#34; fish entrees.&#34; A paragraph in the Cairns <inline font-style="italic">Daily Argus</inline> states that - </para>

                    <para>Two more beche-de-mer vessels have arrived in the river with good cargoes of slugs. One boat&#39;s cargo is estimated tn be worth about ^170, and the other at about ^450. </para>

                <para class="block">These facts show that the industry is of some importance. Is beche-de-mer to be included in the fish on which bounty is to be paid when preserved as prescribed ? It . is most important that we should establish along our Great Barrier Reef, if possible, a good fishing industry, because the constant running of cutters along the reef will form a sort of outpost for defence purposes, and as we do not know much about the reef, which is exceedingly dangerous and is always altering, all the information- that can be obtained about it should certainly be obtained. The beche-de-mer boats are mostly owned and controlled by white men, who largely employ coloured labour. If they are allowed to compete for the bounty, they, will employ white men, which is the very thing that honorable senators desire to bring about. Another animal, which I should hesitate to call a fish if it were not for the dictionary, is the dugong, which is caught along the Queensland coast. A book which I looked up describes it as one of the dolphin family, which I take to be fishes. The dugong is used for the production of oil, and in another form is produced as a kind of bacon. Will dugong and beche-de-mer be included under the heading of preserved fish? </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry that the Minister has not seen his way to give some encouragement to the industry. We have secured good results from our attempts to convert into white industries many industries which, in the past, have been almost wholly in the hands of coloured labour. The sugar industry is a proof of that. If we followed the same course in the case of the pearl-shelling industry, excellent results might be expected. I have with me some quotations which will strengthen the case for doing something in this direction. I should like the Minister to agree to make provision for a special message on the subject. I recognise that we are somewhat hampered at the present stage in doing all that we should like to do, but I have every right to expect the Government, &#39;who have all along been identified with the policy of taking industries out of the hands of the Asiatics, and putting them into the hands of white men, to give me some assistance in the encouragement of the pearl-shelling industry. No assistance has ever been extended to it, although it is an important one to Australia. It has been gradually going down for the last few years. The suggestions which I am about to offer will, I think, prove a solution of. the difficulty, and prevent the industry from totally disappearing. There is little doubt from the way in which the pearl shell is being dragged from our coasts that, unless some means is taken to encourage .the cultivation of pearl shell, our coast line will very soon be denuded of it to such an extent- that the industry will- be completely wiped out. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that they have met with much success either in German New Guinea, or in the Aroo Islands. The Clarke Combine, who went to those coasts, have not met with a great deal of success. The latest information I have is that their fleets are now returning to the Australian waters where they previously did better. In the past it has been a very valuable industry. It would be a great pity indeed if we took no step to encourage the cultivation of pearl shell, and allowed the industry t6.be completely destroyed by the present method of fishing. It is well known that the Asiatics have depleted all the shallow waters on the coasts of Queensland and Western Australia. Deep fishing is almost the general rule. The shallow waters have become depleted by reason of the fact that no time has been allowed for the cultivation of pearl shell. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Much harm has been done in the past by allowing constant deep fishing. It is, I think, the  opinion of most men who are acquainted with the industry that the deep waters ought to be kept as a sort of breeding ground for the shallow waters, which can always be fished with white labour. In the deep waters the prosecution of the industry is attended with some risk. I would regret to see white men obliged to fish in deep water. In shallow water it is, comparatively speaking, an easy kind of industry for a white man to follow. It is only in very deep water, where there is an enormous weight over the diver&#39;s head, that the danger of paralysis is so great. In shallow water that danger scarcely exists. For that reason I would like to see some step taken to protect the industry and to supplant black with white labour. If we were to adopt that policy, we should establish on those portions of our coast which now carry a very small population a race of white fishermen. I hold that the shallow fishing &#39;of pearl shell could be carried on by white men along our coast just as easily as any other kind of fishing is carried on in Europe and the United Kingdom. I am convinced that much good would be &#39;done <inline font-style="italic">b\</inline> substituting pearl shell for some item in the schedule. Two years ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Saville</inline> Kent reported on this question to the. Government of Queensland.

                    <para>As will be recognised by the perusal of the  above  recorded data, the assemblage together of a number of individuals is absolutely essential for the abundant propagation of the species. lt is through the full recognition of this fact and by assistance given towards the restoration of corresponding conditions on an adequate -scale, and at suitable locations, that I would -propose to bring about the resuscitation of the much depleted Torres Straits  pearlshell  fisheries. What i have to suggest &#39;is, in fact, the establishment of a certain number of Government  pearlshell-breeding  .reserves, on which shall be laid down and maintained for breeding purposes only a suitable number of mature &#34;healthy shells. These shells, to the number, say, of about one thousand to each breeding  depot,  should be enclosed in cheaply-constructed wood and wire netting frames, wherein they will be protected from their natural marine enemies, and also be effectively safeguarded from human interference. A decision as to the &#34;best locations for the, establishment of these proposed Government breeding reserves can scarcely be arrived at without some further information being at my disposal concerning the nature of the ground, the predominance of the currents, and other details that would, I consider, be best arrived at in consultation with leading representatives of the  pearlshelling  industry. </para>

                    <para>Within a period of three or four years from the establishment of the proposed breeding reserves, I consider that the adjacent waters within many miles from these breeding centres should be restocked with young shell to such an extent as to permit of profitable fishing. </para>

                <para class="block">From the opinion of this great expert it will be gathered that a return will be obtained from this industry much more quickly than will be derived from any industry in respect of which a bounty is proposed. He suggests that the best breeding grounds are the depleted shallow grounds, in which may be found the natural food for the molluscs, and which are within easy access. I hope that honorable senators will recognise the feasibility of his proposal. He goes on to say - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>I should, at the same time, recommend that these proposed breeding reserves should be made a permanent institution, under which circumstances young brood will be continually supplied to replace the adult shell withdrawn, and there should be no further recurrence of the deleterious depletion of the beds that has brought about the present unprofitable condition of the Torres Strait fisheries. </para>
                    <para>As a practical illustration of the efficiency of the foregoing suggested method for restocking the surrounding waters with young shell, I mav mention that in that island in the South Pacific to which the  greater  portion of the Torres Strait shell was transported and laid down in frames as above described, a period of six months sufficed for the propagation of the molluscs to such an extent that many of the parent shells were found with as many as from ten to  twenty  or thirty or more young attached to their surfaces. At the same time, it was scarcely possible to raise a coral mass from the adjacent reefs without finding young Torres Strait shell growing on them. </para>

                    <para>Other countries are turning their attention to the scientific investigations of the pearl-shell molluscs, with a view of improving their  own  pearling industries, and the time must come, sooner or later, when artificial cultivation must give place to the present methods of obtaining shell. Desultory experiments have been made in different parts of the world without much conspicuous success. If, however, proper methods are adopted, and these will eventually be proved, and suitable localities chosen, there is no reason why the pearl shell could not be cultivated in immense numbers, the same as the edible oyster, in many parts of the world, which gives employment  to  thousands of persons, and a permanent flourishing industry maintained. </para>

                <para class="block">The opinions of the experts I have quoted are very encouraging. They go to show that the depleted shallow beds, which are washed by waters in which there is ample food for the molluscs, are adapted to the successful propagation of the pearl shell. Having regard to the encouragement which is recommended by both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kent</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale,</inline> I think I am justified in suggesting to the Minister that this subject should receive more consideration than has evidently been given to it. On the present occasion, the Government should not lose sight of the policy which has been so successful in connexion with the sugar industry. Repeatedly we have been reminded that the northern coasts of Australia are greatly in need of white population. I do not know of any persons who would be capable of rendering greater service to the country than would a race of fishermen. The climatic conditions against which we have to fight on the land do not prevail to any great extent on the water. Storms are much less frequent on our northern coast than in any other part of Australia. Therefore, the conditions of a fisherman&#39;s life on our northern coast would be less dangerous than, and not so arduous as, that of the fishermen who operate on the coasts of England, Ireland, and Scotland. We have every reason to anticipate a successful result if some encouragement is given to bring about the transfer of the pearl-shell industry from coloured to white men.  1  do not propose a radical alteration straight away. I do not suggest that at a given date we should tell the Asiatic that he must go. I would like the existing conditions to continue until it is made sure that the bounty system will result in the establishment of the pearl-shell industry in the hands of white men. </para>

It would be of no use for anyone to move in that direction at the present time. All that I can reasonably ask the Minister, to do is to give this question! more consideration, and to see if a special message cannot be brought down on behalf of this industry. I regret exceedingly that it has received so very little attention from . the Government. The question is worthy of very serious consideration, in view of the enormous extent of our coastline which is unoccupied. It is also worthy of consideration whether we should not do something to prevent the complete extinction of the pearl-fishing industry, which is still a very important industry,, but one which is fast disappearing, owing to the depletion of the deep waters. </para>

I am afraid the time is not far distant when we shall have&#39; no pearl shell accessible to the fishers on our coast. Experts have advised that in three or four years from the time the spat is laid down the fish can be caught. It would, therefore, be some time before we should need to spend any money in the form of a bounty on pearl fishing, and ample time would, therefore, be given to the Government for full inquiry into the question. If the Minister, is not prepared to give an answer straight away, I hope he will at least admit the advisability of considering the matter, with a view .to future action. </para>

                    <para>.   The total amount to be appropriated for the payment of this bounty is ,&#163;50,000. I believe in the principle of bounties, and I should gladly support this item if I thought that it would have any effect whatever in providing the people of Australia with an increased supply of fish. As most honorable senators must be aware, fresh fish is a luxury in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Hobart. This is a proposal to give a bounty for an article which at present is beyond the means of the ordinary citizens of the Commonwealth. You cannot get a decent fish in Melbourne at under 10d. or is. per lb., and the bulk of the people are unable to buy any but the coarsest kinds of fish. The Government propose a bounty amounting to ^50,000 for preserved fish, when, so far as I know, we have not the fish in Australian waters to preserve. At present, I understand that there are fish rings in the large centres, and that in Melbourne large quantities of fish are destroyed to prevent a reduction in the prices. We cannot hope to compete in preserving fish with countries where fish are caught in hundreds of tons. I see by this morning&#39;s newspapers that there has been an immense haul of fish in the North Sea, and we cannot compete with countries where fish can be obtained in such quantities. I have done a little fishing in Queensland, New South Wales, and Tasmanian waters. I have talked with men who have made their living at fishing for many years, and they have told me that we have no fish in great quantities in these waters. We have ground fish, but we have a coral bottom in nearly all our waters. The Government have made provision for a trawler, and I may say that trawling, has already been tried in Australian waters by private enterprise and by the Government of New South Wales. I have said that if I thought that we had fish in our waters in sufficient quantities, and that the granting of this bounty would be the means of bringing fish within the reach of the masses of the community, I would support the proposal. </para>

                        <para>- If any attempt were made to trawl for fish along the Barrier Reef the nets would be torn to pieces on the coral. A man might be fishing there in twenty fathoms, and when the boat he was on swung round on her anchor he would be fishing in thirty fathoms. It is quite impossible to use a trawler in those waters. With the exception of mullet, which for the most part are caught by Chinamen in Queensland, most of our fish, are caught with hand lines, as are the best fish found in Tasmanian  waters. There is a species of trumpeter caught in small quantities in Tasmanian waters by netting, but they are found amongst kelp, and a trawler could not be used for the purpose as the net would be filled with some hundreds of tons of kelp inside of five minutes. Our best fish are for the most part caught by hand lines, and they fetch on the market up to  is.  per lb. We could not hope to tin fish at that price. I have seen fish sold in Hobart at 10s. per dozen, and the fish would not weigh more than 1 lb. each. </para>

                        <para>- From Swansea all round the east coast you cannot get flounders tinder 5s. a dozen. There may Le a ring in Hobart keeping up the price of fish, but there is a fish market there controlled bv the corporation, whilst I have seen fish sold in Launceston only off a cart close to the bridge. For the life of  me I cannot see how we can expect any practical result from this proposal to offer ^50,000 in bounties for preserved fish on the, information we have before us. A large sum of money is being spent on a trawler, and if the operations of the trawler prove that we have school fish, and can expect to be able to tin them- successfully, I might be prepared to support such a proposal. I have taken a special interest in the item  since the Bill was first introduced, and I have asked people engaged in the fishing business about it. From the&#39; information I have received, I have come to the conclusion that in existing circumstances it is useless for us to hope to be able to preserve fish in competition with countries like North America and Great Britain, where fish suitable for tinning are caught in large quantities. We know that hundreds of thousands of tons of salmon are caught every year in British Columbia. , We have good fish in Australian waters, but we have a coral bottom which makes trawling impossible. We have some school fish like mullet and barracouta which are caught in large numbers in Tasmanian waters. But they are not fish that people take to. </para>

                        <para>- That experiment was tried by Jones and Company, in Hobart, where fish can be purchased at 2s. 6d. a box, weighing from 5 lbs. to 7 lbs. each. The article was placed upon the market in Sydney and Melbourne, but the enterprise was not a success. Jones and  Company  are large exporters of jams and have made a .success of that business. They are really intelligent people, and they would have made a success of fish tinning if there had been a possibility of doing so. If they could not succeed I do not think that others would be likely to do so. The public would not eat the fish which was tinned, even in Tasmania. Unfortunately, ,a disease called the &#34; worm disease &#39; &#39; attacks these fish, and I have seen as many as thirty out of 100 thrown away as unfit for human consumption. If the tinning industry were established, we should have to be very careful that fish unfit for human consumption was not placed upon the market. The fact is that we have hot suitable supplies here such as they have in the northern hemisphere. Take the Dogger Bank. Fishermen have been exploiting the waters there for 800 or 1,000 years - not one or two fishermen, but hundreds and thousands of them: It is true that we have large quantities of fish in our waters, but we have not suitable shoal fish. I would support this item as strongly as any senator if I believed that by means of a bounty we could establish, a successful industry. But, at present, I have heard no reasons to convince me that it is a wise thing to do. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has mentioned the subject of pearl shell. In Queensland large numbers of people went into the pearling industry some years ago. But, as in the case of our forests, they soon depleted the supply. Chinese, Japanese, and Queensland aboriginals were employed. If they got a quantity of small shell, instead of putting it back into the water, they kept it, and very soon made the pearling grounds barden. They rushed the thing, in fact, to get all they could out of it. If we did give a bounty on pearl shell it would take a few years before it became profitable to work the beds again. </para>

                        <para>- But by the time the spat was got more time would be taken. Probably it would take six years. But then it would be difficult to prevent people from depleting the ground again, unless we had revenue cutters &#39; to look after it. Unless the Commonwealth Government had some system of patrolling the waters, we should soon have men tearing up the bottom for shell. Another thing which we should try to do is to keep the Japanese from fishing in our waters. Whether attempts in this direction would raise an international question I do not know. I very much doubt whether we should be able to do it. The Japanese are willing to work for wages which we could not expect white men to accept. Some years ago a man named Clarke made a large fortune from pearl shelling in Torres Straits. </para>

That would mean that those who went into the industry and employed white  men would have to bear a large addition to the first cost. They would have to compete with the Japanese fishing in the waters alongside them, and whom we should probably be unable to prohibit. </para>

                        <para>- The Japanese will do the same, so that we should still have the wages difficulty to contend with. I&#39; think it will be a costly experiment to give a bounty for pearl shell, but if we could do it successfully I should support an effort in that direction. But as to the tinning of fish, I do not think that sufficient reasons have been given for the inclusion of the item. Even now, if the Minister can show me where the fish is to be caught, and that the bounty will not increase their price to the consumer - who already pays too much - I do not say that I shall not alter my mind. But at present I cannot see my way to vote for the item. Unless the Minister can show that a successful industry is likely to be established it will be useless to spend  ^50,000.  I am prepared at any time to support a proposal for a bounty for any industry if I believe it can be fostered and flourish. But at present I cannot see my way to vote for this item. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened with interest to the remarks and the quotations of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, but, as  I said at the outset of his remarks, I had just previously, in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> stated if we intended to include pearl shell in this item, it would be necessary to add after the word &#34; fish &#34; the words &#34; and including pearl shell.&#34; I do not think that pearl shell would be construed to be included in the item at present, nor was that intended by the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de.</inline> Largie has submitted that it is desirable to encourage the pearl-shelling industry, and to increase the productiveness of the seas round the Commonwealth in this regard ; and he proposes that we shall endeavour to promote the carrying on of the industry by white labour. .With every one of those objects I&#39; am in hearty accord. I think it is desirable, if the industry is capable of expansion in the Commonwealth - and from the quotations given ( by the honorable senator it would, appear that it is so capable - to encourage it. It is desirable, also, that we should induce our own white people to engage in the in-&#39; dustry. Whether that means the displacement of the coloured labour already employed or not, it will, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie pointed out, give continuous employment to a large number of people around our own coasts, particularly in the undefended north. It will have the further effect of giving them employment which, under tropical conditions, will be more congenial&#39; than work upon land. The question, however, that comes before me and would confront the Government is as to what means should be adopted to give effect to such an object. The circumstances surrounding the industry are, in many respects, totally dissimilar to those .of any other, in the Commonwealth. They may be in some ways analogous to the circumstances of the sugar industry, but in many other respects they are totally dissimilar. It is necessary to go into all those circumstances, some of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> has touched upon, before it would be practicable to bring down any definite proposals for the extension of the industry and for inducing our own people to go into it. I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie that the objects which he has put forward as worthy to be striven after have my own^hearty accord and support, and the Government, so far as I know, are fully seized with the importance of doing something if practicable. . But it was not thought practicable, with the information at their disposal, to include in this Bill anything in that behalf. So far as I am concerned, the matter will be pressed continuously upon the Government, who will be glad to have any information which will serve to elucidate the problems of what must be regarded asa somewhat difficult and complex question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> said that if he could be satisfied that fish were to be obtained in the waters of the Commonwealth, and also that the granting of the bounty would not mean ah increase in the price to the ordinary consumer, he might alter his mind and support the item. I should like him te* view this proposal in the same light as he agreed with me in viewing the last. I pointed out then that if the tobacco were not grown in the Commonwealth no financial responsibility would fall upon the Government. If the fish are not to be caught in Australian waters in sufficient quantities to warrant the establishment of a preserving industry, then our proposal to give &#163;10,000 per annum bounty for five years will bring with it no financial responsibility. Before dealing in more detail with the views urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> I should like to point out the actual facts of the position. Honorable senators have urged that the demand for fresh fish in Australia as not supplied now, and that they would like to have some assurance that it can be supplied before we give any bounty for fish to be preserved. It is also stated that fresh fish, when supplied, is supplied at a cost that makes it practically a luxury. But the fact is that the demand for fish in Australia is fluctuating and capricious, as honorable senators will be told by fishermen, distributers, and others associated with the industry. </para>

                        <para>- I am content to regard as the cause what the honorable senator accepts as the effect. I have been assured that the demand for fish in Australia is uncertain, uneven, and capricious. The Australian eats more meat per head than the inhabitant of any other country in the world. I have been repeatedly assured by people engaged in the fish industry that it was not worth while to send fish to certain centres, because the demand was so -uncertain and unreliable, while the demand for meat was continuous. </para>

                        <para>- I am stating, first, the factors which lead to the present position. We are a meat-eating community in the main, and the demand for fish is not constant, nor is it so great as among other communities. The fisherman, when he brings a certain kind of fish to market, finds that there is very little demand for it, and that the price he gets for it is very low. Further, the fisherman is not the fish distributor. He complains very bitterly, in more centres than one in Australia, that the price he gets for his fish bears a very small proportion to the price which the public pay the retailer for it. If the fisherman were assured that, apart altogether from fresh fish for immediate consumption, there was a demand for his product in consequence of the establishment of industries for preserving it for consumption here or abroad, that would be one factor which, to a certain extent, would relieve him from the difficult position in which he now finds himself, of being compelled either to take whatever price he is offered for his fish or destroy it. One honorable senator stated that in Victoria fish had been returned to the sea, or destroyed, rather than sold to the middleman, because the price offered was so small. The establishment of the fish preserving industry will create an extra demand. </para>

                        <para>- That only happens in Hobart. It could not be done in many other centres. Hotelkeepers and others in Hobart who have to supply a sudden demand can get fresh fish of almost any kind you like by sending down to the dock and having it taken out of their boxes. I know a good deal about what is being done in regard to fish in Tasmania, in the north and south, in the east, and in the north-west and west. The honorable senator referred to flounders. I can assure him that scares of times I have been served with two flounders - and all the accessories - for a shilling in Launceston. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know. I have been astonished at the prices quoted by some honorable senators. If the fisherman knows that he will not be dependent merely upon the demand of the middleman who supplies fresh fish to the- public, but that he will have a permanent demand elsewhere, he is much more likely to go into the fishing consistently and&#34; continuously than he is at present. Present conditions are very discouraging to him, and if he gets a fresh outlet for his fish, we have every reason to believe that it will be greatly to his advantage. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers&#39;</inline> views are correct, there will be ro financial responsibility under this item. If mine are correct-, we shall stimulate the fishing industry itself, and encourage people to give their attention to it. Probably no industry in which the inhabitants of the Commonwealth can engage is calculated to bring more profit directly or. indirectly to the Commonwealth. We must remember, first, that we are an island continent, and present to our enemies a sea-border only. It will be our responsibility at all times to maintain ourselves in a state of effective defence against aggression, and if we can only induce our people to enter into the fishing industry in proportion to their numbers to something like the extent obtaining in Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, and other countries, we shall have, as is pointed out in the report circulated amongst, honorable senators, a reserve of - </para>

                <para class="block">This report shows the number of persons engaged in the fishing industry in the United Kingdom to be  106,000,  France  147,000,  Italy  100,000,  Norway  120,000,  Russia  158,000,  United States of America.  210,000,  Canada  73,000,  and Japan  2,508,000.  The number of persons engaged in the fishing industry has been an important factor in the defence of every country. Great Britain, more than any other nation, was engaged in this industry for centuries, and was to a large extent enabled to draw from her water-working population the reserves from which she built up her magnificent naval strength. Japan, no doubt, found it a great advantage in her recent naval war with&#39; Russia to have  2,508,000  of tier population engaged in the fishing industry. Honorable senators will remember that when the Russian Baltic Fleet went round the world to engage the Navy of Japan, it was stated- in the newspapers that many of the men on board had been drawn from inland, and had practically never seen blue water until they went on to the vessels, and so were absolutely&#39; worse than useless. Japan, on the .other hand, was able to draw successfully on. her seafaring population for her naval strength. We in Australia are doing all in our power to encourage our people to engage in blue water occupations, because if we can get a fair proportion of them so engaged, we may rely upon  it  that they will have broken the back of the training which will be necessary to fit them to navally defend bur shores against aggression. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> has thrown some doubt upon the capacity of Commonwealth waters to supply the fish-. From a report on the Bounties  Bin,  which was published, last year, and from which I had the pleasure of reading passages in connexion with the proposal for a trawler, I propose to read a few extracts with regard to the position in each State. In the first place, I shall deal with Queensland,- because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> has referred to that State and the scarcity of shoal fish, in its waters. From <inline font-style="italic">Australia To-day,</inline> a publication which is brought out by the Commercial Travellers* Association, I &#39;take this extract from a report on the Barrier Reef, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> Saville Kent, who was quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie as the greatest fishing authority in the Commonwealth - </para>

                    <para>Queensland possesses a fish fauna remarkable both for the abundance of its species and for the structural variety of its constituents.- Alt told, the number of combined marine and fresh water species authoritatively recorded UP to date falls but little short of 900. In other words, it embraces two-thirds of the entire marine and fresh water fauna of the Australian Continent. Out of the foregoing total number, over 300 species may be classified as of more or less value for human food. They present almost unlimited possibilities of profitable employment. The waters- abound with shoals of fish akin to  tbc  European mackerel, herring, anchovy, and pilchard, which up to the present date have been literally allowed to run to waste. - </para>

                    <para>Of the presence of the Maray - <inline font-style="italic">clupea sagax</inline> - say the Royal Commission in their report, in numbers close to these shores, we have indisputable evidence. At many of the coastal fisheries visited by us we were enabled to establish the fact, on the authority of intelligent and reliable witnesses, that the herring does frequent our waters at certain seasons of the year. During September and October of this year pilchards made their appearance in countless numbers, both along the coast and in many of the estuaries, and from inquiries instituted at the time we are enabled to say that, had the Colony been in possession of establishments for treating and preserving these fish, millions of them could have been netted and converted into a marketable commodity. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> W. Benson, Inspector of Fisheries, stationed at Lake Ilawarra, has informed us that large shoals of pilchards were for several weeks seen off the entrance to that lake and off Shell Harbor. At Manly these fish swarmed in countless numbers, and at Middle Harbor and other parts of Port Jackson nearly as far as Chowder Bay the water was alive with the immense shoals. Large schools of the herring tribe were also observed at other fishing centres. The amazing abundance of these fish makes it indeed regrettable that from the mere&#39; lack of the necessary appliances for canning, salting, and otherwise treating them, tons upon tons were permitted to leave our shores. </para>

                    <para>But very little is known about the herring in New South Wales waters. One of the first to assert its presence at all was the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Macleay, F.L.S., who always exhibited an intense interest in the fisheries, both from scientific and economic stand-points. He went so far as to affirm that there is no sea on the globe favoured with a more rich or varied supply of fishes of the herring tribe than that which washes our shores. He names two principal species - the Maray,clupeasagax,asbeingalmost identical with the English pilchard, and * the Southern herring,clupeasundicia- which he claims to be, for excellence and delicacy of flavour unsurpassable, being superior to the common herring of Scotland, and which if preserved in oil after the manner of sardines would eclipse even those delicacies. </para>

                <para class="block">The report goes on to deal with the Tasmanian fisheries and the value of the industry in other parts of the world. I think it will be recognised that there is no reason to doubt the capacity of our waters if they are properly investigated and explored to furnish not only all the fish which the Commonwealth may require, but a good deal which may go profitably into markets abroad. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> is right in his opinion that the fish will not be found, he is committing himself to practically no expenditure. If, on the other hand, we are right in asserting that these waters can be profitably worked for fish and that the industry can be established with advantage, then not only he, but we, will have the satisfaction of giving further employment to our own people, and in a direction which indirectly will be of great value and benefit to us in connexion with any naval defence policy which hereafter we may have to enter upon. </para>

It</inline> is very peculiar indeed that all our fishermen - and we have some good practical men-have not been able to discover the fish <inline font-style="italic">referred to,</inline> and put them on the market. I am not opposing the proposal because it .is submitted  by  :he .Government. The Minister knows that the Government of New South Wales has spent many thousands of pounds in promoting the fishing industry. What has been the result of the&#39; expenditure ? .Practically nothing. I am surprised at the Minister even reading the report and asking us to believe it. I cannot comprehend why lie took that step, especially as the Government of New South Wales has spent far more money than it is proposed to spend under this Bill. I believe that if the proposed bounty of ,&#163;50,000 is spent we shall have practically nothing to show for the money. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-style="italic">t do</inline> not say that it will not be spent. An experiment has already been tried, and a bounty of one halfpenny per lb. might make a difference of one penny, per tin. Some persons might begin to tin barracouta, and if they obtained the bounty it might leave them, with a. margin of profit. The present scanners have sent thousands pf tins of barracouta to Melbourne and Sydney, but they have not been able to make a profit, and therefore have had -to drop the business. If the grant of a bounty were authorized, a syndicate, or a company might bc formed, but that would not benefit the fishermen, because they would not receive one penny per dozen more for their fish than they are now getting. It is the most plentiful fish to be found on our coast, but there is a great doubt as to whether a large quantity of it is fit for human food. I do not want that kind of fish to be tinned. If a bounty fs to Le granted I want it to  be  given in a way which would benefit the men who are engaged in catching the fish. The Minister must be aware that the preservation or tinning of the fish would not be done by the fishermen. That work, if done under the offer of the bounty, would be done by a syndicate, and it would bring no advantage to the people df Australia or to the fishermen. </para>

                        <para>- How much more would the syndicate be likely to give to the fishermen? At the present time the scanners get the fish as cheaply as possible&#39;. They are&#34; offered in the market, and the price they bring is generally 2s. 6d. per dozen. Although the fish has been tinned and smoked, for instance, in Tasmania, still that has not led to an increase in the price. What I am afraid of is (hat this bounty, if authorized, would be wasted. The Minister, as well as the representatives of New South Wales, must know that the Fisheries Commission of that State has not been able lo achieve any good results with the parliamentary votes which have been placed at its disposal, and which represent far more than is intended to be spent under this Bill. For all these reasons I shall oppose the item. </para>

                    <para>- - In view of the fact that it is proposed to spend a large sum upon the construction and operation&#39; of a trawler, will it not bc better to wak until by means of the trawler we ascertain whether fish abound on our coast before wc pledge ourselves to give a large bounty upon the preservation of fish ? No harm- will be done by deferring the consideration of the item until we receive a report upon the results 0/ the trawling investigation. It is very doubtful whether we have edible fish in great quantities in our waters. We know that shoals of fish enter our large harbors at certain times, and at other times there are none of them to be seen. It would no doubt, be a very good thing if we had a canning industry thai could dispose of large quantities of fish when they were to be had, but I do not know: that there is any need for a bounty for the industry. If it would be likely to pay, I am certain that there is sufficient enterprise amongst our people to induce some of them to take up the work without Government assistance. There are some -varieties of the kingfish which were to be caught in Tasmanian waters fifteen years ago, and they have never been seen there since. </para>

                    <para>.- This Bill has been so long before the Senate, and I am so heartily tired of opposing votes of money that I believe will be thrown away, that I have remained silent during the last few days when the Bill has been before the Committee. But it appears to me that this item is especially one in connexion with which the Government are putting the cart before the horse. I agree entirely with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Macfarlane</inline> has said. I propose to quote a couple of paragraphs from the report, not of the New South&#39; Wales Fisheries Commission, but of the Australian Fisheries Conference, that met in Melbourne two or three weeks ago. I had the privilege of talking to the Tasmanian Fisheries Commissioner on the. subject of this bounty. I told him that it was suggested that&#39; a bounty should be offered for the canning of fish, and I asked him what he thought of it. He told me that he did not think we had any fish worth canning, or that would pay to can in comparison with salmon. I asked him what he thought about schnapper, and he said he did not think schnapper good enough for the purpose. I do not agree with that, because I think that  schnapper should be good enough if they could be had in sufficient quantities for canning. </para>

                <para class="block">It would appear from this, and it must be within our own knowledge, that our fisheries have not been developed. We are intensely ignorant of what our waters contain. We know little or nothing of the habits of our fish, the quantities in which they can be obtained, and their market value. The skilled men attending the Conference suggest that inquiries should be made upon these subjects, and as men of common sense we should not determine what bounty, if any, should be paid for the canning of fish until after we have received a report of the investigation which the Fisheries Conference think should be made. I am told by my landlady that for some whiting she has to pay  10d.  a-piece. The cost of some of our fish is simply enormous, and yet we are being asked to give a bounty for the canning of fish which we cannot get fresh in sufficient quantities, and when we know that we have no chance of underselling the canned fish preserved in other countries. I think that this money will be absolutely thrown away, and the Government should withdraw the item. </para>

                    (New South Wales) &#91;3.53&#93;- - It is strange that this proposal should be made by a Ministry .whose general interests are chiefly identified with Victoria, whilst in the matter of the destruction  of fish that State is the greatest sinner in the Commonwealth. You may go as often as you like between here and Sydney, and at the refreshment rooms at Albury, on the bank of the River Murray, and you will never be able to get a bit of Murray cod or Murray perch, and why ? Because the mineral works on the banks of various Victorian streams that flow into the Murray poison the waters and destroy the fish. That is a positive fact, known to every one who has been in that part of the world, and without going there people can obtain the information by reading what appears in the press. Whilst Victoria &#39; deliberately destroys one of the grandest fish to be found in the southern hemisphere, a Ministry with Victorian1 sympathies comes here with a proposal to grant a bounty on the canning of the very fish that Victoria is busily  destroying- It passes one&#39;s comprehension, except that the whole process of our friend the enemy is  to slop down like a pailful of water one proposal after another without the slightest connexion, between&#39; them. If these bounty proposals of the  Government were discharged by a mountain howitzer battery, they could not come with more uncertainty or more deadly effect. I speak seriously when I say &#34; deadly effect,&#34; because their effect is most demoralizing on the Chamber. There is one strong reason why we should not accept this proposal. By doing away with the goat bounty there will be a reduction in the number of goats, and there is not likely to be the same demand for old tins. We all know that goats browse on tins, and as now there is to be no bounty on goats we shall not need any fish tins. This proposal is certainly one which should be allowed to stand over that we might have a little time to think about it. It is notorious that fresh fish in Australia is at very high prices. If you go to the parliamentary refreshment room in New South Wales you cannot get a little bit of fish on a small plate under1s. Fresh fish is so outrageous a delicacy and so extreme a luxury in Sydney that the New South Wales Government are making phenomenal efforts to breed fish. They are bringing flounders from Tasmania and New Zealand, and, in fact, are floundering about in all directions in the hope of getting a few fish for ordinary consumption. It is ridiculous to talk of a canning industry when the fish supply of Sydney is drawn from as far as the Clarence River. 360 miles north. Fish are caught forty miles up that river and carried to Sydney packed in ice. The only reason why the Committee might consent to pass the item is that no one is ever likely to apply for a bounty under it, as no one is ever likely to get hold of enough fish to make it worth while to start a cannery. We know that the canneries established in America are immense establishments, dealing with thousands of tons of fish . Any one who is familiar with the coast line of Australia must know that there is no prospect of getting together at any part of it a sufficient supply of fish to make a canning industry a success. We can never expect to get out of the retail stage in the fish industry until some successful effort is made to establish a fish supply.

                        <para>- Certainly. I do not think it necessary to make any comments upon the documents which I have read. There is one other matter which I think I shall be justified in mentioning. I hope that I shall have an answer from <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> honorable and learned friend, the Vice-President of the Executive Council. .Last year the Senate joined with the House of Representatives in passing a measure to provide for an Excise- upon harvesters made in the Commonwealth. The Act provided that unless the makers of those harvester machines paid proper rates of wages they would have to pay an Excise of <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;6</inline> per machine, which they would not have to pay if their employes received the wages which they had a right to expect. That payment has not been made. Either the country is being defrauded of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;fi</inline> per machine, or the work people employed by the Victorian firm, McKay&#39;s - are being defrauded ; because they are not receiving the wages which they are entitled to get. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor, in the Federal Arbitration Court, decided, much to the disgust of the McKay firm, that they must produce their books, and have them audited if they wished to escape payment of the Excise. That is to say, they must actually show that they are paying the stipulated wages. What has followed? The Government,&#39; instead of carrying out the law as enunciated by a Court of their own creation, are now talking about bringing in a Bill to do what an existing Act already provides can be done. The judgment qf. the Arbitration Court . enables it&#39; to be done, but the Government are trying to dodge their responsibilities. They are trying to throw upon the operatives in these works the cost of making &#39;this- inquiry instead of making it themselves. It was, of course,  admitted in&#39; the Arbitration Court that an inquiry by an accountant is necessary. We find in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> to-day that these operatives, who cannot obtain justice from the Government, which created this Court, and also created the Excise system, have decided to call a meeting. Here is the advertisement - </para>

                <para>The Government will not carry out the law, and by thus dallying with the matter, assists in defrauding the revenue, or defrauding the employes of these firms. They will not carry out this beautiful new protection system. They will mouth about it, but they will not do that which can be done now if they would only do their duty. I believe that there is a connexion between certain, funds of some associations and* certain firms, and that investigations by an accountant would very likely lead to some political scandals such as have occurred in the United States of America in relation to the Trusts and- certain electioneering bodies. I believe that is why the Government are afraid to do their duty. Hence, I say that one of two things is happening. Either the taxpayers are being defrauded bv not obtaining what they ought to obtain, the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> Excise, or the persons employed by these firms are being defrauded by not being paid the stipulated and legal wages. I want to know from my honorable and learned friend, the Vice-President of the Executive Council - and I ask . the question with all  friendliness, but all &#34; firmness - whether he will put himself in a position to give the Senate a satisfactory assurance upon this matter when it meets on the &#39;first day of meeting next week? </para>

                        <para>. - I entirely agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> - if the facts, as stated by him in connexion with the Excise duty on agricultural machinery, and the payment of fair wages to those engaged, in the industry, are correct. I am very glad that he has &#34; got a hustle on &#34; in connexion with that matter. But with respect to the telegram that he has received from New South Wales, I should like to. know 1: if it is as reliable as the telegram which he received from the . ex- Premier of the State about the election of Dooley ? In seeking urgent information in connexion with the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;</inline> Loghlin this morning,  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> was very careful &#39;not to ask whether the first portion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin&#39;s</inline> statement was correct - that is, that 176 applicants were applying for one block of land in New South Wales. An answer upon that subject would throw some light on the situation existing there. If information is required, it should be of the most complete character; and I hope that when we meet next Wednesday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will be supplied with another telegram from the Chief Secretary of New South Wales, or from the Lands Department, with respect to the excess of applicants for blocks of land, with a view of showing the quantity of land available there. </para>

                        <para>. - If my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, refers to the constitutional aspect of the Australian Industries Preservation Act now on the statute-book, I can assure him that it was elaborately discussed when it was before the Senate. If he will refer to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> he will discover the various arguments and views of honorable senators regarding it. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the amending Bill will involve any serious constitutional question- certainly not the constitutional questions which were originally involved when the Act was before us. With regard to. the somewhat excited statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> I shall be. very glad to place his representations before my colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, and to learn from him what, is to be said in reply. </para>
