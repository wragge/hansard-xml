However, he has seen fit to take the step, and I have to announce it to the Senate. It has involved certain alterations in the allotment of portfolios. The Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne has' assumed the office of Treasurer ; the Honorable Austin Chapman has assumed the office of Minister of Trade and Customs; and the Honorable Samuel Mauger has assumed the office of Postmaster-General. </para>

                        <para>- The work was intended to be brought out during the latter half of this year, and we understood that at that time the Government Printing Office in Victoria would be working under very heavy pressure, owing to the fact that two Parliaments would be sitting in Melbourne. In addition to that, in bringing out a work of that character, possibly a number of alterations will have to be made up to the very last moment, in order to adjust the material to the latest information supplied. So that there should be no hitch in the bringing out of the work, tenders were invited from firms all over the Commonwealth. It was also considered that we might be able to get even a higher class production in that way than could be obtained from the Government Printing Office. At the same time, I want to point out that the applications for tenders specified that the Department would not be necessarily bound to accept the lowest or any particular tender, but would act in what it considered to be the best way for the production of the work itself and the furnishing of the most correct information. </para>

                        <para>- Once again we are called upon to consider this Bill, which, in the words of a friend of mine, might be considered a hardy annual, because it comes along every year. I think, however, that it would be more accurately described as a hardy perennial, because it appears that, no matter how often it is nipped in the bud by the blighting frost of defeat, it comes up smiling in the following spring. </para>

                            <para>- The only thing I have to regret in connexion with the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> speech is that he or somebody else excised the beautiful flowers of fancy with which he adorned it. If it were permissible for the Vice-President of the Executive Council to be poetical, I do not see why I should not be poetical also. Iri his first attempt to move the second reading of this Bill, the Vice-President of the Executive Council said that it was owing to the " whirligig of politics " that he found himself under the painful necessity - as I suppose it' was - of doing so. He did not admit, however, that this was a final and successful moving of such a measure. I consider that the Minister's explanations as to why he is in favour of the Bill at the present time, when we know how strongly he opposed it on previous occasions, was very laboured indeed. In fact, I think that, in the language of Lord Byron, his speech might be described as one composed in that style of rhetoric which the learned call "rigmarole," because it consisted simply of sophistries strung together to cloak over the position in which the Minister found himself. The Senate is in an unfortunate position, inasmuch as this Bill has been introduced by so many Governments that there is now possibly a majority of the members of the Senate who feel themselves constrained to vote iri favour of it. Yet I venture to say that a number of those who will vote for the second reading are in their heart of hearts opposed to the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator stated that the measure had been so often passed by the other House that the Senate was not justified in constantly rejecting it. He will admit that he said something to that effect. But when we consider that there is a majority of the members of the Senate who are really opposed to the Bill, though, for one reason or another, some feel constrained to vote for it, I consider that those who are opposed to it have a perfect right to offer it the most strenuous opposition. At any rate, a minority, no matter what the facts of the case mav be, if they feel- that they are in the right, are perfectly justified in offering strenuous opposition to any proposal whatever, no matter how many Governments mav have proposed it. </para>

                            <para>- The pressure brought to bear noon senators to vote for this Bill has been so great that 7 do not think that any one  could  resist it for very long if he were  merely slightly opposed  to the measure. It must be remembered that the Senate does not  occupy  the same  position  as a mere Legislative Council. The Senate represents the people's will just as much as  the other House does. We are sent here to execute the commands of the people of Australia. Further, it must be recollected that the Senate exists for a particular purpose, and was called into being by the people of Australia in order to conserve and safeguard the rights of the States. That being so, if we are convinced that the rights of the States are involved in any particular matter, we have a perfect right to offer the most strenuous opposition. </para>

                            <para>- I am not quarrelling with the supporters of the measure. But when we see sophistical reasons put forward for adopting a certain course of action, we have a right to combat those reasons, and show the fallacy underlying them. The Constitution itself provides a method for overcoming any deadlock between the two Houses of the Legislature. If the Government are earnest and sincere in this matter, why do they not avail themselves of that constitutional method ? This Senate has a right to resist to the last and the utmost any measure to which it is opposed, and the Constitution itself prescribes a method by which the people can decide between it and the other branch of the Legislature. I challenge the Government, if they are sufficiently in earnest in this matter, to push the test, and I think it is due to the importance of the subject that the test should be pushed, to such an extreme as to adopt that method. There is no need to quote at length from the various pamphlets, reports, and expressions of opinion which have been published in connexion with this subject, because the whole ground has been so thoroughly canvassed in this Parliament that it would only be reiteration to make extracts from them at length. It would be quoting again passages which are already embodied in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> But I do propose before I sit down to enter my emphatic protest against what I can call nothing less than a piece of political jobbery being forced on the country. I say that it is political jobbery for this reason : that we have no right to spend the taxpayers' money upon a scheme so unsound, when we would not think of spending our own money in a similar direction. Now, in my opinion, there is not a single member of the Senate who would be prepared to spend his money in the way that it is proposed to spend the money of the taxpayers on this survey. </para>

That is to say, they have the option to purchase up to a certain day. Would such a syndicate undertake to spend £5,000 or £10,000 in determining whether it was worth while to exercise their option, unless they definitely had the right to take the mine at the stated price, and at the stated time ? Undoubtedly, there is not a single man in Australia - not a business man in any part of the world - who would be guilty of such arrant folly as that. Vet we, as the guardians of the welfare of the people of Australia propose to be guilty of such a ridiculous piece of folly. </para>

                            <para>- I am illustrating the position by a reference to what people would do in their ordinary private affairs. Not a day passes without such a transaction as I have described taking place in the mining world. It is quite a common thing for a company which desires to buy a mine to obtain an option over it with the proviso that it must spend a stipulated sum by a stated period. That money is spent in order to determine whether it is worth while to exercise the option or not. But we are asked to spend £20,000, with the knowledge that we shall have to spend ,£50,000 before we have finished with the business, on an alleged option to do a certain thing without the slightest prospect of our ever having the right to complete the transaction. We have not yet been given the option. There is not the slightest chance of being able to obtain it. For the last three years, and at the present moment, one-half of the honorable senators representing South Australia in this Chamber have been opposed to the building of the suggested railway. </para>

                            <para>- South Australia, ir&gt; giving her consent to the survey, makes a further important condition. She must be consulted as to the route and gauge of the railway. She will then be in a position to say, " We would be willing to let you build the line, only we are not satisfied with this route, or with that gauge." Has any one ever heard of such a ridiculous proposition as that this Parliament should be asked to spend £20,000 on such conditions? Most of the South Australian people to whom I have had the pleasure of talking on the subject say that they would be satisfied only with a 3 ft. 6 in. gauge which would be uniform with the ruling gauge of the railways already constructed in the State. Again many people, who are in favour of the building of the railway say that a 3 ft. 6 in. gauge for a main trunk line of that kind would be useless. Here is ground for a renewal of the whole difficulty on the question of the gauge to be adopted. It is well known to any one who is acquainted with railway construction that a survey that would be suitable for a 3 ft. 6 in. gauge line would not be suitable for a 4 ft. 8J in. line. The narrower the gauge the sharper the curves that may be adopted, and it is more easy to follow the natural contour of the country with a 3 ft. 6 in. gauge line than with one of 4 ft. 8^ in. gauge. Therefore, a survey that would be suitable for a 3 ft. 6 in. gauge railway  would be unsuitable for a railway on the wider gauge. </para>

                            <para>- Of course they are. A further difficulty raised by South Australia is that before she can consent to anything in the way of the construction of the line she must be consulted as to the route as well as the gauge. The route which the Commonwealth Parliament might, in its wisdom, decide to be the best to adopt might not suit South Australia at all, and the people of that State would then use their reservation as to the route as a subterfuge to refuse consent to the building of the line. Such an unbusiness-like proposition really does not deserve serious consideration for a moment. </para>

                            <para>- The possibility and, in fact, the certainty at the present time is that a majority of the South Australian representatives in the Senate are not in favour of the building of the railway. It is equally certain that a majority of the South Australian representatives in another place, and of the people of South Australia, are not at present in favour of the building of the railway. Otherwise why all these objections and conditions. If the people of South Australia do not object to the construction of the line, why do they not do as the people of Western Australia have done, and give us their consent without any humbugging about it? It is evident that nobody in South Australia is in favour of the building of the line at present. Whilst they raise no objection to the spending of ^20,000 on the survey, they are not likely to do anything which will commit that State to giving its consent to the building of the line. It is all very well for South Australia and Western Australia to secure the expenditure of this money if they can, but the other States have to be considered, and as they would have to find the major portion of it, they should have some guarantee that it would not be thrown away. Some honorable senators apply a salve to their consciences in voting for this Bill by saying that it is something more than a Survey Bill, and the expenditure of the money will be justified by the advantages of exploration or some other reason. </para>

I suppose one man will bring along one rail in one year, another man will bring along a peg the next year, and another a dog spike, and in that way South Australia will get out of the whole business. There are only two reasons which can be advanced for the construction of this fine. One is the settlement of the great territory of Western Australia, and the other its advantages for purposes of defence. </para>

It is safe to say that Western Australia would to-day be of perhaps smaller importance than any other State in the Commonwealth in regard to population, wealth and industry, were it not for the discovery of those gold-fields. To be of advantage to that State, the proposed railway must benefit the gold-fields which are intended to be the Western Australian terminus of the line. </para>

It would not lighten his load in the slightest degree, and it is a matter of surprise to me that honorable senators who believe with myself that the policy adopted by the Labour Party is the only policy which can do good to the class they represent, are found doing all they possibly can to help this proposal along as one of the measures which would be of value in assisting the toilers of this country to work out their own salvation. </para>

                            <para>- Of course; but if we are to build this line to convey goods to the sea there are places at which they could be conveyed to the sea before we reach Kalgoorlie. For instance, there are Port Augusta and Eucla, and if those places are passed the goods must be carried further inland. We are told by the advocates of the line that it is an enormous handicap to the people of Western Australia that they should be four days' steam from the eastern States, and should then have  the long train journey from the western coast of Western Australia to reach the heart of the country. But there is an easier way out of that difficulty than that proposed by this Bill. A railway which would be of real and lasting advantage to the people of the gold-fields, bringing them nearer to the coast, and enabling them to get their goods at a very much lower rate, thus cheapening the cost of living, would toe a line &lt;f'rom Kalgoorlie to Esperance Bay, which would also give speedier communication with the eastern States. </para>

                        policy for the benefit and glorification of the property-owners of Perth and Fremantle we are being asked to spend ^5,000,000 of money. That is a ridiculous policy, and one which should not be tolerated for a moment in a sensible assembly. Is it not a fact that a railway to Esperance Bay would shorten the journey from the gold-fields by land to the sea by from 120 to 150 miles, and bring the people of the gold-fields two days nearer by steamer to the eastern States? Whereas it takes under two days for a steamer to go from Adelaide to Esperance Bay, it takes four days by sea from Fremantle to Adelaide. The railway from the gold-fields to Esperance Bay is the one that would be of advantage to the people of Western Australia, and the cost of building it is easily within the means of that State. Its construction would benefit the people there.

                            <para>- Of course, and it would not be a very heavy tax on them. That is not the consideration which stops the Government of Western Australia from building it. Their objection is that it would detract from the importance and advantage of the property owners in Fremantle and Perth, and give the people of the gold-fields another outlet to the sea. The people in Perth and Fremantle would not then be able to fleece the inland producers for all time, as they want to do now. That is why they are so eager to get a Bill passed providing for the expenditure of Commonwealth money to further their nefarious objects, and to stave off for all time the building of the railway which would be really useful to the gold-fields people. </para>

                    </interjection><para>SenatorGIVENS.- The fact remains that it was not built. I accept the honorable senator's statement that it is being built now, and if that is so, then there is no necessity for this proposed railway at all, as there would be nothing whatever for it to do if it was built. Nobody would be so foolish as to travel by rail at the enormous fares that would have to be charged in order to make the line a paying proposition, when he could travel cheaply by sea. Of course, a few wealthy individuals to whom£10or £20 was a mere bagatelle could afford to travel by rail, and the line would also be used by a few business people whose time was exceedingly valuable, but the great majority of the population of the gold-fields would never use it at all. They would go by rail from Kalgoorlie or Coolgardie to Esperance, and then take ship to the eastern States. We have the experience of our existing InterState lines to guide us. The bulk of the passengers from Adelaide to Melbourne, Melbourne to Sydney, and Sydney to Brisbane go by steamer. The expense would be very much greater in proportion on this line, because the distance is so much greater. . The railway from the gold-fields to Esperance, as it would bring the people two days nearer by sea to the eastern States, and shorten the distance bv land from the gold-fields to the sea by over 120 miles, would be an enormous advantage to the people, and yet Western Australia, as represented by its Government, if that Government does truly represent it, refuses the people of the gold-fields that great concession, although going continually cap in hand to the Commonwealth and asking it to build a comparatively useless railway for them. We are asked in this Bill to take the initiatory step towards spending £5,000,000. That is a very serious proposition. The first question that suggests itself to anybody who is called upon to consider such a proposal is whether the line will pay. </para><para class="block">It will not do anything of the kind. It will not nearly pay, nor can it possibly be hoped that it will pay, especially if the Esperance Bay railway is built, because that line would take the whole of the prospective traffic. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I want to examine the question quite apart from what anybody has said about it hitherto. We have a very good guide as to the prospects of the line in the condition of the present InterState lines. We have practically one continuous railway from Brisbane to Adelaide, through Sydney and Melbourne. That is just about the same distance as from Port Augusta to Perth. Everybody knows that the line from Brisbane to Adelaide through Sydney and Melbourne traverses the very best country, the most thickly settled portions, and the biggest and most important towns of Australia, and yet we know that the line, as a whole, does not pay. How, then, can it be contended that an equal length of line through the most unsettled and most sparsely populated portion of Australia, passing through no towns of any size or importance, except the gold-fields towns of the west, throughout its whole route, has any reasonable prospect of paying? </para>

                            <para>- The portion from Sydney to Brisbane does not pay, although it goes through about the best country in the Commonwealth. By far the greater portion of it is in New South Wales, yet the New South Wales lines as. a whole pay- handsomely. The Queensland lines do not pay. That brings me to another iniquitous feature of this proposal, that we in Queensland, although we have incurred a heavy indebtedness per head of the population, higher, perhaps, than that of any other country in the world, are to be asked, after having spent that money unproductively in our own country on railways, to hand out another large sum to help to build a railway for other people. </para>

The line will go through a stretch of country about 1,100 miles in length, and at no part will be distant more than 200 miles from the coast.

That is none of it is more than 200 mile from the coast. I have also pointed out that every portion of the country through which the railway will pass is in that part of Australia where the climate is supposed to be most congenial to white men's existence, and most favorable to the pursuit of white men's occupations. It is in the southern area of the Continent, right along the sea-coast where it is of most easy access to other parts of the Continent. All those conditions are favorable. Yet what are the facts? Over that distance of 1,100 miles the country is practically uninhabited, although there is no other portion of Australia right round the coast of which the same thing can be said. </para>

                            <para>- In Australia there is no stretch of coast, for even 300 or 400 miles which is uninhabited, except the stretch of coast through which we are asked to take the initial step towards constructing a railway. Frequently we have been told by certain honorable gentlemen with political leanings that the southern portion of Australia is the only place fit for a white man ; in fact, that the northern portion is only fit for a black man. Yet there is no single portion of the Continent - not around Cape York Peninsula, the Gulf country, the Northern Territory, or even the north-west of Western Australia - within 200 miles of the coast for a stretch of 300 miles, which is uninhabited similarly to the country between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. Therefore, if we find that what is admitted to be the most unfavorable portion of Australia is uninhabited to that extent we can only conclude that its circumstances are exceptionally unfavorable towards occupation by white men or the pursuit of white men's industries. I think there can be no two opinions about that. If that is so, what reasonable hope can we have of picking; up traffic or inducing settlement along the route of the line? There can be little or no hope, though, of course, as some honorable senators say, we may discover a. second Mount Morgan, Kalgoorlie or Coolgardie. There is always that possibility, but it will be exceedingly foolish for the Senate to lend its countenance to a gamble of that sort. The Inter-State railway lines,, going through the great capitals, do not as a whole pay. What prospect would they have to pay at all, or of getting a. payable traffic if they were dependent on the traffic which was carried from the terminus? If they did not serve large towns and important settlements on the route they would be practically idle, and that will be the fate of this transcontinental line if it is ever constructed, especially after the railway to Esperance Bay is completed. That is the line which is best calculated to serve the interests of the people on the gold-fields, and if it were constructed, I am confident that the traffic available for the transcontinental line would be infinitesimal. Apparently the country to be traversed is an exceedingly difficult one to open up. It is all accessible by sea. We have along that coast ports and harbors, just as we have along the rest of the coast of Australia. It might be easily penetrated and made available for settlement so far as accessibility is concerned if there were any inducements to offer to settlers. I contend that the railway, if made, will not provide as cheap or easy means of access - from the economical stand-point - as does the sea. It will certainly make for a little rapidity of access, but that will be the only advantage. I can see no reasonable prospect of settlement along the proposed route, because even Sir John Forrest admits that it is absolutely waterless country. In fact he says in -the paper which has been presented to the Senate in order to induce honorable senators to vote for the Bill, that on one exploring trip he had to turn back because the only waterhole he found was one containing fifteen gallons of water. So I suppose that this railway may be accurately-  described as the "15 gallons waterhole railway." It is, as everybody knows, important that Australia should be in a petition to defend herself. No one is more anxious than I am to see Australia placed in a position to be able to independently defend herself from any attack which is likely to be made. If this railway is to be built for defence; if that is the only justification which can be put forward for its construction - and I think I have effectively disposed of the other alleged argument in favour of the proposal - then I submit that the proper route has not been chosen for defence purposes. A railway line for defence purposes which could be seized at two or three points of its course by a raiding enemy .would not be a safe line of military communication. Even the veriest tyro in military science will admit that if we want to fight an enemy we must .not run undefended into his arms and allow him to embrace us. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, there are railways which, for a very long distance, are considerably over 40 miles from the coast. But those lines were not built from a defence stand-point; they were made for the purpose of opening up and developing country. As I have already pointed out,, at Port Augusta and Eucla this railway, if built, would be vulnerable to any enemy. Therefore, from that point of view, I think it must be recognised that, as a method for providing us with more effectual defence, it would not be worth anything like the money it would cost. A railway for defence purposes, should be made far enough inland to prevent any probability - in fact, any possibility - of seizure by an enemy. If this railway is to be built at all, in my opinion it should go direct from the eastern States almost across the continent to Western Australia. A great portion of a central line of that sort is already made. All that would be necessary would be to link up Cobar with Broken Hill, and run  a line through the centre, or near the centre, of Australia to Kalgoorlie. </para>

Such a railway should start from the most populous centre, and what is generally recognised as the heart, of the 'Commonwealth, where it  woul(J  be most easy to concentrate a number of troops and send them across the continent.

                            <para>- No; I shall do my level best to insure that the line, if it is to be built, shall be of some use for defence purposes. Suppose that this proposal is carried, and that we make the survey, and start to build the line. What will it mean? It will mean that we shall have to initiate a borrowing policy straight away, unless we are prepared to exact from the taxpayers of the Commonwealth about £1,500,000 per annum in the way of fresh taxation. </para>

                            <para>- The demand for' £20,000 is a mere subterfuge. The people who are now in favour of the proposed survey intend to follow it up by a proposal to build the line. They have already tried to bind certain public men in the Commonwealth to support the construction of the line. They have even gone so far as to say that the cajoleries that passed between certain public men in reference to the question are sufficient to bind this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest was candid enough to admit in another place that he looked upon the survey as the forerunner of the line ; that is to say, he looked upon this vote as a necessary step towards construction. In fact <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> stated that if he had his way he would build the line straight away ; he would have survey and construction going on simultaneously. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> suggests, we are merely called upon to deal with a proposal to spend £20,000, what necessity is there for a survey at all ? Why not say that we appropriate £20,000 for exploration or prospecting? The fact is that this is the initiatory step for the building of a railway which must ultimately cost this Commonwealth , £5,000,000. That means - if the line is to be constructed in three or four years, as it ought to be if constructed at all - that we shall have to raise £1,500,000 in extra taxation if the money is to be paid out of revenue, or to initiate a Commonwealth borrowing policy. .Now I am against a borrowing policy all the time. If the railway is to be built I shall give my vote in favour of raising the money by taxation. But if we must increase the burdens of the people of this country let us do it in such a way that we shall have another half million people making a living in Australia. That would be a better defence for us than to build a railway in any part of this Commonwealth. Let us get clown to bed-rock in the matter of defence. Let us have the manhood here to defend the country. If we have not the manhood our defence must necessarily be very poor indeed. The Commonwealth would be far wiser in spending money in enabling half a million more men and women to make a prosperous living in the Commonwealth than in building a railway which would not enable a single individual to settle. It would not lessen the burden of any working man whether in Western Australia or any other part of the Commonwealth. Therefore, as a Labour member, I do not feel inclined to give it the . slightest consideration. We want no political railways. We do not want any bargaining or cajolery between prominent politicians such as have been going on in connexion with this project. We want an honest policy, which will not place a burden on any particular State, but will enable us to nourish a happy and prosperous population in Australia. If we do that we shall have nothing to fear in the matter of defence. I have opposed this Bill from the time when it was first introduced in the Senate. I shall continue to oppose it. If I am beaten I shall not be angry. But I regard the Bill as one which, so far from being beneficial to Australia as a whole, will, on the contrary, impose fresh burdens, without any compensating advantages, and will inevitably perpetrate a gross injustice upon the State which I represent </para>

I think that the abject poverty of the arguments adduced by the honorable senator who has just resumed his seat proves conclusively that the measure has been so thoroughly discussed that there is no necessity to debate it again at great length. </para>

I have been straightforward in connexion with the matter, and intend to continue the honest course that I have assumed from the inception. If I understand the question at all, in voting for this Bill I am not voting for any proposal connected with the cost of the line, but am taking a step towards the completion of the Federation of Australia. It is a ste£ towards the complete upbuilding of that national life to which so many eloquent references were made during the earlier years of the movement for Federation. </para>

                            <para>- It will be necessary to construct a railway to Western Australia before the Federation of this country can be completed, and before this Parliament can honestly say that it has carried out what has always been the demand of the people of Western Australia, namely, that they shall be made, in common with the people of the rest of Australia, people of one sentiment and one destiny. Where is the one sentiment now ? Where is the one destiny ? The destiny depends upon a sugar bounty in one case, and probably it will depend on some other kind of bounty in another ! But there remains the fact that Western Australia has materially suffered in her industrial possibilities from Federation. She undoubtedly had a great struggle against the cords that have been tied round her by the Commonwealth ; and unless the Federation is prepared to carry out its compact with Western Australia- </para>

They were the people who pointed out the strong possibility of this line being constructed at an early date. In my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has treated the subject very unfairly. It has been generally admitted that the line must be built sooner or Liter. I say that it had better be built sooner than later. What is our position? To the <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> type of man - to the man who has never seen Western Australia, except from the window of a railway train or the top story of an hotel - the talk about the "desert" lands of the west is full of meaning. Such opponents of the Bill copy the phrases used by the Victorian newspapers, and I suppose tell the Queensland people that Western Australia between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta is simply a huge desert unfit for men to live in. </para>

                            <para>- No ; my conviction is, and always has been, that the obligation rests upon the Commonwealth. That is the reason for the attitude assumed by honorable senators from Western Australia. I have some idea of the feelings of the people of that State. I read everything that was to be read on the subject of Federation at the time it was proposed. I listened to the public men who came from South Australia, and other parts of the Commonwealth to Western Australia to advocate Federation. I have already said that I opposed Federation, and did' all I possibly could by voice and vote to prevent it. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> did that conscientiously believing that Western Australia would, if 'she entered the Federation, tie herself up, and be at the mercy of the eastern States, and that, so far as her industrial life was concerned, she would, for a great number of years, have to give up all hope of expansion. I raised those arguments and believed them at the time, and I have lived to see that many of them have been justified by the actual facts as they exist to-day. I say that the promise of the linking of Western Australia with the eastern States by a railway, whether implied or direct, was used with great power in Western Australia, and exerted a mighty influence in bringing the people of that State to the conclusion at which they arrived at the referendum on the Commonwealth Bill. No man whether he be in favour or opposed to Federation, need fear for a moment to make that statement. We are asking by this Bill that £20,000 - and I should not care if the amount were £50,000 - should be spent for the purpose practically of proving the country between the two points mentioned. Then, if it is shown that Western Australia is not the country it is represented to be, honorable senators will be entitled to take whatever course they please. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, in his <inline font-style="italic">precis,</inline> refers to one patch of country comprising 13.000,000 acres of excellently grassed land. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has no right to say that. The facts have been so clearly and carefully stated, even within the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> records of this Parliament, that no one has a right to make such a statement at the present 'time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story,</inline> made some answer to the effect that whilst roads and bridges were not considered as productive works, this was a roads and bridges proposition that was being submitted by people who desired that others should nay for it. I was under the impression that in this Commonwealth we were influenced by some sentiment of nationhood, and that what would benefit any part of Australia in the matter of railway communication and the opening up of the country would be considered as benefiting the whole Commonwealth. If we are to have a Commonwealth of six States, without any community of interests, the sooner that is made ' known the tetter by our candidly declaring ourselves hypocritical federationists,  and admitting that from the beginning we were mere " boodlers " and " boosters," who were endeavouring to carry out a scheme by which some of the big States would be enabled to skin the little ones. If that is the idea of nationhood possessed by some honorable senators, I can only deplore it. I desire a Federation of Australia based upon very much higher motives, and I wish Western Australia to obtain that share of advantage from the Federation which I think she deserves, and which she was given to understand would be hers when she entered into the compact of Federation. </para>

I am very glad that that opportunity has been given, and that the Bill is now before us.

No one can deny that the question which we are now debating is of the utmost importance, not only to Western Australia, but to the people of the Commonwealth generally. It is only natural that representatives of the western State in the Senate should feel somewhat anxious about it, and desire to place their views before the Senate. On this occasion I intend to be brief, because I know that in previous Parliaments the pros, and cons, of the matter have been somewhat comprehensively discussed. But there are now in this Chamber new senators, who may not have heard the arguments of their predecessors, and in order that they may be able to give an intelligent vote, I think it wise that those who support the Bill should submit arguments in favour of the proposed survey. I listened with a great deal of interest to the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> which was composed for the most part of " ifs" and "ans." </para>

                            <para>- I am not worrying about the respect of some of the honorable senators who have interjected. I can get along very well with or without it. So far as the survey is concerned, no honorable senator who supports it will thereby commit himself to vote for the construction of the railway. I think that is an honest statement. We simply desire to prove to the people of the Commonwealth that the country through which it is proposed that the line shall pass is not a desert. . There seems, also, to be a feeling among certain journalists, and also, I believe, certain honorable senators, that Western Australia itself is a desert. Men who hold that opinion have never seen the State, or, if they have, have only had a cursory glance at the country. Now that Australians are all one people with one destiny, the people of Western Australia are simply asking for justice. We ' look for a practical demonstration of the true Federal sentiment. I might remind honorable senators from Queensland, who have so strenuously opposed this survey right throughout, and who say it is not right to call upon other States to pay any part of the cost of it, that, had it not been for Federation, the sugar industry in Queensland would not be in- its present flourishing condition. It is a bounty-fed industry, and, had it not been for Federation, I can safely say, without fear of contradiction, that it would not have been able to compete immediately after 1901 in the markets of the world. Western Australia contributed her share to the preservation of that industry which amounted to £18,000 in 1906. That sum is almost equal to the amount the Senate is now asked to vote for this survey. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that we are desirous of proving to the people of  Australia that it will not be a "desert railway." Senators Givens has referred to the question of defence, urging that the route of the proposed line would make it useless for defence purposes, because it is so short a distance from the coast. One would' gather from that argument that we were not going to have any coastal defence at all, either in the shape of battleships, submarines, or torpedo destroyers. Once the forts at our principal ports are silenced, it will not matter, so far as defence is concerned, whether the railway is forty or a hundred miles from the coastline, because the invading army the honorable senator referred to will " get there all the same." Considered from the standpoints of defence, postal service, or commerce, either singly or collectively, this railway, or the- survey of it, is necessary.. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has already stated,, it was generally understood in Western Australia that if that State joined the Federation, justice would be done to her in reference to the railway. Even allowing for a moment that that was not the motive actuating the people of Western Australia in casting their votes for Federation, no honorable senator will deny that one of the Federal ideals was that every State would be able to send its produce to, and have a share in the benefits of, the markets of Australia. Under present conditions,. Western Australia is debarred from participation in those benefits. We are in a position of isolation that is altogether too splendid., There are only two means of egress from, or ingress to, our State - steam-ship or balloon. The steam-ship is not always an enviable means of transport, and the balloon is not yet a system perfect enough to use. I have always been a Federalist, and, reviewing the period from 1901 to the present day, I believe that great things have been done in this young nation. The Federal machine hai done a great deal of good work. We are on the straight path to nationhood, but the benefits of Federation have not been equally enjoyed by all the States, and no State has more reason to complain in that regard than Western Australia. So far as Queensland is concerned, the steam-ship service to Papua, for which Australia pays a certain amount, Western Australia contributing her portion, is of direct benefit to Queensland and New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- Western Australia is paying the subsidy for that service herself, and also for the service on the western portion of her coast. I think that is an effective answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway's</inline> interjection. Australia pays ,£200,000 a year as a subsidy for the British Fleet in Australian waters. Sydney is practically its head-quarters. Occasionally it is found at Hobart and Melbourne, but I do not think it has ever been seen in Western Australian waters, although we have had an occasional warship there. Consequently, the other States again get the benefit of the money spent in the maintenance and provisioning of that fleet. I want it to be clearly understood that I am not complaining personally in this respect. I am simply following the same line of argument as those honorable senators who oppose this survey for the one reason that the other States will be called upon to pay their share of the ^20,000. Let me refer again to our contribution to the bounty paid to the Queensland sugar planters. I may be told that the reason for endeavouring to preserve the sugar industry is the desire to maintain a White Australia. I agree with that policy. When this survey is made, I am confident that we shall be able to prove that it is also in the interests of a White Australia that the line should be built, because the reports of the engineers who have surveyed the country show that there are millions of acres of fertile land there which can be inhabited by white people. We can only have a White Australia by settling white people on the portions of our territory that are at present uninhabited. The natural resources of the country through which this line will pass will give every opportunity to the Government of this young nation to provide means whereby a white population can be settled on the soil, and so add to the prosperity of the Commonwealth. I freely admit that the reports submitted to honorable senators show that there is a shortage of water. </para>

                            <para>- Western Australia has also done it. In many instances she is doing it to-day, and at the same time she is contributing largely, as I have mentioned, to the assistance of other States. If this parochial spirit is going to pervade all our actions, then I submit that there is no Federation; let it be abolished at once. I shall certainly advocate that Western Australia should defray the cost of this survey if she will be freed from her contribution to the support and preservation of certain industries in the Commonwealth. I do not think it is necessary to detain the Senate at greater length, because I recognise that if the question were discussed for a week no further light would be thrown on it. We are not asking the Senate to pass a vote for the construction of the railway, but merely to authorize the expenditure of £20,000 for the survey of a route. A great deal of stress has been laid on the fact that the consent of South Australia has not been obtained. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> constitutional lawyer though he thinks himself to be, is not aware that if, in its wisdom, this Parliament held that the safety of Australia demanded that this line should be surveyed or constructed, there would be 110 necessity to obtain the consent of any State. That, however, is beside the question just now. I merely refer to it in order to let previous speakers know that the Commonwealth has the power to construct any  railway if the safety of Australia should demand its construction. I have not the slightest doubt of the consent of South Australia being given. During the recess I took the opportunity of travelling through many of the States, and coming into contact with their people, and from personal experience I can say that if the Senate should carry the second reading of the Bill, the news will be welcomed by the people in every State. I hope that not only will the Senate carry the second reading of the Bill, but will pass it through all its stages, and that on this occasion we shall be able to send cheering information to the far distant State of Western Australia that we, the representatives of this young nation, are determined to give its Government and its people a. chance to prove their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> in this matter, that the true Federal sentiment pervades our action, and that Federation is no phantom, but a reality. If we do that, then I think that we shall have done something to cement the bonds of true unity between the States of the Commonwealth. </para>

That quotation is taken  from  an article by a gentleman who writes under the name of " Geographer," and who says that the country there described is on the route of the proposed railway. Tn submitting the Bill, the Vice-President of the Executive Council made the best of a bad case. One half of his argument did not advance his case a single step, and the other  half completely damned it. Why did my honorable friend, astute lawyer as he is, give to the Senate those wonderful figures which, I suppose, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest stuffed into his hand at the last moment to make it thoroughly understood that Western Australia is about the richest State in the Commonwealth? We were asked to dwell on her marvellous territory of 625,000,000 acres, and to think of her wonderful gold mines. We were reminded that her annual output of gold was valued at ^8,305,652. We were told of the marvellous return from the railways of Western Australia, and here I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> who,  1  believe, intend to vote for the Bill, to ponder a little. It appears that two or three years ago - these are the latest statistics which I have seen - her railways returned £280,000 over and above the interest and working expenses. Compare that return with the losses of the other States. For the three years ending 1905, the total deficit in New South Wales was ^768,000, in Victoria ,£364,000, and in Queensland £.1,164,000. No wonder that my honorable friends cannot convert the senators from Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- A Labour Government ! My honorable friend makes an irrelevant interjection because by any remark which is relevant he cannot answer the argument. Tasmania is small and is sparsely populated. Yet she has defrayed the cost of her surveys and her railways. In railway construction she has been self-reliant. Where is the justice or the fair play in asking that State to assist to make 625 miles of railway for South Australia and 475 miles of railway for the rich State of Western Australia? Talk about fairness and justice ! In my opinion a more impudent demand than this was. never placed before a legislative body. When I go into early history, what do I find ? I find that . it has taken three Prime Ministers, and no end of, as Senator Best said, "political whirligigs," to bring this proposal up to its present position. I find that in the early days, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest commenced by suggesting that South Australia and Western Australia should build this transcontinental railway, and in making that suggestion he was quite consistent with the attitude he took up in the Federal Convention. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has left the chamber, because otherwise I would justify my statement that, in arguing this matter, he seemed to have an absolute disregard of the facts.

                            <para>- At the Convention in 1898. I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> has seized the point. Some honorable senators opposite seem to be unable to seize any point except that there was an implied condition of Federation that the railway should be built. Now, any senator who makes such a statement is absolutely flying in the face of the facts. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest found that he was getting on admirably with his railway scheme - first inducing one Prime Minister to conduct the correspondence, and then seizing upon the next Prime Minister to continue it - he thought that he would clinch the matter with regard to the survey by telling every one what they all knew, that voting for the Survey Bill did not commit them to the construction of the  railway. But afterwards he tried to make people believe that those who once voted for the survey would be committed to the construction of the railway. Here are the words he used when he found that by his little tricks and his powerful influence he was getting what he wanted - </para>

                            <para>- But for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest's influence and ministerial position, and but for the position which he holds in regard to Western Australia, we should never have seen this Bill. Those are the words of my right honorable friend, who is determined to get this railway by fair means if he can, but, any way, to get it. He commenced by being honest and consistent in his utterances at the Convention. We all. know the reason why the words in the Constitution with reference to railway construction and extension were inserted. They were inserted for defence purposes, and no one ever dreamt that three years after Federation was established they would be used for the purpose of inducing the Commonwealth to build 625 miles of railway for the benefit of South Australia and 475 for the benefit of Western Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest commenced in 1889 by asking  South Australia to join Western Australia in constructing this railway. But South Australia, not being the rich State that Western Australia is, said that she could not see her way to do it, that her ordinary expenditure was very large, and that she preferred that the Federal Government should undertake the work. Well, I suppose there is not an honorable senator who would not prefer that another man should pay his debts and undertake his liabilities. </para>

That consent has not been, and cannot be, obtained. A more indefensible thing was never done  by  any Government in the British dominions than that of proceeding with a measure like this without the consent of the State which the Constitution says is necessary. I have by me a number of quotations from various pamphlets which have been showered upon us with reference to this proposal. I shall not quote from them at length. But the fact stands out that South Australia is doubtful as to whether she will give her consent unless she gets the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge that she wants, and the route which she prefers. In the correspondence is a. declaration by South Australia that she will not consent to the construction of the  railway  until she is satisfied about the gauge and the route. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend must think that he is talking to a party of babies ! Consent to the survey ! Of course South Australia consents to the survey. Would my honorable friend consent if I offered him ,£20,000? But if I laid down the condition that he should give me £[40,000 next week I do not suppose that he would take the offer. Naturally South Australia consents to the survey, but at the same time she insists upon having control of, and a voice in, the determination of the route and the gauge. We may spend our £[20,000, but we cannot go further without the consent of South Australia. It may be said that Tasmania's share of that sum is under £[1,000 - about £[900 to be correct. But if we spend this money it will be absolutely pitched away. The survey may result in proving that the country is better than some of us suppose, and that the prospects of the railway are brighter than we think. But if South Australia does not get her own way in the matter of the route and the gauge, she will simply shrug her shoulders and say, " Well, you have spent your £[20,000 with' your eyes open, knowing  that  we insist on having the route and the gauge determined to suit us. We shall not agree to your going any f further unless our wishes are met in those respects." Can I sit silent and see the citizens of my State exploited even to the extent of £[900 on a proposal of this sort? </para>

                            <para>- I wish to point out that in order to give effect to the implied promise of which we hear so much, there is a way to meet my honorable friends from Western Australia. But I am so absolutely disgusted with their repeating time after time that there is an implied promise, that I am almost loath to point out the way. Here is an Act which Western Australia has put upon her statute-book, and which makes no reference to an implied promise. I will quote from it in order that honorable senators may see the position in which the Federal Parliament is placed owing to statements - I will not say untruthful statements - but statements which are absolutely contrary to the fact. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> based the whole of his case upon this point. He said that he knew as a fact that the feeling in Western Australia and in the Commonwealth generally was that Western Australia on entering the Federation would get this railway. But there is absolutely nothing in the point. I cannot find language to express what I feel about such a statement as that. This railway was never mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, or bv any one of the representatives of Australia during the whole of the three sessions of the Convention. The idea of Western Australia wanting anything was never mentioned when the words about railway construction were put in the Constitution. </para>

                                Largie asks me what was said by certain leading Federalists who were hospitably treated, and probably feted in Western Australia. Perhaps they gave expression at the conclusion of some banquet to a belief that Federation would sooner or later bring about the construction of a railway connecting the east with the west ; but what right have my honorable friends to talk of that as an implied promise?

                            <para>- What right have they to use that as an argument? It is most mi unfair to argue in that way, and I go so far as to say that I think it is insufferable cant. Advocates of this proposal have used that argument again and again, and have thrown it at the heads of those who are opposed to the construction of the railway as showing that they are un-Federal, local and provincial; that they are not treating the p.,0;le of Western Australia fairly in not giving effect to the views expressed in these after-dinner speeches by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and other people. What makes me speak so strongly and so earnestly on the point is that I find in the Western Australian Act a most improper recital to which T direct the attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. If the Goernment, of which the honorable senator is a member, had a particle of respect for themselves, they would not have submitted this Bill until the Act to which  T  refer was removed from the statute-book of Western Australia. This is the Act in which the Vice-President of the Executive Council informs us Western Australia has shown her <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> in the matter, and this is the way in which it is shown - </para>

                    <para class="block">I think that the Western Australian Parliament, in adopting such a preamble, has treated the Commonwealth unfairly and unjustly. Those who drew it up, as well as those who passed it, knew that the words used were objectionable. They knew that Western Australia had not entered into Federation on the faith of any promise that the railway referred to would be constructed bv the Federal Government. It is true that they had every reason to believe that Federation would help it along. I have frequently said that the construction of the proposed line is first of all a. matter for the States concerned, as they would benefit enormously by it. Western Australia would derive untold benefit and riches from the line. I admit that to some extent it is a Federal matter, and, to that extent, in view, of the need of defence, and because the Commonwealth might once in a half-a-century require to use the line for military purposes, I should be perfectly willing to assent to the Commonwealth giving a subsidy in connexion with its construction. I have placed myself in no attitude of unjust opposition to Western Australia. I have always said that we should treat this matter as one in which the Commonwealth is interested, but that it is primarily a State matter. If we were to construct this line, we should be expected to expend  -£5.000,000  on its construction, whilst the two States particularly interested would reap the entire benefit. The whole of the wages paid would go to the people of those States. The material required would pass through them, and their railways would get the benefit of that traffic. The better the land opened up, the more it would be settled by their citizens and farmers and taxpayers. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it would. We cannot build 1,100 miles of railway and spend £[5,000,000 without doing some good. I point out that there is a way in which we might meet Western Australia in the matter, and that is by giving the people of that State a liberal mail subsidy, an-.l a subsidy in addition on account of whatever advantages would accrue to the Commonwealth from the construction of the line. If, for instance, the railway were to cost £[5,000,000, the Federal Government might consent to pay interest on £[1,000,000 of the amount. That would amount to £[30,000 or £[35,000, and we might give a mail subsidy in addition. Would that be an unfair proposal ? Would it not be considering the undertaking as both a State and a Federal matter? I should be wanting in common sense were I to pretend for one moment that the benefits that would accrue to the States of Western Australia and South Australia from the construction of the proposed railway would not outweigh the indirect benefit to the Commonwealth. From the first the attempt to make this a Federal matter has been a great mistake. It is most unfair to the other States, who have paid for their own railway construction. I do not believe that for the next twenty-five years our railways in Tasmania will pay the whole of the interest on the cost of their construction. We have constructed only 437 miles of railway, and we are here being asked to build 475 miles for one State and 625 miles for another. Is there any fairness about that ? If honorable senators will look at the debates of the Convention, they will find that the one idea in giving the Commonwealth the power to construct rn]ways was that it might be necessary for purposes of defence that railways should be constructed here and there. But to relieve Western Australia and South Australia of their obligation to construct their own railways, to make exceptions of those States, ar.el make the other States of the Commonwealth, whose railways do not pay, contribute to the construction of a railway in Western Australia, where the States rail ways are returning a surplus revenue of over £[280,000 a year, is monstrous. I feel' very indignant that, 'because I honestly and firmly oppose the proposed line, and give my reasons for doing so, I should be accused of failing to display a Federal spirit, and of being untrue to the real principle of Ff deration. If we are to go on in this way, there may be no end to these demand.? upon the Federal Treasury. If the people of any State require the construction of a very large public work, and cannot undertake it themselves, all they will have to do wil be to start the cry that it is unfederal for the Commonwealth to refuse to undertake the work and carry it through. When  I  visited that historic place, Port Darwin, it struck me that from a defence point of view the construction of this railway is not nearly so important a matter as the connexion by rail of Port Darwin with some of the settled districts of the Commonwealth. I say without fear of contradiction that if we asked, as I think we should, a committee of naval and military experts for their opinion on the matter, they would tell us that the transcontinental railway which should be first built is not that to which this Bill refers, but a line to connect Port Darwin, which is a more important place, with some of the settled districts and the trunk lines of Australia. The one argument which the advocates of the Western Australian line can urge is that it is required for purposes of defence. But I find that in the last paragraph of his report on the subject Major-General  J.  Bevan- Edwards says most distinctly that for purposes of defence the railway would be of very little use for some years to come, simply because we have not an army to transport. </para>

                            <para>- Major-General  J.  Bevan-Edwards speaks in his report of railways to Port Darwin and other transcontinental railways, mentioning first the  former. So that even on the question of defence, the Commonwealth is only very indirectly interested in this matter. It must be admitted that, for the next fifteen years, we are not likely to be faced with any difficulties of defence. Germany, with all the progress she is making, is not likely to reach the standard of Great Britain during that time. We can anticipate no very great disturbance, and there is, therefore, no hurry for any of these railways. But there is an urgent necessity for inquiring most fully and completely into the requirements of every part of Australia, and for getting naval and military experts to tell us which is the transcontinental railway which should be first built. I intended moving in this matter, but I find that my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> has given notice of an amendment, which I think should receive the careful attention and thought of every member of the Senate. The proposed agreement for the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth should certainly be considered in connexion with this question. If we are bound to take over the Northern Territory merely for purposes of defence, and to populate the North ns  President  Roosevelt has advised us to do, it would be a fatal mistake if, led by the representatives of Western Australia, we were in the meantime to commit ourselves to the building of a railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, if there is another line which ought to be built first. I hope that the proposed survey of this line will show that the country is better than we think it is. I have a number of quotations which show that it is merely a miserable waterless desert, but I hope it will be found to be better than we at present suppose. I hope that mineral deposits will be discovered on the route, although I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, in his diary, stated that such deposits were likely to be found on lv at about 150 miles east of Kalgoorlie/ </para>

                            <para>- He insisted that this should be made a Federal matter, and that all the States should shoulder the obligation of constructing the railway. He held that Federation would be a sham and a farce without it, and he went on in the same breath to say that he would have nothing to do with the pooling of revenue, and nothing to do with the <inline font-style="italic">-per capita</inline> system; the Western Australian revenue was too great in comparison with that of the other States for that. What he desired was a true Federation with regard to the transcontinental railway, and a sham Federation with regard to Commonwealth revenue and expenditure. What are we to think of statesmen who ask us to spend Commonwealth money under these conditions? In the absence of the Vice-President of the Executive Council I point out to the Minister of Home Affairs that the only justification which the Government of which he is a member could offer for taking up this proposal would be a determination to insist that we shall have a Federal revenue and a Federal purse. But Premier Daglish does not go into that point. He will not listen to Federation so far as regards his revenue or his great wealth. Why cannot <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie make a Socialist of him ? Why cannot he build his own railway? Why cannot he give us a little of Western Australia's surplus wealth to help us to run our own lines? It appears to me. that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Premier</inline> Daglish is not a good Socialist or a good Labour man, and is a precious bad and selfish Federalist. </para>

                            <para>- I wish he would rub a little Federal paint on. I asked the Vice-President of the Executive Council what the meaning was of the twenty-five miles of land being reserved on each side of the line, but he did not appear to know. I have a recollection of reading somewhere that the land was to be set apart, and that if it was sold the money was to go into a fund to indemnify us all against loss. I believe that is somewhere in writing, but I cannot find it in the papers I have. It is all of a piece with the improper way in which this matter has been brought forward. Ought we not to know something about this reservation of land, and what kind of guarantee there will be to save the Commonwealth from loss? We have it in the papers before us that when Western Australia learned that South Australia objected to the project on financial grounds, thinking it too bold a venture, and that she could not afford it, almost the very next hour the. Premier of Western Australia telegraphed that if South Australia would only consent, Western Australia would guarantee her against loss for ten years. What is meant in the recent correspondence is that if the railway is built by the Federal Government, whatever share South Australia lias to pay of the loss, the Government of Western Australia will make up. That is very generous and fair, but is it legal ? Is Western Australia going to guarantee one State against loss? Surely, seeing the position of the Tasmanian railways, if any State ought to be guaranteed against loss, it is Tasmania. Our position regarding railways is the worst in the Commonwealth. It must be so, because we have only 180,000 people, we have a small island, and honorable senators all know how mountainous a great part of it is. Our railways have cost £[7,000 or £[8,000 a mile, and we are now losing £[80,000 a year on £[4,000,006, or exactly 2 per cent. The two States of South Australia and Western Australia ought to provide safeguards before a penny of this £[20,000 is spent. I shall endeavour, so far as I can, to get the States to see that none of the money is spent until South Australia has given her consent by Act of Parliament - until she has unreservedly placed herself in the hands of the Federal Parliament. I shall also make it my duty to endeavour to see that none of the money is spent until the matter has been submitted to the High Court. It will be a bad day for Federation if we allow party politics, and political opportunism, and all those features which degrade public life, to be brought into play to enable  some  men to push a thing through Parliament in this way, thrusting on one side all constitutional, legal, and moral difficulties, and in the last resort getting their own way simply on account of their persistence, power, and influence, and this wretched system of party government. I shall not say that I wish my honorable friends joy of their £[20,000 if they get it. If they do get it, I hope it will be spent to good advantage, and that it will show that the country is better than some of us think it is. Every estimate we have had, no matter how skilful the railway experts may be, is simply guesswork. I do not think that any set of railway experts in the world can estimate what that railway will cost to build, what it will cost to maintain, and what it will earn. It is simply impossible to do so. I have a note of a  Tittle  railway in Victoria, not many miles away, of which the cost of construction, and the expenses of working were double the estimate, but I am happy to say that the receipts were more than double the estimate. Nobody can possibly foresee what will happen after a railway has been constructed across this waterless country. I am glad to hear that some part of it is not- a desert, but it certainly is waterless. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish first of all to express regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> was not able to discuss the survey of this railway without dragging in the Queensland sugar bounty. I may take an opportunity, at a later date, to refer more fully to that question, but at present I would point out to the honorable senator that Australia as a whole has adopted a protectionist policy. A certain duty has been put upon sugar, as upon other articles, and that duty is imposed as part of the protectionist policy. The bounty is -right inside the duty. It is raised by means of Excise paid by the sugar producers, to whom that Excise is paid back again in the shape of a bounty. When the proper time arrives, I shall be prepared to show that the people of Australia as a whole are not paying more for sugar now than before Federation. </para>

Another argument that has been brought forward <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam,</inline> is  that  a promise that the railway would be constructed, was definitely made to Western Australia as an inducement to her to join the Federation. That statement is incorrect. Only once before Federation can I find that any leading Australian statesman urged the people of Western Australia to vote for Federation by  holding  out to them a pious hope that they would be connected by rail with the rest of Australia. That was in a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> who was not Prime Minister, and not then likely to be. I fail to see that any honorable senator is bound by statements made at that time by an irresponsible individual. </para>

                    <para class="block">The significant part of that is the concluding words of the last sentence "when we can agree with our friends to join us on the border." The difficulty seems to be that South Australia would never definitely consent to the building of the line. What <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest said at the Convention was, in effect, " We will build the line when our friends will meet us on the border." That has been the whole trouble from beginning to end. To quote expressions of opinion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> and other South Australians as being binding on the rest of Australia is simply to use arguments put forward to stave off Western Australia as reasons why Australia generally should pay for building the line. To show that Western Australia looks upon South Australia as blocking the way, Western Australia is prepared to guarantee the loss on her portion of the line, and has even offered to guarantee the loss on the South Australian portion. It appears that Western Australia has done everything she possibly and reasonably could do to induce South Australia to join her in connecting the two railway systems, but the fact that she has not been able to persuade South Australia to do so is no argument why Queensland or any of the other eastern States should as a matter of course, join in and do what South Australia has refused to do. We have been told that many promises have been made to Western Australia, but promises have also been made to other States. We may all hope that this undertaking will be carried out at some date, whether by the Federal Government or bv the States combined, and we hope to see Western Australia connected eventually bv rail with the eastern States. But other States have also had promises made to them which have not yet been carried out, and which possibly may be in the dim vista of the future. N&gt;\v South Wales has a written compact in the Constitution as to the Capital Site, but that agreement has not been carried out, so far, either in the letter or the spirit. Tasmania has had certain promises made in connexion with her revenues, and those promises have not been carried out, so that Tasmania feels herself reasonably aggrieved over it. Queensland was promised marvellous markets for her manufactures, and all sorts of other advantages, yet we find as the result of Federation - I am not going to say that we could have expected anything else, because personally I was not very keen on Federation - that for the three years after the first two years of Federation the production of Queensland manufacturers decreased at the rate of  £1,000,000  a year, as compared with the three years before Federation. Western Australia may reasonably claim sympathetic consideration for this proposal, but her senators must understand that while we are perfectly prepared to extend to them any amount of sympathy, we must at the same time regard the matter from the point of view of how it will affect our own States, and consider whether we are under any real or serious obligation to pass this survey. We are told that we are only asked to sanction a survey. X ask honorable senators to think over the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> and see if it does not contain almost nothing but an argument in favour of the construction of the railway. It has been stated over and over again that an honorable senator who votes for the survey of a route will be morally bound, should a favorable report be received, to vote for the construction of the railway. T hold that view. If I vote for the survey of a route, and it should be found that there will be a fair chance of the railway paying in the dim and distant future - and it is urged that it will pay in about ten years - then I should feel compelled to vote for its construction when proposed. There have been laid before us a large number of reports concerning the country to be traversed, including reports bv eminent explorers, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. To some of them I do not pay very" much attention, but we. know that an immense quantity of information about the route appears to be available. If it is available, then it is obvious that the survey cannot be a mere exploration survey. It must be intended to precede the construction of the railway- Amongst the reports which have not been placed before honorable senators - unless, of course, they were submitted in  a  previous Parliament - is a report to the </para>

However., nothing but disaster met their enterprise, and they were forced to absolutely abandon highly improved stations, properties, and buildings to the winds.

                            <para>- They may be worse, but I am not discussing that point now. When Queensland asks the Commonwealth to construct a railway through her territory it will be time enough to discuss the quality of her land. If it is a fact that immense areas of these plains have been sold to an English company, the mere throwing up of the improvements does not revest the land in the Government. </para>

                            <para>- That may be correct. I merely mentioned the statement as it appeared in the letter. If the land has been sold, as the writer states, then the Government of the State concerned should have laid the information before this Parliament. The position is very much complicated by the fact that South Australia has not yet given her consent. I take it, however, that the Government of the Commonwealth will not attempt to spend any portion of this vote until definite consent has been given by that State. I desire to refer to the provisional agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australia for the transfer of the Northern Territory. The price of taking over the Northern Territory and developing it by railways appears to include, amongst other things, the consent of South Australia to allow the Commonwealth to proceed with the construction of the proposed railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. It seems to me that there is a danger that we may be paying two prices. First of all, in order to get the Northern Territory, we shall have to agree to build a railway therein, and then we shall have to ask to be allowed to build a railway to Western Australia. In other words, before we have gone very far, we shall find ourselves tied up with two agreements, and each agreement will involve the construction of an expensive railway. The people of Queensland are not in a position to contribute to an expenditure of £8, 000,000 or £10,000,000 for the construction of two railways, one from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, and the other from Oodnadatta, or some other point to Pine Creek. It is very regrettable that the question of the consent of South Australia to the survey and construction of a railway through her territory towards Western Australia should have been mixed up. with the agreement to transfer the Northern Territory. Reference has been made to the necessity of building a railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie from a defence point of view. But the arguments used in its support have entirely ignored the fact that it wi,U not affect the defence of that part of Western Australia which is bound to be open to danger. Major-General Edwards has pointed out that what is required to defend Australia are two railways, namely, one to connect Perth with Eastern Australia, and the other to connect Port Darwin with Eastern Australia. But Major-General Hutton, in his report, pointed out that it is from the people of the East that danger is to be feared. I venture to suggest that everyone will agree with me when I mention that the danger from that quarter is to be feared at Port Darwin, Wyndham, and along the north and north-west coast of Western Australia and not at Perth. It has also been urged that a Federal spirit should induce us to agree to this survey. Speaking at Perth in July,  1900, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> F'orrest advocated that this line should be constructed in order to prevent Port Darwin becoming the gate of Australia.  His  trouble, then, was not that Western Australia should be connected with the eastern States as a matter of Federal spirit- </para>

                            <para>- Only that it is against the Standing Orders, I could quote a speech in which it is stated that it was <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest who stood in the way of Western Australia entering the Federation;, but afterwards he declared that it was the danger of Perth losing the trade of the eastern States, and Port Darwin becoming the gate of Australia which made him urge the construction of the railway. During my short experience in the Senate, it has struck me as a most remarkable fact that when any State wants a thing for which it ought to pay, its representatives invariably trot out the Federal spirit, and appeal to every one to regard the proposal entirely from an Australian point of view. It would be better if we were to drop talking about the Federal spirit, and to recognise that we are all actuated by a desire to do what we believe to be best for Australia as a whole. It has also been said, of course, that the country to be traversed by the railway is entirely undeveloped. That may be perfectly true, but I hold that it is not the business of the Commonwealth to explore or develop country which belongs to any States and .which those States cannot explore or develop on their own account. If a State finds it is unable or unwilling to proceed with the development of a portion of its area, it will have the opportunity of offering it to the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth can then treat the country as a Territory, and develop it by constructing a railway or by other means, as it may think fit. The time will come when that Territory will be populated and developed, and it will be erected into a State. That, I think, is the legitimate way in which the Commonwealth should construct railways to develop unexplored or undeveloped parts of States. The States own the lands, and upon the manner in which the lands are held and their resources developed will largely depend the success of a railway. Australia is now asked to be responsible for the construction of a railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. The land which it will serve is in the hands of two States. If those States mismanage the land, and the railway does not pay in consequence of such mismanagement, who will bear the loss ? It will be borne, not by the two States concerned, but by the Commonwealth, comprising States that have no voice in the management of the land. Before we decide to construct a railway - the construction of a military railway is provided for in the Constitution - to develop or explore land, we should certainly have the control of the land. If that portion of Australia which it is proposed to traverse with this railway were created into a  Territory the Commonwealth would have control of the land, and if it were mismanaged, or the railway did not pay, it would have to bear the loss. I am not in favour of any proposal which is likely to lead to the institution of a new railway department. We have in existence six Railway Departments, and the creation of a seventh would not only add to the general cost of government throughout the Commonwealth, but also lead to a large number of questions being raised in each House of this Parliament which would divert the attention of its members from those large national questions which they had been sent here to consider. I have drawn an analogy between the Northern Territory and the country with which this Bill is concerned. I strongly urge honorable senators to consider seriously the question whether it is wise for the Commonwealth to enter upon this new business of developing territory belonging to States instead of asking those States first of all to place the land to be traversed by the railway in the hands of the Commonwealth, so that we can treat it as a Territory, and, later on, when suitable conditions are created, convert it into a State. For such a purpose, we might take the country lying between the 125th and the 1:33rd lines of longitude and the 26th parallel of latitude down to the coast. We are told that that country is a barren waste or a sandy desert, upon which there is no settlement. I have discovered upon the map one place where there is water. It is called Boundary Dam. And it is well worth remarking that when you have such a dam marked in the middle of country which is not at present occupied, it is a fair inference that the loss of such territory would not be a hardship to Western Australia in any way. I think that the area of Western Australia is 625,000,000 acres. To sever this portion from her territory would be to take a mere flea-bite. So far as South Australia! is concerned, it would still leave that State with a territory larger than New South Wales. If what I recommend were done, there would be a reasonable chance of developing the territory if it is capable of being developed - and there would be some justification for constructing the railway. For the reasons that I have given, I beg to move - </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to say a few words as to the reasons which will actuate me in giving a vote in favour of the proposed survey. In doing so, however, I wish' emphatically to express my opinion that I shall not be necessarily bound, even morally, to vote in favour of the railway itself. I shall vote for the survey because I believe that, prior to Federation, Western Australia took every legitimate step to gauge the feeling existing in the States as to linking her territory with the rest of the Commonwealth by railway. I believe that Western Australia would not have come into the Federation unless she had believed that she would be connected by railway with the other States. I recognise that at the present Western Australia . is in exactly the same position as New Zealand. While a distance of 1,200 miles or over separates the Commonwealth from </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">New Zealand, there is a distance of over 1,000 miles of sea between South Australia and Perth and Fremantle, which are the principal ports of Western Australia. Looking at the master from a purely business point of view, New Zealand acted quite rightly in her own interest in not entering the Federation. Western Australia was in almost exactly the same position. She knew that she had to sacrifice much in determining to enter Federation, but she also realized that there was a possibility of becoming linked with the other States of Australia. I can come to no other conclusion than that Western Australia did enter the Federation in the belief that she would thereby become connected by railway with the eastern States, and that consequently we should have a Federation in reality. I believe that we should, as soon as possible, carry out that obligation. I take it that, after consenting to the survey, and assuming that the survey is favorable, we shall be willing to do our part in linking together the States. I do not say that I shall give my vote in favour of spending the large sum of money that will be necessary for the building of the railway, or bind myself to any conditions except such as are equitable. But we are bound to consider favorably any proposal that is made for constructing the line under conditions which are in keeping with what Western Australia has a right to expect from the fact that she entered the Federation in the expectation that the railway would be built. I have a good deal of sympathy with the Tasmanian representatives with regard to th'e position in which their State is placed in reference to her share of the expense. So sincerely do I feel for Tasmania, that, as I have said on previous  occasions, I believe that the people of Australia and their representatives would be inclined to consider favorably her financial position, and to meet her claims. It is impossible to ignore the fact that Tasmania has suffered materially in financial matters, and that she has a strong, claim to special assistance. Therefore, I should be inclined to take a generous view of her position. </para>

                    <para class="block">Federation. I believe I am correct in saying that during the last six years there has been a marked advance in that State in all that pertains to the well-being of a community. I had the pleasure last week of reading the half-yearly returns of statistics for the State, and I was glad to note a very satisfactory increase in the number of her flocks and herds, and in the production of cereal crops. The general advance that has been made leads me to believe that the people of the gold-fields, whilst remaining an important factor, do not now exercise the dominating influence which they did. With the exception of the manufacturing industry, the agricultural, and every other local industry have made great advances since the establishment of Federation. The fact that the manufacturing industry of the State does not show a like advance, is due to one of the effects of Federation, which has been attended by similar results in all the smaller States. I put it to honorable senators to say whether, in view of the present position of Western Australia, and the possibilities of further development before that State, the difficulty of finding £20,000 is one of so much importance to her people as some honorable senators would suggest. I venture the opinion that if that were all that was necessary, Western Australia could provide the £20,000 without trouble and without inconvenience. -But I gather that in this matter there is a distinct principle involved ; that the people of Western Australia indulged anticipations concerning the construction of the proposed railway, which had very considerable influence in inducing them to consent to that State joining the Federation. It is, of course, important to us that we should know the character df the country through which the proposed railway would pass, and the expense likely to be incurred in its construction, but in these times the cost of construction would not be the total bar to the building of the line by the State which it would probably 'have been in years gone by. I think I may safely affirm that the difficulties in the way of the construction of that line are such as have been frequently overcome in other countries, and could be overcome by Western Australia. We can all recollect the difficulties which were anticipated in connexion with the construction of the railway from the eastern States of the United States to San Francisco - of the railway connecting the United States with the Canadian Dominion, and the line connecting Eastern </para>
                    <para class="block">Canada with the State of Columbia. There were many prophets who foretold that those railways could not be built owing to the enormous cost that would be involved in their construction. I believe that the proposed railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie might be constructed within the estimate of £[5,000,000 which has been referred to. As I am not an expert in railway construction, my opinion on that point may not perhaps be worth, much, but I have gone into the figures, and I believe that if the construction was carried out in a business-like fashion, it would not cost more than the estimate stated. </para>

                            <para>- L venture further to assert that within ten years of its construction, the revenue to be derived from that railway would be sufficient to cover working expenses. I need not go into details, because most of the members of the Senate have had quite a sufficient dose of this subject, but the development of Western Australia since Federation, the possibilities of the future development of that State, of the State of South Australia, and of the Commonwealth as a. whole, and the fact that it- is not likely that the line could be completed in less than five or six years, lead me to believe that there would be a much heavier traffic over the line at the close of the period mentioned than the engineers have allowed for in making their estimate of revenue. I see no reason why, if the construction of the line were undertaken in a business-like way, it should not be built for an amount within the estimate, and I believe the Commonwealth would, within the ten years specified, have in connexion with that railway a credit, and not a debit account. I believe there would be no difficulty in getting a syndicate to build and take over the railway on reasonable terms. However, as the question of the defence of Australia is involved in the matter, I think it would be very unwise for Western Australia or South Australia to enter into any arrangement for the construction of the line by a syndicate. I find it hard to believe that, with the general advance of Australia, and in view of the policy of immigration which has been foreshadowed, there would not within fifteen years from the present time be sufficient traffic between Western Australia and South Australia to cover working expenses and maintenance. For these reasons, and without committing myself to support the construction of the line except on conditions I consider equitable, I have very much pleasure in stating that I intend to vote for the second reading of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not know that there is very much in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray's</inline> argument with respect to the building of American and Canadian transcontinental railways. We know that they were built purely by the concession of land grants and large subsidies to private companies, who undertook their construction. That is not the way in which we have built our railways in Australia. When I entered the Senate first, I" had not pledged myself on this question to the electors of Queensland. On different platforms I was asked whether I was in favour of the construction of the line, and I gave the answer that I had not sufficient information on the question to pledge myself one way or the other. When I entered the Senate, I tried to get information concerning it. Some honorable senators from Western Australia said, " If you wait until the debate on the second reading of the Survey Bill comes on, we shall be able to give you sufficient information to satisfy you that it is a very reasonable proposal." While waiting for the debate, I secured all the reports furnished' to Parliament in connexion with the matter. . I looked into them, and I must say that I failed to see anything reasonable in the proposal. While it might be a very good thing for one State, it did not appear to me to be fair to ask the other States of Australia to bear the burden. With respect to the promises said to have been given by prominent men prior to Federation, I can only say that there was nothing in them. Nothing was said in Queensland on the subject, and no one in that State held out a promise of support for the construction of the line as an inducement to Western Australia to join the Federation; for the simple reason that Queensland was. not represented at' the Convention, and had no say in the matter. The people of that State have a perfectly free hand in dealing with this question. It is not usual for the people of Australia to look upon the promises of public men as being worth very much until they assume a-practical shape in the form of legislation. Promises have been made by public men throughout Australia as to what they would do if they got the opportunity, and many of them have left public life before those promises which they held out as a bait to others have been  fulfilled. I do not know that' Australia is going to be bound by the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder, or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> said to the people of Western Australia, " If you join the Federation in all probability you will get some help in the construction of this railway." Possibly the people of Western Australia have been expecting altogether too much from the Federation. In the first or second session of the Federal Parliament, representatives of Western Australia, in another place wished to invoke the power of the Commonwealth to compel the State Government of Western Australia to construct certain railways within the boundaries of that State. They thought that the State Government was doing something which was against the best interests of the Commonwealth, and they asked that the influence of the Federation should be' exercised to compel the State Government to adopt a certain course. They made out a. good, case, and that, is why I was interested in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> said to-day about, the- Esperance Bay railway. Some time last year there was handed to me a report of what took place on that occasion. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr..

                    <para class="block">Figures given in this document show the distance that would be saved by the construction of the Esperance line as compared with the existing railway from the goldfields to Fremantle. The distance from Adelaide to Esperance is 836 miles. From Adelaide to Fremantle is 1,36b miles, or a difference of 524 miles. A railway from Esperance to Kalgoorlie would be 220 miles long, while the existing line from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle is 386 miles. One of the arguments put forward for the Esperance line was the expense of travelling and length of time occupied both for passengers and goods on the line to Fremantle. As indicating the saving that would be effected to the people of the goldfields, they showed that the first class single fare from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle was <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> 2s. 3d., while to Esperance it would be <inline font-style="italic">j£i</inline> 17s. 3d., or a saving of 25s. on a single ticket. It was shown also that the saving would be <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 18s. 6d. on a first class return ticket, 15s. 8d. on a second class single ticket, and <inline font-style="italic">j£i</inline> 3s. 6d. on a second class return ticket. The figures given in this document include the freights for live stock and produce. They show that there would be a saving of £[8 17 s. 5d. on the carriage of 6 tons of produce in the different classes on the line to Esperance, as compared with the existing line to Fremantle. That railway has now been started a few miles further down than where it was then proposed to start it. Seeing that when that line is completed the journey will be. considerably shortened and freights and fares so much lowered,_ it seems to me that we shall have very little return from the construction of 1,100 miles of railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. We are practically asked by this Bill to go on with the construction of the line, because the expense of the survey will really be added to the cost of construction, and, therefore, can be called part of it. Unless we are prepared to say that we can afford to construct the line, it is absolutely useless for us to throw away £[20,000 on the survey. , I have a pamphlet issued by the Western Australian Government, containing all the statements, or alleged statements, made regarding promises. That aspect of the matter has been dealt with by a number of honorable senators, and I do not wish to go over it again.

                        <para>I can quite understand that before the Parliament of South Australia would be prepared to agree to the building of the line they would require to be assured of two things - the route to be taken and the gauge to be adopted for the railway. The route is a most important consideration for the State of South Australia, because if the line goes in one direction it will be of very little use to the State, whilst if it goes in another direction it will be of no use. If the line does not traverse the mineral country in South Australia, it will not be of much use to that State as it will Be if it is taken by way of Tarcoola, and thus opens up the mineral country. If, on the. other hand, it is decided that the line shall be built on the 4 ft. 8£ in. gauge, South Australia might very well say " No, thank you," because that would mean the alteration of the existing gauge from Port Augusta, and the State of South Australia could not afford to make that alteration. </para>

Not only that, but my personal feeling is so strong that when I have an opportunity I shall bring this question before the people of South Australia in a very concrete shape. My views are thoroughly well known there, but the question has not been put as an issue to the people of South Australia. Their feeling is against the construction of the line ; and that feeling has been intensified lately by what has happened in connexion with the Northern Territory. </para>

                            <para>- No. So far as South Australia is concerned, the Commonwealth is to be at liberty to spend £[20,000 in making a survey of the country, but it is to remain with that State to say whether it will agree to the construction of the line or not. I do not think it is fair to expect the other States to contribute towards the cost of an exploratory survey in South Australia or Western Australia. They have all had to bear the cost of opening up their own territories, and it is only reasonable to ask that South Australia and Western Australia, if they wish to ascertain the nature of the country, should defray the cost of a survey; if they think that that would not be satisfactory to the Commonwealth, let them give a guarantee to bear the cost between them, and allow the Commonwealth to make the survey. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that the bounty was given because it was recognised that the coloured alien was a menace to Australia, and that it was better to have our industries carried on with white labour. I do not know whether there is a question of coloured labour connected with the proposed survey. I do not know whether the representatives of Western Australia contemplate that it shall be carried out with coloured labour. But in the case of any industry which they like to establish in that State I believe that I can promise that they shall have the solid support of the Queensland representatives in extending to it the same treatment as has been extended to the sugar industry. </para>

                        <para>It will thus be seen that, in all cases, the cost by the overland route will be less than by the ocean liners, even on basis of present rates, and still more so on basis of proposed rates; and, although there is the fact that, in most cases, the cost by intercolonial steamers would be less than by the overland route at existing railway rates, and in one case at proposed railway rates, there is also the fact that a very large number of persons now go backwards and forwards by the ocean liners - probably to save time - although they could go cheaper by the intercolonial steamers, and, that being so, it is probable that they would go by overland railway, when it is made, as that would be, not alone quicker, but also cheaper than by ocean liners. </para>

                    <para class="block">But the rates mentioned are not .at all in accordance with the rates now charged by the steam-boats on .every portion of the Australian coast when the steam-ship companies have to compete with the railways. It seems to be assumed that passenger rates would be considerably less by train .than by boat. Take the journey from Melbourne to Brisbane, and back. It costs £12 for a return ticket, in addition to which the passenger pays £2 10s. for sleeping berths. It will cost him nearly £1 for incidental expenses, making the total cost of this journey about £15 ios. The heaviest traffic on- any long-distance line in Australia is. I suppose, on that between Sydney and Melbourne, which are our two largest centres. The distance between Melbourne and Brisbane is about 1,300 miles. Now, take the cost of travelling by boat. The steam-ship companies issue a' return ticket from Brisbane to Melbourne and back for £7 ios., for which they feed the passenger, and enable him to live on board two days in Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- That is the point.. We are asked to believe that the railways will carry passengers at considerably lower rates than the steam-boats will do, whereas in other parts of Australia the reverse is the case. If the steam-boats have to compete for passenger traffic between 'Melbourne and Western Australia, they will' lower their fares. At present one can .go by boat from Sydney to Brisbane for £3. and sometimes for less. There is not a great deal of time lost in going by boat. The one journey occupies .2 7 J hours, and the other from 38 to 40 hours. The bulk of the passenger traffic is by boat .rather than by rail, although the railway runs through fairly good country. I am sorry that I have &gt;not the last report  of  the Queensland railways, but I think it is a fact that the line running from Gowrie Junction to Wallangarra, which has been in existence for eighteen years, does not pay. Yet that line Tuns through splendid country. It touches such places as Clifton, Warwick, and Stanthorpe, where there are hundreds of tons of stuff to be shifted, and where the main line is fed by a number of branch lines. Some time ago, it -was paying 1 per cent, on the cost of construction. </para>

                            <para>- I have already explained that there is an estimate of a total loss of £680,000, which is at the rate of £68,106 for each year of the ten years' period. The estimate further shows at the close of that period a profit over working expenses and interest of £23,564 a year. We have had some very valuable experience in the working of the line between Sydney and Brisbane. We were told that that line would pay within four or five years from the time it was completed. It. was constructed in sections, and when the Queensland sections from Toowoomba to the border of New South Wales at Wallangarra were being submitted, we were told that unless those sections were pushed on with the State would, lose money on the line. It was said that all that was wanted was to secure the connecting link with the New South Wales railways, and a revenue would follow which would recoup Queensland for all the losses suffered in making the connexion. The through line has been in existence now for eighteen years, and it is not paying yet. </para>

The line between Brisbane and Sydney, of which I . speak, was built in sections over good country that was well known, and on which there was a considerable amount of settlement before the line was constructed. Is there any settlement along the route of the line under consideration which would induce us to believe that it "would pay to run a line through that country? </para>

                            <para>- It was not greatly increased on that account. A very great deal of the land through which the line runs was held under lease, and it did not cost much fo resume it. Some of the land being held under freehold had of course to be paid for when it was resumed. At the same time, the railway was not a very expensive one to construct, and it has since its construction been very considerably improved. My point is that the country through which it runs was good enough to induce people to settle upon it before it was supplied with railway communication. That speaks highly of the character of the land. Does it speak well for the character of the country through which this proposed line is to be built, that while men have been hunting all over Australia for the last twenty years for good pastoral land, all who have prospected this country and taken it up for pastoral purposes have gone down ? </para>

The natives evidently obtain their water supply from the mallee and other roots, numerous heaps of which are to be seen lying about, and a blackfellow will not, I believe, have recourse to these roots if he can obtain water within anything like a reasonable distance. </para>

                            <para>- No, but Mr. Muir points out that in the creek to which he referred there had, in his opinion, been very little water for ten years. If he is telling us lies we cannot help it. He was an official sent out by the Government of Western Australia to report, and, if possible, to put the best side of the Western Australian case before this Parliament. Speaking of the geological formation of the country, he says - " There are no hills of any magnitude, no lakes, and very few water-courses." </para>

                    <para>We know that where there is any reasonable rainfall there are water-courses to be found. In the north and west of Queensland there are to be seen' the channels of fairly large rivers. There may be no water in them at certain times, but there is evidence that large volumes of water flow down those river channels periodically. It might be once in six months or once in twelve months, but there are the watercourses, giving evidence that volumes of water have cut their way through the country. </para>

                            <para>- Western Australia does not want to prove it - at least, not at her own expense. If that country is so good, and I am not saying that it is not, plenty of people will be found ready to spend money in prospecting for water. There are hundreds of bores put down in Western Queensland by lease-holders. I admit that at the start the Queensland Government put down two or three trial bores, and proved that water existed. If" the Western Australian Government did the same thing, and proved that there was a water supply that could be depended upon, they would be able to get this country taken up. That would be the best evidence they could possibly submit to this Parliament, that it was a country with which railway communication should be established. The whole of the argument is that this piece of country exists which their own people are not able to say is good enough to-day for settlers to take up, although land has been taken up from one end of Australia to the other. Would  people have gone to the north-west of Australia if there had been available good land in the south, near to shipping, with facilities for getting their wool and other produce away cheaply and regularly ? The position at present is that those who have gone into the north-west of Australia have their big market in the southern part of Australia. They have to send all their stock down south to find a market. If this land within a couple of hundred miles of  the big  gest market in Western Australia is not thought good enough to be taken up by people who are looking for land every day, it is not fair to ask the Senate to call upon the people of Australia to bear the expense of proving that country in order to enable Western Australia to do ' something with it. The Western Australian Government at last thought fit to send a man' out to see if water could be got. A report was furnished by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H</inline> . C. Castilla on boring operations for water along the proposed route. He says - </para>

In the face of reports such as this, submitted by men who have been sent out specially to gather this information, we are entitled to ask why the Western Australian and South Australian Governments are not prepared to spend their own money to secure information, more calculated to convince the members of this Parliament, that it is necessary to spend Commonwealth money on this railway. I have a report sent in by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gwynneth,</inline> who acted as Secretary to the Engineers-in-Chief of the -various States during their inquiry into this question. </para>

                    <para>SenarorTURLEY. - I do not know anything about him personally ; but he referred in his report to other reports furnished to the Western Australian Government. I gather from them that the route recommended by. the Engineers-in-Chief would not only be very expensive, but would require a considerable amount of money to keep it clear, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gwynneth</inline> says, of shifting sands. That gentleman evidently knows something about the country. He states that the route recommended by the Engineers-in-Chief is the longest they could find. It is 65 miles longer than the route he recommends below the Gawler Range. When we find ourselves in a position like this, knowing that it rests altogether with the South Australian Government to say, " Unless you build the most expensive line possible, we shall not have anything to do with it; we shall not give our consent to its construction, and you cannot build it without our consent," it should make us pause before we go any further. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> dealt with the project from the point of view of defence, and gave the gist of Major-General Hutton's report to the Minister of Defence on the proposed line from a defence point of view. The whole question appears to be whether we can enter upon an expenditure of , £5,000,000 in connexion with a project to transfer a number of troops which we do not yet possess. Would it not be a long way better for us to secure the troops first? It is useless to make provision for transporting an army which we have not got. If we spend money first to get the troops, the representatives of Western . Australia will be able with far greater weight to argue, "You have in eastern Australia a large number of troops that we may require at some time to defend this part of the Continent, and you should help us to build a railway over which they can be carried. " Major-General Hutton's report shows that the money, to the expenditure of which we are asked to commit ourselves, could be far better spent in training our people to defend the country. </para>

                            <para>- I should still object to the Commonwealth bearing the whole cost of constructing the railway. At the present time, the Federal Government are in this position, that if they want to send troops from any part of Australia, they can simply take control of the State railways, and run them to the objective. If we take any part of the coast line exactly the same argument can be brought forward as is advanced in support of this railway project. For instance, the people on the north-west coast can say, " It is necessary to have the means of bringing troops here in case we should have to defend this part of the Commonwealth." </para>

                            <para>- That is not a sound argument for asking the Commonwealth to raise £150,000,000 or £200,000,000 with the object of running out a railway to every part of the coast. I do not think it is in the best interests of Australia to entertain the suggestion. From <inline font-style="italic">Coghdan,</inline> I propose to quote a few figures to show the position Queensland has been in for some years in regard to her railways. The cost of construction to the end of 1903-4 was £20,887,000. On that capital expenditure there had been an annual net <inline font-style="italic">loss</inline> ranging from 2.67 to 1.35 per cent, during a period of five years. Practically, the State had lost annually very nearly 2 per cent, on an investment of over £20,000,000 during a period of five years. </para>

                            <para>- In my opinion South Australia is rather anxious to get the burden off its own shoulders. I do not think that it has been owing to mismanagement that the railway in the Northern Territory has been losing at the rate of from 3 to 6 per cent, on the capital cost ever. since it was constructed. Up to the period I named, Western Australia had expended on her railways £[8,955,000. </para>

                            <para>- I a.m talking about the railways in one State on which there has been an annual loss of from £[300,000 to £[400,000, and -of the railways in another State on which there has been a clear annual gain of from .07 to 2.29 per cent, for the five years ending 1903-4. Yet the State which has been making an enormous profit on its railways comes down to the Federal Government and says, " We are not prepared to pay even £[20,000 to get information regarding the country through which we want a railway, but we desire those States which have been losing hundreds of thousands a year on their railways to come in and pay their share, not only of the cost of making a survey, but also of the cost of constructing the railway." It is preposterous to ask the people of Australia to agree to .a proposal of that kind. The Governments of Western Australia and South Australia can hand over the money to the Federal Government and ask them to carry out the survey of a route if they are not prepared to accept the statements of their own officers. Why should they ask the people of the States who are paying large sums annually to keep their railways running to contribute not on 1.v to the cost of a survey but also to the construction of the railway, especially as Western Australia is regarded to-day as practically the richest State in the Commonwealth? I came here with a clear and open mind on this question, but at the present time I am strongly opposed to the Federal Government carrying out a survey, and anything I can do to prevent the Bill from being passed I shall cheerfully do. </para>

                                (Tasmania) [9.2:1]. - I did not intend to intervene in the debate, but as one or two honorable senators have touched on the military aspect of the railway, I feel to a certain extent called upon to express my views on that point. I need hardly say that as regards the proposal being a practical undertaking, the bottom has been knocked out of it completely by Senators Turley and Givens.

                            <para>N- From the stand-point of a practical man, I do not think that ir had. The statement that from a military point of view Western Australia should be brought into communication with . the eastern States, appeals to me. But I ask honorable senators to give that aspect a little more attention than it has hitherto received, and to realize what we are asked to do. We are asked to undertake the construction of a railway from Port Augusta, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Eucla, to Kalgoorlie. Every honorable senator who has paid attention to recent events in the East must realize that a naval power, if it has the command of the sea, and is able to deliver an attack, has the option of selecting the point of attack. The isolation of Western Australia presupposes the fact that we have lost the command of the sea. If that be so, I ask honorable senators, in all seriousness, to think over what this project means. It is practically a proposal to run a railway alongside the coast, and having lost the command of the sea we should be absolutely in the same position then as now. After having constructed the railway, our weak point would be at Eucla, which would be cut, when the western State would be separated from the eastern States, and we should 'be as helpless as we were before. </para>

As we have the command of the sea, the present is not the time to waste money over such a project. </para>

That means that Western Australia would be entirely cut off. I ask honorable senators to consider the nature of the country around Eucla. Wa have had a clear exposition to-night that that country is absolutely unable to support either animals or human beings. Everything would have to be transported, .. because we could get. nothing on the spot, and how far should we have to transport things? We should have to transport our requirements 400 or 500 miles from Port Augusta, which would be under the whip of the enemy. What could we expect to get from Western Australia? </para>

If it be necessary in the interests of Australia to construct a strategical railway to connect Western Australia with the eastern States, it must be constructed at a distance from the coast, so that there shall be nothing to impede the transport of troops. </para>

                        <para>. - I was very pleased indeed to hear the various statements made for and against the proposal .to survey a route. It has been ably advocated, and just as ably denounced. No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest has been the prime mover in getting the project advanced to its present stage. In his report he speaks very unfavorably indeed of the country to be traversed. ' I agree with the last  speaker  that if we were once to lose the command of the sea, a land force could cut the railway at a short distance from the coast, and that then we should be worse off than if we had no railway. I maintain that if the railway is constructed by the Commonwealth, and an enemy is able to take Western Australia, we shall have provided a means for them to come over to the eastern States. How would it have been during the Boer war if there had been no railway into Johannesburg and Pretoria? We know that the line to each place was destroyed, but the troops repaired the permanent way nearly as rapidly as the men could travel, and all the munitions of war and food supplies were transported by that means. How would aru enemy get over to this side of the Commonwealth from Western Australia if we had no railway? I. do not believe that there is an army which could march over the t. .100 miles of country which has been described to us as a waterless, desert. If, however, it is as: good as the advocates- of the Bill have said,  1  am surprised that* the spirit of adventure which is so conspicuous in Western Australia has. not led to. the occupation and use of the country.  </para>

                    <para class="block">In parts of Queensland there is grass, but no water for stock. But country of that kind has been made available for settlement by putting down bores. The Government of the State showed the people how water was to be obtained on the table-lands, and then private enterprise came along, leased- the land from the Crown, put down bores, and put stock upon the properties. Why does not Western Australia follow that example? In Queensland we have spent millions of money in building railways. Year after year we have had a loss on them. But we do not come cap in hand to the Federal Government asking it to bear, the loss for us. We are surveying railways now, and I am perfectly satisfied that the Queensland Government is prepared at any time to meet the wishes of the Commonwealth and to allow a railway to be made to the Queensland border connecting with Western Australia. We already have - a line built to a distance of four or five hundred miles in that direction, and I am satisfied that there would be no obstacle to carrying that line right to the border. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> has said, if that were done there would be no hope for any enemy invading this country unless he fought his way in from the coast. Surely Western Australia, with her vast mineral wealth-, should not ask the Commonwealth to pay £20,000 for the purposes of such a survey as is proposed, in view of the fact that other States have carried out extensive railway works for the good of the country at their own expense. I should be very sorry to think that Western Australia, and South Australia were so impoverished as to be unable to undertake this work. Even if we spend the money, what guarantee shall we have that £20,000 will be sufficient? For my own part, I am satisfied that at least £30,000 will be required. I cannot understand the position of those honorable senators who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> say that they will vote- for the Bill although they are opposed to the consTruction of the railway. </para>

                            <para>- But we know what they really want. If they do not mean what I have stated, the proposal is a farce. The aim and object is to get the railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta built at the Commonwealth expense. If they are satisfied that the survey will prove that the railway will be a success, why do they not prove their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> by handing over  £20,000  to the Commonwealth for the purposes of the survey ?It is all very well to say that this is a national question, and that we should approach it in a Federal spirit, but I notice that a number of honorable senators do not approach other questions in such a spirit. I am quite sure that if Queensland asked the Commonwealth to build a railway, or survey a line, for its benefit, many of those honorable senators who are now supporting this Bill would be the strongest opponents of the project. In fact, I should vote against it myself, because I do not believe in the principle. </para>

                            <para>- About  400  or  500  miles. I have spoken about it to members of the Queensland Government and Parliament, who have told me that they were quite prepared to support a proposal to build a line to the border without asking the Commonwealth for any money for the purpose. That is a very fair offer indeed. But how such a bare-faced proposal as that now before us can be. made, surpasses my comprehension. We are told that the line will traverse splendid land, where there is plenty of grass for stock, and that where there is grass there must be water. People who make a statement like that cannot have travelled over very much of Australia. Men accustomed to the bush know perfectly well that there are hundreds of places where you can feed stock, but where you have toto  50  or  60  miles to get water. There are in Australia what are called grass  Tains,  which are quite sufficient to make the grass grow, but not sufficient in basalt or 'limestone country to provide supplies of water. Country of that kind is of no use for stock unless surface water can be obtained, or artesian bores can be successfully put down. Now, as to the arrangement under which Western Australia entered the Federation, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobsonhas</inline> toldus,  as a  member of the Convention, that no promise was either given or implied that this railway would be built. It is quite true that certain prominent statesmen expressed the opinion that there should be a transcontinental railway, but they had no power to pledge the Commonwealth. The present Prime Minister has entered into an agreement with the Premier of South Australia with reference to the Northern Territory. But does any one imagine for a moment that the people of Australia are bound to carry out that agreement because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has made it ? </para>

No individual, no matter what his position may be in the Commonwealth, has power to bind any Parliament. To say, therefore, that promises made by public men with reference to the transcontinental railway ought to bind this Parliament 'is absurd. Queensland was not even represented when fee promises were made. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that any State gave its representatives power (to enter into an understanding that Commonwealth money would be voted for making railways in  any State.  If  certain men  chose in an open-handed manner to make large promises in the course of after-dinner speeches, when they were in a nice mood, that is no reason why we should spend millions of pounds to carry out their pledges. I heard a Minister of the Crown say the other day, when asked a Question about a statement made at a banquet, "You  cannot expect me to remember what I said then." I acknowledge no moral obligation such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> says exists. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator who interjects would be the last to contend that a promise made under such conditions was binding on this Parliament. He has got out of some tight corners in his time. There may have been a moral obligation on him to do something, but no doubt he saw a way round the corner and escaped. Queensland, at any rate, has made no promise, and is under no obligation. The State which the honorable senator represents will not even undertake to give permission for the construction of the railway; within its borders. So far as this Parliament is concerned, we have not a particle of evidence that if we voted the £20,000 to-morrow South Australia would allow the survey to be made. In spite of that, we are asked to pass this Bill, and take everything on trust. Would any man in conducting his own business make an agreement of that sort? Would he guarantee to spend £20,000 on a certain work without knowing whether some other person, who had the right to refuse, would permit him to spend it or not? </para>

                            <para>- I am 'very glad to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> admit that this is only an instalment.  I believe that the honorable senator is going to vote for the second reading of the Bill, and we now have his assurance that in voting for the expenditure of this £20,000 he expects to have to sanction the expenditure of the other £4,500,000 or £5,000,000 later on. During the last forty-five years, I have known a number of railways to be built, and the estimates of their cost were not worth the paper on which they were written. The engineer's ' estimates for railway lines have been exceeded times out of number, but when Parliament has been committed to the construction of a section of a line it has always been claimed that it must go on with the work. An en- gineer-in-chief  and a number of experts in Tasmania estimated only the other day that a job that was to be undertaken in the city of Hobart would cost £80,000. The gentleman who has estimated the cost of this railway at £4,500,000 has admitted that, his estimate is, of course, liable to modification, but in the case of the. job in Hobart, to which I refer, engineers certified that if it were carried out according to the specifications, it could be done for £80,000, and done well. But what happened ? The authorities concerned had to come to the State Parliament, and ask for power to borrow another £100,000 for the work. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know" whether it was a " job " in the sense the honorable senator suggests, but my point is that reputable engineers certified that a certain work "in the city of Hobart would cost only £80,000, and would consequently, require the levy of ai certain rate to pay for it. It is now found that it will cost more than double the amount estimated, and the unfortunate ratepayers who took the word of the experts will be called upon to pay the double rate. </para>

                            <para>- I have known the State Government of Queensland to lay plans on the table for the construction of a line, not of 1,100 miles, but of a section of 50 or 60 miles - the line referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> from Warwick to Wallangarra. We were informed that there could be no doubt but that the line would pay. It has five or six feeders, and amongst them the Killarney line, which joins the main line at Warwick, and goes through some of the finest land in the dis- trice, and yet the line has never paid. We have been told that the proposed railway to Western Australia will pay. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> dealt fully with that matter. If we consider the passenger traffic from Brisbane to Sydney, or even from Sydney to Melbourne, we must know that for every passenger who goes by train ten go bywater. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> said that he would prefer to go the 1,100 miles by rail to Western Australia, I do not know whether the honorable senator has ever travelled 1,100 miles by rail through desert country. South Australia will not consent to the construction of this line unless it is built on a 3 ft. 6 in. gauge, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> would certainly find a journey of 1,100 miles on a railway of that gauge a very long and wearisome one. I am afraid that he would find also that he would not get to his destination very much sooner by that means than he would by some of the new steam-boats on our coast. We have a turbine boat something like the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> running now between Brisbane and Townsville at 15 to 16 knots an hour. But through passengers from the north by that boat do not often get out at Gladstone to finish the journey by train, and sometimes when they do those who have remained on the boat reach Brisbane before them.  With respect to the probable traffic on the proposed ' railway, I should like some honorable senator to tell me any product, with the exception of gold-bars or bullion, that it would pay to bring by railway from Western Australia to Adelaide. It must be remembered that the only traffic would be that between the termini in the two States of South Australia and Western Australia, since there is no settlement along the route of the line, and I ask honorable senators from Western Australia to say what produce would be brought from Kalgoorlie that could pay railway freight to  Adelaide alone. </para>

Honorable senators from Western Australia have been calling out about the sugar bounty a great many times to-night, and I may inform them that we in Queensland have to bring the mails to their door, and as far as Sydney, and have afterwards to pay separately to bring our own mails to Brisbane. Is there anything of the Federal spirit about that ? </para>

I. am sorry to hear the honorable senator speak in that way, because he must know that towards the subsidy paid by the Commonwealth for bringing the mails from the Old Country to Australia Western Australia pays her share and no more according to population, and according to population also Queensland pays one-eighth of the total sum, whatever it is. We have iri addition to that to pay £2'I,000 every year to have our Queensland mails brought from Sydney to Brisbane. Western Australia gets the benefit of the calling of the mail-boats at Fremantle and along her coast without extra payment. That I suppose is done as a matter of Federal spirit. But they do not offer to help Queensland. They do not offer to bear any share of the extra amount which the people of that State have to pay, and which they object to pay. They are called upon to pay £21,000 to have then-emails carried from Sydney to Brisbane. Here we have a proposal for the expenditure of £20,000, and two great' </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators from Western Australia were willing that that State should pay a share of the cost of subsidizing a line of steamers to carry the European mails, knowing that the boats must go as far as Sydney, but when it was suggested that Queensland, as a part of the Common wealth, should have the benefit of the service, we heard nothing of the Federal spirit which some honorable senators wish to see exhibited now. We were told that if the mail steamers were to go on to Brisbane they could not complete the voyage within the contract time, but when the contract was finally settled it was found that the mail-boats could go on to Brisbane within the time to take the mails to and" from that port, and any freight that might be offering for an extra subsidy of £21,000 a year. Queensland has to pay that extra amount, and now honorable senators from Western Australia come here, and without a blush of shame ask us to help them to pay £20,000 for a survey of a route for the proposed transcontinental railway. </para>

                            <para>- That has been stated so often that it is hardly worth while repeating it. None of the advocates qf this railway will tell us that we have the right to build it. They do not say what freight they expect to be carried on the line when it is constructed, and if they gave that information they might convert me and secure my vote for the proposal. I will not vote for it until I know what products are to be carried on the line. I want something more than a bare statement by some gentleman that the population will be doubled in ten years and the line paying. That sort of thing is only clap-trap. The man who made that statement brought forward no proofs. The whole thing is only in his own imagination. That report was brought up to order. It is just the same when a Government want to construct a certain line to which they know there will be strong opposition. They send out surveyors with certain instructions, and the report is all in favour of the project. Honorable senators on the other side are advocating this proposal, whether it is right or wrong. They can only see one side of it. I know that railways have cost £20,000 or £30,000 more than the estimate. I have known curves to have to be taken out after a line  has been made, thus doubling the cost of construction. Experts can be obtained to make any assertion, and to bring down reports favorable to any scheme. I have seen prospectuses of gold mines issued by experts, and once the  shares have .been taken up by the public, the expert cannot be found, nor- can any truth be discovered in his. report, although to read it one would believe that, one only had to go to the mine and pick up the gold. ' We can get the same sort of reports about railways. Most of the reports now before us are simply the opinions of individuals. If South Australia and Western Australia want us to pay a share of this expenditure, let them first prove to us that- they are genuine. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that this country is uninhabitable and waterless. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest states that he went miles and miles without finding a drop of water. It is because I believe the reports that I object to this expenditure: I believe also what I read in the paper the other day from a man who signed his name, and stated that he traversed the country with camels. He showed that the country is simply not worth taking up. If this land is as good as certain honorable senators would have us believe, why are people going away thousands of miles from, the coast in the West to take up country which is not so good as the coastal country in Queensland? It is simply because they must have country of some sort. Why are men leaving Victoria and New South Wales to take up country in Queensland', when there is in this district, in a much cooler zone, such splendid country quite as near to them as Queensland ? If that country is so good, how is it that nobody is willing to take it up, or that those who did lost their all upon it, abandoning it as waterless country- which they could do nothing with ? Let the Western Australian Government prove the country, just as Queensland proved that water could be got on her tablelands. Queensland did not ask the other States to help in that work, but put her hand in her pocket, and sunk three or four bores: Artesian water was proved' to exist there, and the country was made available. That work 'cost a good deal more than £20,060. Let Western Australia spend £20,000 to prove this country. If it is anything, like it is said to- be, Western Australia.- will soon get  a  big revenue from- it. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest's report', which honorable senators received to-day, tells us that there is good grass, but  no  water. I am sure the right honorable gentleman knows what that means. A shower will soak into the earth, and forty-eight hours afterwards there will be no sign of it, but it will bring up a good spring of grass. That grass does not live long-, and is no good. Stock cannot live on grass without water. ' <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest himself has stated that the country is not fit to be stocked. He is a far-seeing man, and if the . land was available for stocking, being so near the gold-fields, where cattle bring a high price, he and others connected with him would have taken- it up and proved that it would carry stock if there had been  a'  possible chance of it paying. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose it was applied for in the expectation that £20,000 or £30,060 would be spent in surveying it. We  can.  draw our own conclusions from that fact. This project has been in the air for several years, and there is_ an impression now that it will be carried this session. There will be a long fight before it is carried, but those people think there is a prospect of Commonwealth money being spent to open up the country, and' that they may get somebody else to buy the land from thom. That  sort  of thing is often done by people who take up country in the hope of getting rid of it  at a  profit. There are men in New South Wales, and even  in Queensland, who pay others to prospect for likely country.- Why do not people go out to prospect this land between Adelaide and Perth when we are told time after time that it is so good? We  heaT  that those who have gone there to settle and rear' stock had to desert it for want of water. It is not right for the Government to ask us to vote this sum. I believe the Bill was defeated last year: </para>

                            <para>- If the Western Australian Government will find the money and send men out to make a survey, I will believe their report. I am not going to vote blindly like the honorable senator. I should have been glad to support the Bill if I could have seen my way to do so in fairness to the State I represent, but I cannot for two reasons. One is that I honestly believe that this is only the thin edge of the wedge, and that if I supported it, I should be in honour bound to support the Bill for the construction of the line if the report was favorable. Several honorable senators have said that they will support the survey, but not the construction, because they do not think it would pay through that country. I do not see why they should support one and not the other. If I could honestly support the survey, I should feel bound to support the construction, but I cannot support either, because it is not right or just for Western Australia and South Australia to ask the other States to put their hands in their pockets to prospect this country for them. </para>
