Pairing is arranged for the convenience of honorable senators, and is not taken cognizance of by the Senate.

With great respect to you, sir, I point out that in the Imperial Parr liament, under a long established custom, - pairs are not recognised. We have no long established custom, but only Standing Orders to guide us. I have investigated the code, and I see no rule which prevents me from raising, as a matter of privilege, the question, not of a dispute as to a pair, but of a written alteration of a record which has the effect of misrepresenting me. </para>

            <para>- Order ! I cannot allow the matter to be pursued any further in this way. I have given my ruling. It may be quite true that in the Standing Orders there is no rule dealing with the question of pairs, but where they are silent, there must be some authority in the Senate to act, and that authority is placed in the Chair. I consider that it is my duty to give a ruling on a question of this kind. The Senate would be fed into all sorts of strange by-ways at different times if a  President  were not in the position to take the responsibility of giving a ruling. I rule that this is not a matter which can be raised by the honorable senator as a question of privilege. </para>

If he only wishes to make a personal explanation, and it is to be devoid of personal remarks, and this is the first opportunity he has had to do so, I shall not prevent him from proceeding, but I shall not accept a motion of privilege or allow him  to refer to an honorable senator as having done anything which may be considered to be improper. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel NEILD</inline>(New South Wales) &#91;2.41&#93;.- I thank the Senate. It was a physical impossibility for me to be present when the division on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl&#39;s</inline> amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bounties Bill was taken, and, therefore, I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> to effect a pair. I understand that he made an arrangement for a pair with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> That pair was entered in the pair book, and duly chronicled in the press. The daily newspapers represent the pair as having been made between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> and myself. Senators Walker and Trenwith are present, and can contradict me if I make an inaccurate -statement. The pair was chronicled in the press, but is not chronicled in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Another senator&#39;s name has been substituted for my name in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record, and as the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters are not able to make any statement on the subject, it is only just and proper that I should say that they have followed an alteration in the pair book which records the pair. I do not say who made the alteration. I am informed as to who made it, but following your ruling, sir, I do not wish to mention the name. I do not say whose handwriting I recognise in the alteration, but I dare say that it can be recognised by any honorable senator who looks at the pair book. I makethis statement to put myself right, and also to put the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters right, because it is a remarkablethingthat a pair duly recorded in the press should be unduly recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I think it would be an advantage to some extent - perhaps I should be trespassing beyond a personal explanation if I were to express an opinion on the matter, and, therefore, I refrain. I wish to put myself right, and to have a statement in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to show that as a representative of the people I was not careless in respect of the division on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl&#39;s</inline> amendment, which practically was the only division taken in connexion with the second reading of the Bounties Bill. I thank the Senate for giving me an opportunity to&#34; make this explanation. </para>

          <para>- There is a standing order that prevents the discussion of certain amendments in Committee, but there are a number of amendments which may be moved. Two or three motions of a general character may be moved, the first two of which represent an absolute stoppage of proceedings in Committee, such as the amendment that I submit proposes to effect. The fact that certain  rules are provided that specific motions cannot be discussed clearly leaves every other form of motion open to discussion. According to the old legal aphorism expressio <inline font-style="italic">unius exclusio alterius-</inline> the fact that the Standing Orders provide that certain motions may not be discussed leaves open to discussion all other motions that are otherwise in order. Clearly I can move this amendment in any circumstances. The only possible question that arises is whether it can be discussed. I submit with the greatest confidence that &#39; you, sir, would not attempt to add to the rules provided for the conduct of our business another rule that does not exist. Such a ruling would be in absolute opposition to our Standing Orders. </para>

I also rule the amendment out of order because motions which can be moved in Committee, other than motions dealing with matters referred to the Committee, are set out in standing orders 267-8-9 in explicit terms. They provide facilities for honorable senators to move that the  Chairman  report progress for the purpose of superseding the Committee and enabling the Senate to deal with any such expressions of opinion as are covered by the proposed amendment.

            <para>- I submit for your consideration, sir, as I have already done for the consideration of the  Chairman  of Committees, that while standing order 269 provides that certain motions may besubmitted, but cannot be discussed, it is absolutely silent as to other forms of&#39; motions that may be moved in Committee. I point out that these are forms which, intimes past, have been used for the purposeof obstruction in Committee; not in this. Chamber, of course, but elsewhere. Surely it will not be contended for a. moment by any rational person that, because the Standing Orders provide that three forms of motion in Committee cannot be discussed, therefore no other form of motion shall be discussed. If that wereso, &#39; no form of motion could be discussed in Committee. I submit that the wellknown rule of interpretation, <inline font-style="italic">expressio unius exclusio alterius,</inline> clearly covers thisground. Your legal training and experience, sir, will convince you that I am submitting a reasonable proposition. With respect to the other standing orders towhich the  Chairman  has referred, I submit that standing order 251 has absolutelynothing whatever to do with the question. It provides that - </para>

            <para>-  The motion I have submitted is in the nature of an amendment, which does not ask the Committee to consider anything except the proposal to adjourn the proceedings until a specific time for certain reasons that are given. It may be said that because there is a reference in the amendment to certain sums of money, the Committee is necessarily asked to consider the amounts referred to. That is not so, because those amounts are included, not as matters &#39; for consideration by the Committee, but merely in order to show, that there is a rational basis for the amendment. Standing order 267 is simply an authority for the moving of one class of motion. I doubt very much if we have a standing order &#39;authorizing the motion of dissent from the Chairman&#39;s ruling, and the reference to the  President,  and yet that is one of our practices found necessary in the conduct of business. </para>

            <para>-  But there is no procedure provided in that standing order, and no authorization, except in the most indirect manner. As to standing order 267, I direct attention to the fact that it is repeated and included in standing order 269, and as a matter of fact is without virtue or validity, and need not appear amongst our Standing Orders at all ; standing order 269 providing all. that is necessary, and for .more than is provided by standing order 267. Standing order 268 is utterly inapplicable to the amendment I have moved, because it provides for something that I have not moved. I do not know whether I should be in order in taking any notice of interjections, but one was made which may possibly have reached your ear. I may be doing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> an injustice in attributing it to him, but certainly it was made by some honorable senator, and it was to the effect that the amendment I have submitted is one which would have been appropriate on the second (reading. </para>

            <para>-  I am glad that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has pleaded guilty, because it puts me quite in .order in pointing out that I &#39; wished to move this amendment on the second reading, and should have done so had not the form of an amendment previously submitted rendered that course impossible. I do not know that it is necessary&#39; that I should labour the matter in any way. I have pointed out briefly that standing order 251 does not apply in this case, inasmuch as there is no application to the Committee to consider anything. The amendment is that the Committee should cease consideration of the Bill, and not that- it should consider something new. Standing order 251 cannot be strictly applied, as in Committee we move all kinds of amendments which are not provided for in our Standing Orders, and are not included in any order of reference from the Senate to the Committee. I have pointed out that standing order 267 is covered by standing order 269, and it is therefore unnecessary to consider it; that standing order 268 has nothing to do with the question, and that standing order 269 provides only that three forms of. motion in Committee are not open to debate - necessarily leaving open for debate all other forms of motion. On the question of economy of time, which might- be considered to bear to some extent on the matter, I point out that everything that could be said in one speech on the amendment I submitted might be repeated in detail on every item in the schedule. There is therefore nothing to be gained by what I .regard as a far too strict interpretation of &#34;fEe Standing Orders, because, even if your ruling is against me, I can still say everything I might have said on my proposed amendment, on any of the items in the schedule. I submit that the Standing Orders do not bear the singularly strict and restricted construction placed upon them by the  Chairman. </para>

            <para>-  I submit that we cannot ignore the fact that we all had knowledge in Committee that the Tariff, which, perhaps, is improperly referred to in the amendment, had already been tabled in another place. The Senate had full knowledge of that fact when it ordered the Committee to consider this Bill. The honorable senator&#39;s amendment is to the effect that the Committee should say that it considers it inexpedient to consider the Bill. I submit that it is not within the discretion of the Committee to say anything of the kind ; that inasmuch as the Senate assented to the principle of the Bill when it was read a second time, the clear, duty, of the Committee is to consider its details. Suppose that the amendment were in order, and that ultimately the Bill were reported ; what the Senate would then .do would be to refer the Bill back to the Committee, with a request to do their duty, and that is to consider its details. The clauses of the  Bill have been passed by the Committee, and the details  of the schedule cannot furnish a reason for a refusal to proceed with their consideration. While I admit that the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> might have been relevant to the motion for the second reading of the Bill, I submit that it is not relevant to the proposal to grant a bounty upon the production of New Zealand flax. Clearly, it is a proposal which touches the Bill as a whole, and not an amendment which is relevant to that item. On all these grounds I submit that the Chairman&#39;s ruling was, correct. </para>

            <para>-  Having listened to the discussion I am more convinced than ever that the point I raised in Committee is sound. The Tariff has not yet been submitted to the Senate, and if this amendment were accepted it would enable every honorable senator to discuss any item in the Tariff. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> might have quoted the figures correctly when he submitted his amendment. He knows very well that the Bill provides for a total expenditure of .&#163;412,000, but in his amendment he asserts that it involves an expenditure of &#163;1,500,000. By no stretch of imagination can I come to any other conclusion than that the amendment is entirely foreign to the Bill, and that if it could be moved in respect of the item &#34; flax,&#34; it could be moved in respect of the last item in the schedule. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Neild</inline>has pointed out to the Senate that had it been possible he would probably have moved an amendment of this character to the motion for the second reading of the Bill. There was standing in his way an amendment which had to be put, and when it was negatived that prevented him from submitting the motion which he has submitted in Committee to-day. There is no question that if it could have been submitted then and carried it would have delayed the passage of the Bill until the other matter referred to had been dealt with. The Senate, however, affirmed the principle of the Bill by agreeing to the motion for its second reading, and under standing order 251 the duty of the Committee was to -  consider such matters only as shall have been referred to it by the Senate. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Those matters were the provisions contained within the four corners of the Bill as it was read a second time. It was impossible for the Committee to consider any other question, and it was essential that every amendment which an honorable senator might desire to offer should be relevant to the clause or schedule under consideration. It cannot be said that the .amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is in any way relevant to the item before the Committee. It was submitted because, to use the honorable senator&#39;s own words, it is inexpedient to proceed with the consideration of the Bounties Bill, proposing an expenditure of upwards of ^1,000,000, and involving taxation to the extent of &#163;4,500,000, until the Tariff now before Parliament has been finally dealt with. The amendment, if. carried, would have the effect of postponing the consideration of the Bill until that event. It cannot be said to be rele vant to a proposal to grant a bounty upon the production of New Zealand flax. Then the honorable senator raises a further question with regard to motions under standing orders 267 and 268, which have been quoted, and argues that the mere mentioning of certain motions does not prevent any other motion from being submitted. I point out to the honorable senator that the very maxim he alluded to, <inline font-style="italic">expressio unius exclusio alterius,</inline> is really against him, because the Senate, by its Standing Orders, has specified certain motions which may be submitted in Committee, and, according to my reading of that maxim, it exhausted the power of the Committee with regard to motions for the purpose of getting the  Chairman  out of the chair, and so getting rid of a Bill. I consider that the ruling of the  Chairman  of Committees was strictly correct, and that the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel Neild</inline> was not in order. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel NEILD</inline>(New South Wales) &#91;3.4&#176;&#93;- - Last night I was addressing the Committee on the subject of New Zealand flax, and. I quoted very briefly indeed from the evidence of three witnesses before a Select Committee of the New Zealand Parliament. If I remember aright there were only fourteen witnesses, but I only quoted, very briefly, from the evidence of three witnesses. In compliance with a suggestion of the leader of the Senate last night I discontinued my remarks in order that he or somebody on his behalf might move that progress be reported. Of course, I am aware that in Committee, where a senator can speak as often as he likes, it is not necessary to ask permission to continue one&#39;s speech on another day. Therefore I am not continuing my few remarks of last night, but beginning again. I propose to quote a few more extracts from the evidence of a very competent witness - apparently the most competent witness&#34; procurable in New Zealand - with the object of showing that the proposal to pay a bounty <inline font-style="italic">of &#163;z&#176;&#62;00&#176;</inline> upon the production of New Zealand flax, at the  Tate  of .&#163;3,000 per annum for ten years, is highly inexpedient. In the interests of the taxpayers, and particularly in the interest of those who, by reason of dangling this golden bait of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3&#176;&#62;000</inline> before the&#39; eyes of some of the most industrious and worth\ citizens of the Commonwealth, will be induced, in ignorance, to &#39;abandon useful avenues of employment and industry and attempt to achieve the gathering Tn of this bounty bauble to their own detriment, because of the certain failure which will pursue them, I point out that the money for the bounties will have to be raised by taxation. Inferentially I submit that if one of the methods of taxation by which the money is to be obtained takes the form of an impost on Barbed wire, fencing wire, or wirenetting, we shall simply be robbing Peter to pay Paul - taking the money out of the pockets of agriculturists under the pretence of giving it back to them in the form of a bounty. The schedule to this Bill involves an expenditure of ,&#163;533,000 in the course of fifteen years. Under the Constitution it is necessary for the Commonwealth to raise 15s. to return to the States, for every 5s. that it spends. We shall, therefore, have to tax the people to exactly four times the extent of the money required to pay these bounties. Four times &#163;533,000 means &#163;2,132,000. This is a proposition that staggers me, and if it does not stagger other honorable senators I can only say that they entertain ideas of public finance of such a character that I humbly submit that the Senate is not the proper field for their ambitions. In order to inveigle a few people into growing a patch of New Zealand flax we contemplate taxing; the whole&#39; Commonwealth to the tune of. &#163;120,000 a year. The proposition is extraordinary. In order to raise this sum it is proposed to place duties on almost everything that a man, woman, or child eats) drinks, or wears. </para>

            <para>- I do not think that the honorable senator is doing justice to his own reputation in making such a statement. To raise the money for this beautiful industry it is even proposed, to put a duty of 40  Der  cent, on teething, necklets for poor little babies. Even the suckling is to be penalized. The old people are to shiver at night for want of blankets because the honorable senator is willing to increase the price by one-third in order to raise money for these wretched bounties. Referring to an interjection made several1 times last night, I beg to state, for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> information, on the strength of a telegram just received from the Premier of New. South&#39; Wales, that Dooley has not won. Last night I made some quotations, from the evidence of witnesses who gave evidence before the Select Committee appointed in New Zealand concerning the growth of New Zealand flax. Ohe of them, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frost,</inline> pointed out the effect of cutting New Zealand flax in the winter.. The witness showed the necessity of providing first-class instructors for the growers, to show them how to prepare their seed, for instance. It is no use inducing people to invest in an industry in connexion with which first-class expert knowledge is; required in planting with any hope of fruition. As far as South Australia is concerned, my honorable friend opposite ought to know that the only part of that State, where it would be possible with success to- cultivate New Zealand flax would be upon the flat patches in the Mount Gambier district. </para>

            <para>- But it is being put to better use than to grow New Zealand flax at 13s. 6d. per ton. I was wrong in restricting myself to the Mount Gambier district because on portions of the flats along the River Murray New Zealand flax can &#34;be grown. On the other hand, it is now proposed, by a system of locking, to throw a lot of those swamp lands under water, and so they will not be available. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frost,</inline> speaking on behalf of the Association which he represented before the Committee, said - </para>

          <para>Then I come to the scale under which flax is graded. The most serious complaint against it is the range. We consider that 14 points is too great a range for one particular quality. That I think, is the most serious difficulty, and I believe has been the cause of more serious deterioration than anything else. I sold a lot the other day of 73 point flax, and I said to the grader- &#34; That is no use to me; I do not want it. Sixtythree does for me, the price being the same.&#34; I am ashamed when I look into the sheds at Auckland and see the flax. </para>

That is the industry which the nation of Australia is asked to undertake  - a  nation that does not possess  a  defence force capable of defending any corner of its territory for half-an-hour. It is proposed to waste  &#163;45,000,  and to tax the people to the tune of &#163;180,000, in order to attempt to conduct in the Commonwealth  a  business that, after thirty-five years of experience,  5  seriously on the. down grade in New Zealand, where the plant is a natural weed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frost</inline> proceeds - </para>

        <para>We certainly think that the range in the &#34;f.a.Q.&#34; class wants amending. I certainly do not believe in having two &#34;fairs&#34; such as from 65 to 70. I said to a merchant in discussing the point on Monday, &#34; I can get <inline font-style="italic">&#163;24</inline> for 63 points and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;24</inline> for 73.&#34; We would sooner have only a five-point range. If it is &#34; fair,&#34; it is &#34; fair,&#34; and we shall get the same for it. It is similar to a farmer having, we will say, cocksfoot. He shows his sample and says,. &#34; I have given you so-and-so.&#34; Another man has got machine-dressed, and he gets no more. He does not machine . again. It is the same with the flax. We do not want 73 points; we do not want 70. Sixty-three is quite good enough for me. We do not want the higher points. We are fighting against it, but it is forced upon us. </para>
        <para>I urge upon the Committee the undesirableness of inducing the taxpayers to enter into an undertaking of such an intricate character. I will undertake to say that there is no member in the Federal Parliament, and no official in the employ of the </para>
        <para>Government in any part of the Commonwealth who can tell any better than I can the difference between 63 and 73 point flax. If the people enter into this industry they may laboriously attempt a higher grade instead of a more useful grade of an ordinary character which will give them a larger return and an equally good price. </para>

        <quote>
          <para>I refer to one or two points that have come before the Committee. The first is regarding rejected flax, arid I think the view of the Chamber of Commerce is that all flax should be allowed to find its proper, market. There is no objection even to the worst grades going out of the Colony as long as they are branded according to the grade. For instance, flax is required for all sorts of purposes - for mixing with manilla, making binder twine, ropes, lashings, &#38;c. And the stuff we at the present time are refusing to allow out of the Colony can find a good market in the United Kingdom, Australia, and elsewhere, .and it can do no possible injury to the trade as long as it is branded with the brand of its grade. The Minister, at the Conference, mentioned that binder twine could be made out of some of this rejected flax. I think we might let binder twine manufacturers look after their own interests, and they are not going to make twine out of a class of flax that will ruin the sale of their twine in the future. They will use rough flax for other purposes. Another point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frost</inline> is with regard to the grading sheds. I think it is only right that flax should be  graded where there is an accumulation of flax, whether in a grading store or not. This affects Wellington, where Blenheim and Picton flax  passes through. It is desirable in many cases to have flax graded in the Blenheim store and shipped direct from there&#39; without any overhauling in the Wellington store. </para>

        <para class="block">A great deal of this gentleman&#39;s evidence is peculiarly applicable to New Zealand, and is not very pertinent to the proposed attempt to cultivate flax in Australia. It, therefore, may be passed over without any loss of advantage to the Committee. A great deal of the remainder of the evidence so largely follows that which I have already quoted, that it may also be omitted, unless honorable senators think that the evidence I have quoted requires confirmation. I might quote a great deal of highly technical evidence referring to the use of chemicals in the preparation of flax, but perhaps it will be sufficient if I refer honorable senators to this volume, which will be found as an appendix to the Journals, of the House of Representatives of New Zealand for 1905. It certainly comprises one of the most closely reasoned and carefully studied papers on the cultivation and preparation of flax that can readily be obtained. I have quoted from it in order to impress upon honorable senators that the proposed bounty is not one to be hastily agreed to. There is no particular virtue in the schedule as it stands, beyond the fact that it is not the schedule proposed by the Government, but the remnant of the schedule originally submitted. It contains; now only a portion of the original policy of the Government, and there is, therefore-, no reason why this item should not bestruck out in the same way that other items; originally presented have been. I suppose that I cannot refer to items which were struck out of the schedule in anotherplace, except by way of estimating the  value of the present proposition. Palm oil, sunflower seed, and a number of other items were struck out in another place, and some people held that the palm oil proposal was involved in another Act of the Legislature. </para>

If the Minister in charge of the Bill is prepared to announce that the Governmnent will abandon this item, he will save a very great deal of time. If, on the other hand, the Government are determined that the item shall pass, then, in the interests of the taxpayers, I shall call for a division upon it. </para>

            <para>- I propose to bring my remarks to a close, because I do not wish to see the Government counted out on the Bill. If I discontinue my remarks, I do so on purely personal grounds, and out of consideration for the unhappy position in which Ministers in the Senate are placed. We recognise that there are two faithful Ministers and one faithful supporter, and, in the circumstances, it is hardly fair that this measure should be placed in jeopardy by a discussion of this item at greater length than is customary. If I have spoken at greater length than usual, it will be remembered that I did not speak on the second reading of the Bill, and, although in another way, I am making a speech which I was entitled to make at that stage. By way of recapitulation, I object to this item, because it proposes the starting of a pernickety industry without any guidance for those who might be induced by the proposed bounty to enter into it, and thus undoubtedly to be involved in loss and sorrow. I also object to the expenditure of .&#163;30,000 in the form of bounties for the production of </para>

        <para class="block">New Zealand flax - because that is what the proposal amounts to - on the ground that the money can only be raised by the taxation of the people in the most serious manner. The fourth column of the schedule represents a total expenditure of  &#163;77,500  as the maximum expenditure for any one year under the Bill. But I draw attention to the fact) that provision has already been made in clauses to which we have agreed, that the amount not expended in one year may be carried on to another. This involves a total expenditure, of &#163;533,000 during fifteen years, and, as under our Constitution revenue to the extent of four times that amount would require to be raised, the Bill involves a total taxation of the people to the tune of &#163;2,132,000. I further point out that the expenditure on this item alone would involve taxation to the extent of &#163;120,000. Knowing what I know of flax, and in view of what I have read concerning the industry in New Zealand, I cannot conceive it to be my duty to vote for this item. My honorable friends opposite will accept my assurance that I do not take so much exception to many other items in the schedule. I shall not offer to every item the positive opposition which I am offering to this. I propose to be fair, as I hope I always am, and I do not mind telling my honorable friends opposite that I have been induced to speak at greater length than usual, and have not shown the same consideration for the Vice-President of the Executive Council and his colleagues as I should otherwise have been prepared to do, because of a certain happening of yesterday. That is a political happening, and not a personal one. The honorable senator knows perfectly well that this is not a personal objection. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> appears to have very successfully knocked the stuffing out of all opposition to the item by occupying the attention of the Committee for an inordinate length of time. I donot propose to follow his example. I wish to enter a protest against the adoption of this item, and I base my objection mainly upon the fact that the conditions under which jute is produced are not likely to obtain in Australia. Do honorable senators believe that we can establish in Australia an industry to compete with that of India, where the conditions are such, that people are compelled, in &#39;the open air under a blazing sun, to stand more than knee deep in water saturated with vegetable matter to clean the fibre? If honorable senators think that that condition of affairs can possibly obtain or is desirable in Australia, let them carry the item. I do not object to this item on the ground that an industry could not possibly be successful. I object to it on the ground that, even if it were successful, it would be undesirable. </para>

I oppose it precisely on the grounds mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway.</inline> It is all very well to argue that, in countries where labour is cheap, no attempt is made to invent machinery,, but that when labour becomes expensive machinery will soon be introduced to economize methods of production. Whilst that may be true in some respects, I have read reports which convince me that the cost of establishing the jute industry in Australia would be too great to warrant us in making the attempt. I prefer to leave the industry entirely in the hands of the Indians. If they consider that jutegrowing is worthy of their efforts let them continue to produce it for a considerable time io come. I shall vote against the item. </para>

            <para>- The production of jute is degrading from the time when it is planted until it is manufactured. The Government are anxious to spend &#163;412,500 on the promotion of agricultural industries. We are bound to consider the financial resources of the Commonwealth. It may be that we shall discover that we cannot afford the whole sum proposed to be appropriated. There are some industries which, if successfully established, would undoubtedly be very advantageous to us. The growth of cotton, and possibly coffee and tobacco, might be brought to the stage of economic success. It is just as well for the Senate to exercise its discretion, and to pick out those industries which are most likely to be successful. We import very little jute, and yet we propose to give an enormous bounty for its production. </para>

            <para>- If that argument were applied to every &#39; article which we import and do not produce, we should be here almost to the crack of doom. What prospect of success is there for jute production in Australia? No indication is afforded by the report of the experts that it can be successfully grown in Australia, nor is there any reasonable hope of growing it under the labour conditions that prevail here. We should have to compete against, perhaps, the most degraded form of labour in the world. I do not doubt that the climate in some portions of Australia would permit jute to be grown. But the growth of the plant is only part of the difficulty. I am one of those who do not like to see our labour degraded, and for that reason alone I should oppose the item. But there are some agricultural industries which we have reason to believe might be made to succeed. Why waste money on growing an article like jute- when we ought to conserve our financial strength for the promotion of those industries which we have reasonable hopes of establishing? I feel sure that the Government have no wish to limit our choice with regard to these items. The Minister should leave it to the Committee to decide as between tobacco, cotton, coffee, and other articles for which there is a world-wide market, and upon the growth of which white people can be engaged. Why waste our resources upon an industry^ which cannot come within miles of being economically successful,  seeing that we shall have to compete against Chinese and Japanese labour of the lowest kind ? Originally, it was- intended to _devote a large sum of money for the; encouragement of certain industries, but some items were reduced in another Chamber. Those who are opposed to this Bill in principle recognise that, as the second reading has been carried, they ought to choose those items for which there is the greatest prospect of success. If they prove successful, there will be strong reasons for the Government coming down to  Parlia-ment  again and asking for money for other bounties. I do not . pose in any way as an expert on this. item. If the Government persist in this proposal with regard to jute and other products, they are simply defeating the end which we are all anxious to attain. I urge the Committee to leave out this item, &#39; because other industries may want the money in later years, and may justify from the beginning the assistance offered to them. </para>

          <para>&#91;S-il- - Some honorable senators are apt to fall into a fallacy in dealing with the items in the schedule. Some of the arguments adduced in opposition to the proposal for a bounty for particular items are based on the assumption that we are forcing people into certain industries. That is not so. We simply hold out a prospect of a reward to such persons as may succeed in producing the articles in question of a merchantable quality in sufficient quantities and under the conditions laid down in the Bill. We do not force people into the production of those articles, nor, by passing the item, do we necessarily * take a step which will absolutely involve the Commonwealth in the expenditure of the maximum amount provided. The amount appropriated for some particular item may never be called upon, because individuals may not find it profitable to embark in the production of the article specified. If, on the other hand, they do succeed in establishing the fact that that article can be produced in the Commonwealth, under the conditions laid down in the Bill be it remembered, they will undoubtedly have done a great service to Australia - a service more than ordinary,^ if it be an article criticised as one in &#39;the manufacture or production of which degrading conditions must necessarily obtain. In the production of these, articles, in order to obtain the bounty, those degrading con ditions must be absent, as far as we can prevent them. The Government would have been neglectful of their duty if they had not included this article in the schedule of a measure for granting bounties for .productions from the soil. It is now said that certain of the circumstances under which jute is retted in India would not be tolerated in Australia. I cordially agree with that statement. Every member of the&#34; Government is heart and soul with the principle that we do not want transferred to any area in the Commonwealth conditions such as prevail in certain industries in other parts of the world. But will honorable senators pursue such arguments to their logical, conclusion in  every  department of production about which the same thing has been said? It was argued until quite recently that it was impossible for Australia to grow sugar without the assistance of black labour, which was am indispensable condition, and that all the attendant circumstances of black labour must be inseparably associated with the industry if the industry was to succeed here. </para>

            <para>- It is not my purpose to raise a discussion now as&#39; to the relative merits of white or black labour in the sugar industry. But I am not overstating the position when I  say  that it is not many years ago that those who might be looked upon as the best qualified to judge were fairly unanimous that black labour must be inseparably associated with the sugar industry if it was to remain a permanent industry in the Commonwealth. It was stated that the work was unfitted for white men. In the ordinary course of evolution, we have found that those statements were not based on fact, and that as a matter of actual experience white men to-day are doing the work which, a few years ago, many who were competent to judge said confidently that they were unfit to do. One of the objections raised in the past to the attempts to establish the cotton industry in the Commonwealth was that there was no machinery for picking . cotton. It was said that bonuses or rewards were offered for the invention of a  suitable machine for that purpose. I am not in a position to say how far inventors have succeeded in that direction. </para>

Is it not reasonable to expect that when the people of a country like Australia, which&#39;&#39; enjoys many tropical conditions of climate and soil, apply themselves to the production of jute, they will bring to the retting of the plant ingenuity superior to that which has characterized the people of India in their production for many years past? </para>

            <para>- I am simply answering the objections that have been put forward. Whether a machine is produced or not, we have yet to be satisfied that trie degrading conditions associated with the industry in India are inseparable from it in every other part of the world. I do not believe that they will be associated with it in Australia. If those conditions are inevitable here, the industry will not find a place in Australia, and the bounty will not operate. We are not taking this money irrevocably .but of the Treasury and putting it aside for all time. We must offer to our own people a prospect that, if they can succeed in establishing the industry and maintaining it on the conditions laid down in the Bill, they will, as the pioneers of an important development in the production of the Commonwealth, receive some reward. The experts&#39; report states that&#39; the imports of jute - I wish honorable senators to distinguish between jute and jute <inline font-style="italic">goods</inline> - for the year <inline font-style="italic">&#93;Q0t</inline> amounted to 4,382 cwt., of the value of &#163;5,265. That is small, but it is iri relation to the enormous consumption and importation of jute goods into the Commonwealth that the experts and the Government have been seized of the importance, and even the necessity, of including the item in the schedule. </para>

          <para>It was the unanimous opinion of the Conference that the cultivation of certain fibres is worthy of the most generous encouragement. Prominence was given to the matter of jute production. As the raw material of which bags are made, the question of jute supply vitally affects most producing interests in the Commonwealth. .The recent heavy increase in the price of all bags and sacks has caused some disquietude amongst farmers who arc naturally concerned when they find the price of the bag holding their wheat equal to an impost of 2d. per bushel. </para>

A great many more woolpacks are used now than formerly owing to the increase in the New South Wales clip.

          <para>During my recent visit to Sydney, and after delivering an address before the members of the Farmers and Settlers&#39; Association, at the Royal Chambers, Hunter-street, Sydney, I was specially questioned concerning the supply of jute goods and reasons for the then ruling high prices. </para>
          <para>During my visit to India I specially looked into the matter, and am now decidedly of opinion that the recent high quotations did not occur in consequence of any combine or corner in jute. </para>
          <para>The exportable surplus from a given crop depends upon local consumption. It is estimated that the area under jute equals 3,181,600 acres, producing about 353,600,000 lbs., or equal to 8,384,000 bales of jute of 400 lbs. each. Nearly the whole of the jute comes from Bengal, where there are 23,000 looms, an increase of over 16,000 during the last 23 years. Of recent years, the high cost of the raw material has considerably restricted the local consumption and the output of the mills. In the meantime, the foreign demands increased, the result being very keen, competition at increased prices. </para>
          <para class="block">As an illustration : In August of 1905 the quotations for 400 lb. bales were rupees 41, or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2.</inline> 14s. 8d. per bale. In igo6 this price increased to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> 4s- 8d. per. 400 lb. bale. </para>

        <para class="block">Then, by means of statistics, an  illustration is  given of the enormous business donein jute goods, and it is shown that &#39;theexport of gunny bags ranged from. 200,099,449, valued at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3,127,964,</inline> in 1904, to 248,593,232, valued at &#163;4,637,061, in 1906. It is most interesting to note to what places these exports, were sent from India in order that we may -see the extent to which Australia is interested in the matter. It is stated in thereport that &#34; in 1906 the exports went <inline font-style="italic">tothe</inline> following countries.&#34; The countries are then enumerated, and Australia stands first on the list, and is shown to have imported! 43&#187;594,o39 bags, value at ,&#163;1, 106,242. Next to Australia comes England with an&#62; importation of 32,193,985 bags, valued at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;571,</inline> 583- Then follows China, Chile, the Straits Settlements, and other countries in order. The report further statesthat, in addition to gunny bags, India exported the raw material of jute to a number of countries which are given in the order of the value of the export to each. The first on the list is England, which imported 6,652,576 cwt., valued at &#163;7,045,474. The export to Germany, of raw jute was valued at &#163;3,229,181, that to France at &#163;2,009,873, and1 to the United States  at &#163;1, 878^001, and so on. It has been said, by way of interjection, that, we are proposing to give a bounty only in respect to jute itself and that these figures have relation to jute goods, but I have already pointed out that it will be next to impossible for us to manufacture jute goods iri Australia unless we can succeed in producing the raw material within our own borders, because, notwithstanding the great output in India, there does not seem to be a sufficient supply to meet the world&#39;s demand.

            <para>- On the back of this number of the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> of the Institute there is a list of available papers on the resources of different portions of the Empire, and heading the list is Queensland, and then New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand in the order named. I should think, therefore, that my Queensland friend, as well as the Queensland Government and people, ought to be acquainted with the operations of the Imperial Institute.

          <para>Jute is one of the cheapest fibres, and is. employed for making the coarse cloths used for sacks, bags, bale covers, and tarpaulins. At present almost all the raw jute imported in the United Kingdom comes from Bengal. In the three years 1901, 1902, 1903 the average annual import was 325,000 tons; of this quantity 319,000 tons, or 98 per cent, of the whole came from Bengal. In recent years there has been a large increase in the machinery employed in India for jute spinning and weaving, and the export thence of &#34; gunny &#34; cloth, which is the name by which such coarse cloth is known in India, has risen from 307 million yards in the 3&#39;ear ending 31st March, 1900, to 552 million yards in the year ending 31st March, 1904. </para>

        <para>Honorable senators will, therefore, see that the Indians do not confine themselves to the production of the raw material, but, having erected machinery on the spot, they turn the jute fibre into &#34;gunny&#34; cloth, which has been- exported in large quantities.

The passing of the item does not irrevocably commit us to the expenditure of the amount voted.

        <para class="block">We recognise that these may be the conditions applying to retting in India, which has so far been practically the only source of supply of jute for the world. But we confidently believe that if our own people, influenced by the prospect of obtaining the bounty, enter upon the production of jute thev will operate on lines which will not involve the degrading conditions which may appertain elsewhere. We may rely upon it too that if they think that the conditions are inseparable from the jute indus try they are not likely to enter upon an experiment, bounty or no bounty. If they do not make an experiment there will be no financial responsibility on the part of the Commonwealth. After describing in some detail  the  retting operations, the article says - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The operations vary somewhat in different localities ; the fibre is sometimes first loosened by means of a wooden beater before separating it from the stem, and a thick plank or heavy piece of wood held  firmly  in position by posts driven into the bed of &#39; the pond is recommended as facilitating the washing process, by offering something . more resisting than water to dash the root-ends of the plant against, these being less perfectly softened by the retting than the upper parts. </para>
          <para>These primitive methods yield an exceptionally pure product, and the retting accomplishes the disintegration of the bundle of bast fibres.

        <para class="block">When I was  speaking  last night on New Zealand hemp or flax I referred to a report in which it was set out that the process adopted by the natives of New Zealand produced better results than the machinery which has since been adopted by white persons for extracting the hemp. In this article, dealing with jute, it is pointed out that the particular process which is adopted by the natives, and called &#39; retting, produces excellent results. But that has been the case with very many industries associated with the soil. If the early methods of converting wheat into meal were adhered to they might not appeal to honorable senators or the general community. But when a man of intelligence and education applies his attention to the production of necessities from the soil it does not follow that he will carry on an industry under the stagnation of primitive conditions. He will bring his intelligence and ingenuity to bear to see if it is not possible by mechanical processes to get through the work which, under more primitive conditions, was carried out directly by hand, and in a most laborious manner. Considering how - much this community in all its productive capacities is dependent upon a proper supply of bags at a reasonable cost for its different industries, we should hold out some prospect of reward to those who will embark upon the production of raw material, so that we shall not be dependent upon an unreliable market abroad. I hope that the Committee willi allow the item to stand. </para>

          <para>So far, only experimental plots of jute have been planted in the north; there is no record of its cultivation on an extensive scale. We are therefore compelled to fall back upon Indian experience&#39; to form some idea of the returns which may be expected from the cultivation of this important commodity, and the conditions under which it may be profitably raised. </para>

            <para>- On what evidence or experience does the Minister base his opinion that we ought to approve this bounty? The experts appear to have lost sight of every practical consideration. I have not read a more misleading report. Every line contains a remark which goes to show that it will be a splendid thing to give a bounty, but not a single fact or figure is adduced to show that it would lead to the establishment of a permanent industry. I should conclude at once that if we started to grow jute we should have to compete against India - a country with a population of&#39; 300 odd millions, and in which black labour is paid at from id. to 3d. a day. If the experts expected the Parliament to approve of this bounty ought not they to&#39; have dealt with the question of labour, shown that there is no hope of competing against India unless we impose a high protective duty, and also pointed out how persons engaged in primary industries would be affected if we imposed too high a duty upon their requirements? In my opinion the report of the experts is useless, misleading, in fact, dangerous. Employing general terms, a good case is apparently made out for every item by the experts, but when it is analyzed there is no case made out for half an item. It is only in India that jute will grow. Experiments have been tried in other parts, but it is only in the vicinity of Bengal that jute can be successfully grown. Yet these experts, in their report, say that wherever maize will grow jute can be grown. That I absolutely deny. </para>

            <para>- I believe that they made that statement in regard to one of the fibres. In the Northern Territory where can warm moist climates with deep alluvial soil be found ? How much countryis there in the Northern Territory fit for growing rice&#34;? I only saw one plot of that description, and that was on the banks of the Adelaide River. I defy any agricultural expert to point out how the flats of that river are to be treated. Between Pine Creek and Port Darwin I did not see or hear of any land of that description. I do not believe that we can successfully establish a jute industry. I think it is a piece of folly to propose a bounty upon the production of four different &#39;fibres. Why can we not act prudently and pick out two fibres to experiment with? What I should like the Government to do would be to spend &#163;2,000 or &#163;3,000 upon experiments to see whether we cannot grow a fibre which would supply the raw material for the bags used by our primary producers. I suppose that if we have to compete against black labour we shall be told that it cannot be done, even with the aid of a bounty, unless we impose a protective duty. Is it possible to have a duty upon every covering which the farmer needs for his products? Such an idea is absurd. I do not know what the Victorian protectionists think of this proposal. If they do not stand by the. primary producer and help him in every possible way, instead of taxing him out of existence, what will become of our export trade, of our boast that we export more per head than does any other country? That position cannot be maintained if we give a bounty upon the production of jute, impose a heavy duty upon the foreign article, and at the same time tax every farmer. </para>

          <para>. - In the interests of the primary producer of whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> speaks, it is very desirable if we can to establish the successful production of jute. Speaking as a wheat grower, I may mention that six years ago I paid 5d. each, for very good bags; but one year ago my son paid 8d. each for very bad bags. That is the effect of the expansion of the use of jute goods. In Australia jute goods are going down in quality and up in price in a very rapid manner. </para>

            <para>- No, because the articles have been duty free. The wool producer and the wheat producer - the two largest forms of production, at any rate for export - are dependent in a large degree upon reasonable prices, for the covering of the goods which they want to export, and they are absolutely in the hands of persons abroad over whom they have no control. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has suggested that the grant of this bounty may lead to the imposition of a Customs duty. There is no necessary connexion between the two things. It might happen, I think probably would happen, that, if we successfully produced jute we would commence to manufacture jute goods. </para>

We have established the manufacture of some goods without giving them protective duties, and we manufacture many others cheaply and successfully with the assistance of protective duties. I shall be prepared to discuss the Tariff&#39; when we have it before us, but I do not wish to involve the present issue in that. Honorable senators who know me are aware that there is nothing I delight in more than a Tariff debate, but I want to have it at the proper time. I rose to give the Senate the benefit of my actual experience as to the question at issue, and that is the experience of every farmer and every wool raiser in Australia - namely, that jute goods have been rapidly advancing in price, and rapidly declining in quality. </para>

            <para>- But there is no proof that that is due to scarcity. It may be due to a cornering of the market in Victoria, or to a number of other causes for which a bounty is not a cure. I desire, however, to come back to the statement made in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson.</inline> The sugar industry was used as an example. But the most extreme advocate of coloured labour never contended that sugar could not be manufactured with white labour. What the advocates of black labour contended was that sugar could not be grown with white labour. I was a member of the Senate when we discussed the whole question of the sugar industry in Queensland. Honorable senators can search the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but they will not find that the assertion was made that white men could not manufacture sugar. The only question, was as to the growing. It has not been contended that white men cannot grow jute, nor does any one desire to make such a contention. Therefore, there is no similarity between the two conditions. The one is a question of growing, and the other of manufacture, because the retting of jute is the equivalent of the manufacture of sugar. </para>

            <para>- We are not dealing with the question of whether jute can be grown with white labour, but of whether the process of preparing it after it is grown is an industry in which we should encourage the workers of Australia to engage. Suppose we admit, for the sake of argument, that it is an industry in which we should invite white people to engage, both with respect to growing and retting, what are we going to do with the raw material? Is it to be manufactured into bags in this country, or are we to send it to India or Dundee to be manufactured ? </para>

            <para>- Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> imagine for one moment that we can manufacture jute goods in Australia in competition with India and Dundee, without a protective duty? Before we spend &#163;15,000, we ought to know what is to be the ultimate destiny of the product. The path of the Committee has been smooth with regard to the other items in the schedule, because they are articles which are produced in countries similar to our own. Hempen fibre is an example. I have yet to learn that the manufacture of rope is an Indian industry. I think it is a white labour industry all the world over. The production of those fibres is carried on in the temperate zones of the world. But jute is an item of an altogether dissimilar character. No honorable senator has yet shown that in Australia we can manufacture wheat bags in competition with India or&#34; Dundee, where the raw material is grown without a bounty and under natural conditions. Is any Parliament that may be elected in Australia for many years to come likely to put a duty on the wheat bags in which our produce is conveyed to the markets of the world? </para>

            <para>- If they did, they must be qualified for admission to. another place than Parliament, and I should say that any protectionist who recommended the same thing would be qualified for admission to the same place. Not only do I believe that the conditions are against the successful growth of jute in Australia, but I also believe that the industry is one that we should not endeavour to encourage. It is not worth while for us to spend money upon it, unless we intend to produce wheat bags in our own country. But if there is one thing that we must recognise, it is that if Australia had to depend on her own home market for the consumption of her wheat her farmers would dwindle by 75 per cent. It would cripple our farming industry. We have to depend on our exports, and we could not afford, to put a duty on bags,, and so cripple the farmers in their competition with foreign wheat. I ask the Committee, in all seriousness, whether they do not think that they are injuring the principle of bounties by retaining this item. It will bring discredit upon the whole system of bounty giving. I appeal to the Committee to strike out the item, because I feel sure that it has been put in without forethought, and without considering what is to be done with the jute if it is produced. &#171; </para>

          <para>- - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> insists upon dragging in the question of protective duties, and he has asked the question whether any honorable senator would dream of putting a duty on wheat bags, inasmuch as the wheat we grow has to compete in the markets of the world. I venture to say that any one of us who saw a reasonable prospect of wheat bags being much more conveniently obtained, and at a cheaper rate,- as a consequence of a duty, would think of imposing one. I am not now saying whether that would be the effect of a duty upon, wheat bags, but I Have no hesitation in saying that it has been the effect of duties on a large number of things. The manufacture of manila rope and binder twine may be instanced. As a consequence, they, have gone down in price. </para>

            <para>- Undoubtedly I do. But, as I have already said, I do not wish to confuse the issue. The point is: that there is a large and increasing market for jute, and if we can develop its growth in this country, we shall be doing a good&#39; thing, unless it has the effect, as a necessary concomitant, of employing labourunder conditions which are degrading. But I do not think that that is. a necessary concomitant. Certainly, labour cannot be employed under degrading conditions under this Bill. </para>

            <para>- The Bill provides that white labour must be employed,, and that standard wages must be paid.. We have a reasonable ground for assuming,. also, that the regulations will be in accordance with the spirit of Australian industrialism. The regulations must be submitted to us, not necessarily for overt indorsement, but for acquiescence or, if we choose, rejection. Therefore, we know that if jute is produced at all for the winning of the bounty it will be produced under conditions that are not degrading. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson!</inline> and others are unnecessarily alarmed at the thought that the production of jute will lead to the degradation of Australian labour. It cannot do so under the provisions of the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> pointed out that competition with India was necessarily a bar to our success. I happen to be intimate with an industry which is succeeding, developing, and extending very satisfactorily in Australia, although in direct competition with the penny-a-day labour of India. We are making a very superior class of leather known as glad: kid. We have not long been making it. The best quality is made from goat skins. We are sending to India for the skins, and producing the article cheaper than we used to be able to buy it when it was imported from abroad. One of the manufacturers tells me that while in India he was in an establishment where men were working for from i to  8  annas a day. Eight annas a day was the veryhighest wage for the most skilled men in the establishment, and an anna is about equivalent to an English penny. Yet we are competing and increasing our power to compete with, and buying our raw material from, the place where alone it can be obtained now - India. So that competition with inferior races who use primitive methods is not necessarily a bar to successful and cheap production - cheaper production than that of cheap labour with primitive methods. The work of retting jute is probably very disagreeable and undesirable work, but I question very much whether it is as disagreeable as some of the processes in fellmongery which is being -carried on with more or less success over the whole of Australia. No .person has yet hinted that our labour is degraded because of the disagreeable character of the work at which it is employed in that industry. Some of us have complained that our labour is degraded because of the low rate at which it has to work in some of these kinds of industries. I hope that we shall do everything we can to create numerous and diversified avenues of employment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is mistaken in thinking that one of the four fibres specified in this schedule will serve the purposes of all of Them. I believe that New Zealand flax grown in Victoria is so fine and of so high a quality that it is capable of being made into linen. </para>

            <para>- We must not be afraid to move in this direction, simply because objectionable methods may be employed elsewhere. If those objectionable methods are sought to be imported io Australia, the provisions of the Bill will preclude their application to the process of earning the bounty. That argument ought at once to disappear as a factor influencing &#39; honorable senators&#39; minds. If it happens that jute cannot be produced without the adoption of those objectionable methods, the result will be that jute will not be produced here, and that, although we may have passed the Bill and provided the bounty, the money will not be paid. </para>

          <para>.- When speaking in support of the second reading of the Bill, I said I would endeavour in Committee to have certain items deleted, with a view to apply the amounts to what I considered more important items, in order to give every possible encouragement to industries which there was no doubt could be well established&#39; in Australia. But, having been informed by the Minister that we should have to vote for the Schedule as a whole, or that, if we chose to strike out any item, the amount set- apart for it could not be applied to any other item, but must be deducted from the total of &#163;412,500, I have made up my mind to support every item in the Schedule. As a protectionist, I should be untrue to my principles if I voted for the deletion of the item now before the Committee. </para>

            <para>- They are not so strong in their recommendations in regard to- other items.  They point out that jute can be easily grown in Australia, and that the industry can, by encouragement, become highly profitable to the Commonwealth. We ought, therefore, to have very little hesitation in voting in support of their recommendations. We are always asking for expert opinions and advice, yet when they are given to us, some of us are indisposed to treat them seriously. It is argued that if we establish the jute industry in Australia it will be impossible to compete with other parts of the world where labour is worked longer hours and paid about onefourth of the wage of a white man in Australia. If that argument is. sound in regard to jute, it is sound in regard to every other item in the Schedule; in fact, it applies to every, industry that has been established in Australia under a protectionist policy. It may be true that in India they have not yet perfected a machine to supersede manual labour. As one who visited the East about two years ago, I know that there is little or no incentive for a man with an inventive mind to attempt to produce or perfect a machine to displace human labour there, because in many parts of the East labour is cheaper than any mechanical appliance. All the buildings in Hong Kong, some of which would bte a credit to any city in the world, were erected without machinery at all, because there human labour is cheaper than machinery. Although many different machines are used in other parts of the world, to-day in building work, that work is performed there by Chinese men and women. </para>

            <para>- As a matter of fact, the machines to which I referred could be introduced in the building trade in Hong Kong, but they need care and attention, and cost large sums of money; whereas if the human machines become worn out they can be tossed, so to speak, on the scrap heap, and plenty more can be obtained to. take their places. No one who supports the retention of this item in the Schedule desires that the industry shall be established here under degrading or demoralizing conditions. It will mean a very big thing to Australia if the industry can be established. </para>

            <para>- Other honorable senators as well as myself have made that statement in this Chamber, and it has been made by hundreds of the residents of Tasmania. The woollen industry is to-day well established in that State. The mills there have the reputation of turning out high-class goods, and it is reported that they cannot supply their orders. By the 3170 <inline font-style="italic">Bounties&#91;SENATE.&#93; Bill.</inline> evidence which he has submitted to the Committee the Minister has conclusively shown that there is a world&#39;s market for this commodity. Importations of the raw material and of &#39;the manufactured article to the value of over &#163;1,000,000 are introduced to Australia year in and year out. The goods manufactured from jute are largely required by our pastoralists and farmers, and the raw material of jute can be utilized in many directions. If we encourage the establishment of the industry for the production of jute in Australia we shall soon have other industries established for the manufacture of jute good&#39;s. It has been stated that I said I desired that this item should be eliminated from the Schedule. I said so because I believed at the time that it might be possible to transfer the bounties proposed for the production of jute and other articles to other, and in my opinion more important, items. When I found that that was not possible,. I said&#39; I was prepared to vote for every item in the Schedule, and I trust that the majority of the Committee will be found to be of my way of thinking. </para>

          <para>. - In speaking on the second reading of the Bill,. I made it plain that I would oppose the inclusion of certain items in the Schedule. This is one of the items&#39; about which I was very doubtful as to the course I should pursue. After the arguments in support of this item to which I have listened, I have come to the conclusion that it should be allowed to stand, and principally because I believe that over large areas of northern Australia it will be found possible to produce this commodity successfully by means of white labour. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has mentioned that in Australia we can produce wheat in competition with the cheap labour countries of the world. I know as a matter of fact that one white man in Australia has cultivated no less than 200 acres on his own account. That is a feat which cannot be rivalled in any other part of the world. </para>

        <para>SenatorLYNCH. - If we can compete against cheap-labour countries, such as Russia and India, in the production of wheat, we can hold our own in the production of this commodity. It has been mentioned in the course of the debate that there are certain unpleasant features con nected with the production of jute which those who embarked in the industry would have to put up with. But our people put up with many unpleasant features connected with other industries in Australia, and we know that very many people are engaged in occupations which may be considered distasteful. </para>

            <para>- If we take mining, it will be admitted that it is not pleasant to work in the hot end of a 200-foot drive, and I can imagine that people would prefer the stench that is said to be associated with some of the operations of the jute industry to the unpleasant features of other occupations which could be mentioned. We shall be largely dependent on India for our supplies of jutegoods in the future if we do not take up the industry ourselves. The population of India is increasing, and whether the people of that country areprogressing or not there is little doubt that they will become the victims of the combines that are beginning to operate there. Once the combines get. to work and manipulate the labour of India for their own purposes the consumers of jute goods, and the raw material of the industry throughout the world, will have to payfor it. If the people of India advance they will necessarily ask more for their labour, and in that case more must be paid for the goods they produce. If, on the other hand, they do not advance, they will&#34; only the more readily become the victims of the combines that are starting their operations in the country. I find that in 1906 we imported jute goods to the value of no less than &#163;1,121,000. If those goods were produced in Australia their production would give employment to many people who are idle at the present time, and we should have an additional industry for the tropical portions of the Commonwealth. I believe that we can hold our own in the production of jute. It should not be forgotten that the methods of production followed in India are very old. Those who have visited the country recently know that the ox is still used for treading out the corn in India. We have advanced leagues in front of that industrial position. The jute industry cannot be started in this country without some encouragement ; if none is offered there will be no inducement to people to invest money in the industry and in view of the fact that we are very large consumers of the commodity, </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger suggests a very ridiculous analogy. He must know that in the early development of the country people took up what appeared then to be the most profitable employment. In the early history of Victoria, and of some of the other States, people left the sheep paddocks and flocked to the goldfields in the belief that they could make a better living. When the gold-fields were to some extent exhausted, many of the people were thrust back upon the next best occupation at which they thought they&#39; could make a living. They were driven again from the pastoral to the agricultural areas. Agriculture has provided, and will continue for a long time to provide, profitable employment for the people, but our agricultural industries need to be varied. I believe that we should do what we can to foster new industries for the employment of our people. Although I must admit that this item is very close to what I consider the border line, I am prepared to support its inclusion in the schedule. </para>

            <para>- I find that I have plenty of material here, and therefore I have no anxiety on that score. I assure honorable senators that I have no desire to speak at any length. The reputation of the Commonwealth is, I take it, a matter of consequence to every one of us. Certain persons of a speculative character have undoubtedly played with the reputation and the interests of the Commonwealth in a most inappropriate manner. I desire to use no strong language, but I submit that the interests of the Commonwealth have been the subject of barter and barney in the money markets of the world, and that it has been practically degraded by the course pursued by certain persons who professed to enter into a binding contract with it. If I were to do what I certainly am tempted to do - to point out how, a little more than a year ago, when the proposed mail contract was brought before the Senate, I indicated the difficulties which were to be faced, and how entirely the Commonwealth was asked to place itself at the mercy of persons who might be scrupulous or unscrupulous - I should be able to show by reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that every word I then uttered has been proved abundantly true. </para>
