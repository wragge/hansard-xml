                        <para>. - It is mentioned in the report that several papers were in print when tabled. . It seems to be unnecessary that such papers should be referred to the Printing Committee, and that they should be put to the trouble of taking cognizance of them. All regulations which are made under a Statute have to be printed and tabled. In my opinion, there should be no necessity for the Printing Committee to take any cognizance of papers which are in print when tabled. . It would lighten their labours, and reduce the size of their reports, which are necessarily lengthy and costly to print, if that course were taken. </para>

In the new subclause 7, the use of the word " statements!" which might import more than the Committee intended, should be limited to only the facts and documents stated in the petition.

                    <para>- I also suggest that in sub-clause 3 the word "section" should be substituted for the word "Act," because the rest of the Act does not relate to this matter at all. And with a view to saving expense, I suggest that the same sub-clause be amended by the addition of the words "or a Justice*." Otherwise we might have counsel appearing in open Court about a trumpery matter of procedure. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to be quite clear as to the meaning of this clause. According to my reading of it, any case such as that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin,</inline> or any case of qualification, as set out in section  44  of the Constitution, could be. brought before the Senate, when it might evoke a long political discussion, perhaps, on its merits. I desire to know whether or not it will be possible for any case of the kind to come before the Senate in the future, because, if so, I intend to ask the Committee to negative the clause. We have had sufficient evidence to convince us that it is unseemly and undesirable to have a system whereby an appeal or a petition may be decided 'according to the political leanings of the members of a Committee of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> explanation, cases of thai kind would go to the High Court without the Senate's consent being first required. But under this clause several kinds of disqualification, such as those under section 44 of the Constitution, would come under the special purview of the Senate. Is it not possible that party spirit or political bias may be introduced in the Senate in future in. the discussion of matters of that kind? There may be sufficient room for differences of opinion in a case where a senator is disqualified on account of bankruptcy, or for having sworn allegiance to a foreign power, to warrant a serious political difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- It is questionable whether in all cases the facts will be sufficiently clear to prevent sides being taken. If the case is simply a question of fact, which gives no room for the introduction of party' spirit, why not refer it to the High Court direct? I understand that the object of wording this clause in this way is to avoid the expense of referring to the High Court any case which the Senate can very well deal with when the facts are plain. But if the facts are plain, why should not such  ai  simple case go automatically to the High Court, in order to prevent the repetition in a future Senate of what has occurred here recently ? If I do not 'obtain a satisfactory explanation, I shall move to amend the clause so as to provide that all cases of disputed returns or qualifications shall be referred to the High Court, without coming before the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - By clause 5,  all questions analogous to that which has been brought before the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon'-s</inline> petition - all those arising under section 15 of the Constitution - are to go automatically to the Court of Disputed Returns. According to section 192 of the Electoral Act - " The validity of any election or return may be disputed by petition addressed to the Court of Disputed Returns and not otherwise." Many honorable senators' were of opinion that all questions of ' ' choice ' ' under section 1 5 of the Constitution, were comprehended within the terms of section 192 of the Electoral Act, but it turns out that that is not so, and the object of the Bill is to declare that a " choice " under section 15 of the Constitution shall be regarded as an " election." By that means it will come under the terms of part XVI. of the Electoral Act and go automatically to the Court of Disputed Returns in the same way as any disputed popular election would go. In this clause, however, quite a different class ot cases, arising under sections 34, 44, and 45 of the Constitution, are dealt with. It provides machinery by which it wilt be ' competent for the Senate at any time, by the mere passage of a resolution, to. refer those cases to the Court of Disputed Returns. The reason that provision is included in the Bill is that there are a number of cases where it must be obvious to the Senate, beyond all dispute", that the disqualification does exist - such as that a man has become insolvent, or is an undischarged bankrupt, or has corruptly received pecuniary remuneration for his services in regard to some particular matter in Parliament, or has committed a crime. It would be unwise to adopt the cumbrous machinery of forwarding cases of that kind to the High Court. - The presentation of a certificate of a man's insolvency or of his conviction of a crime would establish the facts beyond dispute. The machinery is provided, however, so that if any question of law, or indeed of fact, is in dispute, it will be competent for the Senate, by the mere passage of a resolution, to forward the matter to the Court of Disputed Returns. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite true. I recognise that this is essentially a matter for the Senate itself. If the Senate considers that all cases of disqualification, no matter how simple, should go automatically to the High Court, it will be necessary to amend proposed new section 206AA by substituting for the words "may be referred by resolution," the words. " shall be referred." If that is the wish of the Committee, it- can be done. It is not a matter over which there can be any strong feeling. The Government submitted in this clause what they thought to be the more sensible course. But if honorable senators wish to rid themselves of any Possible dealings with questions arising under sections 34, 44, and 45 of the Constitution, they can do so in the way I have indicated. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) [2.57]. - We are indebted to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>
                    for raising these two questions. I am sure that he will be satisfied, as to the first, with the explanation of the Vice-President  of  the Executive Council, who called attention to section 192 of the Electoral Act, which confers upon the Court of Disputed Returns its jurisdiction. The inability of the Court of Disputed Returns to deal with such a case as that with which, the Senate has recently been concerned is . due to the circumstance that a "choice" under section 15 of the Constitution is not an "election or return" within, the meaning of section 192 of the Electoral Act. The Government remedy that defect by declaring, by clause 5 of this Bill, that such, a " choice " shall be deemed to be an " election " within the meaning of that section. That disposes of the first point raised  by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline>
                    As to the other point, I should have preferred that these clauses should not be in this Bill at all at present, because they import into the Bill matters affecting the other branch of the Legislature, which may very rightly say that it would prefer  to have matters regarding disqualification dealt with in a consolidating Electoral Bill. But if they are to be dealt with, I see no reason,  why  instead of its being left discretionary, cases pf disqualification should not all go to the High Court in the event of dispute. There may be, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    says, many cases in which the mere production of a certificate of a man's insolvency or conviction of a crime - if such a thing were possible in the case of a member of either branch of the Legislature - would probably end the matter, and it would mean unnecessary expense and delay, to refer a case of that kind to "the High Court or any other tribunal. All that would be necessary would be the production of the certificate and a resolution of the Senate.

To put extreme cases, where a certificate was produced of insolvency, or of conviction for an offence, it might be contended that the certificate was a forgery. The objection raised might be that . the senator had taken an oath of allegiance to a foreign power, and the person charged might say, and should be allowed to say, if necessary : " I have not taken an oath of allegiance to any foreign power. That is a fiction." In the event of dispute in such cases, we could provide that they should at once be referred to the High Court. If it is left to the discretion of the Senate where there is any dispute, to say whether the case shall be referred by resolution to the High Court, we shall have the same difficulty arising as to the influence of party feeling. </para>

Members of the present Senate are undoubtedly of the opinion that any disputed matter should be referred to the High Court; but we are legislating here for the future, and it is possible that in the future a party having a majority in the Senate might be disposed to take advantage of their strength to decide one of these cases in the interests of the party. But is there no alternative? Might we not, instead of leaving the discretion in the hands of the Senate to refer the matter to the High Court, specify the simple cases, such as death, or insolvency, in connexion with which the question might be solved by the production of a certificate, and say that such cases should be decided by the Senate ?

                    <para>.- I gather from the remarks of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that he has no objection to the proposed new section being amended in the way suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> and advocated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> Since I have been a member of the Senate, during over six years now, I have heard a general expression of opinion that all disputed matters, where the election of a senator is concerned, could be better decided by a judicial tribunal than by the Senate. When we were passing the original Electoral Act we thought we were providing for that, but we discovered that we did not do so effectively, and yesterday evening we remedied one of the most serious omissions. Now we have reached a stage at which we should ask ourselves whether we should not absolutely divest ourselves of every power to deal with these matters. I am inclined to say that as we are about it we should make a clean sweep this time, and transfer all matters of dispute, even of the most minor character, to the High Court. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that it is necessary to go to that length. In the case, for instance, of the bankruptcy of a senator, if the presentation of a certificate of bankruptcy were not disputed, it would surely be unnecessary to refer such a case to the Court. The Vice-President of the Executive Council would hardly contend that a case of that kind could not be dealt with by the Senate? </para>

It draws  no line between the two sets of cases. The suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> would overcome the difficulty. If his suggestion were adopted, every case in which there was a dispute would be referred to the proper legal tribunal, and where there was no dispute the matter would be settled by the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - In trying to do the right thing, we should be careful not to go too far. I can understand that some honorable senators are very anxious to have every matter in connexion with elections, where there is a possibility of a dispute, referred to the High Court. There is an obvious reason for that. But, on the other hand, there is also a reason why we should not be parties to imposing unnecessary expense upon any one who has run as a candidate for Parliament. Under section 34 of the Constitution it is provided that a member of the House of Representatives moist be of the full age of twenty-one years. I take it that if any question as to the age of a member arose a duly qualified copy of the register of the person's birth, lodged with the Senate, would be sufficient. </para>

                        <para>- It appears to me that we could not go past a certificate of birth duly attested unless it could be proved that the person whose seat was challenged was not the person referred to in the certificate of birth produced. Of course, such a contingency might arise. In any case, we should be careful not to impose unnecessary expense on persons whose qualifications are contested. In our anxiety to divest ourselves of all responsibility in connexion with these matters, we may possibly go too far. I do not see why a case of the age of a member, the fact whether he was an elector, or was a subject of the King, either born or naturalized, could not be dealt with by the Senate when sufficient evidence could be placed before honorable senators. Then, under section 44, we have the various disqualifications set out, and the first is a person who is under any acknowledgment of allegiance to a foreign power. The facts in such a case ought to be easily ascertainable and could be submitted to the Senate. Then, again - " Is attainted of treason." Surely evidence on that matter could easily be obtained. Once more - " Is an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent." There ought to be no difficulty about that. </para>

                        <para>- It is the business of' lawyers to manufacture differences in connexion with every conceivable question. But we must try not to go too far. If we refer everything to the High Court; what will be the result? If a man's position as a senator is disputed, even on the most trivial grounds, he will be dragged into the High Court, compelled to employ counsel, and be subjected to all the irritation and expense of a long law suit, whilst probably the grounds will be utterly trivial. We ought in these matters to be guided by common-sense. It is just as possible to go to extremes in the one direction as in the other. No senator is more anxious to purge the Senate of unseemly party conflicts over such matters than I am. But, while I have that object continually in view, I also recognise that it would be exceedingly hard if we were  to subject candidates to what might possibly degenerate into a persecution. </para>

That is the reason why I think we ought to pause before we accept the clause as it stands, or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment. I think it is quite possible so to frame a clause as to cover almost every contingency, and provide that where proof positive is given the Senate's decision shall be final. If there is reasonable cause for calling that proof in question, the election should be referred to the High Court. But who is to pay the expense? </para>

                <para>SenatorSTEWART.- That is all right in theory, but my experience is that the man with the longest purse usually comes off best in law cases.

                <para>Courts of the States. Only banisters of the highest standing are usually feed in connexion with such cases. Considerable expenditure on travelling might have to be incurred on account of witnesses. A senator might be subjected to so much expense that even if he succeeded in establishing his case he might be made a bankrupt, and in that event would lose his seat ; so that his latter end would be worse than the beginning. We ought to be exceedingly careful not to agree to an amendment which would throw senators absolutely and without any reservation into the whirlpool of the High Court. </para>

                    <para>. - The Committee generally are desirous of sending every case of this kind in which there is a dispute to the High Court. But the question arises - How are we going to determine what are cases in dispute? I take it that any case is in dispute if the Senate is not practically unanimous about it. If a question of age arises, there is a certificate, and I do not think there would be any difficulty about the Senate passing an  unanimous resolution in Such a case. I suggest that the clause should be altered to provide that a question may be referred by unanimous resolution of the Senate to the High Court. If we adopted words conveying that idea, the effect would be to send cases about which there was a dispute straight away to the Court of Disputed Returns. If one senator dissented, that <inline font-style="italic">would</inline> constitute a dispute, but if the Senate was unanimous on the subject, I take it that there would be no dispute, and the Senate itself would deal with the matter. We could have no party feeling where we were all of one opinion. </para>

                        <para>- That is very easily done. For the moment, I was under the impression that if a certificate were presented to the Senate with a view of establishing the fact that produced the disqualification, that would be sufficient. But on reflection, I see that that is not what would happen. Some one would have to petition the Senate, pointing out the disqualification ; or a member of the Senate might move in the matter, which would be equivalent to a petition. The moment that took place, we should be obliged to refer the question of fact to the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications, in order to inquire into the facts. Once that was done, we should be plunged into the whole trouble that we wished to avoid. We should have a party question raised, because the Committee might, on the facts, arrive at a certain conclusion, and it would be perfectly competent for a party vote to reverse the decision and leave the person whose qualification was challenged in possession of the seat. For the moment, I thought that there might be two classes of cases. It is now perfectly plain to me that there can only be one, and that unless we make the clause absolute, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has suggested, and refer every question respecting the qualifications of a senator to the High Court, we shall not achieve the object we all have in view. </para>

                <para>SenatorMcGREGOR.- That is what I am about to contend. If a senator is returned who is stated not to be twenty-one years of age, and he produces a certificate which shows that he is, there is no dispute. If the Senate is not satisfied, or if a few are not satisfied, there is a dispute straight away, which should undoubtedly go to the Court of Disputed Returns. We have not the power to send it to the Court at present. That is the very reason why the Bill has been introduced. We desire to remove such contentious cases from the Senate. On the other hand, if any question such as may be suggested by section  44  of the Constitution came before us, and the Senate was satisfied that there was nothing in the allegations, there would be nothing to send on to the Court. </para>

If a defeated candidate, or any one on his behalf, petitions the High Court, the case will not come before the Senate at all, as I understand it. But if a petition is sent to the Senate, and a dispute arises here, under this clause we shall have to send it to the tribunal to which it ought to go. </para>

                        <para>- I make that reference in  order to point out that a political body is more likely to be influenced by a passing wave of opinion than is a judicial body. If a question of that kind came before the High Court it would take the dry legal meaning of treason, and would not be influenced by a passing wave of public opinion. It must be borne in mind that a body elected by popular opinion is very susceptible to that influence, and therefore a passing wave of public opinion, at any time, might determine what was treason. A body like the Senate is really the worst body to determine a question of that kind. It should go automatically to the Court of Disputed Returns <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be determined. Then let us take another disqualification, namely, the taking of an oath of allegiance to a foreign power. That is not a simple matter to prove. At one time the Consul for Japan occupied a seat in another -place. I am told that a consul for a foreign power has to take the oath of allegiance to . that poWer because certain information, and papers come into his possession which he is required not to disclose. Suppose that an honorable senator was consul for a foreign power. How would it be possible for the Senate to determine whether he had taken the oath of allegiance to that power? Where could we find a record of the fact? </para>

                        <para>- A question may arise when a charge of treason is laid against a senator and the Senate is asked to refer the matter to the Court. It may be a clear case of treason, but the views to which the accused senator has given vent may represent the views of the majority here for the time being and they may decline to refer the matter to the High Court. I want a question of that kind to be determined, not by a chance majority in the Senate, but by a judicial tribunal. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and they would do great violence to their consciences If they decided against the facts. But where the marginal line is very narrow, where there is a legitimate opening for a difference of opinion as to what is treason or allegiance to a foreign power, the majority as a rule will give the benefit of the doubt to themselves and to the man who is on their side. There is another point to be considered. Have honorable senators ever considered what is meant by the absence of a senator for two months? Does it mean absence from his last day's attendance from the Senate or from the next possible meeting of the Senate? What it really means is arguable. I hope that for the sake of preventing these cases coming before the Senate again the Committee will agree to the amendment. Otherwise I am satisfied that a loophole will be left for such cases arising! here again. In all probability a charge of treason would not be laid against the senator except when there was great excitement on some question, and that would be the worst time for the Senate to deal with a case of that kind. The possibility of such cases arising furnishes a strong reason why we should not retain the power to deal with them. </para>

                    <para>. - I am inclined to think that the amendment should be accepted. As you, sir, have just suggested, cases may arise which may involve not matters of. dispute but questions of qualification or disqualification, and these might be very contentious. For instance, it is provided in sub-section 2 of section 34 of the Constitution that a senator -  must be a subject of the Queen, either natural born, or for at least 5 years naturalized under a law of the United Kingdom, or of a Colony which has become or becomes a State, or of the Commonwealth, or of a State. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The interpretation of that provision might raise very contentious matters. I may mention that in one case of a disputed election petition it might be a very fine point of law to determine whether a man was or was not a natural born or naturalized subject.. One can imagine that a question of that kind would be highly contentious, and naturally the Senate would refer it to the Court. It is just as well, however, ' that we should provide for its automatic reference to that body. Then in section 44, which deals with disqualifications, there is an expression which apparently looks very simple, but which it is very difficult to determine, and which only a Court can properly determine. A person is incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator if he -  has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth, otherwise than as a member, and in common with the other members of an incorporated company, consisting of more than twenty-five persons. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I can remember a case which had to go to the Privy Council for an interpretation of words nearly equivalent to those words. The more I consider questions of qualification or disqualification, and questions which may arise, the more I think that it will be consistent with the resolution of the Senate, as well as probably in harmony with public opinion, if we refer the interpretation of all such statements to the Court of Disputed Returns. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Lawyers could raise questions which might accentuate political differences of opinion. The more I look at the clause in the light of legal knowledge and experience, the more it seems that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment will achieve what we all desire. Now that we have decided to place in the hands of. the High Court for decision every possible case of disputed election, it will be wise to refer to the Court also, without any limitations, all cases of qualification and disqualification. If the amendment is accepted, the clause should be made to cover questions both of qualifications and disqualifications. The right of a naturalized or natural-born subject to sit might arise under the word "qualification," while the word " disqualification " would include a question of direct or indirect pecuniary interest, and so on. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not feel that I can support the mandatory amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> All that is necessary is provided in the clause as it stands. If the amendment is agreed to, it will be mandatory to refer to the High Court a case where a man admitted that he was guilty of the offence charged against' him, and so he might be involved in a large amount of costs in spite of his having admitted his guilt. It is not necessary for a case of that kind to go to the High Court. The question of treason which has been raised furnishes the strongest reason why the clause should be retained as it stands. The Senate should retain power to consider such a case, and to send it to the High Court if it thinks desirable. There might, at a particular time of great excitement, be a wave of public opinion in a certain direction, and the public might be prepared to adjudge a man guilty of treason on the spur of the moment. It has been suggested that the High Court would be a greater protection against such a wave of public opinion condemning a man than the Senate would, but I take exactly the opposite view. </para>

                        <para>- Even under the clause, the Senate itself would have no power to unseat a man for that reason. I know of no wave of public opinion that would affect this Chamber that would not equally affect the minds of the Judges.I know of no instance in the history of the world where the Judges have been more democratic, or given a more  liberal interpretation of any Constitution, than have the Parliaments themselves. In a case such as I have mentioned, a very salutary delay would take place before a decision was arrived at, because, by the terms of the clause, the Senate could not unseat the man, but would have to pass a resolution referring the question to the High Court. There never will be a case of a wave of public opinion, where there will not be found a few men with courage enough to create a debate in this Chamber. That debate would have a stimulating and sobering effect upon public opinion. The necessary delay entailed in getting a resolution carried in the Senate before the case was sent to the High Court would have a very good restraining effect upon public opinion, and also give an indication that there was really a sound dispute. On one occasion the Victorian Parliament, during a wave of excitement, yielded to public opinion that had been fomented by the press, and unseated a man. If the Victorian Parliament had had the power to refer, by resolution, a case of that kind to the Court, I believe that, after the debate and delay that would have been necessary, and the consequent sobering of public opinion, that member would never have been unseated. In cases of the kind, delay is necessary to give public opinion an opportunity to right itself, and to afford a better chance of absolute justice being done. In any case,  I  would rather trust the Senate, consisting of thirty-six members, than two individuals constituting a High Court. </para>

If a certificate from such a Court that  a  senator had been convicted of treason were lodged with the Senate, the Senate would have no alternative but to declare his seat vacant. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a little difficulty about the alteration of the clause, and I may find it necessary to reconsider it. It is proposed now, with the object of automatically referring these cases to the High Court, to leave out the words "by resolution." A question arises within the Senate, and it may be necessary for the Senate to do something to get rid of it. That is a difficulty which must be met, and requires further consideration. Of course the proposed new section has been drawn on the assumption that the words proposed to be left out should remain a part of it, and if they are omitted, it may be necessary to substitute other machinery. </para>

                    <para>. - As the Vice-President of the Executive Council has suggested that it may be necessary to recommit the proposed new section, I suggest that the words "or disqualification" should be inserted after the word " qualification." I. take it that the word "qualification " covers conditions precedent as well as subsequent to an election, which might raise an issue which it would be very proper to refer to the High Court. On the other hand, the word " disqualification " would seem to relate to matters subsequent to election, and to deal with a different set of conditions. I am guided in making the suggestion by the fact that the word " qualification " is used in the marginal note attached to one of the sections of the Constitution, whilst it has been thought necessary to use the word "disqualification " in a marginal note attached to another of the sections. </para>

                        <para>- He might be inquire a good position financially, and yet be an undischarged bankrupt. We had a case of the kind in Queensland only a few months ago. A man had become insolvent nearly twenty years ago, and failed to procure his discharge. He is now, I believe, in an independent financial position, and yet he lost his seat in Parliament, because  he had neglected to procure his discharge. If he had 'been elected to the Federal Parliament, under the proposed new section, as amended, he would be dragged before the High Court, and compelled to pay the expenses incurred by the petitioner, even although - as the man to whom I refer actually did in Queensland - he admitted the fact, made no appearance, and left the matter to go by default. What I am pleading for is that the Senate should retain the power to deal with such cases. </para>

If it is contended that, in such circumstances as I have related, the person whose seat is challenged would not have to bear the cost, why should we put the petitioner to the cost of going to the Court ; or, if the petitioner is not to bear the cost, why should we put the country to the expense involved?

                        <para>- If the Senate could deal with the matter, there would be no expense. Does the honorable senator mean to say that a case such as I have suggested could be referred to the Court without expense? There would, in the first instance, be the expense of setting up the Court of Disputed Returns. Then, as I have pointed out, the petitioner- would have to appear either in person or by counsel, and would require to have his witnesses within call to prove his case if necessary. However, it does not matter to me. I do not expect -that I shall ever have to go before a Court of Disputed Returns, and some one else will have to bear the expense. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, a question might be raised by any member' of the Senate under the proposed new section, and if it were passed as amended the matter would have to be referred to the High Court. I might get up in the Senate and say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> had been convicted of treason; that he was an undischarged bankrupt, or was undergoing a sentence. The question having been raised, there would be no possibility of doing other than send it to the High Court. Suppose that there is really nothing in the allegations - that the respondent is neither an undischarged bankrupt, nor- attainted of treason, nor disqualified on any of the other grounds enumerated in the Constitution. Nevertheless, the question having been raised, he would have to go to the High Court. If there was any expense he would have to pay it. There is no petition in question. There is no charge of any description, except that raised in the Senate. But as soon as the question is raised, if the clause is passed in its present form, it will have to go to the High Court. I agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> .desires, but an amendment will have to be made in the clause to carry out the intention properly. </para>

We should have one member of the Senate accusing another of being disqualified under the Constitution. That would provoke discussion in which party bias would be introduced. The debate would be conducted on party lines. That is the kind of thing we wish to obviate in future. </para>

The overwhelming opinion of honorable senators seemed to be that all such cases should be automatically referred, and consequently words were struck out of the clause. But, that having been done, I certainly do recognise difficulties. It will be my duty between now and to-morrow to reconsider the clause carefully, and it will have to be recommitted, so as to take the necessary safeguards to avoid contingencies which might arise under it. </para>

                        <para>- The word " person " is very wide. We might  make  the clause read "any person enrolled or entitled to be enrolled." The foundation  of  such a petition as is contemplated is  that  the person petitioning is not properly represented. Of course the responsibility is to a great extent on the shoulders of the Vice-President -of the Executive Council. </para>

Undoubtedly he would have the right to be heard as a party to the case without asking the opinion of the Court. The proposed new section says - </para>

                <para class="block">If the original petitioner was not interested, he would not lodge a petition. Having presented his petition, he is entitled to be heard by the Court. But is it contemplated that a person who can show the Court that he is also interested shall have the right to be heard ? That is the point I wish to be made clear. The clause provides more and more work for the lawyers, because if any person other than the original petitioner appears before the Court, he will have to demonstrate to its satisfaction that he is interested, and that will probably involve much legal argument on both sides, many fees and refreshers, and a great waste of time and good money. </para>

                        <para>-  I was expecting to find that power included among the powers of the Court in this proposed new section. It has been suggested that a senator might accuse a fellow senator of being disqualified, or of not having a good title to his seat. If such a case should arise, and  find its way to the Court, that body should have the power to declare the petition frivolous, and award costs to the person against whom it was lodged. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that the contingency which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> seeks to provide against cannot possibly arise. A mere charge made across the. floor in debate as to a senator lacking a qualification would not raise a question for transmission to the Court. The probability is that the  President  or the  Chairman  would rule such a declaration out of order as a reflection upon a senator. </para>

                        <para>- But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has proposed an amendment with regard to expenses, and it is to the effect that if any senator, or other person, makes a charge of that kind against another senator, he must deposit the sum of <inline font-style="italic">£50.</inline> The English language is not sufficient to enable me to express my opinion of the ridiculous character of the proposal, as applied to senators. I never heard of such a stupid proposition in my life. We hear the most extravagant charges made by one senator against another, but we take no notice of them. If they are more than ordinarily bad, the  President  or the  Chairman  calls upon their author to withdraw them and to apologize ; he does so, and the storm blows over. If, however, this extraordinary measure is placed on the statute-book, we shall be in a peculiar position. Immediately one senator tells another senator that he is under an acknowledgment of allegiance or obedience to a foreign power, or is attainted of treason, the accusation will be referred to the Court. </para>

I wish again to express my dissatisfaction with the bungling fashion in which the measure has been handled by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best.</inline> He has weakly allowed himself to be led into a most peculiar position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> had an idea in his head, which he tried to carry out to the best of his ability. The Vice-President of the Executive Council did not exactly agree with him ; but, because he thought the numbers were against him, he refrained from even telling the Committee what the ultimate effect of the amendment, if carried, would be. </para>

                        <para>- Words are cheap. If the honorable senator had known his business, he would not have permitted this peculiar crisis to arise, whereby one member can accuse another of having committed an offence, or of being subject to a disqualification, and then the matter, on that member's mere assertion, must be referred to the High Court. Did any one ever hear of anything so ridiculous ? The whole thing is branded with stupidity from beginning to end. </para>

                    <para>. - The extraordinary heat evidenced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> who is usually so mild, was a matter of surprise to myself and many other honorable senators. The honorable senator has also given a sample of inconsistency. He drew a harrowing picture of a senator, who was accused of being an insolvent, being obliged to go to the High Court to have his case decided, whereas, about five minutes previously, he welcomed an amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> to provide that any case in which there was any dispute should be immediately referred to the High Court. I draw his attention to the impossibility of expecting any man to submit quietly to an accusation of being an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent. The person accused would immediately dispute the charge, and, therefore, it would be a case " in dispute." </para>

                        <para>- The amendment which I have proposed is very necessary, and would prevent the possibility of such a case as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has pictured arising in the future. Unless a person has substantial grounds for disputing the title of an honorable senator to sit, he will not move in the matter, but, if he takes action on frivolous grounds and without proper justification, prompted only by political or personal motives, it is right that the Senate or the Court of Disputed Returns should have sufficient power to declare his petition or his action in raising the question to be frivolous, and mulct him in adequate costs. Although the Vice-President of the Executive Council may be satisfied that that power is already possessed and has been exercised in the past by the Court, I consider that it is wise to give the Court the specific power which my amendment would confer. In that way  the author of any flimsy petition or objection, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> depicts, could be saddled with heavy costs. I simply ask the Committee to destroy the remotest chance of any frivolous petition being presented to the High Court. After all <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> objections to this measure, is it not in keeping with the present trend of thought everywhere to remove petitions of this kind from the political arena to some independent and impartial body ? </para>

                    <para>. - The desire of the Committee all through this discussion has been, as far as possible, to take anything in the nature of a dispute out of the hands of the Senate. We seem to be fairly unanimous on that point, but no one here is likely to support a proposal which would allow all kinds of ridiculous and frivolous charges to be taken to the Court of Disputed Returns. No reasonable person would say that a mere charge hurled across the Chamber in the heat of debate should be sent on to the Court for investigation. </para>

                        <para>- When the honorable senator can say anything venomous - of course, the question of its truth is of no moment - in order to gratify his own feelings, he does not hesitate to do so. I told honorable senators when this clause was reached that the scheme of the Bill was that the Senate, if it chose, should have the right to decide by resolution that these questions should be remitted to the Court. That provision left it open to the Senate, in simple cases such as I cited, to come to a decision without a reference to the Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> made certain suggestions, in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> largely concurred. The outcome was a general expression of opinion on the part of honorable senators that, if possible, a resolution of the kind provided for in the clause should be avoided, as it would result in the introduction of the political aspect into the consideration of the case. I said that it was a matter purely for the Senate to decide, and that if they so decided I should endeavour to carry out their wishes. I even went so far as to explain to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that if the clause was amended as suggested it would be necessary for me to recommit it in order to provide the requisite safeguards. I made that absolutely clear, and yet the honorable senator charges me with disregarding my duties as the leader of the Senate, and making some explanation which I do not understand, in spite of my distinct promise to the Senate that I would reconsider the clause, and make certain proposals in regard to it. My anxiety is to carry out the wishes of the Senate, and I undertook to do so from the. beginning. As to the amendment immediately before the Chair, the scheme of this particular portion of the Bill was not to be by petition. It was provided that if the question was raised by a resolution of the Senate, it was to be forwarded to the Court. Section 197 of the Electoral Act is specifically embodied in this clause. When the question goes to the Court, section 197 provides that the Court shall have power to award costs. Section 202B of the same part of the Electoral Act provides that the. Court may award costs against an unsuccessful party to the petition. But in this clause no petition was involved. It all depended upon the resolution of the Senate. It will be necessary in the circumstances to provide some machinery to take the place of that resolution. I shall have to consider what that machinery should be. If I can make any other suggestion in order to carry out the wish of the Senate, I shall endeavour to do so, but at this particular stage it is quite impossible to make a definite proposition on a matter which involves considerable and serious difficulty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch'</inline> s amendment in the . circumstances is hardly relevant or necessary. The Act itself provides for the awarding of costs. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. That is what the Vice-President of the Executive Council or the Committee will have to. do later. Something must be substituted for what we have taken out of the proposed new sections. 1 think the difficulty can only be overcome by providing that in future all questions must be submitted to the Court by petition. But as a petition is not involved in the matter we are now discussing, I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will see that his amendment is not applicable. The probability is that when the necessary amendments are submitted, on recommittal, the honorable senator will find that the rest of the" principal Act will apply, and such an amendment as he now proposes will not be necessary. . We have been led into some confusion by the adoption of ill-considered amendments in the first instance. </para>

                    <para>. - There is nothing novel* in what has been proposed: If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> will look about him, he will find that in some of the States it has already been provided that every form of dispute in connexion with an election must be removed entirely from the control of the State Parliament, and referred to a Court of Disputed Returns. As the Vice-President of the Executive Council is not disposed to accept my amendment, I ask him to take into serious consideration the necessity for some amendment of the Bill, which will have the effect of deterring persons from presenting petitions or raising questions challenging the seat of a member of Parliament without substantial reason. I think we should specifically provide in the Bill that it shall not, in future, be a paying proposition for any person, without good grounds, to take action with the object of unseating a member of Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. - I protest against the passage of paragraph h of clause 13, and I intend to move that it be left out. It appears to me that we have arrived at a stage in the consideration of this Bill when we must decide either to limit the powers of the Commonwealth in dealing with quarantine, or to permit the Commonwealth Government to exercise quarantine powers to the fullest extent from one end of Australia to the other. I do not object to the Commonwealth Government exercising the fullest powers conferred by the Constitution in connexion with oversea quarantine. But when we are asked to give the Governor-General power to declare any part of the Commonwealth or a State in which any quarantinable disease, or any disease or pest affecting animals or plants exists, to be a quarantinable area, I draw the line. [ am not prepared to go as far as' is proposed in this Bill in that respect. I think it would be most undesirable to do so. I am satisfied that the States authorities are likely to be infinitely more careful than the Commonwealth Government of the administration of internal quarantine. The Commonwealth Government could not exercise the care now being given to such matters by the States authorities, except at a cost that would be unreasonable and altogether unnecessary. It may fairly be admitted that in the past the States Governments have taken such steps from time to time as have been necessary to enable them to deal as effectually as possible with diseases affecting human beings, animals, and plants. They have endeavoured, especially in connexion with plants, to discover a remedy for most of the pests known in. Australia. </para>

                        <para>- With regard to oversea quarantine, I quite agree with the honorable senator, but I am satisfied that a State itself is infinitely better qualified to deal with quarantine within a State than the Commonwealth can be at any time. Further, I believe that legislation of this description will have a tendency to create friction. There will be a suspicion that undue pressure is being brought against one State as compared with others. One of the clearest examples of that was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> who pointed out that during the prevalence of the tick pest Queensland had a solid grievance against New South Wales, because of the quarantine restrictions set up against taking stock over the borders. </para>

                        <para>- If I thought that there would be no such difficulty, I  should have no hesitation in supporting the Bill. But I believe that if the Bill is passed in its present form the Commonwealth will practically have the right to do, with regard to matters of inland quarantine, exactly what it has the right to do regarding oversea quarantine. That is the great danger that I see. So soon as the Commonwealth thinks it necessary to declare certain portions of a State quarantine areas, whilst other districts in the same State are pronounced by the Commonwealth authorities to be clean, an adjacent State will probably think that cattle infected by disease are permitted to come from the unclean portions of the State into the clean portions, and thence into other States. It will be feared that infected cattle are coming, not from the ostensibly clean portions, but really from the tainted portions. </para>

                        <para>-I should like to strike out everything which gives the Commonwealth power to take away quarantine authority within the borders of any State. Undoubtedly, if we give the Commonwealth power to deal with quarantine for the whole of Australia, we give it a power that will land us in endless difficulties, whilst our quarantine areas will not be nearly so well supervised or controlled as they are at present. Is it not to the interest of every State to look after the health of its people, its animals, and those of its plants which are commercially valuable? Can any one imagine that the Commonwealth is capable, or will at any time be capable, of looking after the interests of the States in these respects better than they do it themselves? Imagine an epidemic of any kind breaking out in any part of the Commonwealth. Is it for a moment conceivable that the States would neglect the proper handling of that epidemic, so as to prevent its spread? I cannot for the life of me see how it can be imagined that a State would be so culpably negligent of the welfare of its people ; and I do not for a moment believe that the Commonwealth would ever be in a position to deal so immediately and effectively with such cases as would the States themselves. I believe that I am acting in, the best interests of the Commonwealth and of the whole of the States. I trust that the Committee will limit the powers of the Commonwealth in quarantine matters entirely to oversea affairs. </para>

But it has been brought up again by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> who, I am afraid, is affected with "State fright." The very essence and genius of this Bill is not that we are going to have two parties in contradistinction with each other, but that there is to be co-operative action on the part of Commonwealth and State. There is no desire on the part of the Commonwealth, and it is not the intention of this Bill, nor will it be the intention of the administration under it, to interfere unduly with the internal working of any State in combating diseases affecting persons, animals, or plants. </para>

                        <para>- The clause provides that the Governor-General may, by proclamation, do certain things. If the Commonwealth sees that a State is doing its duty with regard to any matter of this description, it will not interfere. The Commonwealth is not going to proclaim any area within a State to be a quarantine area unless it sees that it is absolutely necessary to do so. The illustration which the honorable senator gave simply cuts away his own argument. He said that there might be some disease affecting animals or plants existing only in a particular area of a State, and that an adjoining State might refuse to take cattle or plants from the State affected, because it would not believe that they came from the clean parts. That illustration seems to imply a doubt in his own mind as to whether a State would do its duty, and proclaim a certain part a quarantine area, as it ought to do in the circumstances described. It is a reasonable thing to give this power to the Commonwealth in case a State does not do its duty. This Bill is intended to bring about harmonious working between Commonwealth and States for the good of the people as a whole. To-day we are not working together in matters of this description. The Bill will be an absolute absurdity, if we are going to say that any part of Australia is not to be subject to Commonwealth rule in respect to quarantine. </para>

He is of the opinion that if a, State quarantines the whole or a part of its territory, that is the end of the matter.

                        <para>- Western Australia may declare every portion of its territory clean, but South Australia may be of a different opinion, and, in that case, it is really South Australia which quarantines Western Australia. The object of this Bill is to do away with the ridiculous position which has often been taken up by individual States. Suppose that a disease broke out on an island which belongs to Western Australia. Under the Bill, only that island would be quarantined, but under the old system the whole of the State would be quarantined as against the other States. The honorable senator knows that that terrible disease called surra is confined to only a small portion of Western Australia, and that South Australia has quarantined the whole territory of Western Australia so far as the importation of animals from that State is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Under this Bill, as we are endeavouring to frame its provisions in the best interests of the States, and also of the Commonwealth, merely the area affected by the disease would be quarantined, and animals, plants, and goods would be removable in the rest of the State, or from the rest of the State to any other portion of the Commonwealth. The object of the Bill is to get rid of the difficulties which have existed under the old system, and that is why it has my support. Some State Premiers, some State members, and even some Federal members, are suffering from State fright. They think that the Commonwealth is intending to do something terrible, when it is only taking power in this Bill to co-operate with the States. If honorable senators will carefully read its provisions, they will find that it is only in cases where the State officers cannot act, or will not be allowed to act, or in some other contingency of that description, that the Commonwealth is intrusted with the power to appoint other officers. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly, the Commonwealth Government will have full power for that purpose if they cannot obtain the services of the State officers. Suppose that any State should refuse to allow' its officers to co-operate with the Commonwealth in carrying out our quarantine law. Would not the Commonwealth be in a very foolish position if it had not the right to appoint officers for that purpose? The clause is framed in the interests of the Commonwealth and its people, and I hope that, with very few modifications, it will be carried. </para>

                    <para>. - The Premier of New South Wales and the Premiers of other States have circularized some members of the Senate to the effect that they wish their representatives to oppose this clause, so far as it enables the Commonwealth to control internal quarantine in a State. I assume that no. honorable senator can possibly entertain anything but a favorable feeling towards the Bill. It has been long wanted, and if there is any advantage in Federal administration, this is certainly one of the subjects which the Commonwealth Government should take in hand. But I apply that remark to quarantine as it is generally under-: stood - to passengers and stock arriving here in oversea vessels. When, however, the Government propose to take away from the States - and that is what the clause means, however its meaning may be covered - the right to regulate matters outside ordinary quarantine in the interests of their citizens, we have to consider this Bill as it affects the powers and interests of the States.' </para>

                    has asked, by interjection, whether the Federal administration of the quarantine power in its entirety will not be more .conducive to the interests of the States than has been State administration. I believe that it" will not. It is of no use to attempt to get away from the facts. If they teach us anything, it is that the Federal administration has not been of such a character as to inspire the people of New South Wales with sufficient confidence to intrust the Commonwealth Parliament or Government with any additional powers. The Federal administration has not been of such a character as to convince the people of New South Wales that .their interests will - be better administered by this Parliament than they would be by their own Parliament.

By this clause we are asked to transfer the administration of certain details in connexion with quarantine from the States to the Commonwealth, and it appears to me that I am quite entitled to state why New South Wales considers that it is inadvisable to do so. I am merely mentioning that the people of the State, through their representatives in the State Parliament, have given expression to that view.

I have been prevented through ill health from speaking before on this measure, but I. felt so strongly, and I know that the people of New South Wales also feel strongly, about it, that I was compelled to speak on this occasion. The people of New South Wales believe that it would be better for the States to retain the powers conferred by this clause, for many reasons, one of which is that 'the self-interest of a State must lead it to act more promptly, and that a local authority can better localize and deal with an outbreak of infectious disease than could a central authority which had to govern the whole of the enormous territory of Australia. In view of the extraordinary diversity of climatic conditions and of business ramifications in the different States, it is better to leave the people of each State to protect their own interests in matters of this kind. The danger of an outbreak of bubonic plague has been referred to as a reason why the Bill should be brought into operation.

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz</inline> is still, so far as I know, making experiments. Whilst the different Chambers of Commerce, and many pastoral and agricultural bodies, as well as the Premiers of several States, have protested against the Commonwealth taking over these powers, in no single instance that I know of has there been any expression of public feeling in favour of taking away these powers from the States. That shows very strongly that no serious complaint has been made against the existing State administration of health matters: ' We know that there has been a certain amount of friction as between State and State, but those disputes have been more matters of business than anything else, and so could have been satisfactorily settled if relegated to the Inter-State Commission. That would be a better way of avoiding the difficulty than would the taking over by the Federal Parliament of the powers of the States in a way that will engender ill feeling as between State and State. </para>

                <para class="block">This amendment partakes of the nature of a compromise, although I know that all compromises are rather dangerous, and that the end sought to be achieved is sometimes not achieved. I was delighted to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson's</inline> remarks as to the powers of the States to deal with their own health concerns. I hold with him that the States have the most powerful inducements themselves to look after their own health, and that no powers that we can put in force could be stronger than those possessed by the States to protect themselves from the spread of infection. During this discussion, I have been glad to hear it continually iterated that the sole desire of the Government is to work in aid of the State machinery and State laws. Clause 11 gives the Government power to enter into arrangements with the States with respect to any matters necessary or convenient to be done in order to enable the Commonwealth quarantine authorities and the State health authorities to work in aid of one another. We have passed that clause. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to know, first, what position the Government are going to take up. Do they regard the amendment as antagonistic to clause11, or will they accept it as a clear expression of their desire to work in with the States authorities? If they regard it as antagonistic, will they point out how far it is antagonistic to their desire to work in with the State  authorities? I am trying to hold, in this case, a middle position. I know that it is a difficult and somewhat dangerous position to hold, because the result may displease those who advocate exclusive Commonwealth powers, while, at the same time, it may not satisfy those who desire to assert the supremacy" of the States jurisdiction. All that I ask by the amendment is that the powers conferred under paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">g, h,</inline> and i, of clause 13, shall be deemed and be construed to be in aid of the States laws and States administration. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to find that I am getting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> on my side. If the Committee has not declared the contrary, and honorable senators have no desire to make such' a declaration, I may expect to receive support for what might be called a half-way clause. I supported an amendment which was proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> because -I did not believe in either the wisdom or the expediency of allowing the Commonwealth Government to interfere in matters of internal quarantine. That amendment was defeated. It is evident that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> cannot succeed with a similar amendment, and I submit that if the Committee accept the amendment I have proposed, it will be a distinct intimation in clear and explicit terms on the face of the Bill that the Commonwealth authority will respect the States administration and machinery before interfering in internal quarantine. I think that the term "quarantine " in this connexion is misused, as what is referred to are rather matters of health than of quarantine. I pointed out that in the United States, whether or not they have the powers we possess under our Constitution, it has been made clear in the Acts of Congress, and in the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, that in that country the great desire of the Federal authority in the matter of quarantine is to assist the States authorities. I read a portion of a judgment of Chief Jus_.tice Marshall "in the celebrated case of <inline font-style="italic">Gibbons</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Ogden,</inline> in which he pointed out that it had been the practice of the United States Legislature, notwithstanding the powers the Federal authority had under the commerce sections of their Constitution, at all times to aid the States authorities in matters of health and quarantine. When this Bill was under consideration in another place this matter was presented for careful consideration. It was naturally discussed from the States point of view, and, as a result, sub-clause 3 of clause 13 was introduced as an amendment. This provides that where the Federal Government wish to intervene in matters of internal quarantine, the Governor-General must first intimate to the States authorities the intention to over-ride their legislation and administration, and that certainly implies that reasons would be given for doing so. It seems to me that my amendment is in harmony with the spirit and intention of sub-clause 3 of clause 13, because it proposes that before they can intervene, and say to the States authorities that the States laws are deficient, the Commonwealth Government must show that they ' have exhausted the machinery and administration of the States; without effect. I understand that that is. what the Minister desires. I know that the States Governments are anxious to preserve every tittle of their internal power. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has effectively answered that question by showing that the Government and people of a State have a greater incentive to prevent the spread of disease within a State than the Commonwealth authority can claim to have. Where these State authorities have the necessary powers under State legislation, in view of the fact that they will have every incentive to do so, we can surely allow1 them to administer the health laws they have passed before we intervene to make use of the extreme powers assumed by the Federal Government under this Bill. In discussing a previous clause, I suggested a contingency which I do not say will be realized - that if we, as is' proposed in this Bill, assert every power which the Commonwealth Government can claim under the Constitution within the scope of the word." quarantine," under the broad interpretation given to the term in this measure, the States Governments might say, " You have asserted your powers. You have resisted the representatives of the States, who have, *.&amp;n our behalf, urged a recognition of our powers, and now you had better take over the whole business. We shall pay no more health officials. We shall discontinue our scientific researches in connexion with various diseases, -and you must  accept the responsibility." If the "States Governments adopted that course,  what  would be the result? Has the Commonwealth Government at command the means or machinery to deal with internal quarantine and matters affecting public health within the States as effectively as the States Governments can deal with them at the present time ? </para>

                        <para>- Then it can only be done by regulation and administration. May I also ask, if that is what is proposed to be done, why there should be any resistance to my amendment ? If honorable senators do not approve of it, it is shown that they are prepared, without sufficient reason, to do away with the States administration of internal quarantine, because the object of my amendment is only to make in the Bill, itself such a declaration as we have already to some extent made in clause n, and as is made in subclause 3 of clause 13. Practically, the Minister and his supporters are taking up this position: They say, "We promise that we will not materially interfere with your administration until the interests of the Commonwealth are imperilled. We require the use of your buildings and machinery, and we promise that we will make use of your machinery and administration as far as possible." When that promise is made on the floor of the Senate, I ask the Minister to put it in the Bill, and make it as clear there as it has been made to the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- With all deference to the honorable senator, I  think nothing could make it more clear. As. the Government claim power to control internal quarantine, especially in connexion with animals and plants, I say. that we should make it clear on the face of the Bill that before the Federal authority exercises that power it must be shown that all powers in the hands of the States authorities, under local health laws and machinery, shall first have been exhausted. What is the value of the promise we have had from the other side if honorable senators are not prepared to accept this amendment? Either they require the assistance of the States machinery and legislation or they do not. . </para>

                        <para>- No; if that were what I desired, I should have worded my amendment quite differently. I wish the honorable senator to note that my amendment does not affect in the slightest degree what is alleged to be the exclusive power or the implied powers of the Federal authority to enter a State to control internal quarantine. The amendment is intended to be in aid of State laws. It will not derogate from the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, because if the State machinery will not work there will be nothing to prevent the Commonwealth Government from using its constitutional power. This is the last form of compromise between State power and Commonwealth power. </para>

                        <para>- If there is no effective State law, the implied or reserved powers of the Commonwealth can at once be exercised. But where a State was trying to deal with a difficult situation, my amendment would enable the Commonwealth to aid that State, but not to supersede its administration until the State administration proved to be ineffective. We have not been able to keep the hands of the Commonwealth off the internal administration of the States, but we are seeking to lay it down clearly in the Bill in black and white that we will respect the administration of the States, whilst not preventing the Commonwealth, in an extraordinary emergency, from using its powers. Let me draw attention to the way in which State administration has proved ineffective. I do not believe that in the whole of Australia there is a health administration that has done more to prevent the spread of disease than has that of Queensland in regard to bubonic plague and the tick pest. </para>

                        <para>- In regard to the tick alone, our State voluntarily suffered an immense loss to protect the rest of Australia from infection. Whatever mistakes may be attributed to it in the administration of the quarantine law in that instance, on the whole it succeeded. Queensland went to immense expense.* ' It traced the origin and development of the disease minutely. It made many experiments. That being so, is it not commonsense and common prudence to use that administration which has been so effective for its purpose? Take bubonic plague. The disease has been stamped out. although Queensland is in the position of being, so to speak, the sentinel in the east to protect Australia from plague. All that I am asking for is that my amendment shall be accepted with the view of enabling the Commonwealth Government to aid State administration. </para>

                        <para>. - Since the question of compulsory military service was brought before the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> three or four years ago, many meetings have been held and many associations formed in various parts of the Commonwealth to further the movement. A considerable number of persons have been won over to the principle of compulsory service. Indeed, I know of no movement which, in the same short period, has made such rapid progress as has this movement. Associations have been formed in various States; and newspapers which were formerly silent on the subject, and public men holding responsible positions and representing all shades of political thought, are now more or less in favour of a compulsory system of military service. At a Labour Conference I had an opportunity to submit a motion affirming that principle, and it was only defeated by a very harrow majority. I dare say that at the next Congress it will be carried by a very great majority, because public opinion seems to be setting in" favour of a system different from that to which Britishers have been accustomed during the last five or seven years. Any one who has considered the subject, from either the Commonwealth or the Empire stand-point, must admit that the present system has not g'iven us that sense of security which would warrant its continuance. Indeed, it is admitted on all -hands that the volunteer system has been proved to be a failure in British politics, and, I think, in a greater degree in Australian politics. A fear seems to be entertained, especially amongst those of the same way of political thinking as myself, that in adopting the compulsory system we might create amongst the people a spirit which would produce a great deal more harm than good. It has been argued that once the spirit of militarism was aroused in the community, it might run to riot and engender' that most objectionable spirit known as jingoism. When we recollect how that spirit has manifested itself amongst the most civilized, cultured, and advanced peoples of the world, we must recognise that there is a little justification for persons to entertain such a fear. If we inquire into what has been the experience of the most advanced peoples of the world, we find that the spirit of jingoism has been more or less prominent at certain periods of their history. All nations have suffered from this cause, and I think that even our own people have as much to answer for in that respect as have' any other peoples. We know that we are just as prone to such outbursts of feeling as are any of the continental peoples. If we read the history of continental peoples we see that a number of arguments might be advanced against adopting the compulsory principle and incurring the risk of the danger to which I have referred. France is a very glaring case in point. Because of the military success which the French achieved under Napoleon, they went on the rampage and continued to pursue a mad policy of jingoism for several generations. Until the time of the Franco-Prussian war the French were unable, apparently, to get away from the glory and the glamour of the victories achieved under the leadership of Napoleon. It was not until the Germans . combined and, . under Von Moltke, defeated the armies of France so decisively, that the French, seemed to get cured of the spirit of jingoism. And so intoxicated, apparently, were the Germans with their success that they, in turn, became the jingoes of the Continent. During the last fifteen or twenty years the Kaiser has, half a! score of times or more, almost precipitated a European war. On several occasions Europe has been almost thrown into a blaze by his jingoistic tendencies. In Russia the same state of affairs, more or less, has been brought about by the bullying policy pursued for so long by its Emperor, and it was not until the little brown man " happened along " and took a fall out of the mighty Russian Empire that the Russian seemed to get cured of the spirit of jingoism. If military success will produce this spirit in the most cultured and advanced peoples of the world, such as those I have mentioned, there is some justification for fearing that similar results might be- brought about if we adopted a compulsory system of military service. A people who have succeeded in militarism instantly Become possessed of what the Americans call "swelled head," and suffer accordingly. When military success has had that effect on European peoples, it may be expected to be developed in the Asiatic nation which has recently come to the forefront of military nations. It is only reasonable to assume that at the present moment the Japanese are just as jingoistic as, perhaps, they can afford to be. They are facing up in a rather bellicose attitude towards the United States, a mighty republic, with a population of eighty millions, and with, I suppose, the greatest amount of wealth in the world. When military success has inspired the European imagination in the way I have described, need we be surprised that it should produce a similar effect upon the Asiatic mind? . Knowing that that has been the result of military success with nation after nation throughout the world's history, we can assume that if the opportunity is presented Japan will become just as bellicose and as ready to take advantage of its military power as has any other nation. At the present time the Japanese are confined in a. very small country, and it is natural to suppose that they are anxious to expand and to get a footing on another continent. When we recall the fact that they are our nearest neighbours and are anxious to add to their territories so that they may expand, and when we also recollect that in some of our Australian towns the Japanese population are actually in a majority, we must recognise the gravity of the situation with which we are brought face to face. It may seem an extraordinary thing, but nevertheless it is a fact, that in some of the towns on the north-west coast of Australia the Japanese form a majority of the population. For instance, at Broome 70 per cent, of the men engaged in the pearling industry are of Japanese nationality. That fact, ought to suggest to honorable senators the danger which lies ahead of us. We shall be very short-sighted indeed if we do not frame a defence policy in accordance with the facts which stare us in the face. I do not wish to play the part of an alarmist, and to suggest that we are in immediate danger of war. I do not mean to insinuate anything of that kind, because I realize that so long as the alliance between Japan and the British Empire continues there is no danger of war with Japan, so far as, we are concerned. But we have to remember the actual- position of affairs in the Far East. Russia lost considerable prestige when she was defeated by Japan, and it is natural to assume that a mighty Empire such as Russia has always been regarded as being by the peoples of the world cannot afford to rest under defeat continuously. It may be that in the near future another war may be brought about in the Far East. There is still another contingency 10 be considered, and that is, that Russia and .Japan may lay their heads together, and come to an understanding, and if they do our position will become worse than it is. So long as there is a possibility of a row ensuing between the Japanese and Muscovites, we are to that extent safe ; but the moment those two powers arrive at a common understanding, then will arise the greatest menace to us as an independent people, and this demonstrates the necessity for taking some such step as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has proposed in this Bill. Suppose that Japan and Russia come to recognise that it is not worth their while to continue glaring at each other and getting ready to come to blows, and' that it would suit their purpose much better to come to terms and to apportion the territory in dispute in the Far East, directing their attention thereafter to the advancement of their own interests elsewhere. The history of the world has shown very clearly that such alliances as that between Great Britain and Japan are only continued so long as they are of benefit to both parties. The moment an alliance ceases to benefit one of the parties, that party takes the first opportunity of drawing out. It is natural, therefore, to expect that what I have indicated may happen. If Russia and Japan came to an understanding by which Russia was allowed a free hand in Manchuria, whilst Japan obtained a free hand in Korea, the two powers so apportioning that part of the Far East between them, they would then be able to direct their efforts to other parts of the world, and we should be face to face with a very grave danger. For many generations Russia has had a hungry eye on India. She bullied the British Government on the Indian frontier for a long time, and it is only since Japan took a fall out of her that her pressure in that quarter has eased off. But it might be renewed if Russia was free of any anxiety with regard to Japan. If Russia pressed on the British Empire in one direction, it is probable that Japan would press on it in another, and the most likely part of the Eastern world for Japan to direct her attention to would be the northern coast of Australia. If she once got a footing there, we should be in the gravest danger. We offer an excuse to her to attack us in that quarter by having a township, such as Broome, where her subjects are in the majority. She could claim that she had a better right to that part of the Australian coast than the British had. We ought to recognise that danger in time. If she did obtain a footing there, what force could we bring against her in defence of our right to hold this great Continent? We could not do what America is doing - bring a mighty navy around from the Atlantic to the Pacific. We could not make any demonstration in force that would be in any degree a lesson to Japan in the same way as the United States are doing. </para>

                            <para>- We could send a contingent to augment the 30,000 troops' which we have, reckoning them at their maximum strength. We might also send the <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> and our other little gun-boats, but it would be the merest farce to regard that as an adequate or sufficient force. Even if we were to make the most presentable appearance possible with our present forces, or any forces that we are likely to have in the future under present arrangements, there would be nothing to prevent Japan from doing what she liked with them. Several honorable senators think that our first line of defence ought to be on the sea. I have heard that repeated over and over again, but I could never see the force of it. Have those honorable senators ever calculated the cost to the taxpayers of Australia of providing a navy worthy of the name and fit to defend us? A modern ' battleship, of the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> type, costs nearly ^2,000,000, and. therefore, the provision of a fleet of battle-ships as a means of defence is entirely beyond the means of the Australian taxpayers. We must remember also how quickly those battle-ships become obsolete, for no sooner is one type established than we hear of some other country laying down an improved type. </para>

                            <para>- Airships may possibly be the future mode of warfare, but from what I have been able to learn about them-, they will be quite as expensive as ironclads are. Just as enormous sums could be spent on them as are being spent now by the great powers in providing navies. Any one who has given the question a thought must have seen that an Australian Navy is entirely out of the question, and that we must turn elsewhere for an adequate means of defence for the Commonwealth. It would be foolish to delude ourselves into thinking, no matter what scheme is advanced by the Government or what fancy ideas we may have of a future Australian Navy, that we can do anything but turn our attention to a system of defence which it is within our power to establish. We could establish a means of defence that would cost us only just as much as would be sufficient to arm an adequate citizen army in such a way that we could hold this country against any nation that tried to invade it. </para>

                            <para>- It is not very hard to explain, when we remember how a small people like the Boers, with a population not nearly as great as that of the smallest State in Australia, were able to hold their country so long and so well against one of the mightiest Empires of the world. When we remember what was done by that mere handful of people, and consider our .geographical position, a great distance away from other continents, and the fact that we have a population of 4,000,000, we must see that if the manhood of this country were as well trained and as well prepared to fight as the Boers were, not a nation in the world could successfully invade Australia, or land an army strong enough to keep its footing, because no nation has ships enough to bring an army here big enough for that purpose. </para>

                            <para>- That ' nation had, also, the biggest mercantile marine in the world with which to transport its troops. It had also the greatest navy in the world, and although those ships could not be used against the Boers, the bluejackets from the ships were landed, and were the most successful fighters that England sent to South Africa. Perhaps next to them were our own Australian soldiers. Our troops in Australia number only about 30,000 men, and that strength has only been achieved after an heroic effort on the part of the Commonwealth Government, and after years of criticism in this Parliament. It is only after continued agitation that we have been able to supply sufficient arms for that force. After all our efforts, we have nothing like an adequate force to protect Australia. It is utterly out of the question to expect to defend our enormous territory with such an insignificant force. If so, what other means have we of defending ourselves? We are unable to get a navy of - our own to do it, and there is even some talk of going back on the agreement entered into with Great Britain some years ago, and dispensing with the services of the Aus- ; tralian Squadron. If we intend to hold this country entirely on our own, we shall have to take other means to find sufficient troops. We have up to the present depended upon the volunteer system, and the men have not come forward to volunteer. The troops that we have got are costing this country so much that they are not justly entitled to be called volunteers. </para>

                            <para>- I am referring to the volunteers pure and simple, and to what they cost Australia to maintain. In view of the cost of this insignificant force of 30,000 men, it is quite out of .the question for us to expect by the present system to' raise an army at all adequate for the defence of the Commonwealth. Australia is not at all likely to go in for a standing army of sufficient dimensions for that purpose. The spirit of the times is against any such move. Many of the people of Australia, sooner than 'face the cost or the danger of a standing army, would be prepared to let the foreigner take the country. The only solution of the difficulty is to have an. adequate national citizen army, based upon compulsory service. I recognise the very great difficulty of bringing that system into effect straight away. Our industrial institutions would suffer, and, therefore, I welcome the proposition in this BiU as the best method of building up a proper system of defence. I admit that we cannot build up an army this year or next year. It will take several years for the cadets to be trained and grow up to be men, but every year a number of boys are reaching manhood, and within the next decade we should have a sufficient number of trained men to warrant us in saying that we could make a very presentable show. We do not need to depend upon theory or our own imagination for guidance in this matter. There are other countries in the world quite as liberty loving and democratic as we are. One of those countries - Switzerland - has put the system into practice. They have adopted the principle of compulsory service with such results that we need have very little doubt that it can be applied in a democratic country, with perfect safety to the preservation of democratic institutions. I propose to quote from the latest authority I could find on the subject, an article written by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lynch,</inline> a member of the House of Commons, who, with other members and public men, recently visited Switzerland to study the question. I suppose that honorable senators have been supplied, as I have been, with the excellent pamphlet which has been issued by the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> and which was written by Lieutenant-Colonel Reay, a gentleman who has done a very great deal to advance this movement. It is really wonderful to notice how <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lynch</inline> corroborates most of the statements made in that pamphlet. I shall read a few extracts from his article to prove the success of the Swiss system*, to show that it provides for an adequate military force, and that such a state of efficiency has been reached by the troops' of the little Republic that the Swiss are perhaps the best-armed people in the world, according to their numbers. Referring to the rifle club membership, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lynch</inline> says- </para>

                        <para>The 400-metre range is, I believe, universal in the Swiss rifle clubs, it being considered sufficient for all ordinary practice. Every citizen of military age enrolled in the Army is allowed to keep the rifle supplied him by Government at his own house; and, when he becomes free of the roll, at the age of forty-five, it becomes his property. So quite naturally these voluntary rifle clubs spring into existence - to practise the weapon that hangs on the wall of the parlor at home. </para>

Youths and adults are required to fulfil a certain term of- service .every year until a certain age has been reached, but after a man has reached, the age of forty-five years his .further service is based on the voluntary system.

These figures, taken in relation to the population of the country - about 3,000,000 souls - are eloquent of the popularity of the practice of shooting over here. England, with a population fourteen times greater, would on these figures maintain no fewer than 26,000' rifle clubs, with a membership 'of a million and a quarter. The only assistance given to the clubs by the Swiss Government is half the cost of 'the ammunition consumed -and a bonus of 2fr., or is. 8d., per member. </para>

                        <para>It- is at least possible that by this skilful blending of the two principles - the compulsory and the voluntary principle - the Swiss people may have solved the problem of a citizen army in a democratic and industrial State. These Volunteers drawn up on the Rhine almost at a stone's throw from the German frontier, represent the' preliminary tactical training of a considerable proportion of the Swiss Army, just as the voluntary rifle clubs represent the training in musketry "of the bulk of the Swiss male population. </para>
                        <para>The corps is manned by youths from the sixteenth to the twentieth year - the year when the youth hopes to pass the physical recruiting test; and we are informed that in 1906, when the recruits taken for the Army numbered about 29,000, the number of Volunteers who had passed into the third, or highest, stage of the preliminary training amounted to nearly 7,000. In addition to these corps, there were in the same year fifty-four cadet corps, or corps for boys between their twelfth and sixteenth years, with a membership of over 7,000. But military opinion in Switzerland is divided 011 the merits of the cadet corps, some holding that their tendency is to make a boy stale before he enters upon the more regular courses. </para>

                    <para class="block">If it has been found to be the actual experience in Switzerland that too much' practice as cadets makes lads stale before their actual military experience  commences, we should be very foolish if we did not guard against that kind of thing from the beginning, and make our yearly training for cadets as limited as possible consistent with efficiency. If we insist upon a continuous training, which is likely to make boys stale, we cannot hope for the success which otherwise we should have a right to expect. If we made the training of the cadets more a pleasure than a labour, we should popularize the cadet corps, and on passing from boyhood to manhood, the cadets would take on their new duties with greater vigour than if they were made stale by the training which they had to undergo under the cadet system. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lynch</inline> further says; - </para>

                            <para>- I believe that it would cost a little, but if common-sense regulations were adopted the boys would not be taken away from their ordinary work. They could put in the necessary drill in the evenings, on Saturday afternoons, at encampments during holiday, time, or at other leisure moments. I admit that if we took a large number of able-bodied men away from the industries in which they are engaged for any considerable time there "would be danger that our industrial operations would be thrown into confusion. </para>

                            <para>- I dare say that the time passed in company with others in undergoing military training would be regarded by many country youths as a relief from the monotony of country life. I should like to finish the quotation I was making so that honorable senators may learn the opinion of a writer who believes that without physique no army can be worth very much, 'if we provided exercise for our youths, combined with the scientific development of their physique, we should have a more vigorous manhood in the Commonwealth than we can look for without a system of national physical training. The advantage gained in this way should in itself be worth something to the poor people to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell has referred. The opinions of military experts who have investigated the question have been quoted in the Senate from time to .time, and they are all agreed that the health and physique of the manhood of the country is undoubtedly improved by enforced training and drilling of lads at school. Completing the quotation I made, the article continues : - </para>

The greatest military authorities in the Old Country give this proposal their support, and point to it- as "the only means by which the British Army can be made anything like what it should be. For many years past dependence has been placed on the volunteer system, and it has resulted in failure, as the British Army during the last two generations has never reached its old fighting' strength. It is nothing like the army that it used to be in ancient times. </para>

It will be far better for our youths to be drilled in fresh  air  than to stand about witnessing football and cricket matches on Saturday afternoons. It will be better for them and more profitable for the country.

                            <para>- There is no use in running with the hare and hunting with the hounds in this matter. If we are in favour of providing an adequate defence for Australia it is useless to cry out about the cost of it. It is not. good enough for anyone to howl against the compulsory system unless he is prepared to suggest a better. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has a superior method to recommend let him by all manner of means give us the benefit of his ideas. I, at all events, am satisfied that the method suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is the only one that is likely to be successful in Australia. We have had sufficient proof of the failure of the volunteer system. Certainly I am not going to bury my head in the sand and fool myself with the belief that we are able to defend Australia with the force we have at present, or with any force that we are likely to have under the existing system. Therefore I give my hearty support to the Bill. So far as I am able to judge of the various proposals that have been made, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> is the best that ' we have had before us. It will not give us a standing army straight away, but with the number of boys who are growing into manhood we shall in time, I am satisfied, have an army that will be a credit to the Commonwealth </para>

                        <para>. - The thanks of the Senate are due to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> for introducing this Bill. I question whether any measure has been placed before us which has done so much to bring the Australian people into touch with the defence requirements of " this great continent. The time has come when the people of Australia must realize that they have to depend upon themselves if they are to provide against the potentialities of the future. We must make plain to them our geographical position and the special dangers to which we are subjected on account of it. At present we are dependent almost entirely upon Great Britain for our defence. But no student of history can come to the conclusion that we have any guarantee that Great Britain will remain at peace for any long period. She is faced by grave dangers created partly by the aggressive policy of the past and partly by her commercial prosperity in the present. There is certainly an uneasy feeling prevalent amongst the people of the Mother Country, and an equally uneasy feeling on the part of foreign nations in relation to the commercial success which the United Kingdom has attained. There is unrest in India and in other portions of  His  Majesty's Dominions, and there is danger of Great Britain being brought into a serious conflict by the connivance of some of those Powers which are jealous of her- commercial prosperity. Knowing these conditions and realizing that we have to defend a coast line of nearly 9,000 miles with a population scarcely approaching 4,000,000, it is a source of uneasiness that we have practically no standing army and little better than the nucleus of an effective voluntary system. It cannot be said that we are safe so long as we remain in our present position. </para>

                            <para>- Second to none in the civilized world, I will repeat, if we study her history in relation to the recent Russian War. Japan has something even better than a standing army.  Her  people seem to. be inoculated with something of the old Mahommedan spirit. I venture to say that no other civilized troops - in the world would have done some of the things that we read about as having occurred during the Russo-Japanese War. Not only did the Japanese go to certain death with readiness, but some of their officers even committed suicide rather than endure the thought that they had not done their utmost for their country. China is only just beginning to realize her own potentialities. General Gordon said of the Chinese that, given educated officers, he believed' they would be the finest troops in the world. They are now being drilled by Japanese and German officers, and will soon realize their strength. What I fear most from Japan is this.  Her  territory is overpopulated.  Her  people are energetic; able, and possessed of every aptitude of a great commercial race. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to condemn a great people, who have proved that while they can be brave even to the point of fanaticism, they can also be generous in making terms with a vanquished enemy. When- Japan could have squeezed Russia in regard to the payment of an indemnity after the war, she diplomatically, and I think wisely, realized how far she ought to go, and nobly and generously stayed her hand. I do not forget those characteristics, while I realize that commercially some of the Japanese do not show that probity which I believe the Japanese people as a whole possess. But what we have to realize is that it would be absolutely impossible for this young country, .with its small population, under present conditions, to guard completely against aggression. For many years to come we shall be, to a considerable extent, dependent upon the Old Country. Yet the 11,000 miles of sea that divide us make it impossible for us to lie idle. We ought to commence to build a small navy of om own, and also to establish an army that will, at all events, enable us to hold our own. It is imperative that we should commence to establish a citizen soldiery as early as possible, and, in my opinion, it should be established on a compulsory basis as far as that is practicable. This great work should be started in a proper spirit - with the belief that our young men must be educated not only to be good marksmen, and to be loyal to the country, but also to be like the Swiss, and to realize that we depend upon them for our defence. I suggest to the Minister that, within reasonable bounds, the Government should incur every expense that is necessary, not only in trying to make our citizen soldiers loyal, but also in saturating them with the belief that they are looked upon as our defenders. If that policy is pursued, we shall obtain a very good practical result. I believe that the whole secret of success lies in making the army a popular institution. What is to prevent our achieving that result? In Japan, every boy, like every man, was absolutely fired with the military spirit, in fact, the Japanese were of the one mind. At present, it has, perhaps, the most popular army in the world. How did Napoleon achieve his great success? It was done by means of his great personality: He inspired every man with the feeling that he carried in his knapsack a field-marshal's baton. He made every soldier realize that he was a Frenchman, and that the duty of a Frenchman was to do all he could to defend his country. It was the same with Frederick the Great. Every man in his army was imbued with the spirit of loyalty to the country. Take, again, the Prussian army whom Von Moltke raised to such a perfect condition. It may be asked: "Surely if compulsory military education would be unpopular, how is it that the whole population of Germany rose as one man?" At that time, the military system was upheld by the German people as a body, but at present that spirit, I am sorry to say. is not so strong. There have been brought to bear certain elements which, to some extent, have weakened, not the military loyalty, but the military patriotism. </para>

                            <para>-I have read extensively on the subject, which is very complex. I have my own ideas, but it would take a considerable amount of time to state them. What I want to impress upon the Senate is that with a citizen army there must be the feeling that our defenders are doing what the citizens of Australia generally believe to be the best for the welfare and advancement of the country - in other words, a true national sentiment. If we are to have a compulsory military training, the sooner it is begun the better it will be for the country. I realize, however, that the conditions may be such that we may have to wait a considerable time before we can make a beginning.

                            <para>- I believe that from a physical point of view the lads and young men of Australia would be immensely improved by the conditions to which they would have to submit. If there is a fault in the youth of Australia, it is that they are not amenable to the influences to which the youth of other countries are amenable. I am. not suggesting that that fault is to be found in the youth outside a certain sphere, but here it exists. I venture to think that if we could induce all our young men to devote a certain amount of their time to habits of discipline it would be to the advantage of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I was not thinking of that at all, but referring to that discipline which any organized institution maintains amongst its work people. I want the young men to feel that they are under a master, and have to comply with certain conditions and obey the regulations. . I believe that before long they would realize that it not only enlarged their minds, but also improved their physique. I desire to refer to one matter, which I think bears on this subject, and which I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> to take up. In addition to a citizen army there is one very important element which we lack. It is well known to those who take an interest in military matters that our greatest trouble is to get efficient and educated officers. In New South Wales the regiments are very far short of their full complement, and instead of the authorities receiving applications for the position of officers, it is just the opposite. To a certain extent that is due, I think, to cause and effect. Let us take the history of the Civil War in the United States. The officers who came to the front and proved themselves to be great generals were almost invariably men who had been educated at West Point. The officers who have come to the front in the United Kingdom during the last few years have nearly all been men who were educated at Sandhurst. West Point is an institution which any person could enter to be trained and examined at a nominal expense. General Stonewall Jackson, General Lee, General Beauregard, and all the great generals who came to the front in the Civil War, were men who had been educated at West Point, and many of them were comparatively poor at the start. It will be generally recognised by honorable senators that those officers gave good value to the people of America for the instruction they received at West Point. It will be of very little use for us to have a citizen army unless we have educated officers to teach the men, and to regulate the conditions under which they shall serve. If the Government would institute a military college, the money would be well spent. In both England and America it is the common practice for many families to give a son to the army or to the navy and thus supply the country with educated officers. In America no one can be appointed an officer unless he has passed certain examinations at West Point. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that if the Ministry will devote their ability at once to altering the existing conditions, it will be to the advantage of the Commonwealth. It was only last week that I was conversing with a colonel in New South Wales. He gave me a most distressing account of the feeling which pervades not only the officers, but also the rank and file, in that State. The sooner the cause of that feeling is done away with the better will it be for the country and the service. I hope that the Ministry will take the hint I have thrown out. I feel confident that any money which was expended upon the establishment of a military institution would be amply repaid by the results accruing. </para>

                            <para>- Order ! I point out to the honorable ' senator that this Bill provides only that boys and youths over twelve and under nineteen years of age shall join and. continue to be members of a naval or military cadet corps, and receive instruction. Although the whole question of defence is a very tempting one for honorable senators to speak on in debating the Bill, it is nevertheless hot strictly relevant to the Bill. We cannot insert in the Bill provisions that would enable us to deal with any complaints that exist at the present time as to the administration of our forces, citizen or otherwise. I ask the honorable senator to confine himself as closely as he can to the subject-matter of the Bill. Honorable senators will recognise at the same time that I do not want to cramp them unnecessarily in their remarks upon the measure, but I do not want a debate to be opened up on our existing military system. </para>

                        <para>. - I join with honorable senators in congratulating <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> on having brought this matter forward, not only on this occasion, but upon past occasions. I do not think that any honorable senator can accuse me of being a Jingo. I have never considered myself one. There was a time when I deprecated any attempt by Australia to take any part in militarism. It is only the developments in Asia, referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> that have converted me to the belief that Australia must be prepared to defend herself. I have never feared, nor do I now fear, the invasion of Australia by any European nation. I believe that we are perfectly safe in that direction, and that even in the event of a European war no nation would turn her eyes with any ill-feeling towards our shores. But I do recognise that in the East there are peoples alien to us in race, religion, and ideals, industrial and social, and that if we believe in our ideals, if we want to establish the industrial Commonwealth which we hope to establish here, we must shut our doors against races so foreign to us as the Asiatic races are. The only doctrine that those races respect is the doctrine of force. Our White Australia legislation is so much waste paper unless we have rifles behind it, and are prepared to back it ' up by force, if necessary. I agree with the condemnation of our existing military system voiced by other speakers. No one could be bold enough to say that we are even getting value for our money from it. We spend upwards of£800,000 a year on our Military Forces alone, and we get practically little or nothing for it. The men who sacrifice their time in joining our Military Forces receive scant consideration from the Government and the people of Australia. I look upon those men as heroes. I regard those who give their Saturday afternoons and their holidays in our militia as worthy of all praise for their sacrifice. A few days ago I saw a little incident in the street I live in in Windsor, which brought home to me in a practical fashion the unfairness of our present system. There was a big football match on the St. Kilda Cricket Ground, and a stream of humanity, from the ages of fourteen to twenty-five, was passing down the street. The flower of our young manhood was going down the footpaths in thousands, and coming in the opposite direction was one solitary youth in khaki, struggling to make his way to the station in order to put in his afternoon at drill. He was buffeted from side to side of the footpath, and had at last to take to the road. There was one of our defenders, endeavouring to do his duty to the country, and scarcely able to move along because of the number of citizens who were anxiously rushing to spend their leisure in a different occupation. I thought that was a remarkable commentary on the way in which Australia treats the youth who is prepared to do his duty. It treats him with scant courtesy, and makes him take the road, because that incident is practically an example of what we do to him in other respects. But in time of war that young fellow, who was shouldered off the footpath, would have to stand in the ranks and to defend the others who were rushing on that day to the football match. If this Bill would deny to that crowd of young fellows who were rushing to the match anything that was worth anything to them, I should have some sympathy for them, and might hesitate to put into force these compulsory provisions. But what a travesty it is on the name of sport to designate as sport the actions of those 30,000 or 40,000 people who stood around the football arena hooting and yelling all the afternoon ! That is of no use to them, except, perhaps, to exercise their lungs. I have never heard that the Australian youth is deficient in lung power. He has certainly a fairly good vocabulary, and plenty of air to back it up. Apparently, the only exercise he gets at football matches is that which enables him to extend his vocabulary and his lung capacity. </para>

                            <para>- For every hundred youths who play football to-day, a hundred thousand look at them and " barrack," talk football, yell football, but never by any means kick a football. The man who first said that the battles of England were won on the cricket fields of England never meant that they were won by the cricket " barrackers " of England. He meant that they were won by the' men who played cricket. In putting into force these compulsory provisions, we shall not be taking away from the youth of Australia anything that is worth anything to them. It would be a blessing to those youths, I do not say to take every Saturday, but to haul them off by force for a few Saturdays, if necessary, from the football grounds, and give them a few manly exercises on the military field, where they could be. taught to square their shoulders and to carry out military evolutions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell seemed to think that there was some objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> scheme from the point of view of the youth of the country. </para>

The youth would not be taken from the harvest field at the harvest time, but would be given his drill at a time of the year when it would least interfere with farm work. That would be a good thing for the youth. In many farming districts the health of the lads is being seriously interfered with by too much unremitting toil, and this Bill would be a good thing if it only gave them a little recreation. _ <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> - And very often they are kept at work so that the old man may spend the market day in the town, whether he has anything to buy or sell there or not. </para>

                            <para>- In many cases the parents of the youths who would Le interfered with in the country are well .able to afford the little leisure that would be given to the lads. If there are any people at the bottom of the social ladder who cannot afford the little expense necessary, they are the workers in the cities. But ' what expenditure is proposed? There is no provision in the Bill for an elaborate uniform, and I take it that the armament will be provided by the Government. We are proceeding on wrong lines by introducing a uniform for our present cadet corps. A uniform is not necessary. I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has made provision for naval cadets. I do not share <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's view that it is utterly impossible for us to do anything, on the naval side of our defence. The vital difference between Australia and Switzerland or the Transvaal is that neither of those countries has a sea-board, while Australia has 8,500 miles of it. Neither of those countries has a mercantile marine, "whereas Australia has a very valuable one. Western Australia has more to lose than any other State has in this connexion, because the other States have railway communication, but, as Commander Creswell pointed out, a raiding cruiser at our ports could immediately hold up all the traffic between the eastern States and the western State. That shows the necessity for some provision for the defence of our mercantile marine, and for training our lads not only in military but in naval drill. </para>

                            <para>- I have often tried to do so, and failed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> seems to be more willing to give us an army than a railway to carry it. Hints have been thrown out that the Government intend to provide torpedo destroyers - a type of boat which will lend itself to training the youths of our ports. That would be a valuable education to those lads, and of immense assistance to them in their after life. What is there in this proposal which can be repugnant to any honorable senator's idea of liberty ? We compel our youths to go to school until they are fourteen years of age, or can pass a certain standard of education. Why do we do that? Simply because we recognise that it is essential in the interests of the body politic that every citizen of the country should be possessed of a certain degree of education. If it is necessary that our youths should be trained in the duties which will fit them to be effective units in the industrial army, it is equally essential that they should be taught the duties and responsibilities pf citizenship, one of the responsibilities of which I hold to be the defence of their country, and it is certainly one of the duties of citizenship that they should acquire the ability to defend it in the best manner possible. I have very great pleasure in saying that I shall support the second reading of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not wish it to be understood for a moment, from the few remarks I propose to address to the Senate, that I have anything but the warmest admiration for the action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> in introducing this measure; but it has struck me as inviting some criticism that circumstances should have so shaped themselves that a measure of this character should be submitted by a private member of the Senate. I know of no matter more important to Australia as a whole, .or of greater importance at this particular juncture, than that of defence. It was one of the particular matters which by the Constitution were transferred absolutely to the Federal authority. We had many promises on the subject, and we had a right to expect that the moment Federation was accomplished some practical steps would be taken to place the whole question of defence on a more satisfactory basis than that on which it was when in the hands of the Governments of the States. But what is the position? The Federation is to-day in its seventh year of existence, and we find that defence matters have been allowed to drag on in such a woeful manner that, as I say, it has been left to a private member of the Senate to bring forward this important Bill. I say that the measure should have been in the hands of the Government long before this. </para>

That is one matter to which I wish to direct attention. I find some difficulty as to what my attitude towards this Bill should be, because I am in ignorance as to what the Government intend to do with respect to it. </para>

                            <para>- I accept the assurance of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the statement will be made before Christmas, but I should like to know which Christmas. It has a very important bearing upon my attitude towards this Bill whether it is the coming Christmas or some other Christmas to which the honorable senator refers. I emphasize the point that this is distinctly a serious matter, in connexion with which delay may involve tremendous loss to Australia. Delay may mean that, perhaps sooner than we expect, we may have to do hurriedly what we should be doing to-day circumspectly and after due consideration. Ever since Federation was accomplished, we have had the assurance of the Federal Government that they have been seriously grappling with this problem. One Minister of Defence after another assured the Federal Parliament that he is calling for reports, taking the matter into consideration, and has prepared a scheme which in due course would be unfolded. The present Minister of Defence, who, I believe, has shown commendable energy in trying to smooth away some of the difficulties with which his Department is confronted, has informed the world that he also has a scheme; but we are still in ignorance as to what it is. I say that the time has arrived when, if the Government is not prepared to grapple with this question energetically, it has become the duty of the Federal Parliament to say that they shall, and must, do so. </para>

But this is hardly a subject on which I feel disposed to joke. I express my profound astonishment and regret that a question of this magnitude should for a moment be allowed to pass out of the hands of the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> in recognising our responsibility and the importance of the matter, has rendered a great public service in performing a duty where the Government have so obviously failed. But I do hope that before the Bill finally passes; the Government will give Parliament and the country no mere vague outline of some visionary scheme of defence, but a complete and practical proposal, to which they will invite Parliament to give immediate effect. </para>

                            <para>-  That may be so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> who has given a great deal of consideration to military matters, will recognise that it is desirable to grapple with the military problem as a whole. Whilst I admit that in this Bill he proposes to deal with matters which may well be regarded as the foundation of a military system, the honorable senator will not contend that it comprises the entire system, I think he would be the first to admit that it would be far better, as it certainly would have been proper, if the Government had taken the matter in hand long ago, and submitted a comprehensive scheme of defence. It is not too late yet for the Government to do so, and it would have been very much more satisfactory if we had had an intimation from the representative of the Government in the Senate as to the extent to which this Bill would dovetail with the Government scheme, or how far it was in conflict with it. We should then have known better what to do. At present, the only course open to myself, in common with other honorable senators, is to show how far we approve of the proposals contained in this Bill by voting for it. I still venture to hope - though I admit it is somewhat foolish to do so after the frequency with which such a hope has been deferred - that we are approaching the time when we shall get some disclosure of the Government proposals with respect to defence. If we could have any assurance that it was likely to be made at a nearly date, we might, after passing the second reading of this Bill, postpone its further consideration until after the Christmas vacation, in order that with the Government scheme before us we might be in a position to consider whether we should proceed with this Bill, and if so, how far its provisions should be adopted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will, I am sure, accept my assurance that I make this statement as one who heartily supports the main principles outlined in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - No one who looks into the conditions of Australia to-day can fail to regard the question of defence as a very serious one. I certainly do so, and consequently I find considerable difficulty in taking this Bill seriously. As an Australian who knows practically nothing of other lands, I am particularly anxious that the Commonwealth shall be well defended. I am also very anxious that Australians shall have a full and free opportunity to give effect to their ideals by legislation, without interference by any foreign body. I am also aware of the risks and the grave dan-, gers we run in Australia of an Asiatic invasion. But really, when we begin to consider legislation to provide for the defence of Australia, we should treat the matter a little more seriously than to talk of defending this country with poor little puny youths of thirteen years of age. As art Australian; if there is one thing' which I. regret more than another it is to witness puny little boys, who have not yet attained the age of reason, going about with rifles in their hands, jostling each other at railway stations, apparently in the belief that they are out for a lark, and regarding the matter with no seriousness at all. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that' they will, but I say the country is in a very poor position when we put a rifle into the hand of a child thirteen years of age, because the result will be that the child will grow up imbued with the jingo spirit, which, I regret, is already being encouraged in our State schools. I have seen the time in Victoria when mere lads, reared under the cadet system of the State, practically ran riot when the jingo spirit was rampant here, because they felt that they were part and parcel of the military system;. They were not permitted to <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> to South Africa, but some of them, had the opportunity been afforded, would have been willing to go without knowing why. </para>

                            <para>- I am very suspicious of such regulations, because I have an idea that the intention is to compel the boys of the working classes in Australia to provide our soldiers, and not the boys of other classes in the community. Is. it intended that boys going to school or college, or that boys at work for a living should be exempt ? I was rather surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> ridicule the idea of attending a football match, and suggesting sarcastically that a man should have been presented with the Victoria Cross because he was jostled in a football crowd. Let me point this out to the honorable senator. The men who attend football matches are very often persons who have to work for nine or ten hours a day in factories. It is necessary that they should be afforded opportunities of outdoor recreation at the end of the week. But it appears that in the view of some honorable senators a mere lad, after spending a week in the bad atmosphere of a factory, and going home every night to a stuffy house in a congested suburb, is to be compelled to be a patriot on Saturday afternoons, and to devote his time to drill. The supporters of this measure might as well endeavour to make it compulsory for lads to drill all the time when they are not either asleep or at meals or at work, leaving them no time for recreation; Again, many working lads attend schools of various kinds in their leisure hours. I have had to do the same myself. After working all day, these lads devote a large part of their leisure to study, in order to develop their mental faculties, and thereby become more useful citizens. Are such lads to be exempt under this Bill? </para>

                            <para>- I wish I could say that, but, from private conversations which I have had with one or two of my honorable friends, I am .afraid that it is not so. If it is necessary to compel the working lads of Australia, who spend most of the week in a shop or a factory, to join a military force, why is it not proposed that part of the time which they devote to drill shall be granted by the employers ? Why should not the employers give up for this purpose a couple of hours a week of the time of the lads whom they employ? There is another principle- of the Bill to which I take exception, and which I think is unworthy of its supporters. That is, that if the parents of a boy fail to cause him to join a military force, he can be brought before a Court and fined, and that, after he has been fined for neglecting to attend a course of military instruction, his employer is actually to be turned into a bailiff to . collect the penalty. What does that mean? It means that a boy whose father, .perhaps from conscientious motives, would prefer to pay the fine rather than allow his lad to serve in the army, would nevertheless be marked through a notification being sent to the employer. I have not the slightest sympathy with any part of this Bill. I say that, not because I do not realize the necessity for defending Australia, but because I wish to see the defence of. Australia seriously undertaken, not by its boys, but by its young men, who have reached the age of reason, and- know something about the country in which they live - know that it is worth defending, and know that there is justification for compelling them to devote a certain portion of their time during a certain number of years to military training. I also believe that it is more desirable on other grounds to compel young men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-two to attend drill than boys. A lad is generally under the control of his parents, but when he reaches the age of eighteen it might be a very good thing in his own interest to subject him to some amount of discipline. But I do sincerely hope that the day will never come in Australia when it will be thought necessary to put into the hands of . any boy who has not reached the age of reason a rifle  for  the purpose of shooting other people.  We  have a sufficient number of men physically capable of defending Australia if  well organized  without dragging in our boys.  We  should call upon the bone, the muscle  and  the sinew of Australia to defend our country, leaving the children at school and  under  the care of their mothers. </para>

                        <para>. - I heartily agree with  the  principles embodied in this Bill. The  beginning  is always the proper place to  start  from, and this Bill aims at starting  at the  beginning. I have no such morbid fear  of  the puny boy of Australia as has  been  expressed . by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell. The boy of to-day will be the  mart  of a few years to come. The  boy is  physically and mentally the hope of  the  Commonwealth of Australia. We  have  shown our belief in that fact by the efforts which have been made to perfect our system of education, with the object of  fitting  our boys to face the duties which they  will  ultimately be called upon  to  undertake  as citizens.  But whilst in relation to the  defence  Of Australia, I agree heartily  with  the principles laid down in the Bill, I  am  not sure that some of its provisions  are  quite as elastic or as good as they ought  to  be. The Bill commences with a boy  of  twelve years of age. That gives him  at  least two years before he leaves school. During those years if he is drilled he  will,  in the majority of cases, become so far  disciplined  as to give him an appetite  to go&gt;  forward in the w.OrE that he has taken  in hand.  He will want to become  a  better soldier. I believe' that a system  of this  kind will encourage ambition amongst  our  lads. A soldier ought to have ambition. One who had no ambition would be  a very poor  soldier indeed. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly ; several speeches which we have heard  during  this debate have shown how thousands of our citizens display their ambition  on a  Saturday afternoon by going to  holloo  themselves hoarse to the kicking of a  football  in the air. That is the kind  of ambition  that seems to be' fostered amongst some of our citizens. Not that I have  any  antipathy to football. I do not frequent these games myself, but if a man chooses  to  go there he is quite welcome so far  as  .1 am concerned.  The  Bill provides  that a  boy having commenced his drill at the age of twelve shall by compulsory regulation continue until he reaches the age of nineteen. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J.' Russell that between the ages of eighteen and twenty -five we get the bloom of our soldier life. A man at that age is prepared to face anything. "Under such a system our- young men having gone through their disciplinary course will be well trained in the arts of war. I see no hope for us in Australia being able to defend ourselves unless we adopt some scheme of compulsory training in regard to our lads. I suppose that a good many people are still saturated with affection for the old voluntary system of England. Many of the fathers of to-day will say in regard to such a proposal as this, " Oh, you are going back to the old days of the press-gang." Well, we should have to return to such a system if serious trouble came to Australia. Should we not have to turn to the citizen life of our nation . to defend the vital interests of the country against invasion? Therefore I say that the principle of this Bill does not in any way interfere with the liberty of the subject as properly understood. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill compels children because it is wise in its premise. It recognises that the children will be the men and the women of another generation, and that in the course of a few years we shall have built up a citizen army. Suppose that we commenced now. to train every boy between the age of twelve years and the age of nineteen years. At the end of seven or ten years - and 'that is a very short period in the life of a country or a nation - we should have a host of young men able, not only to shoulder a musket, but also to shoot straight. That is the kind of force we need in Australia. The Bill lays the foundation for the creation of that force,, and it practically provides for a continuity of system. If we enact this Bill, the men who will take our places fifty years later will have undergone a military training, and all those by whom they will be surrounded, and who are not incapable for one reason or other, will also be fitted to take their place in the military ranks. Would not that be an infinitely preferable system to ' a standing army ? Suppose that we had to raise an army to defend the country from an invasion by the people whom most persons 'fear, but whom I do not fear, and will not, at any rate for some time to come. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I think that there is no possibility of any trouble coming to' Australia through a European power. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think it would render it necessary for us to .shoulder a gun. If we were to compel our lads of eighteen or nineteen years of age to undergo a military training,  we would not have a sufficient army, and we could not afford to maintain an adequate and efficient standing army. Consequently, . the idea of defending Australia with a standing army is quite beside the question. I believe that the 'Bill lays down the proper course for us to take. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell made a point which I think might- receive a little consideration in Committee, and that is in- regard to the . time during which boys may be taken away from their work. </para>

                            <para>- I. do not think that boys will be .taken much from their studies, but there is a possibility of the work of boys being interrupted! I believe that those ' whose interests would be largely dependent upon the successful resistance of invasion ought always to be large contributors to a military system of that kind. I do not anticipate that it would interfere with the mental development of the boys, and there is no possible chance of its interfering with- their physical development, except beneficially. ' I am satisfied that- it would afford pleasure to any member ' of the Senate to watch our volunteer artillerymen when they are doing their drill, as it really is an object-lesson. They would find that every provision is made for the physical development of the young fellows. In my opinion, a system of military discipline develops a person mentally more than do a great many of the pursuits into which . lads may drift. Therefore, I am prepared to support the second reading of this Bill. </para>
