Sweating, unemployment, and starvation, he goes on to declare, rule with a rod that breaks hearts and lives, and monopoly is Czar.

                    <para>As stated in No. 2, no inspection fees are charged in New South Wales, and the inspection (for which fees are charged) in Victoria is rendered necessary by the fact that the fruit fly in many instances does not indicate its presence until after shipment or until reaching the port of destination- </para>
                    <para>Regulations have, however, been made in Queensland which prescribe that after 1st September, 1907, no certificates shall issue for bananas for export except where the fruit has been covered with fruit fly netting for two months prior to examination. Owing to sufficient netting not being available, some delay has been caused in enforcing this regulation. Full supplies will, however, shortly be available. It is understood that the protection so afforded will, when complete, obviate the necessity of inspection at ports of destination. </para>

However, this is essentially a matter for the States Governments, and it is clearly the duty of the States Parliaments, by legislation, to make due provision for closer settlement. </para>

I may say that we asked printers throughout the Commonwealth to tender, and we did not bind ourselves necessarily to give a contract to any successful tenderer. We reserve to ourselves the right to distribute our work as we should think fit. In other words, we have a standing offer from the particular firm referred to to do such printing as we may require for four years, and we are under no obligation to give them any particular work. It is a standing offer, which we may accept, for such work as we may require to have done from time to time at the schedule rates. </para>

                <para class="block">The petition with which the report deals was referred to the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications on the 23rd August, and it is gratifying to know that it involves no question of personal preferences. The petitioner is not claiming the seat. I am, as we all must be, sorry that there should be in connexion with any matter of this kind, personal disappointments. We must all regret that there should be anxiety, worry, or suspense, occasioned to any men who, in the interests of their country, come forward to represent the people in Parliament, whether in the Senate or in the House of Representatives. But we are concerned on this occasion particularly to do justice, not merely to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin,</inline> whose right to the seat is involved in this matter, but. to the people of South Australia, and their right to the exercise of their undoubted franchise. In substance, the suitors to the Senate on this occasion are the people of South Australia. The petition merely brings the matter, as it has arisen, under the notice of the Senate, which might and perhaps ought without any petition to have taken the matter into its own consideration, and endeavoured to deal with it. The people by virtue of this petition are the suppliants to the Senate for the just recognition of their rights. That is the situation as I conceive it. We, the members of the Senate, are, in fact, asked to save them from being despoiled of their franchise. They claim by virtue of the inherent constitutional right to be allowed to choose their own senators. It is so written in the Federal compact. It seems to me that it is for those who would take that right away to show just cause for doing so. I do not regard the question at stake as a dry question of technical law, but as a great principle of popular election. If the Committee have failed to make that clear in their report, they have taken all the trouble they did over it, and have made their investigations in vain. That principle lies at the very root of the Constitution, of which I think we are justly proud - popular election for both branches of this Legislature and on the widest of all possible suffrages. The Committee have reported, and it is for the Senate to decide. To enable that decision to be arrived at that report is now submitted by me, as the  chairman  and mouthpiece of the Committee, for the consideration of the Senate. With, of course, one exception, it is the members of the Senate, those who are entitled to assemble in this chamber, who are the judges in the matter. The Committee arrogate nothing to themselves except to report their just and conscientious convictions to the Senate. They recognise that it is for the Senate as a whole to give the decision, and finally deal with this matter. Whether we are right or wrong it is upon our report that the Senate has an opportunity to vindicate and uphold the great principle of popular election, as applied to its own members. I wish, also, to say, by way of preliminary, that in my view, and I think in the view of the Committee as a whole - because the addendum to which I shall allude, does not militate against what I am saying now - this is peculiarly a question for settlement in some way or other by the Senate. The Senate is the guardian of its own Constitution, and the guardian of the rights of the people to whom it owes its existence. I feel quite sure that on this occasion the Senate will rise to the height of its responsibilities, uninfluenced, I confidently believe, by any personal predilections or any party considerations. The issue is far above everything personal or party. I think I may say that the Committee have framed a report which they have endeavoured to make as clear as they could. I believe that they have not overlooked any material aspect of the case, and if they have, in common with my colleagues on the Committee, I shall be glad to have it pointed out. Really there is very little that is essential to be added to the report as we have framed it from our point of view, except that the compression which is incidental to a report makes it desirable to amplify its terms a little, and that is what I now propose to do. Assisted by the unanimous decision of the High Court Judges, and guided by the fundamental principle to which. I have referred, I think it would be wrong for me not to confess that the question involved appears to me really simple. In December in South Australia, there were three vacancies by effluxion of time. The people filled two, but not the third. Their attempt to fill the third vacancy failed. The election was void. Why are they not to fill it now ? That is the Question. Still more, why is some one else to do it for them? Let me put it in this way : If the election in December had not taken place at all, or if some form of election took place, but, owing to official blundering or for any other reason, the election was void, the Constitution has surely not penalized the people by disfranchisement, or by handing over to a limited constituency like Parliament that right which is indefeasible in the people of choosing their own senators? That again is a proposition which we have to consider. Does the Constitution penalize the people who have made no choice, from no fault or default of their own, by taking away their franchise, and by handing over the choice of a senator to fill that December vacancy to another body - and an inferior body in every respect ? I put these preliminary considerations with a view of shortening the remarks which I. propose to make. The vacancy to be filled after the decision of the High Court last May was the original vacancy by effluxion of time, which was thought to have been filled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon.</inline> That was the vacancy which the people tried to fill, but failed to fill. The Court of Disputed Returns might have sat the next day. If they had sat next day, and said that there had been no return and no election, could any one have contended for a single moment that the people had made their choice, and that some one else was to make the next choice? What matters it that the decision of the Court was not given for three months afterwards? It can make no difference in its effect. Whatever vacancy existed as a consequence of the decision of the tribunal in the month of May last was, it appears to me, the same vacancy as existed in the month of December, which the people tried to fill, but failed to fill. If that be so, shall we say, &#34; That ends their right to choose their senator for ever &#34; ? Can it be denied that the vacancy was that of December - that a man was put in to fill that vacancy, that he was put out, and that the vacancy remains? . Was not that vacancy one of the three December vacancies? If so, is it not for the people to fill it? There was no second or subsequent vacancy. The judgment was that the original vacancy as to the third seat had never been filled. If, therefore, the people did not choose a third senator in December, why did they not? Why should they be passed over and another constituency arrogate to itself the power to do so? These questions are&#39; really all that are involved. My desire is to put them plainly! to the Senate. I welcome, and I am sure all the members of the Committee welcome, criticism. If the conclusion &#62; which we have arrived at, or the reasons upon which it is founded, can be shattered and destroyed - well then, I think we are prepared with perfect equanimity to listen to everything that can be urged in that direction. But I do say - strip the matter of legal technicalities, deal with it on broad grounds of principle and good sense, on the ground that we are not to whittle away the right of the people to elect their own senators - and the position taken up by the Committee is unanswerable. There are cases, undoubtedly many of them, in which there is another side. There are few questions to which there is not another side. But, personally I feel that this is one question as to which there is not another side. I _ go further, and say that if the question be doubtful, surely it is better that the mistake, if there were a mistake, should be in favour of popular election than against it. The question is: Did the conditions exist which are necessary under the Constitution to give Parliament, instead of the people, the right to fill a vacancy? If Parliament can step in - if the Senate says that - and prevent the people from choosing a senator, which they have not yet done, there is an end of the matter, because Parliament has chosen. If Parliament cannot so step in and defeat the right of the people, there is equally an end of the matter, because if they had no right to choose under the particular circumstances the person elected by them has no right or title to his seat. It has been suggested that the consequence of so holding might be that there would continue to.ie a vacancy. Personally, I have no apprehension upon that point whatever. </para>
                <para class="block">But honorable senators will see that even if that were the case it does not justify any other constituency - any unauthorized body - in making the choice. It would be an omission in the Constitution if such were the case, which would have to be supplied. But to my mind, and in the judgment of the Committee, there is no doubt and no apprehension that the people are entitled just as much and as readily to make a choice of a third senator now - if a senator has to be chosen - as they were in the month of December last. That consideration, happily - your Committee felt it to be a great relief - relieved us from entering into any controversy on that subject, because the unanimous judgment of the High Court, as shown by the extract given in our report, sets that ,point at rest. The Governor-General may issue his writ, and, the people may elect now if an election is to take place; because the only impediment that was suggested was section 13 of the Constitution, providing for a rotation of senators, and which it was said raised a barrier against electing after the 1st January if the people failed to elect in December. Let me, having made these preliminary remarks, refer honorable senators very briefly to the Constitution. This Constitution is the people&#39;s in a sense and with a truth not applicable to any other Constitution- on this earth. Unlike the American Constitution, it was&#39; framed by delegates chosen by the people. When it was framed it was adopted by the direct vote of the people themselves on a referendum. The dominant feature of the Constitution of this great Commonwealth is: that it rests not merely in essence but in its details upon the people and upon their direct vote. The first question one would ask when a question such as this arose would be how the people would understand it. As I have already said, I welcome criticism - I welcome it in every direction - but I should think there can be no doubt as to how the people would understand such a question.  In the first place they would understand that they were to elect their senators by their own direct vote. Can anybody suggest, supposing that through official bungling their attempted election was void, that their choice went by the board, that the people could imagine they were then, to lose their right of choice plainly given to them by their Constitution ? If you were to ask the man in the street whether such a thing were&#39; possible or to be contemplated we can all very well understand what the answer would be. I do not myself believe that any sane man or woman could when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon&#39;s</inline> return was declared void have supposed anything else than that there would be a fresh election. </para>

                            <para>- On many questions the sentiment of the people is much sounder than are the technicalities of lawyers. If honorable senators look at the Constitution, Chapter 1, Part II., they will find that the constitution of the Senate is on the same footing, follows the same lines, and is inspired by the same great principle as the foundation of the Commonwealth Constitution itself. The Senate is not representative of any class. It is absolutely the House of the nation. It is representative of the people of every rank in the community, and it is incomparably more so in that respect than the Senate of the United States. The United States Senate is chosen by the State Legislatures. That method, as everybody knows, was considered at the time to reflect the distrust of. the people which characterized many of the leaders in that great Convention. It may be well for us, who are more privileged and more blest, to remember that now, and for years past, iri the United States, there has been an agitation for popular election - for choice by the people as opposed to legislative choice. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Australian National Convention adopted choice by the people as the fundamental basis of the constitution of this Senate. There was no debate on the subject in the Convention of 1897 and 1898. It had passed beyond the region of debate altogether. The period intervening between 1 89 1, when the earlier Convention met in Sydney, and 1897, when the National Convention met in Adelaide, had been sufficient to sweep away any lingering remnant of inclination towards an election by the State Legislatures. The time for that had passed, and the Convention was unanimous that the foundation of the Senate&#39;s existence was to be the direct vote of the people. That is provided by section 7 of the Constitution - &#34; The Senate shall be composed of senators from each State directly chosen by the people of the State.&#34; The Committee have described that principle as the basis of the constitution of the Senate. Perhaps if I had seen them at the moment, I should have preferred the words used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> in the Sydney Convention, as reported on page 374. Referring to the question that was then under consideration, of giving the Federal Parliament the right to deal with the electorates and so on, he said - </para>

                        <para>We should at the same time retain as a fundamental principle of the Constitution, unalterable except in the mode provided for the alteration of the Constitution, the right of the senators to be elected by the direct choice of the people of the State. </para>

                    <para class="block">That was, and is, the fundamental principle of our Constitution - the fundamental title upon which we rest in this House. There is no proviso or exception that, if the (people&#39;s choice is void owing to official blundering, they shall be disfranchised, and the senators chosen by the State Governor or &#39;the State Parliament. Yet that is what we should have to say if we held that in such a case as this, where the election was declared void - void altogether as though it had never been - the State Parliament or the State Governor could send anyone into this Senate. If the Convention had meant that there should be a proviso, of that kind, taking away from the people their franchise in cases where they had failed to exercise it by reason of somebody else&#39;s fault, the Convention could easily have said so in a few words. They have not done so. If such a thing were possible, the effect would be - for this is not a question of law, but of common-sense - that it would lie in the power of a blundering official to repeal section 7 of the </para>
                    <para class="block">Constitution altogether. It might not be blundering - I do not say that such a thing would be possible - it might not be an innocent mistake, but it would open the door to wilful abuse of the people&#39;s rights which we are here to protect. That is the point which must be considered. Are honorable senators going to say that section 7 is to be read as though it had a proviso of that kind attached to it, and to put it in the power of any official, guiltily or innocently, to repeal that section, take away, the people&#39;s choice, and hand it over to the kind of constituency that they have in America - the State Houses - State Houses, too, that are not in touch with the people? It may be the case of South Australia today, but - for I feel1 upon this matter that our rights and our standing are at stake - I think I am correct in saving that there are two States in this Union which have nominee Upper Houses. Are they to be permitted, through the blundering of an official, to fill a periodical vacancy which the people attempted to fill, and failed to fill? Even in those States where there is an elected Upper House, that House is based upon a restricted franchise. We in South Australia are now in the throes of an effort to reform our Upper House, which joined in this very election, and to make it more representative of the people and more in touch with them. If it&#39; had been intended that, in case of a void election, which means no election - for void means &#34; void, as though it never took place,&#34; and a void deed, for example, is a deed that is dealt with as though it never existed, and confers no rights upon any one - if, I say, it had been intended that, in the case of *a void election where there had been no choice by the people through no fault- of their own, they should be despoiled of their right, I venture to think that the Convention &#39;.would have said so in plain terms, so that people- could understand it. That completes what I have to say with regard to section 7. But there are one or two things to which I wish to direct the attention of honorable senators while referring to these sections. I should have liked to put these matters into the report, and I am sure that the Committee would have liked to do so, but it was impossible, because they would have made the report unduly long. We find that it is provided that &#34;the senators shall be chosen for a term of six years.&#34; I do not want to introduce any technicalities or refine- - ments as to &#34;term,&#34; and so on, but what does the man in the street understand by that provision ? Chosen how, for a term of six years? Surely &#34;chosen&#34; means exactly what it says in the section - directly chosen, by the people of the State? It is that which gives the term of service, as was admitted before the Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> said his own first idea was, &#34; How could there be a term of service if the choice or election were void?&#34; It is further provided - &#34;and the names of the senators chosen for each State shall be ... &#34; Chosen Row? Chosen by the direct vote of the people, and, of course, &#34;chosen&#34; means effectively chosen ; it does not mean a farce, a fiasco. It is the senator so chosen who is referred to. There is only one term of service in the Constitution - that which is given by the choice of the people. Honorable senators will find the word used again in section  13  - &#34;the Senate shall divide the senators chosen ...&#34; That means those who are chosen by the direct vote of the people. We come next  to section  15  - the section which has given rise to a good deal of subtlety in argument. The expression there used, dealing with the man who holds the place of a senator which has to be filled, is &#34; for which he was chosen.&#34; There it is on the face of what we call our Federal compact. Another aspect that we ought to &#39;bear in mind is that there is no obligation upon a State to elect senators at all. There is no obligation whatever upon a State to send representatives into this Senate. The penalty is not that they shall be elected by somebody else, but simply that the&#34; State shall go unrepresented. There it is in illuminated letters, so to speak, in section  11,  which is the only provision that is made for the failure of a State to provide for its representation in the Senate. It says, &#34; The Senate may. proceed&#39; to the despatch of business&#34; without them. The only penalty is that business goes on without them. It is not provided that if the people of the State refuse or fail to elect senators, some one else is to do so for them. But that is what is to be suggested. In this case, the people have not refused. They did their best to make the election . last December, but, unfortunately, the blundering of officials rendered that effort void. But if the people did refuse, if the State, as the corporate representative of the people, refused or failed to send senators, and the people refused or failed to vote, if they stayed away from the polling booth, so that no vote would , te recorded - if such a thing could be imagined - nobody would ha,ve a right: to send anybody else here for them. Section 13 is the last to which I shall call  the attention of honorable senators, and about which some difficulty arose. The other aspect of the case does not really involve questions of law, but this section did involve a question of technical law. It merely provides, and was intended to provide, for the rotation of senators. It was not intended to be any impediment! against the choice of the people, so that if they failed to elect,  in December, for any reason, they should not elect in January or February. To refer briefly to those sections, the first provides the broad basis of popular representation. That particular basis is, I think, to be respected, if not to be revered, and it seems to me that that popular right of choice should be maintained at all hazards, and that it should not be taken from the people or transferred to any other constituency without the clearest language. There is no exception to that principle of popular election as, to use <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston&#39;s</inline> phrase, the fundamental right of the people of the States. But there is a provision, and a necessary provision, made in section 15 for what I may call temporary or stop-gap appointments, to take effect after the people have done their part and chosen a senator. Section 15 is not intended to take away the right of the people to choose their senator in the first instance; but, after having done their part, then, if what is called a casual vacancy, owing to resignation, death, disqualification, or any of those things which supervene upon the valid choice of a senator by the people arises, that section very properly comes into play and enables a temporary appointment to be made, merely for the interval between that casualty and the time of another election. Honorable senators will notice also that the place which is filled is always the place of the senator, and the term of service which is enjoyed is always the term of service which the original man elected by the people held. It does not matter if there are fifty successive temporary occupants under section 15, the place which is held by that temporary occupant is the original place, and the term of service which he partially is enjoying is the original term of service, which was given by the people&#39;s vote to the original man before the casualty happened to him. Honorable senators will see that under section 15 there must be &#34; the place of a sena tor.&#34; That does not mean a person who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon,</inline> was only called a senator, but a person who is a senator by the choice of- the people elected for the term of six years. A senator can only be chosen in one way to fill a periodical&#39; vacancy, and that is by the direct vote of the people under section 7. The place to become vacant is that which rests upon the choice of the people - not an abortive or ineffective choice, but a valid choice to give the term of service in respect of which the casualty, like resignation or death, . may have happened, &#39; and which is temporarily filled - it is always the old place which is filled - by the temporary occupant. When we are referring, as in this case, to a senator who was supposed to have been chosen by the electors last December, the Constitution says in the plainest manner that &#34; chosen &#34; means chosen by the direct vote of the people. As regards section 15, to put it very shortly, it is not an alternative to the choice of the people. It is supplementary or subsequent to that choice. It was meant to cover all cases such as resignation, death, forfeiture, and so on, under section 20, and also under section 45. These are what are known as accidental or casual vacancies. If I may use an expression which is very frequently used, section 15 has plenty of work to do in that area, and why should we attempt to extend it so as to disfranchise the people? </para>

                            <para>- There is no doubt at all ; it seems to me as plain as possible. Under section 15 a senator must be, as I have said, a senator, not a usurper, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was, according to the judgment of the  Court - that is to say, one who believed that he was duly elected, but in respect of whom the Court has declared that there was no election, that the people had not chosen. Then as regards the expiration of the term of service, that is made plain to us by section 7. It is the term of six years which is given by the valid choice of the people. And a person to be appointed under the section is to hold the place.&#34; What place? The place to which the person was chosen by the people. Now, this was not a case of resignation, or death, or disqualification under section 45. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton, constituting the Court of Disputed Returns, declared that the election was void so far as regarded the petitioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon,</inline> and his judgment is set out at page 16 of the appendix to the report - </para>

                            <para>- I leave that to the honorable senator. I take it that what the counsel meant is what he said. These are. the simple facts : The election in December being void, the detailed circumstances for the consideration of honorable senators are, Have the people of South Australia chosen a third senator? If not, what right has, the State Legislature to do so for them ? If none, then clearly Senator O&#39;Loghlin has not been rightly chosen, certainly through no fault of his, and the vacancy still exists. In the next place, there is no substitute provided for the failure of the people to elect. The only alternative and the only course that can be pursued is that they must simply again set about electing. If they have not elected, justice and common-sense alike say that they should be given an opportunity to do so. Then again, the vacancy which existed in July, and which the State Parliament assumed to fill, is that which existed in December, which the people of the State, owing to no fault of their own, did not fill by an election. The election was void and the vacancy that then existed is unfilled. Whatever view we take of the result of these proceedings, we should all admit that the right  of the State Parliament depends on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> having been elected and returned. If he was not elected, then the Parliament has no authority to act/ and its nominee&#39; had no title to sit. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton decided that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was not elected, and that the return in his case was void. If the action of the State Parliament is maintained on the other hand, clearly the people of South Australia have had no direct voice in the choice of their third senator - the third senator who ought to have been chosen on the 12th December. What is worse still, their franchise is handed over to another constituency consisting of the members of the two State Houses. Supposing there had been no election in the cases which the Committee have enumerated in their report owing to the Governor having omitted to issue his writ, or for any other reason of that kind, the people should not be deprived of their franchise. I ask honorable senators to suppose, as a practical case, there was no election because one-half the voting-papers were lost or destroyed by accident, by fire or flood, or whatever it might be, before the scrutiny. Would that involve the loss of the people&#39;s franchise, and the right of the Parliament to elect? </para>

                            <para>- The count makes no difference. It does not make the election good. The judgment of the Court is that the election in question was as if it had never taken place - it was void. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> means to contend that the return of the writ means a good election, whether it is subsequently declared void or not, I can understand his contention, but I cannot admire its force. There would be no election in the case to which I have referred, and there was no election according to the judgment of the Court of Disputed Returns in this case. I say, very emphatically, that in this Senate we ought to strive against a construction which would transfer the choice of the people to the States Houses, on grounds some of which I have referred to, and on the further ground that it is opposed to the democratic principle of the Constitution, since, as I&#39; have already mentioned, in two of the States there are nominee Legislative Councils that are in no sense representative of the people, and that even where the Legislative Councils are elected it is on a restrictive franchise. The position really is that since December last there have been only five senators for South Australia chosen by the people, and one who was supposed to have been but was not so chosen. One or two other matters were referred to as possibly creating doubt, to which I shall briefly allude. It was said, for instance, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> sat and voted. I do not think anybody can attach any serious weight to the suggestion that, because he sat and voted whilst the matter was <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> that in any respect validated his title to sit or made him a senator. If so, it would apply to any other senator. The proposition bears its own refutation, and, in fact, has only to be stated to be ridiculed. To say that because while a matter is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice</inline> the Senate does not interfere to prevent a man sitting in this Chamber makes him a senator, entitled to be here, is a proposition which does not require any further discussion. </para>

                            <para>- Others might have no right to do so whilst such a matter was <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> How can it be held that a man is&#39; a senator because he is allowed to sit and draw his salary ? The question of his right to draw salary might arise when the case came before the Court. I do not know whether there would be any remedy by which the salary paid to such a person might be recovered. I do not suppose that anybody would be so mean as to suggest such a thing, but whether that were done or not it is one of the courtesies of the Senate that while such a matter issub <inline font-style="italic">judice</inline> we do not interfere. What difference would it make? If the question had been decided the day after the return of the writ <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> would not have sat in the Senate, because Parliament would not have met. If such a contention as I have indicated were to hold good, the result of an inquiry as to one man&#39;s seat in such circumstances might be different from that in the case of another, because if the Senate had not met, and a man had no opportunity of taking his seat before judgment, he would not be a senator, whilst, in the case of another man, if the Senate had met and he had an opportunity to take his seat and did it might be held that he was a senator. It may be rightly contended that a man has a right to sit as a senator until there has been a decision to the contrary. We do not condemn a man unheard, but if there is a decision to the contrary, and it is shown that the election which is claimed as his title to be a senator is void, then he simply is not and never was a senator. It is also said that there cannot be an election for one senator, but we know that the Governor of a State may issue his writ for one senator, as well as for three. He must issue his writ for the election of one senator, even in the case of a casual vacancy, if the election takes place on the occasion of an election for the House of Representatives at a time when members of the Senate do not retire. Section  12  of the Constitution provides that - </para>

                    <para>That means for one senator, as well as for three. It is a curious thing worth noting that our own standing order No.  2  contemplates elections of senators taking place during the interval between one session and another, and such an election could not take place in respect of filling a casual vacancy, or it might be a vacancy which would require to be filled on the occasion of an election for the House of Representatives before any of the members of the Senate had to go to their constituencies. Our standing order does not govern the question nor does it override the Constitution if the Constitution provides to the contrary. But it is significant, and worth referring to.

                            <para>- I am not dealing now with a casual vacancy. As it was my duty to do, I have mentioned the fact that an argument was used that there is no provision for the election of one senator. If there were no such provision it would not justify the State Parliament in making an appointment. It would still be an unauthorized body. But I am pointing out that there is nothing to prevent an election of one senator. </para>

                            <para>- I am obliged to the honorable senator. I have been trying to explain that I invite the Senate to say, as the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications thought, that there is nothing in the contention that there could not be an election for one  senator. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has made that perfectly plain, by stating that the standing order to which I have referred contemplates a return which could only take place upon an election by the people because there is no return in the case of a choice by a State Parliament, and therefore contemplates an election which might be for one senator taking place in the interval between one session and another. It was also said that the term of service to which the State Parliament had the right to appoint was that supposed to have been given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardori</inline> by the choice of the people. But as the people made no choice no term of  service was assigned for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon.</inline> The Constitution does not provide for two terms of service. It has been quite rightly suggested also, for consideration, that there is some kind of term extending to the date of the decision of the Court declaring the election void. That is not in fact a term of service. The Constitution does not contemplate two terms - one until an election has been declared void, and another from the time the people have made their choice and elected their own senator. It was also suggested that the voiding of the election was from the time the Court gave its decision. One need  only say as to that that the election could not be good in December if it was void in May, and that what was declared void was no mere seat occupied in the Chamber by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> - improperly, according to the judgment, but by courtesy of the Senate - up to a certain time, but the election which took place in December. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly he had. But whether he had or had not that power, we cannot question his judgment. The Electoral Act has made the decision of the Court final, and we cannot question it in any respect. If we were to set ourselves up as a Court of Appeal against the decisions of the Court of Disputed Returns - which we ourselves have set up as final - I do not know where we should be landed. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that we require any explanation of it. Mav I point out that that&#39; was the decision asked for by the petitioner&#39;s counsel - that the election should be declared  void  as  against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon.</inline> That  was the decision which the Judge gave, and which met the view of the petitioner. It has been made clear, over and over again, without any indication of disapproval, in the unanimous judgment of the High Court, that the election was void as regards <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> ; therefore I think we may take it - even if we were in a position, which we are not, to question the judgment - that we, in the Senate, must accept that judgment. We must accept the. judgment declared to&#34; be final according to our own law. Surely we are not to repudiate what we have done ourselves. And if we are to accept that judgment, it is absolutely settled that the election was void so far as concerned the return of. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon.</inline> There was a deplorable set of blunders at the election. The man declared returned on the admitted votes by a majority of two was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon.</inline> But there were a number of votes which could not be admitted ; and as to which the learned Judge said, after examining them,&#39; that they might have affected the result of the election. Probably, if they had been admissible, they would have given a majority of four for one of the other candidates, Mr: Crosby. The man who ought to have our sympathy in the first instance  - they are all entitled to our sympathy in this matter - is the man who, on the admitted votes, was declared elected, and whose election was declared void because there were a number of votes which were inadmissible, but which might have affected the election if they had been admitted. The matter to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has referred leads me to ask this question : If the election had been void as against the whole three, is there a man in this Senate who would say that those three places should be filled by the State Parliament? Not at all ! And what&#39; difference can it make, the judgment being final and without appeal, that the election has been declared void as to one? If the three seats could not be filled by the State Parliament because the election was void, upon what principle are you going to say that one seat could be filled by the State Parliament ? </para>

                            <para>- It really does not bear upon the matter, because, whether the expense be great or little, if the people are prepared to exercise their choice, and to fill this vacancy, which I think they have a right to fill, the expense ought not to be considered. Of course, in December, in four out of the seven districts in South Australia, there was an election for the Senate alone. Therefore, the State being treated as. one constituency in respect of elections for the Senate, expense was incurred in every part of the State. The same sort of thing happens in the United States. When a State does not elect its senators when it ought to do so, by means of the State Legislature, it has to go to the expense of holding a special session of the State Legislature for the purpose. They actually complain about it, though I do not know why. But, unfortunate as the expense may be, what is it in comparison with the disfranchisement of the people of the State, or with the admission of a stranger into the Senate - using that term in the sense of a person not authorized to come here? Now, I wish to refer to the fact which has been brought under the notice pf the Senate, as it was brought under the notice of the Committee, that the opinions of lawyers were furnished to the State Parliament. The opinion of the Attorney- General of the Commonwealth has been printed as a Senate paper. There were also the opinions of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray, Mr. Dashwood,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn.</inline> Ihave respect for those opinions, or, rather - I cannot say exactly for the opinions - for the men who gave them. Certainly, in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray,</inline> I can say that he is a careful and thoughtful King&#39;s Counsel in Adelaide. But those opinions were given before the High Court judgment. They were all founded mainly - I do not say wholly - upon section  13  of the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- I should think that if they were sensible men, after the judgment of the highest Court of Appeal in this country, which sweeps away the foundation upon which their opinions were given, that they would not hold to them. He would be a very obstinate man who did not think he might be mistaken in a view which he had taken, after such a judgment. These opinions were based, as I. have said, mainly on section  13,  which seems to interpose an impediment to a popular election taking place after the  1st  January. Now, if that section did not interpose that impediment, it would not by itself have given the State Parliament the power to make the appointment. But it is an argument of convenience that might be used to show that section  15  did enable the State Parliament to fill the vacancy. And that is the ground underlying these opinions. </para>

For instance, if an election by the people were now held to fill the place for which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was returned the senator chosen would not be entitled to begin his term of office until the 1st of January, 1908, and the State would be short of a representative in the meantime. </para>

                        <para>It was suggested that this provision is inconsistent with an election being held after the first of January to fill vacancies which ought to have been filled at the election held before the 1st January, but we do not think that there is anything in this point.

                    <para class="block">The High Court, therefore, absolutely disposed of that point of law, and so the Committee were relieved, and we here in the Senate are relieved, from being influenced in any way by it, because if we are going to rest anywhere we must rest upon the judgment of the High Court. It has held that the words used in that connexion are directory, and not mandatory ; that they are to be so construed as not to prevent the people choosing their own senators by direct vote, and to mean and to insure that if the people do not choose before the 1st of January they must do so afterwards. This does not mean that the writ is to date back. It merely means that if the election is to take place in this month of October, for instance, it does take place now, and the writ is issued now, but the election relates back. It is to be treated &#34; now as then,&#34; treated as though the people had chosen in December, when they made their ineffective or abortive choice, and the term of service is to be computed from the 1st of January of this year. That is the only term of service. The reason, as a matter of common-sense, is the inconvenience and injustice of any other interpretation. The provision is to be so construed to prevent the people from being disfranchised without cause and without redress. That is all that <inline font-style="italic">nunc fro tunc</inline> means. It is an old-fashioned phrase, and the object of the doctrine, as applied here, is simply to prevent prejudice to the people through the unjust taking of their rights. If it were not to be so construed according to common - sense, and justice and fair play to the people who are entitled to vote, then it would be in the power of any returning officer, through mistake, ignorance, or, it might be, corruption, to disfranchise the electors of any State, when they would have no redress. The opinions which have been given on this question are not authoritative, but, personally, I, and perhaps every other member of the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications, might have given them weight, but for the pronouncement of the High Court against the idea that section 13 interposes this obstacle to the people having their right of election now. We have, however, the judgment of the High Court of five Judges against those opinions, for I believe that five Judges were sitting when that judgment was given.- Since the report of the Committee was made, however, 1 find that in the United States almost this very question has arisen and been considered, and that the conclusion which has been arrived at there is the conclusion which the Committee, in this instance, have arrived at. There, as here, the. Senate is the exclusive judge of its own elections. Election to the Senate is by the State Legislatures. They are the constituencies, and stand in the same position as the people do here. The parallel is clear that far. There is a provision for temporary appointments to fill casual vacancies, which I will read. There is also a parallel in the United States to section  13  of our own Constitution, because a power to legislate was there given by the Constitution in relation to the times and the manner of holding elections by the State Houses. If I had come across this before the report of the Committee was prepared, I should have submitted it to the Committee. Legislation to that effect was adopted in  1866  for the first time. Honorable senators will find it on page  3  of the <inline font-style="italic">Revised Statutes of the United States,</inline> paragraphs  14  to  19  inclusive. </para>

                            <para>- They have not done so. Instead of our Constitution saying that the election shall take place before the end of the year, the term beginning on the  1st  of January, power might have been given in the Constitution, or might have been exercised under the Constitution, to do the same thing by virtue of a Statute, but the principle of construction, as to whether it was mandatory or directory, would be exactly the same in either case. I think it my duty to call the attention of the Senate to these matters, for. whatever I might think of them myself, it is right that honorable senators should have an opportunity of knowing of them. This is referred to in <inline font-style="italic">Miller on the Constitution of the United States,</inline> on page  613.  The Statute itself provides - </para>

                    <para class="block">Consequently, when the session ends, the opportunity of choice is at an end. In the United States, owing to the strife of parties in the State Legislatures, very frequently the session ends without any senator having been elected. The struggle is so great between each section to get its own man in, and there is so much obstruction, that they fail to elect anybody. The power to elect is confined to the session. It is fixed for the first Tuesday, but it goes on from day to day, and at  12  o&#39;clock each day another effort is made, until the session closes. Then, if the session closes with the State Legislature refusing or declining or failing to elect a senator, the question arises and has arisen, &#34;Could the power under the Constitution of appointing a temporary senator be exercised by the Governor of the State?&#34; Upon that I shall read a passage from <inline font-style="italic">Tucker,</inline> a well-known and authoritative writer on the Constitution, from which honorable senators will see that in very much the same language, or to the same effect as the Committee&#39;s report in this case, the conclusion is that the power cannot be so exercised. Not merely is that the case, but the Senate of the United States, acting upon the unbroken precedent of three-quarters of a century, has refused to recognise the appointees of the Governor of a State in cases where the State Legislatures for any reason have declined or refused or failed to elect. </para>

                        <para>A question has arisen, whether if the Legislature fails, for any reason, to elect a senator and adjourns without doing so, the Executive has power to fill it. Is it a vacancy which happens during the recess of the Legislature of the State? Did not the Constitution, by using the word &#34; resignation,&#34; in connexion with the words &#34; or otherwise,&#34; contemplate an incumbency which ceases by. resignation, death or  some other circumstance, or did it contemplate a vacancy in the office resulting from the Legislature never having chosen persons to fill it? The better opinion would seem to be, that where the term has never been filled, it is a vacancy in the office bv non-exercise of the elective function by the Legislature, which function the Executive is not competent to perform. The Executive power is only called into exercise where the Legislature, by reason of the happening of the vacancy, has had no opportunity to exercise its original function of electing. This executive power is never to be exercised where the Legislature has had the opportunity .to elect, but declines to do so. There may be reasons why it should so decline, and if so, it would be out of place for the Executive to elect, where the Legislature has deliberately declined to exercise the power. </para>

Although that attempt was made, the Senate refused to admit those so chosen to membership, and declared that they were not rightly entitled to sit. Haynes refers to the vacancies being left in consequence of the State Legislature behaving in that manner, and goes&#39; on to say - </para>

The position, as reported by the Committee, is, I venture to think, unassailable. It is suggested that this is a proper subject for the consideration of the High Court. For the reasons I am going to suggest, I, if it were possible, should welcome anything of the kind, but in view of the illuminative decision given by the High Court on the only controversial aspect of the question as I conceive it .in this case, I do not think that there is any point which a man of good sense and plain understanding cannot deal with and solve. I think it would have been best if when we were framing our electoral law and constituting the Court of Disputed Returns we had placed the question of disputed elections within its jurisdiction. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. It is no reflection upon any senator or, for the matter of that, upon the Government of the day, or the Senate itself, that it was not done. It must be remembered that the position in relation to the Senate was unique. Hitherto, under our system of government, we have always been accustomed to have elections that were dependent upon returns. Until the Senate was constituted there was not a transfer to another body to supply what are called casual or accidental vacancies. Of course, the omission occurred simply because the appointment out of which this case arose is not a return in the strict sense. Returns are only those consequences which come from a popular election. Therefore, every question of disputed election that can arise in connexion with the House of Representatives is within the ambit of the jurisdiction of the Court of Disputed Returns. But with the Senate it is not so, because the matter with which we are now dealing is not a return. We need not reproach ourselves at all, although we may think that it would have been better, and perhaps in the future we may be disposed to extend the jurisdiction. But the point now is that, like the American Senate, we have supreme and exclusive jurisdiction over elections, except so far as we choose to delegate it to other tribunals. We have not delegated our authority in this matter, and, therefore, the Senate has supreme and exclusive jurisdiction. The question is - Are we to shrink from that high duty on this occasion? To my mind it would not be worthy of us to do so. Would it not be a confession either of cowardice or of incompetency? In the Senate we have decided more difficult questions under the financial provision of the Constitution applicable to ourselves than this is. Why not in this case too ? But if this was thought to be beyond our powers, or our competency, why was not that course taken when the petition was presented ? Why was it referred to the Committee? That reference was an acceptance by the Senate of the duty of deciding the case. If that had not been intended, then the Government should have announced, and probably would have announced, that they proposed to take some other step, and I for one would not have been sorry if they had done so. The Committee, in obedience to the reference, undertook this most anxious and important inquiry with a view to arriving at a conclusion. To delay that by an attempted reference to the High Court now would be a slight on the Committee who have done their best to do justice. Let honorable senators show that we were wrong if they can ; let them declare, if they like, that the people of South Australia are not to be permitted, in this instance, to choose their own senator; that they prefer the State Parliament to do so for them, although in South Australia there is one House now undergoing the process of reform ; that they prefer to admit some one whose title is in question to. sit here rather than to trust the people. All this I should personally deplore, but I should not deplore it anything like so much as I should any action of the Senate abdicating its functions at this juncture after accepting them. It is said that our decision will not finally decide the matter for the future. It will finally decide this case. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Our decision will finally decide this case, and my belief is that it will finally decide the matter for the future. I may be wrong, but I have no apprehension as to the point being raised in the future. I think that the passage I read from the judgment of the High Court on the mandamus proceeding removed the only possible ground of doubt or contention in this business. But even if we wanted to do so, we have no means of referring the point to the High Court. We can have, of course, fresh legislation. Is the Bill to be introduced to refer this particular case to the High Court, or to enlarge their jurisdiction to deal with this and all other cases? When is it to get through the Parliament, and when is the case to be heard? We have no control over the arrangement of the business of the High Court. If it is proposed to legislate, we know what it means to have legislation that relates to individuals. This is a matter with which we have to deal, and it is unfortunate that it was only at the conclusion of the inquiry, and when the report was framed, that the suggestion was made. If there had been an intention to make such a suggestion, it should have been made on the  23rd  August. The petition, however, was referred to the Committee ; we expended our time and thought and it was a painful thing for any one of us to be sitting in judgment on a senator. Another consideration is that if a Bill is introduced now, it must be submitted to the House of Representatives. Why should that House interfere in a dispute which peculiarly concerns a seat in the Senate? If it is to be a mere amendment of the law, let it be made irrespective of the personal element. But the moment the personal element is introduced, as it would be in this case, the other House should not be invited to take a hand in settling who shall sit amongst us in the . Senate. I have said that there is no question of technical law. The members of the Committee were unanimous, as the minutes show, so far as regards the findings and reasons contained in the report. I sympathize with the feeling that has been expressed in the memorandum. I am aware that we would all be happier to &#39; be relieved of the consequences of a decision imposed upon us in. connexion with a duty we were bound to undertake, at whatever personal inconvenience, in the discharge of our obligations to the people who sent us here. The High Court also said that it was a question for the Senate to decide. </para>

                            <para>- The Constitution; says so, and the High Court in their judgment said so. They withheld any opinion on the particular matter as to the nature of the vacancy, although they declared that section 13 was no hindrance to the people having their rights of popular election, if another election were to take place. In the name of the Committee, then, I ask the Senate to adopt this report. If convinced that it is wrong, let honorable senators reject it. If convinced that it is right, let them adopt it. If they are in doubt, I should still say, adopt the report, because it is better to err in support of the people&#39;s franchise than in taking it away. Our duty is to stand loyally by the people of South Australia in this matter. We should be vigilant to protect their franchise. We should watch over the dignity and status of the Senate. We should protect it from intrusion by any one without a clear title to sit. I hope, at any rate, that we shall not pursue what I believe would be. a reactionary course. If we do, then, instead of maintaining the breadth and stability of the foundations of our political freedom as a Federation, we shall be undermining them and endangering the superstructure we have reared. Let us be true to ourselves, to those who sent us here, and whose right to choose their own senators is now in, our keeping ; and as the Committee has done its duty, I ask the Senate to do theirs by adopting this report. </para>

                        <para>. - I at once acknowledge the skill and ability with which the case which has been submitted on behalf of the Committee has been placed before the Senate. I would urge honorable senators, if possible, to regard, apart from all personal considerations, the duty which is cast upon us in this matter. The question is, wherein does that duty lie? Nothing, to my mind, would more completely unfit the Senate for the exercise of its functions in this case than to yield to any such sentimental considerations as whether popular elections should be vindicated or upheld, and the people trusted in this connexion. No member of the Senate would fail to trust the people if the opportunity were afforded to do so. The grave and important responsibility which, above all things, is cast upon the Senate is the interpretation and the upholding of the Constitution in its present terms. My honorable friend ventured to submit that the choice of the people and the principle of popular election stands at the root of the Constitution. While that is so to some extent, however disagreeable or unpleasant it may be personally, it is our grave duty, and one which should be courageously &#34;undertaken, to carry out, apart from all personal considerations, the terms of the Constitution, whatever they may be. I differfrom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> when He says that there is no dry question of law involved in this case. I submit, with the greatest respect, that there is nothing else whatever in this case but a dry question of law. I do not submit that as merely my opinion. I hope to be able to support it by words of the highest authority, showing that it is a dry question of law alone that is here submitted to the decision of the Senate. I say at once that I would have been delighted had it been possible for the honorable senators who constituted the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications to have come to a unanimous conclusion that, having regard to its being a dry Question of law, it was desirable that fresh legislation might be introduced for its interpretation. </para>

Having been referred to the Committee, and the Committee having made recommendations on the matter, that, of course, alters the complexion of affairs. I for one am not going to shirk the responsibility that is cast upon the Senate in the matter. I cannot, in passing, ignore the consideration that, however we may desire to divest ourselves of all personal or party feelings on questions of this kind, it is most difficult to do so. If we judge from what has hitherto taken place, the element of party quite unconsciously asserts itself in coming to a determination. </para>

Mv honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> also referred to the opinions which have been obtained upon this matter from learned counsel, and he sought to dispose of them by saying that they were given before the High Court delivered its judgment in the mandamus case, and that the High Court had disposed of the particular questions with which they dealt. I beg to differ from my honorable friend. It is quite true that the Justices of the High Court expressed an opinion as to the terms of section 13 - which is quite a subordinate matter. By so doing they disposed of that subordinate question, and that alone. But they did not dispose of the important question to which I have already referred - the real question involved in this case - viz., that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> a senator during his term of office from the date of his election on the 1  2th  December until the election was declared void on the 31st May. </para>

                            <para>- I am endeavouring to confine myself to the question before us, and I shall deal with it as reasonably and as impartially as I can. My honorable friend has said that he thinks there is no other side to this question. That is a startling proposition. I have quoted the view of the High Court on the matter. We have also, in direct opposition to the views of the. Committee, the opinion of the Crown Law Department, including the Attorney-General and also including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran,</inline> a most able constitutional lawyer. Let me say that the opinion of the Attorney-general was given simply for the guidance of the Home Affairs Department. But the South Australian Parliament, being in doubt as to &#39;their proper constitutional course, sought the advice of eminent counsel for themselves. They obtained the opinions of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dashwood, Mr. Murray,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn.</inline> Of the three I am acquainted only with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn.</inline> He is a recognised constitutional authority. My honorable and learned friend who has just resumed his seat has spoken in the highest terms of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray.</inline> I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dashwood</inline> is a lawyer of great experience and recognised ability in South Australia. These gentlemen all gave it as their opinion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> a senator for the term to which I have referred. These opinions cannot be brushed aside. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that honorable senators are going to brush aside these opinions without thoughtful consideration. I do not believe that they are prepared to accept for one moment the conclusion that there is no other side to this constitutional issue. It will be seen that the view taken by the honorable and learned  Chairman  of the Committee is in direct conflict with the interpretation and advice of the Government. . The advice of the Government is therefore challenged. We have consequently to decide as a Senate as to what is the correct interpretation to place upon the Constitution. If my honorable friend will forgive me for saying so, I do take exception to the terms of the report and to his speech. Both seem to me to proceed upon assumption, and skilfully seek, by piling argument  upon argument, to establish the conclusions which the Committee have arrived at. Let me point out one example. On page 6 of the report, paragraph 5C, the Committee say - </para>

                    <para class="block">My honorable friend has laid great stress on the point that the section says &#34; directly chosen by the people.&#34; Undoubtedly it contemplates that there shall be a direct choice by the people. If it be suggested for a moment that by reason of some abuse of power on the part of electoral officers a whole election might be voided, I reply that that is an unreasonable assumption. Honorable  senators will bear in mind that a later section, viz., section 15, forms just as conclusively a portion of the &#39;machinery of the Constitution. According to the terms&#39; of that section, upon certain things taking place under the circumstances therein mentioned, an election may be made by the two Houses of the State Parliament. In this case, a form of election did take place. To all intents and purposes, it was a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> election. </para>

Section 7 provides that &#34; the senators shall be chosen for a term of six years, and the names of the senators chosen . for each State shall be certified by the Governor to the Governor-General.&#34; Amongst other names returned at this election was1 th&#39;at of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon.</inline> . Section 13 provides for the division of senators so elected into two classes. It further enacts that &#34; the election to fill vacant places shall be made in the year at the expiration of which the places are to become vacant.&#34; The spirit of the section, therefore, is that the election shall take place in that year. By section 15 - :&#34; If the place of a senator becomes vacant before the expiration of his term of service &#34; - the onus is thrown upon the two Houses of the State Parliament to meet together and elect a senator if they are in session, but, if they are not, then the Governor of the State with the advice of his Executive is entitled to make the appointment, and &#34; the name of any senator so chosen or appointed shall be certified by the Governor of the State to the  Governor- </para>

The High Court meant that, even if an Act of Parliament derogated from the Constitution1, or used words which went further than Parliament had a right to go, that was not to be taken as final and we must fall back upon the Constitution at all times. When the Electoral Act refers to certain elections as being &#34;absolutely void,&#34; or &#34;void,&#34; or states that a &#34;place is not filled,&#34; the Court means that, in that case, we need not take any particular notice of the actual terms of the order.

During the term of the occupation of the office by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> this was, consequently, to all intents and purposes, a valid and complete election. The same principle is involved in standing orders 312 and 313, which provide -  312. Any question against the choice or appointment of a senator which can not, under the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, be brought before the Court of Disputed Returns, may be brought before the Senate by petition. 313, Every such petition shall be lodged with the  Clerk  of the Senate within forty days after the  President  has laid on the table the&#39; certificate of the Governor of the State for which the senator has been chosen or appointed. </para>

                            <para>- No. Therefore, in this case, on the same principle, if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon&#39;s</inline> petition had not been filed within forty days after the certificate of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin&#39;s</inline> election was received, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin&#39;s</inline> position could not have been disputed. <inline font-style="italic">Pro tanto,</inline> an election is a good election until it is actually declared to be void. That means that it is not a void election <inline font-style="italic">ab initio,</inline> but simply an election which is voidable. It &#39; is difficult to see how an election, which is absolutely valid unless a petition is filed, can be an absolute nullity, as the Committee contend in this case. My attention was drawn, in looking through the case, to a most important remark made on the self-same subject by Chief Justice Griffith, in the course of the argument - &#34; That which is valid but for the order of the Court cannot be said to be void in the absolute sense.&#34; That puts my case in a nutshell. I wish to draw the attention of honorable senators to some authorities dealing with the proposition which I have laid down-. Amongst many other modes of procedure, there are two to which I wish to draw special attention. The first is the procedure known as the mandamus procedure, where the Court is asked to command a certain body or authority to do a certain thing. There is another procedure called <inline font-style="italic">quo warranto.</inline> If it is thought that a person irregularly holds or fills an office, the Court can be appealed to by that process, and it can call upon the person to show by what authority he occupies the place. If honorable senators will try to bear that in mind, it will enable them to better follow one or two cases to which I propose to draw their special attention. The first is the old case pf <inline font-style="italic">The Queen</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">the Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of Chester,</inline> which was decided on the 8th November, 1855, and is reported in Vol. 25 of the <inline font-style="italic">Law Journal Reports,</inline> at page 61.

                        <para>It is an inflexible nile of law that where a person has been <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> elected&#39; to a corporate office, and has been accepted and acted in the office, the validity of the election and the title to the office can only be tried by proceeding on a <inline font-style="italic">quo warranto</inline> information. &#39; </para>

                    <para class="block">If a man, is actually in an office, he has to be proceeded against because he fills it. In <inline font-style="italic">quo warranto</inline> proceedings the Court recognises the- actual occupant of the office as the occupant for the time being, where the election has not been merely colourable. So, in this case, one would not go to the Court and ask for a mandamus to compel the Governor of South Australia to order a writ to issue ; but he might, for instance, serve a writ upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> &#39;Loghlin or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon,</inline> as the case might be, and then the respondent would be called upon to show by what authority he occupies the position.

                        <para>I must say that when I look to the return in this case, it clearly shows that the writ ought not to have issued. It alleges that the election was held on the 30th November, at which time  at least, there must have been a vacancy. Giving faith to that allegation, this is a case of plenarty. Smith was elected, accepted office, and was admitted, and it is alleged that the office was full of John Smith. It is a rule of corporation law that if an office be full, the title of it shall not be tried upon a mandamus to elect, but the party whose title is impeached must be proceeded against by <inline font-style="italic">quo warranto.</inline> I have no doubt that a <inline font-style="italic">quo warranto</inline> would well lie here. In <inline font-style="italic">The Queen</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Mayor of Leeds,</inline> the election of Richardson was merely colourable. But we cannot say that is so here, when upon the construction of the Statute contended for by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Welsby,</inline> whether rightly or wrongly I do not say, Smith&#39;s title to the office would be good. We ought not to be called upon to decide that question upon a mandamus. </para>

                    <para>I am of the same opinion. A mandamus will only go upon the supposition that there is nobody holding the office in question, and&#39; it is an inflexible rule of corporation law that where an officer has been <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> elected, and has accepted office, and acted, this constitutes a case of plenarty unless the election be merely colourable. In such a case his title to the office is not to be tried by a mandamus. What then is the meaning of the election being colourable ? I take it that when parties have the right to elect and proceed <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> upon the ground of there being a case for an election, it never can be colourable. In the present case, it may be that this election gave Smith no valid title to the office. But this depends upon the proper construction of the 26th and 47th sections of the Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Welsby</inline> contends that, under the 26th section, the mayor still continues a councillor, and that this was an . extraordinary vacancy under section 47, and that the election was rightly proceeded with according to that section, This argument may be all wrong, but is it so clearly wrong that we can lake upon ourselves to say that the election could not have been proceeded with <inline font-style="italic">bond fide?</inline> I cannot say that this is so, and therefore the mandamus does not lie. </para>

                    <para class="block">What is established clearly by that case is that where a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> and not a colourable election has taken place the office is filled <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> and has to be regarded from that stand-point. </para>

                    <para>Where it has been determined that the sitting member was not duly elected, and that some other candidate was duly elected, and ought to have&#39; been returned, the  Clerk  of the Crown is ordered to attend, and amend the return, by substituting the name of the duly elected candidate for the name of the other candidate. </para>

It was admitted that his vote could not be disallowed ; but on taking counsel with his friends he very properly desisted from voting. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not, and that is my case, as my honorable friend has so aptly put it. There is a Queensland case in which practically the same principle is involved, and which may be familiar to some of my honorable friends.  Linnett  and Turner were candidates for the  representation of Rockhampton North in the Legislative Assembly. Turner was returned, and occupied the seat for some time, but within the allotted period Linnett  lodged  a petition and won the case. Turner had been receiving . the parliamentary allowance as he had an undoubted right to do. When Linnett succeeded with his petition he said, &#34; I want to draw the salary from the date of the election,&#34; but the Court held that, as Turner had filled the position in the meantime, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> did, he had been properly paid. </para>

                            <para>-  I wish to draw the attention of honorable senators to the judgment of Chief Justice Griffith when Chief Justice of Queensland, in dealing with this matter. He says -  &#93;n the conflict of argument one consideration seems to me to afford a key to the solution,, and that is that the right to receive the money must be co-extensive with the obligation of the Treasurer to pay it. Whatever person the Treasurer is bound to pay is the only person who is entitled to receive. That seems to be the rational view. The person whom the Treasurer is bound to pay is the sitting member, whose name is on the roll of the Assembly, who is certified by the  Clerk  of the Assembly, and properly so, as being entitled to receive. The Treasurer is not bound to pay two salaries in respect of the same seat. He was bound to pay in respect  of the North Rockhampton seat. The person whom he was bound to pay was Turner. He has- paid Turner. That it seems to me is payment sufficient to satisfy the only obligation that the Treasurer and the Government have incurred towards the member for Rockhampton North, whoever he may be. The Treasurer admits that the plaintiff is <inline font-style="italic">primd</inline><inline font-style="italic">facie</inline> entitled,- but he says, &#34; I have paid that sum to the person indicated by the Legislature as the proper person to receive it, and having done that I have discharged my obligation.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- That is the general principle. It has been laid down in certain other cases which were quoted in the case to which I have referred. I do not think that such a proposition can be doubted for a moment. As a matter of fact, the same principle is more clearly and forcibly put in the case <inline font-style="italic">in re Brail</inline> in 1893,  2  Queen&#39;s Bench Division, page 381.. I find that it is cited again in another authority in respect to quite a different matter, and in regard to the effect of noncompliance with the conditions of a Sale of Goods Act. I quote from Williams&#39; <inline font-style="italic">Principles of the Law of Personal Property,</inline> page 77- </para>

                        <para>It appears that contracts made for the sale of goods worth&#163;10 or more without complying with the conditions of the 4th section of the Sale of Goods Act are not void but voidable only; that is they hold good until set aside. And where such contracts are of a nature to pass the property in the goods sold, it seems that they will confer on the buyer a voidable title to the goods. The construction of the 4th section in this respect is important with reference to section 23 of the same Act, enacting that when a seller of goods has a voidable title thereto, but his title has not been avoided at the time of sale, the buyer acquires a good title to the goods, provided he buys them in good faith and without notice of the seller&#39;s defect in title. For example, if specific chattels worth &#163;10 be sold by word of mouth without delivery of possession, part payment or earnest, the buyer would appear to acquire the ownership of them until the contract be avoided. And under the 23rd section a re-sale of the goods by the buyer in the meantime to a second purchaser buying in good faith and without notice of the defect in title, would deprive the original seller of the ownership which should otherwise re-vest in him on the avoidance of the contract. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is a principle of law which, so far as my experience goes, is conclusively established by a regular line of authorities, and has never been questioned. When we talk of this election having been declared void we mean, and the true construction is, that it was a voidable election. It was a sound, good and valid election up to the date on which it was declared void, and it would&#39; have been an absolutely valid election if a petition had not been lodged. Having all the elements of validity in the meantime, I do not think that it is possible to describe it otherwise than as an election which was merely voidable and not void ; an election which <inline font-style="italic">ab initio</inline> was not void, and which became void only on the order made by the Court of Disputed Returns. If that aspect of the law is correct, and this is  a  dry question of law, a vacancy did occur, and the other portion of our constitutional machinery, namely the 15th section of the Constitution, thereby came into operation and was duly exercised by the South Australian Parliament. According to the view I have put forward, that is the true construction of the law, and in the circumstances I ask honorable senators to be guided by the dry constitutional question alone. If they are, the conclusion at which they must arrive is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline><inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> occupied the place of a senator during the interval to which I have referred, and when the seat he occupied was declared to be vacant, the 15th section of the Constitution Act came into operation. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely mentioning that I wish to submit an amendment in order that honorable senators may follow my line of argument. If I had any doubt before the debate commenced as to the advisableness of the addendum to the Committee&#39;s report that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> and myself handed in, I am quite convinced, after hearing the two legal senators who have preceded me. What we point out in that addendum is that the Senate is quite incompetent to deal with the very difficult legal and constitutional point in question. When the Electoral Act was passed it was thought that we were rid for good of questions such as are now before us. It was considered that any dispute that might occur in connexion with an election would no longer have to be submitted to a House of Legislature constituted on party lines, but that it would be dealt with in the calmer atmosphere of a court of law, where better counsels might be expected to prevail, and where a more reasonable attitude would be assumed than can reasonably be expected in a House of Parliament. Indeed, I question very much whether the Senate is competent to deal with the matter at all in face of the Electoral Act. As neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> nor </para>

                            <para>- I have no desire to burke discussion by raising a point of order, though I think there is something in the point. Questions such as are now before us cannot, in my opinion, receive in a House like the Senate that calm consideration which is their due. Indeed, I do not think that it is fair that we should have such a bone of contention cast in amongst us to argue and fight over. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that there is any relation between the honorable senator&#39;s question and the matter with which I am dealing. My remarks apply generally. I do not think that those who differ from me on the general issue will differ as to the fact that it would be better to have questions of this kind entirely removed from party consideration. This is the second election petition with which I have had something to do in my short parliamentary career. The first was the petition presented to the Senate against a former senator for Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson.</inline> On that occasion we could not avoid dealing with the question for the simple reason that we had nothing but the Constitution to guide us as to what should happen. But since then Parliament has passed the Electoral Act. We were under the impression that that Act removed election petitions from the purview of Parliament, and provided for their settlement elsewhere. I think it fair to say of my colleagues on the Committee on that occasion, that there never was a fairer body of men setting out to deal with any matter brought before them. I daresay there was less of the party element on that occasion than there may be on this, because then both the sitting senator and the petitioner belonged to the same party. Consequently, the , party element did not arise to the same extent as it may do in this instance. But, nevertheless, charges were then made against the Committee to the effect that it had dealt with the petition on purely political lines. </para>

                            <para>- There was a good deal of feeling, though not perhaps of the same party character as may exist now. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> was well-known to be a member of the Opposition at the time the petition was under consideration, just as he always was while he occupied a seat in the Senate. , On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Saunders,</inline> the petitioner, for some reason or other which I could not thoroughly understand, received the support of the then Government. Consequently, the issue became a party one. But, nevertheless, it is only right to say that, in my judgment, party considerations did not influence the Committee a little bit in their determination of the issue. I have only to mention the fact that ex-Senator Glassey, who was an out-and-out supporter of the Government, and I, as a member of the Labour&#39; Party, to some extent, also a supporter of the Government, voted for what may be called the Opposition candidate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> actually supported the Government candidate. But, notwithstanding that, the charge was hurled at the Committee that it arrived at its verdict for purely political  reasons. That charge was made by a prominent member of the then Government, who now holds even a higher position than he did then. Under these circumstances, I say that we can hardly hope to have a satisfactory settlement of an election petition by a House of Legislature. </para>

That charge was made against us, so far as I can see, for no other reason than that we refused to be partisans in the conflict. That will show how difficult it is to do justice to a question of this kind, because the moment that a petition is presented against the return of a member party animosity is aroused, and once that happens, it is very difficult to get anything like a satisfactory solution of the question. The Senate is a party-composed House, and therefore is in a very bad position to settle a party question. It is as though we were asked to sit in judgment upon ourselves or to decide our own case- </para>

                            <para>- It ought not to be, but I make the usual allowance for poor, frail human nature, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> will admit that he has his full share. I have no desire to pose as any less a partisan than any other senator. I recognise that I am a partisan, and I shall not act the hypocrite by saying that I am not. I fight as hard as I can for the party to which I belong, and every honorable senator does the same more or less. Some may not feel as strongly as others, but we all1 have a certain amount of party bias which comes into play in a case of this kind, leaving very little hope of its satisfactory solution. We are not sent here to administer laws, or to act the part of judges. Our duty is to make laws, and this question seems to be quite foreign to the subjects that we should have to consider. Another fact that should have considerable weight with honorable senators is that, before the matter ever came before the Senate at all, it had degenerated into a party squabble in South Australia. It is, therefore, almost impossible for us now to free its consideration from the party element. That is another and stronger reason why it should be taken elsewhere for that judicial consideration which it cannot reasonably be expected to receive here. It is of no use for us to say that we can exclude the party element. Some honorable senators may work themselves up to a red-hot fury, and claim that they can do it, but whether they can induce other honorable senators to believe them or not is quite another matter. Nothing will be gained by our blinking those facts, and the sooner we recognise and act upon them the more will it be to our credit. I do not- wish to be regarded for one moment as reflecting upon the Senate, because every other Parliament in the world, so far as I know, has been in a similar position. What happened in the House of Commons when petitions against the return of members were considered is an illustration of my contention. Every time a petition was presented there it was dealt with on purely party lines. The Tory voted as a Tory with his own side, the Liberal voted as a Liberal, and the thing became so nauseating, such a grave scandal in the political life of the old country, that . the whole question was taken out of the hands of party politicians and remitted to a Court where it could be judicially settled, and where much greater satisfaction has been given than could possibly have been hoped for if the task had been left with the House of Commons itself. My remarks will, I hope, prepare honorable senators to give reasonable consideration to the amendment which I propose to submit later on, to the effect that the matter should be submitted to the High Court for consideration. I do not wish to enter into the merits of the case, as has been done by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I desire to have the question submitted to the High Court without any expression of party feeling, and without it being prejudiced by the views of either side. If we settle clown to discuss the pros and cons, and then send it on to the High Court after having dealt with it from a party stand-point, we shall have prejudiced the case to a certain extent. It is because I do not wish to express a partisan view, and because I look upon the report as a partisan report, that&#39; I do not wish to argue the merits of the question. </para>

The Committee was appointed by the Senate to do a judicial work. </para>

It will be entirely out of order to criticise the report as a report of a partisan nature, because it is. sent to us by a Committee which has been appointed to deal with questions of this kind from a judicial stand-point, and free, so far as possible, from any feeling either one way or the other on questions of party politics. I ask the honorable senator who is&#39; addressing the Chair not to give any opportunity to other honorable senators to interject that the report, or the members, of the Committee were partisan. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to avoid heat in the discussion, and, therefore, withdraw the word &#34;partisan,&#34; as it seems to be taken in a different sense from that in which, I was using it. I did not intend to use it in any offensive way. I will say that the Committee&#39;s report is a report of a kind that I cannot agree with, because it takes up an attitude entirely opposed to the view taken by the South Australian Parliament, the Governor of South Australia, the Federal Attorney-General, the Crown Solicitor of South Australia, and other legal and constitutional authorities. To that extent it is, in my opinion, a party report with which I cannot possibly agree if I desire that the whole question should be sent to the High Court for consideration. I am anxious to have the case sent to that tribunal without any prejudice to the petitioner or the sitting member. If we take sides, we shall send the case on somewhat prejudiced by the views that we express in this Chamber. </para>

                            <para>- When I returned the report was ready for presentation to the Committee. Before I heard the evidence I was anxious to have the question referred to the High Court, and thus freed from party consideration. I recognised at once that I could not agree to the report as it was submitted, and the only attitude which I could take up was to hasten its presentation to the Senate, so that the step which had engaged my mind all through could be proposed at the earliest possible opportunity. Although I did not combat many statements which are contained in the report, still I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> that I disagreed with them. With a great deal of the report I agreed, but to a great deal of it I was opposed, and the addendum indicates my attitude towards it. </para>

                            <para>- I dissent from the expression of an opinion which would prejudice the case when it - did go before the High Court. I consider that the question should be determined by that body, because it is the only way in which we can expect to get a satisfactory settlement of the dispute. I recognise that unless that course is taken the question may crop up from time to time, and it is because of that possibility that I desire to see the settlement of disputed returns transferred from the Senate to the High Court. I may tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger that I disagree with that part of the report which says that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> never was&#39; a senator or held the place of a senator. We have each seen that gentleman on the floor of the Senate, and that ought to be sufficient evidence that that portion of the report is, to use a very mild phrase, very far-fetched indeed. I ask honorable senators if it is not going too far to ask them to believe that part of the report? </para>

                            <para>- I admit that when I try to follow up fine points, I am generally led into deep water. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton did not say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was not a senator up to the date of his judgment. Had  His  Honour declared that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> had not been a senator, that he had not been duly elected, there would be much better ground for the&#39; attitude which is taken up by certain honorable senators. But we know quite well that the report does not go that far, and it is for that reason, I think, that the issue is somewhat confused. I have devoted much time to an effort to discover what was rea.lly in  His  Honour&#39;s mind when he delivered his decision in such brief terms as are recorded in the printed report. When I turned up the Electoral Act and noticed that there were several grounds upon which  His  Honour could have based his decision, it made me more confused than I had been. Had  His  Honour desired to make it clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> had never had any right or title to the position of a senator, or had never held that position, he would have based his decision on sub-section  4  of section  197,  and declared that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> had not been duly elected. But he based his decision on sub-section  6  of section  197,  which authorizes the Court to declare any election &#34; absolutely void.&#34; It will be noticed that the power is given to the Court to deal with, not one seat contested at an election, but an election. So far as the Senate is concerned, what is an election? Is it to be regarded as an election of three senators or as an election of one senator ? When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> pointed out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton had held that the case was not &#34; wholly void &#34; but &#34; absolutely void,&#34; I asked how it could be absolutely void if it was not wholly void, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> interjected, &#34;That is a strange kind of logic.&#34; . I cannot see where the strangeness came in. </para>

                            <para>- Then I beg the honorable senator&#39;s pardon. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton had declared that the election had been absolutely void, I hold that three seats would have been in question. Had  His  Honour meant that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was not duly elected he would have made his decision much clearer than he did, and then we could have arrived at an understanding that the vacancy which was thereby created bore more resemblance to a vacancy under section  15  than it does. Having regard to all these circumstances, I contend that there is only one course open to the Senate, and that is to refer the whole question to the High Court to be dealt with and finally settled. Otherwise, I do not believe that we can do justice to this case. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. It is competent for the Parliament to pass a Bill enabling the High Court to deal with this question and any similar question which might crop up. Unless we take that step there is, I fear, very little hope of justice being done to this case. We have no right to attempt to interpret the Constitution, and that is what really lies at the bottom of the case. The Senate, I submit, has no right to define or explain the Constitution. The interpretation of the Constitution was intrusted to the High Court, which alone, in my opinion, should deal with this point. </para>

                        <para>. - The question with which we have to deal is more or less a delicate one. It affects very seriously the position of a gentleman who, whether rightly elected or not, certainly had reason to believe that he was rightly elected, and who, since he has occupied a seat here, has won the respect and kindly feeling of honorable senators on both sides. According to a Judge of the High Court, the members of the Senate are the proper persons to deal with the question. On what lines ought it to be dealt with? Ought it to be dealt with merely as a matter of dry law, as requested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best?</inline> I hope not; for it seems to me that that is not the best course for us to adopt. I think that we should deal with this matter rather as a court of equity appointed under the Constitution to do that which is right in the interests of the people. However great our regard for the person affected by a certain decision, we should do that which we think right in the interests of Australia and of South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- No ; but it is a fact that- in such cases the personal element counts for something. If, in this debate, it should count for anything, it must be in favour of the honorable senator whose interests are affected, and the case will not be decided against him as the result of any personal prejudice. I propose, first of all, to deal, briefly with the question as one of dry law, as the Vice-President of the Executive Council asked us to do. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> should direct his question to the lawyers who have introduced so much dry law and unintelligible technical terms into this debate. If the matter is to be considered as one of dry law, there is only one question involved, and that is whether at a particular time what is known under the Constitution as &#34;a casual vacancy&#34; did exist? Is that a question which we can discuss or settle here? If we come to a decision upon that question, will that decision be a precedent for future guidance in similar cases? Undoubtedly it will not. Have we any proper course open to us to refer that question to the High Court for decision? We are informed that we have not. I gather from the arguments submitted this afternoon bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> who is entitled to be listened to on account of his attainments as a lawyer and the study which he has given to this matter, that unfortunately we cannot take that course. </para>

But, in my opinion, there is a higher and a very much better way in which to deal with this question. In spite of the arguments and opinions of Attorneys-General and lawyers, the facts are staring us in the face all the time. Whatever legal construction may be put upon the. matter, and whatever legal technicalities may be introduced, it is a fact that the people of South Australia were last December called upon to elect three senators. Did they do so, or did they not? </para>

                            <para>- The question was asked ; If, instead of a declaration that one of the South Australian seats had become vacant, it had been declared that three were vacant, what would have happened ? If the whole election had. been declared null and void, as was the election of a particular individual, would the State Parliament have elected three senators? I ask the question from the stand-point of what is right in the interests of the people of South Australia. Let me assume that the elections of Senators Symon and W. Russell had been declared null and void, as was that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon;</inline> that the same procedure had followed as in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon&#39;s</inline> case, and the Parliament of South Australia had been suddenly called upon to elect, three senators instead of one. would the people of that State have stood it, and would honorable senators here, who rightly proclaim the power and rights of the people, have stood it? </para>

I do not know whether the people of South Australia are satisfied with the existing conditions of things or not. All I know is that they have not been consulted on the matter. I was assuming the case of the election of three senators being declared null and void, and the Parliament of South Australia, desiring to do what it considered right, proceeding to elect three persons as senators, and) at the same time, ignoring the claims of persons who had submitted themselves to the people for election, and had obtained tens of thousands of votes. Would our friends of the Labour Party, or honorable senators of any other party, have tolerated such a thing? </para>

I was not a member of the Senate at the time.&#39; It was for the Victorian senators or others who were&#39; members at the time and took an interest in the matter to protest if they saw fit. I was assuming, in the circumstances I have described, that the Tasmanian. Parliament selected for nomination as a senator some outsider who had not submitted himself to the will of the people at the election, and had not asked for their support. I assume the selection of an extreme conservative, and the ignoring of the claims of a man who had served the State well as a senator in the past. Would honorable senators who clamour for recognition of the people&#39;s rights, in such a case, hold the same view as they appear to hold now? </para>

                            <para>- I did read it, but it does not seem to me that it involves any disagreement with the report. It expresses a desire with which I largely coincide to secure a declaration from the High Court, on the question involved in this case. I should be glad if it were possible to get from the High Court a declaration as to what really constitutes a casual vacancy. I was accused a little time ago of having formed an opinion somewhat prematurely. But my opinion on this case was formed some months ago, before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> came into the matter at all - immediately after the High Court declared that the election of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was null and void, and directly after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> had anticipated the opinion of the Attorney-General, and declared the vacancy a casual vacancy. I then came to the conclusion, which I now hold very strongly, that it was not a casual vacancy. </para>

                            <para>- We are now discussing the question of whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> has been properly elected as a senator or not. The question of party has been raised several times. I do hope that whatever inclinations or prejudices honorable senators may entertain - and I freely admit that we all have them more or less - the Senate will pause and consider seriously before it refuses to act upon the report of a Committee appointed by itself, and which was appointed regardless altogether of circumstances which have since arisen. I admit that it is unfortunate that five senators from one side of the Senate sat upon that Committee. But still no one, not even the Minister, has attempted to argue against the report. I have not heard a single argument except on the legal technicalities involved in the case. </para>

                            <para>- The Convention desired that the people themselves should choose their senators. If there is one thing that stands out in regard to the work of the. Convention, and that has been given effect to by this Parliament - which is, in a certain sense, the creature of the Convention - it is that they desired that the people themselves should elect their representatives. When that right is taken from them in any way whatever, we infringe the intentions of the Constitution in a very serious way indeed. Although it happens that five members of the Committee sit on one side of the Chamber, I feel very strongly that they allowed no party feeling to influence their decision. I should be very sorry to attribute, either to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie or to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> any such feeling. I believe that both of them endeavoured to do what was right.&#39; If the Senate decides that the question shall be settled on legal lines, we should take steps to enable the High Court to so settle it. I should very much like to see that done. But I should prefer that the Senate should proclaim to the world that the rights of the people shall be maintained independently of party considerations, and that questions of this kind shall be determined on the best and highest principles, regardless of legal technicalities. </para>

                            <para>- I am not a party man, so far as this matter is concerned; and if it is possible, for what I may, perhaps, describe as the O&#39;Loghlin mystery to be referred in any reasonable form to the High Court, there is no member of the Senate who will more readily give a vote in that direction than I shall, because I hold that it will be more satisfactory for the matter to be determined finally by the High Court. But that did not appear to &#39;me to be a reason why I should shirk the responsibility which was, in my opinion, placed upon me. As a member of the Committee I had to discharge my duty. I have discharged that duty to the best of my knowledge -and ability. I believe that every member of the Committee did exactly&#39; the same. Let me also say that, for several Parliaments, I was a member of the Elections and Qualifications Committee in the New South Wales Parliament, where our decisions were final, and there was no reference to the Chamber. I took part in I cannot say how many cases, but I never heard one comment from any source that was derogatory to the honour and the straightforward conduct of the members of the Committee. </para>

                            <para>- Surely my honorable and learned friend must have al1 lowed his partisanship to run away with his sense of propriety for the time being. It appears to me that nothing can be dearer to members of the Senate - or to members of the other branch of the Legislature, if it comes to that - than the proper representation of the people in Parliament. That feeling ought to transcend any idea respecting the feelings, wishes, or interests of the Government or of any party whatsoever. The theme upon which I have touched is a painful and deplorable one, which cannot be satisfactory to us or to people outside. If the Government were to withdraw the amendment which they have submitted, and to afford an opportunity for the submission of the amendment which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has outlined, I for one would vote for it. I recognise that the whole subject is complex. It would give more satisfaction to the people, and they would have more confidence in the result, if it were settled by a tribunal of lawyers rather than by a tribunal composed chiefly of laymen </para>

                            <para>- What I have said is not an evidence of that at alL I am prepared to vote for the report, if * I cannot have the matter referred to a legal tribunal as I should prefer to do. I stand by the report most unhesitatingly as in my opinion embodying a correct decision. But I am not now dealing with this matter as a- member of the Committee. I am here as a member of the Senate. I am not going to make a partisan business . of the report. We have brought up our report as member&#39;s of the Committee, and our . duty is therefore terminated. We have now to deal with the report as members of the Senate, and not as members of the Committee. I entirely appreciate the proposition laid down by previous speakers, that  the whole genius of our Constitution is the representation of the people here, and I, for one, should be very glad to see that section of the Constitution altered so as to compel all vacancies, no matter how arising, to be determined by popular vote. It is not at all desirable, for the sake of occasionally saving a few pounds of expense, that we should have a Senate consisting of members differently authorized, that one should come here by election of the people, another by the choice of a State Parliament, and another, perhaps, as the nominee of a State Governor. I know that we have had senators coming here before under those circumstances, but I have never liked it, and I have never considered it a desirable condition under our Constitution that the Senate should consist of members of varying authority&#39;. Who dare advance the proposition that a gentleman who comes here as the nominee of a State Governor or the choice of a State Parliament is clothed with equal authority . with the large majority who come here by the direct authorization of the people? I shall hope yet that this question may be settled without the very ugly appearance of partisanship which certain matters that have transpired this afternoon have most unhappily attached to it. </para>

                        <para>. - It is highly desirable that the basic principle of the grave issue now before the Senate should be strongly emphasized. The position which I take up is largely determined by the opening .section of that portion of the Constitution which deals with the Senate. Section  7  says -  the Senate shall be composed of senators for each State, directly chosen by  the  people of the State, voting, until the Parliament other-  wise provides, as one electorate. </para>

                    <para>Provision is then made for that election. The principle &#39;guiding and governing the constitution of the Senate is that it shall directly represent the people. We, upon this side, are seeking that the Senate shall, under ail possible conditions laid down by the Constitution, be reflective of the voice of the people. I feel that I am entitled,, by way of criticism, to comment upon the fact that, to our claim, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, on behalf of the Government, replies, &#34; It shall not be so if we can avoid it.&#34; The election of a Senate by -the mass vote of the people is a provision unique in the Constitutions of the world. To show that that is not merely the opinion of senators who may be inclined to magnify their office, I shall quote the words of Professor Harrison Moore, of the Melbourne University, one of the most learned jurists in Australia - </para>

                        <para>The Senate is popular in the mode of its Constitution. The Bill of 1891 followed the United States Constitution in providing that senators should be directly chosen by the Houses of the Parliament of the several States. There was nothing as to which there was more agreement than that this system should give way to one which secured immediate responsibility to the people. Senators are to be directly chosen by the people of the States, and the qualification of senators and electors is not left to the States to determine, but is uniform with that of members and .electors for the House of Representatives, .&#34; but in the choosing of senators each elector shall vote only once.&#34;  Only  in the case of casual vacancies is the scheme of 1.891  resorted  to. </para>

                    <para class="block">Section  7  states that senators shall be chosen for a term of six years. Section  9  provides that the Parliament may make laws prescribing the method of choosing senators, but the method must be uniform for all the States. Section  1 2  enacts that the State&#34; Governor may cause writs to be issued for the election of senators for the State. Ir&#187; the case of a dissolution the writs must be issued within ten days from its proclamation. By section  13  the division of senators after the Senate first meets into two classes is provided for, the places of the one class becoming vacant at the end of three years, and of the second at the end of six years. Afterwards the places of senators become vacant at the expiration of six years from the beginning of their term of service. All those sections go to show that the Senate is based upon the principle of the declaration of the voice and choice of the people. The next mention of vacancies arises in section  19,  which provides that a senator may resign &#39;his place, which thereupon shall become vacant. Section  20  enacts that the place of a senator shall become vacant if for two consecutive months of any session he fails, without the permission of the Senate, to attend the Senate. When casual vacancies of those kinds occur, section  21-  provides that the  President,  or in his absence the Governor- </para>
                    <para class="block">General, shall notify the vacancy to the Governor of the State, in the representation of which such vacancy . has happened/ Section 21 must be read with sections 19 and 20, because it provides what is to be done when the contingencies mentioned in those sections arise. The two classes of vacancies which may be said to be casual, and which are clearly indicated within the Constitution, are those of actual resignation, or of forfeiture of seat through absence without leave. </para>

                            <para>- If a senator is disqualified by the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications, then the Senate itself will deal with the vacancy. Those sections clearly indicate the difference: between a casual vacancy and &#39; other vacancies. Unless the strongest reasons can be given there seems to be no justification for falling, back upon section 15 and giving to it a somewhat extraordinary interpretation,, in order to ascertain when and how a casual vacancy occurs. It seems to me that it., was &#39;intended by the Constitution that those were the two situations which should be construed as coming within the category of casual vacancies. Without the strongest justification, we should not strain any, provision with a view to defeating the principle of the Constitution, which is the popular election of the Senate. It is not a question of whether one party or set of politicians may desire that the Senate should have been elected on the Canadian principle, which is nomination by the Crown, or the American principle, which is election by the State Legislatures. What we have to determine is, whether <inline font-style="italic">ox</inline> not there is a casual vacancy. It is a significant fact that the High Court seem to have thought it to be our duty to consider this matter. If it is our duty, we should not shrink from if, and from the responsibilities which it entails. When the question of a mandamus came before them, the High Court concluded their judgment with the following paragraph - </para>

                    <para class="block">The question in dispute is whether or not it .is. a casual vacancy, and that question has been referred to the Senate by the High Court to be determined in accordance with section 47 of the Constitution. I desire to draw the attention of honorable senators to a peculiarity in the wording of the provision. It says that the question &#34; shall be determined &#34; by the House concerned. In the interpretation - of law, the word &#34; shall &#34; is usually regarded as being imperative, and not merely directory. It might -not prevent us from saying that we preferred not to decide the question. Once a dispute arises the words in section 47 are absolutely imperative. What we have to deal with is not the question of an election, or of the validity of an election, but the question of a vacancy in the Senate. The Constitution says that whenever a question of that kind arises in either House, it shall be determined by that House &#34; until the Parliament otherwise provides.&#34; I take it that we shall be assisting the High Court if we do come to a clear decision upon the question as to whether or not there is a vacancy. As Senators de Largie and Turley entered no dissent, I assume that the Committee was  unanimously of opinion that there is a vacancy in the Senate. In view of what may be regarded as practically a unanimous report on that point, the judgment of the High Court, and the authority of section 47 of the Constitution, it seems to me that the Senate would be shirking its duty, and acting iri a way derogatory to its status, if it referred the question for decision to another body. -I also notice in section 15 of the Constitution another significant, and, I think, somewhat important feature. In the case of every other section of the Constitution dealing with vacancies, there is a marginal note to explain what is its .general scope; b,ut in the case of section 15, the marginal note is &#34;casual vacancies.&#34; So that there is a clear distinction between the vacancies mentioned in sections 19 and 20, and those mentioned in section 15. It seems to me that it is only in the case of a vacancy which can be determined to be casual&#39; that section 15 is to apply. We have the judgment of the Court of Disputed Returns that, so far as one candidate was concerned, the election was null and void. It has been pointed out that if we were to adopt the interpretation for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has contended, on many an occasion it would leave it open to a corrupt official, or a corrupt Administration, through its officials, to defeat the choice of the people in order that the nominee of a State Parliament might represent them in the Senate. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> if we cannot find a specific provision in the Constitution, we are not entitled to draw an inference. But I would remind the honorable senator that it is our duty to interpret the Constitution as a document that will lead to nothing which is either absurd or dangerous to the people. I desire to refer to one or two arguments which were advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> In- the first place, he dealt at some length with the position created, unfortunately for South Australia and for us, and quoted legal opinions which have been given. An honorable senator called his attention to section 13 of the Constitution, and I wish to draw attention to the strong wording of the judgment of the High Court thereon. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to emphasize the point around which many of the opinions quoted by the honorable senator seem to centre, and that was the difficulty of dealing with an election if it occurred after January. It is suggested that it would have to be regarded as a casual vacancy occurring under section 15, and that that provision was made to avoid the heavy expense which would otherwise have to be incurred. Every opinion which the honorable senator quoted seemed to be given in view of that apparent difficulty. The point was argued very strongly before the High Court&#62; and dismissed because there was nothing in it. &#39; I will read the portion of the judgment, which I think has already been quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> It says - </para>

It was suggested that this provision is inconsistent with an election being held after the first of January to fill vacancies which ought to have been filled at an election held before that day, but we do not think that there is anything in this point. If the election ought now to be held it should, we think, be taken to be held <inline font-style="italic">nunc -pro tunc</inline> for all purposes : otherwise the main purpose of securing a regular rotation of senators would be frustrated. </para>

                            <para>- I think it is almost the basis of the Attorney-General&#39;s opinion. I may, perhaps, be giving too much weight to that aspect of the question, but I- cannot give too much weight to the judgment of the High Court in the matter - that there was nothing in the contention as to this difficulty. Whilst directing my criticism to interjections made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I said that it is a useful rule in argument, when a proposition is advanced, to show to what conclusions it may lead. I wish to put a hypothetical case, and to ask honorable senators opposite what is the answer to it . from their point of view. Suppose, for instance, Brown has been elected and sits and votes here as a senator. A petition is presented against him to the Court of Disputed Returns. The Court orders an inquiry, which may occupy weeks and possibly months. In the meantime Brown dies. What will the Vice-President of the Executive Council then contend the position to be ? </para>

                            <para>- While there is no doubt that his party should perform that charitable duty, there is still a higher duty to the country to be performed. I ask honorable senators opposite to address them selves to the question. Suppose the Court of Disputed Returns declares that Brown has not been properly elected, the contention of honorable senators opposite is that, notwithstanding that decision of the Court, the State Parliament can afterwards say, &#34; We shall elect whom we please.&#34; It seems to me that the other side are driven in this case to argue that they have that power. Their contention appears to be that affairs can be so managed that a State Parliament may elect persons against whom a petition has been presented to the Court of Disputed Returns and whom that Court has declared not to have been elected. When they can come to such an extraordinary conclusion it is reasonable to hold that the principle on which they have proceeded is not correct. The same thing might happen in the case of three senators, and it might be contended that, notwithstanding the finding of the Court of Disputed Returns that their election was void, a State Parliament could step in and say, &#34; We elect you.&#34; Such a position is not defensible for a moment, and I am interested to know what answer the Vice-President of the Executive Council would give to such a case as I have supposed. If the position I have described is not defensible, how can honorable senators opposite defend the position they take up in the present case? The Vice-President of the Executive Council also mentioned as analogous certain <inline font-style="italic">quo warranto</inline> proceedings. I do not know that I rightly followed the honorable senator&#39;s application of the argument in this connexion. It seemed to me that the reference was an extraordinary one. The term <inline font-style="italic">quo warranto</inline> is from old Latin, which is sometimes referred to as &#34; dog &#34; Latin, but is very simple in meaning. It refers to an inquiry as to the right or title on which a man holds his office. I confess that I was surprised to hear from the Vice-President of the Executive Council that you can question the right of a senator to his seat by <inline font-style="italic">quo warranto.</inline> I understood the honorable senator to suggest that if some one wished to challenge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin&#39;s</inline> right to his seat, proceedings by <inline font-style="italic">quo warranto</inline> are open to him. This is the first time I have ever heard of proceedings of that kind lying against the validity of the seat of any member of Parliament. I have looked up the question in an authority which I do not think can be disputed, and I propose to quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopaedia of the Laws of England</inline> to explain the circumstances in which proceedings under <inline font-style="italic">quo warranto</inline> might properly lie. </para>

I understood the honorable senator to argue by analogy from the result of certain <inline font-style="italic">quo warranto</inline> proceedings, and, as I contend that this peculiar mode of legal proceeding is never applied to the validity of the election of members of Parliament, the honorable senator&#39;s arguments from that analogy were drawn from a position which was not applicable to a case involving the validity of the seat of , a member of Parliament. </para>

No attempt can be successfully made to qualify the effect of those words. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has pointed out that under section  197,  paragraph , iv., of the Electoral Act, the Court might have decided that certain persons who had been returned were not duly elected, and might, under paragraph vi., have declared the election to be absolutely void.

I think that the two cases in which casual vacancies are provided for are clearly pointed out in sections  20  and  21  of the Constitution: As the Vice-President of the Executive Council has said, we have to deal with a dry matter of law; but after all there is a great . principle involved, and. that is that our decision should be based upon a desire to give effect to that principle of the Constitution which declares that the Senate shall embody the idea of popular representation. I trust that we shall stand by that principle. </para>

I&#34; think I do not misunderstand the desire of the people of that State when I say that they wish that every one of their six senators shall be on the same footing. Following up the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> I should be inclined to say that it is the duty of the Government to advise the Senate to deal with this question &#34;on its own,&#34; to use a common phrase. We have power to deal with it, and we ought to preserve our powers under section 47. The wisest course would be for us to pass a Bill immediately declaring that there is a vacancy, and providing for an election to fill that vacancy to be carried out by a poll of the people on the lines laid down by the Constitution. By taking that course we shall find that we have increased the respect and confidence of the people who sent us here. I trust that the Senate will take steps to enable South Australia once more to be represented entirely by senators who have received the popular choice. </para>
