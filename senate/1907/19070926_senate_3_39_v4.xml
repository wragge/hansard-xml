                    <para>- I rise to make a personal explanation. On Friday last <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> rose to a question of privilege with regard to a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> concerning the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications. I did not pay much attention fo the report when I read it that morning. just as the honorable senator commenced to speak some important letters were placed in my hand, and I was reading them whilst he was speaking. Afterwards I heard the honorable senator raise his voice and call attention to the fact that the article in the newspaper indicated what the effect of the report would be. A moment or two later I understood him to ask whether any member of the Committee had been authorized to make any statement as to its proceedings, and I said, &#34;Certainly not.&#34; If I had risen and made an official statement,&#39; as probably I ought to have done, I would have pointed out that at its first meeting the Committee did authorize the  Chairman  to communicate to the press, on application, such salient facts as are usually communicated to the press, namely, that the. Committee had met, and adjourned, arid in this particular instance the reason for a long adjournment, namely, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie had left the State, and wished to be present before the report was agreed to. I regret that I did not make a statement to that effect, because I thought that my honorable friend was inquiring if anybody was deputed to give an account of the judicial proceedings of the Committee, which, of course, ought to be withheld until it has reported to the Senate. </para>

The report will be printed in the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> of to- day ; but if its consideration is postponed, and an order made for printing, it will also be printed as a parliamentary paper. The report from the Committee &#39;is published in the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> of the day when it is&#39; brought up, and twice printed in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> by reason- of the fact that it is submitted to each House. It will not interfere with the right of any honorable senator if this report is adopted &#39;immedi at ely, but it will reduce the cost of printing. It will still be competent for an honorable senator to ask the Senate to order the printing of any paper which the Committee has not recommended to be printed. </para>

Before the insertion of the advertisement a number of machines had been brought under my notice by correspondents. The attention of each of such correspondents is now being specially directed to the advertisement referred to. It is anticipated that still further machines will be brought under notice of the Department ; meanwhile, I have instructed the Chief Electoral Officer and the Inspector-General of Works, in conjunction, to submit proposals for the constitution of an Examining Committee and for the procedure of testing. </para>

                    <para>This is a Bill to grant and supply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the service for the year ending  30th  day of June,  1908,  a sum of money for the purposes of additions, new works and buildings. It is necessary to deal with this Appropriation Bill before the main Estimates are submitted for consideration, because some urgent demands have been made upon the Treasurer in respect of requirements for additions, new works, and buildings, and also in connexion with various sites required throughout the Commonwealth. The principle adopted by the Treasurer is to refuse to grant or pay any moneys without  the sanction of Parliament. In introducing the Bill, I think I shall be justified in reminding honorable senators, in a word or two, of the financial position of the Commonwealth. According to the Customs and Excise Estimates, we hope to receive revenue to the amount of ,&#163;10,509,000; and after deducting the cost of collection, &#163;278,045, there will be left available for division, the sum qf &#163;10,230,955. The Commonwealth&#39;s one-fourth of that sum amounts to &#163;2,557,739, and that available for distribution to the various States - namely three-fourths of the whole - is &#163;7,777,208. Our free revenue - that is the revenue derived from the post office and other services - amounts to &#163;3,236,200. So that our available revenue is &#163;5,793,939- The expenditure which is proposed in the Estimates amounts to &#163;5,689,947 - that is, excluding Customs expenditure - leaving, therefore, a balance of &#163;103,992. It is only fair to point out that the total amount proposed for works and buildings in the main Estimates is &#163;819,874.&#39; Last year, the amount provided was only &#163;479,724. The actual expenditure incurred last year was &#163;472,781. So that in the present Estimates we propose an expenditure exceeding that of last year by &#163;347,&#176;&#176;&#176;- </para>

                            <para>- It is not remarkable in any way. What is more, the Estimates, as I hope to show my honorable friend, are based upon the strictest lines of economy. The &#163;347,000 excess provided for this year is mainly accounted for by a sum of &#163;216,000, which represents new special defence provision. It was originally included in the main Estimates, and was not intended to be included in these. I have mentioned that in the preparation of these Estimates the Treasurer has not yielded, to the demands - and the reasonable demands - of the Departments. The amount originally asked for by the various Departments totalled &#163;i,io7;o86, which included &#163;511,027 asked for by the Post and Telegraph Department. The Treasurer cut down the Post Office Estimates to ,&#163;300,000, being a reduction of something like &#163;211,000 on that item alone. I venture to think that, were the money easily available, there is very much to recommend the granting to this great revenue-earning Department, the Post Office, of the full expenditure asked for, &#163;511,000. I have mentioned that the total sum originally asked for by all the Departments was &#163;1,107,086. The amount granted on the main Estimates is &#163;819,874. So that the Estimates were cut down by &#163;287,213. Under the Appropriation Bill now under consideration, honorable senators are asked to vote a sum of &#163;686,824. That is something like &#163;134,000 less than the amount provided for on the original Estimates, which were laid on the table on the 8th August. The vote for special defence purposes, which amounts to &#163;216,050, has been reduced by the sum of &#163;134,050. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, the vote for special defence purposes, amounting to &#163;342,000, or less the amount which it is anticipated may not be expended during the year, to &#163;216,050, has for the moment been reduced by the sum of .&#163;134,050 as the items harbor and coastal defence, &#163;215,000, and cordite factory, &#163;10,000, will not be proceeded with for the present. The Government are not in a position to supply the Senate with the fuller information they were anxious to supply in- submitting those items. In relation to the cordite factory, as honor-  able senators will be aware, it is proposed to establish a factory at a cost of something like  &#163;10,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hake,</inline> a very experienced State officer - as to his experience and ability I can! speak personally - is at present visiting the old country with the object of collecting information in regard to this subject. Matters appear to be in a state of transition in regard to the manufacture of cordite. The minds of some military authorities are apparently in a nebulous condition regarding it. Questions from time to time ha.ve arisen as to its storage. Experiments have been made, and we prefer to wait for the return of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hake</inline> before submitting proposals in this direction. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. If Parliament desires to have fuller information, before actually passing the vote in question, of course we shall be. pleased to supply it. But, of course, honorable senators can safely rely that the Government would not spend the money without the fullest justification, founded upon the reports received from experts. This brings  me to an additional item which appears at the end of the Estimates, namely,  &#163;1,000 for the purposes of the proposed London offices of the Commonwealth. In approaching this subject I suggest with the greatest confidence that adequate provision for the representation of the Commonwealth in London is certainly not a party matter in any shape or form. I am sure that all sides must be influenced by one anxiety, and that is to promote the highest and best interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I am going to take the Senate into my full confidence. The object of the Government in placing this sum on the Estimates is to ask Parliament to affirm whether, as a matter of policy, it is desirable to secure a site for Commonwealth offices in London. If the Senate approves of that proposal, as another place has, it will then be the duty of the Government to proceed at once with negotiations to secure an eligible site. This matter engaged the attention of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer during their visit to London. Amongst several sites submitted to them was one in the Strand,  which, in their opinion, was specially eligible. The Strand is one of the greatest highways connecting the east and west of London. It is an exceedingly busy thoroughfare, and the site commended itself in every way to my colleagues. The London County Council is at present engaged in re-arranging that portion of the city, and by reason , of the demolition of buildings which formerly stood there, the vacant land is immediately available. Three sites were submitted in this part. I have here a locality plan which is available for the inspection of honorable senators. The semi-circular road known as Aldwych forms portion of the resumed urea, and so does the new thoroughfare of Kingsway, which leads up to Holborn. The sites front the Strand, and are situated between St. Mary&#39;s Le Strand Church and St. Clement Danes Church. The area which has already been selected by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent</inline> forms the western corner of the conical-shaped block shown on the plan. The three sites are marked here. Site A has an area of 10,000 superficial feet, and was submitted at* a price of 19s. per foot. Site B immediately adjoins  that selected by the Premier of Victoria, and also represents 10,000 superficial feet, offered at 18s. </para>

                            <para>- It does not cover those sites. It will be observed that the Committee, after considering the proposals contained in the cablegram of 20th July, adjourned for two months, during which period, of course, it was open for us to make offers for their consideration when they met. The matter was recently submitted to the House of Representatives. I point out again that the amount was only placed in these Estimates with a view to obtaining an expression of opinion from Parliament as to the desirability or otherwise as a matter of policy of acquiring a site for Commonwealth offices in London. The other place having sanctioned the item, the Prime Minister yesterday sent to Captain Collins the following cablegram - </para>

                        <para>House of Representatives last night agreed to Government opening negotiations with County Council and if conditions found suitable offer will be made. Information first desired on following points : What happens at end of 99 years; what is furthest time that would be allowed for commencing building ; what rates and taxes are lessees liable to pay? It is considered that conditions should provide for renewal on expiry of lease on re-appraisement or building paid for on valuation. Obtain building conditions and forward by first mail. Offer if made will probably be for whole Strand frontage with depth of 65 feet. </para>

The sole object in forwarding the telegram is to secure the necessary information, so that if the Senate approves of the project, and the Bill is passed, the Government will be authorized to enter into negotiations for a site in London. The price to be paid will be something between 13s. and 18s. per superficial foot. </para>

The position therefore is that the Government desire to secure the whole frontage to the Strand running right up to the junction of Aldwych, with a depth of 65 feet. It is estimated that this block will have an area of about 12,000 superficial feet, and the rental required will be something like &#163;11,000 at 18s. per foot, the maximum price suggested, and a considerably less sum of &#163;8,000 odd if the site can be secured for the lesser price of 13s. per foot. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend must know that the matter was not before us a week ago. Honorable senators will observe that the votes contained in this Bill may be divided practically into five groups. There is, for instance, a total proposed vote of &#163;221,824 in connexion with matters under the control of the Home Affairs Department; a vote of &#163;300,000 in connexion with the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department ; and of &#163;2,000 for the Treasury. For the Department of Defence there are two proposed appropriations, one of &#163;80,000, and the other of &#163;82,000, and in connexion with matters under the control of the Department of External Affairs there is a vote for .&#163;1,000 to which I have already referred. It will be noticed that various items in the schedule are marked with an asterisk. For instance, in division 1, subdivision No. 1, in connexion with the Home Affairs Department, there is a vote of &#163;6,000 proposed towards the cost of erection of a store at Darling Island, Sydney, and the note attached explains that the total cost of this work will amount to &#163;30,000. Particulars of this expenditure can be supplied if honorable senators desire. Then there is a vote &#176;f &#163;7&#62;5&#176;&#176; towards the cost of erection of a Customs House at Fremantle, and it is noted that the total cost of this work will be &#163;10,000. On the same page- there appears a new item of &#163;12,000 for a trawler. Honorable senators will be aware that the subject of the purchase of a trawler was under the consideration of tHe Senate last year, and a sum of &#163;8,000 was voted for the purpose. On expert advice, it has  since  been recognised that &#163;12,000 will be necessary for this purpose, and we have now placed that amount on the Estimates. For works in connexion with the Defence Force under- the control of the Department of Home Affairs, there is a vote of &#163;32,087 for rifle ranges, distributed as follows: - For New South Wales, &#163;10,993; Victoria, &#163;7,864; Queensland, .&#163;3,725 <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> South Australia, &#163;1,430; Western Australia, &#163;1,854; and Tasmania, &#163;6,221. The practice in regard to rifle ranges has been in some cases to grant the amount required to rifle clubs, and in other cases the Government Department undertakes, the work. An amount of ,&#163;9,693 has been included under the headings of the various States for drill halls, and &#163;9,256 for fortifications, and. &#163;6,618 for barracks. Under Post Office buildings, including the purchase of sites, there is provided a sum of &#163;147,078, distributed as follows: - For New South Wales, ,&#163;34,246; Victoria, &#163;58,300; Queensland, &#163;30,086 ; .South Australia, &#163;14,977 ; Western Australia, &#163;^8,494; and Tasmania, &#163;975. Under telegraph lines a vote of &#163;77,500 is divided in&#34; this way: - For New South Wales, &#163;20,000 ; Victoria, .&#163;20,000 ; Queensland,   &#163;20,000  ; South Australia, &#163;0,000; Western Australia, ,&#163;8, 000 ; . and Tasmania, ,&#163;500. Under telephone lines, including construction of conduits and placing of wires under ground, &#38;c, there is a vote of &#163;237,000 proposed, and distributed amongst the States in this way : - New South Wales, &#163;56,000 ; Victoria, ,&#163;80,000 ; Queensland, &#163;29,000 ; South Australia, &#163;25,000 ; Western Australia,  ,&#163;24,000 ; and Tasmania, &#163;23,000. </para>

                            <para>- We are not asking one shilling for the erection of a building for a cordite factory. This vote of &#163;819,874, which is less &#163;2,000 for printing plant, will be chargeable in this way. The works to be carried out in New South Wales are estimated to cost &#163;260,079, and thatState will be charged on a population basis, .&#163;305,476. The works to be constructed in Victoria are estimated to cost &#163;247,305, and that State will be charged on a population basis with &#163;243,146. In Queensland, the estimate for these works is .&#163;116,357, and the State will be charged with- &#163;105,604. In South Australia, the, estimated cost of the works proposed is &#163;76,505, and the State will be charged &#163;76,324. In Western Australia, the estimate of cost is &#163;^7 1,659, and the State will be charged on a population basis only &#163;52,114. The works proposed for Tasmania will cost ,&#163;45,969, and the State will be charged only &#163;34,940. I conceive it to be mv duty to refer to one or two items for post offices and telegraph buildings under .the control of the Department of Home Affairs. A sum of <inline font-style="italic">S.n,</inline> 000 is required to provide for alterations at the General Post Office, Sydney. </para>

                    <para class="block">I believe that an alteration of its internal arrangements is urgent. But this vote is only a contribution towards a total sum of  &#163;40,000  which will be expended for that purpose. Last year a sum of  &#163;15,000  was voted in connexion with the General Post Office at Melbourne, but only  &#163;2,574  was spent. A sum of  &#163;19,000  is required for the current year, and the total cost on the work is estimated at  &#163;30,000.  The item of  &#163;10,000  for wireless telegraphy has been dealt with here. A sum of  &#163;1,000  is required for the survey of a cable route to Tasmania. I believe that negotiations are in progress for the purchase of the existing cables from the Eastern Extension Company. The survey of a route is being undertaken in case the Government and the company should be unable to agree upon a price. Of course, if they do agree upon a price, no survey will be made. It is believed that a better route can be secured, so that, in the event of the failure of., the negotiations, and in that event only, the work will be proceeded with. I believe than an arrangement has been made with the Pacific Cable Board to undertake the survey at cost price. A sum of  &#163;80,000  is put down for the purpose of special defence material. Last year  &#163;130,000  was voted for that purpose, but  &#163;159,988  was expended. The ordinary vote of the Defence Department for last year amounted to  &#163;639,000  ; the Department spent  &#163;610,000,  and that left available  &#163;29,000,  which was applied towards the purchase of special defence material. Under the head of &#34; New special defence provision,&#34; a total sum of  &#163;82,000  is required. That includes- a sum of  ,&#163;50,000  for guns, lights, and emplacements for fixed defences. </para>

                            <para>- I am hardly in a position to answer my honorable friend, but I shall make inquiry into the matter. Under the head of &#34; New special defence provision,&#34; a sum of  &#163;32,000  is also set down towards the cost and erection of a plant for a small arms factory. That practically represents one-half of the amount which will be required, namely,  &#163;65,000.  No- provision is included in that amount for the building. It. is contemplated that shortly . a building will have to be provided. I understand that it will be. an inexpensive one, and is not to exceed about  &#163;10,000.  It is anticipated that it . will be constructed of galvanized iron, with a concrete floor. With regard to the item, of  &#163;50,000  for guns, lights, and emplacements for fixed defences, I am informed that the Imperial Defence Committee reported that the armament of the fixed defences in the Commonwealth should be, as far as possible, uniform, and recommended  6-inch  mark  7  guns. The Committee of local officers appointed to consider the question were of the same opinion. The total cost of carrying out this work, with the necessary ammunition and electric lights, will be approximately  &#163;280,000. </para>

                        <para>- - I think that the Minister has laid himself open to a charge of being wanting in generosity. I feel that he is under a very great debt of obligation to honorable senators on this side for having plied him with questions with reference to a mysterious and apparently non-existing option. It -has enabled him to reveal two excellent attributes in his character. The first is his extreme loyalty to his colleagues, which no one doubted, and the second is (he extreme adroitness which he is capable of developing when he desires to extricate a colleague from an awkward position. I propose to show exactly what has transpired with regard to the varying Ministerial statements- .on the subject of a site for Commonwealth offices in London. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .Best</inline> was speaking, I interjected that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne had altered the proofs of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> That is not a statement which ought to be made lightly. I recognise the seriousness of it. I made the interjection, not on the spur of the moment, but because I had seen the proofs which were supplied. </para>

                            <para>- I am not speaking about altering the facts, but about altering the proofs of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The practice, as honorable senators are aware, is for proof slips to be supplied to members whose remarks have been reported. I assume that in this case proof slips were supplied to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, the Minister who answered the questions, and also to those members who submitted the questions. I have no doubt that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has been supplied with a copy of the proof as supplied to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne and altered by him. </para>

They can only have been inserted in one way, and that was when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne edited the proof which was supplied to him in conformity with the existing practice. With regard to the other statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, made in reply to an interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> Smith, that also has been altered by the addition of the words, &#34; asking for information.&#34; Both those interpolations have been made for the purpose of showing that what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne said was merely that the object of the cablegram sent and the efforts of the Government was to obtain information. The words have been put in since the proof slips were supplied to the gentlemen whose names I have given. It is quite possible that, as altered by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, the proofs now represent what he intended to say. But it is quite clear, from what I&#39; have seen, that they are not what he did say, and that they have been altered, presumably, by the honorable gentleman himself. </para>

                            <para>- It will be a combination of the two. I admit that it is not material to the matter under discussion, but I refer to it in justification of the interjection I made some time ago. The Vice-President of the Executive Council said, very rightly, that the policy of acquiring a site in London was in no sense a party matter. I cordially indorse that sentiment. But it was not as a party move &#39;that honorable senators on this side submitted their questions. What they considered to be the question at stake was, not whether we were to acquire a site in London, but whether the Government were going to ignore the Senate, whether they were going to enter into a very serious financial responsibility without first obtaining the views of this co-ordinate branch of the Legislature. </para>

                            <para>- I am not now disputing that, but merely saying that the questions were submitted from this side not with any reference to the policy of acquiring a site, but because we, on the strength of the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, thought that a commitment was being entered into without the sanction of the Senate. With regard to the financial aspect of the case, let me point out exactly where we stand. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has said that this innocent-looking vote of &#163;1,000 is submitted in order that Parliament may be able to give an expression of opinion as to the policy of selecting a site. So far as it goes, it is all right. But if honorable senators ask the question, &#34; What is it we are asked to approve?&#34; there need be no doubt that if the item is passed now the Government can claim, and rightly claim, that it has a free hand to commit the Commonwealth practically to any expenditure which it likes. . Is the item on the Estimates for the purchase of a site? No. It is towards the erection of a building in London. That is the technical question upon which we are asked to vote; but, according to the answer which we give to that proposal, the Government will determine whether or not we give it a free hand in continuing the negotiations which apparently are only now commencing. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. But I re-affirm that this vote is put to us as a means of expressing our approval of a policy. I have every reason to believe that the Senate will agree to it. But if we express approval of the proposal we must recognise that we give the Government an absolutely free hand. What is the extent of the cheque which we practically hand over to them? Do honorable senators realize that it means an expenditure of anything up to &#163;1,000,000 or .&#163;1,500,000? The absolute commitment, if these negotiations are carried through, is, I repeat, a total of ,&#163;1,000,000 or .&#163;1,500,000, according to whether the Government succeeds in getting this area of land nearer to or further from the minimum of 13s. per foot. Taking the net annual rental at the mean between 13s. and 18s., and allowing a reasonable estimate for rates and taxes - which I presume will have to be paid by the tenant - what will the Commonwealth have to pay? </para>

                            <para>- That is information for which 1 am much obliged to my honorable friend. It confirms the figures that I have given, that on the ground alone, plus rates and taxes, we shall have to spend every year something in the neighbourhood of &#163;15,000. A ninety-nine years&#39; lease would mean, therefore, a sum ranging to something near ,&#163;1,500,000. I admit that that will be spread over a long period ; but I put it that under this innocent looking item, we aic practically asked to determine whether the Commonwealth shall- incur a liability of ,&#163;1,000,000 or &#163;1,500,000. And that is a liability irrespective of the amount which we shall have to provide to erect a building on the land if we acquire it. I am not saying that as a reason why we should not vote for the item, but I point out that it is not the small and innocent looking item that the Government would have us believe. It is another evidence of that absence of business capacity that even the friends of the Government must credit them with, that, although the option is about to expire, the Government are not yet in a position to furnish us with information as to the terms on which they can acquire the land, and have had to cable to London for it. We were told all along that the option was on the point of expiration, but we find that the Government does not know the very essential factors that are involved in the acquisition of the land. When ray honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger interjected that he hoped that we would not have, in connexion with this matter, a repetition of what happened in connexion with the mail contract, I thought there was good reason for the remark. I hope that we shall not have another such difficulty. But it is remarkable that, on the very eve of concluding the contract, and of asking Parliament to consent to it, the Government do not even know the terms on which the acquisition of the land is possible, do not even know what time they will have before they commence to build, and do not even know whether rates and taxes will have to be paid bv the Commonwealth. They are absolutely ignorant of everything except that land is to be had if we pay the price for it. These facts do not inspire me with any great confidence as to the business aptitude which the Government are likely to display in conducting the further negotiations in connexion with the matter, I pass now to the main question. Here I approach another subject that has no party aspect. It is not a party question in the sense that any party has anything more to gain or lose than any other party by the consideration of it. I allude to the whole financial outlook which is opened up by the introduction of this Bill. Whatever set of political views may induce men to bind themselves together, it is quite evident that no Government can carry on, and no party can continue in existence, unless it pays attention, above all things, to sound finance. I ask honorable senators whether they have paused to consider the fact that the Government is in the habit, of coming down and asking the Senate to pass Bills involving very considerable expenditure of public money, without the slightest regard to the effect that that expenditure may have upon the financial position generally ? In dealing with this matter it is not merely the financial &#34; position of the Commonwealth that we have to consider. There is also a special obligation upon us in the Senate to consider the effect of Federal, finance upon our respective States. My own State is perhaps one that could, as well as any State in the Union, afford to regard leniently the financial pranks of the Commonwealth. But there are other States in the Union whose finances are already seriously straitened by the very existence of the. Union itself; and I venture to say that those of us who come from the larger, and for the time being more wealthy, States are under an obligation to give careful and generous consideration to the position of the weaker States of the Union. We are now within some two years of the time when we have not merely got to talk, or think, or suggest, but when we have to be prepared with a working scheme to take the place of that provision of the Constitution known as the Braddon section. We are in the habit, I am afraid, of going upon the principle that &#34; sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.&#34; But this is a matter that is not likely to wait, because we have to remember that while. we in the Commonwealth are enthroned in a strong position, and can afford to act very much as we please, it is not fair to the States that we should fail to tell them within a reasonable time what proposition we have to submit, and what treatment we are prepared to give to them. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that I must admit that. But, at the same time, I urge that no want of consideration on the part of the States, and no irritating action on the part of State politicians - no neglect of their duties - can be any excuse for neglecting, or should be any incitement to us to neglect, our duty. I quite admit the difficulty which is occasioned when we find an inclination on the part of State politicians not to smooth the inevitable friction, but: to increase it. I am not now speaking with any desire to increase difficulty, nor am I in any sense making an attack upon the Commonwealth. My inclination is entirely the other way. i am as anxious as any man can be to make this Union strong, powerful, and beneficial. But we can only do that by showing that those who are responsible for Federal legislation can rise to the height of their responsibilities, irrespective of State irritation,- and map out  a  ;course beneficial te the whole of Australia. I should like in saying that to add, ;for fear of being misunderstood, that I do not mean to say for a moment that because the Commonwealth has the power it should necessarily exercise it without regard to the wishes of the States. While having regard, first of all, to the wishes of Australia as a whole, as it is our duty to do, the Federation should endeavour to mete out, not merely just, but generous treatment to the States. </para>

                            <para>- I am not saying that it does not. I am speaking of some scheme which must take the place of the Braddon section when it expires. Let me invite the attention of honorable senators to a few figures. I do so to lay the foundation for a statement which I have made quite recently, and shall now support, that the Federation is steadily running to this, position. Without saying that any one is to blame for what has taken place, I point out that the Federation will soon be faced with the serious task of bringing its income up to its larger expenditure. If that be so, it is not wise for us to wait until the time occurs when we shall have to adopt a new policy. We ought immediately to anticipate the difficulty as far as we can, and endeavour so to arrange our financial course that when the time does come we shall be prepared to meet it. In the first year after the Commonwealth Tariff came into operation, the total revenue was &#163;12,105,000. We returned to the States that year  &#163;8,204,000.  This year, with a revenue of &#163;I3&#39;750,000, we return to the States only &#163;7&#62;75&#176;&#62;&#176;&#176;o. In other words, with a revenue of &#163;1,639,000 in excess of that for the first year of the uniform Tariff, we are&#39; giving back to the States &#163;425,000 less. I call attention to these figures particularly. The Commonwealth receives into the Consolidated Revenue &#163;1,639,000 more, and it gives back to the States &#163;425,000 less. Another way of stating the facts is this. In the first year of the uniform Tariff, we gave to the States &#163;1,145,000 over and above their constitutional three-fourths. This year, with a much larger revenue, we propose to return only &#163;103,000 in excess of the three-fourths. </para>

                            <para>- I am taking the Government&#39;s Estimates. I am not saying at the present stage that any of these figures could have been altered ; and, above all, I do not wish it to be thought that I am making any accusation of extravagance against the administration of. the Commonwealth. I am not doing anything of the sort. It is not often that I am in a position to agree with the Acting Prime Minister, but I cordially indorse his remarks when I say that I have never known a Government that has been conducted on  such economic lines as the Federal Government has been. But it is one thing to have economical administration, and quite another thing if Parliament is continually passing proposals for Federal expenditure without knowing where the money is to come from to meet it. I recognise that at the expiration of the Braddon section, the Commonwealth will be in a very enviable financial position if we are prepared to ignore altogether the obligations of the Commonwealth to the States outside the constitutional requirements. </para>

At the rate we are going on now, our expenditure will in a year or two be considerably in excess of the one-fourth to which we are at present entitled. It is clear that we shall not be able to return to the States the three-fourths unless we find new sources of revenue. </para>

We are under no obligation when the Braddon section expires to do anything, so far as the Constitution is concerned. But I think everyone will recognise that as the Federation has taken over the Customs and Excise Departments, which are the great revenue yielding sources of taxation, we have got, not merely for the ten years of the Braddon section&#39;s operation, but for a much longer period, and probably for ever, to make some equivalent to the various States. What is that equivalent to be? </para>

But that would not in any way relieve the Commonwealth finances. We should have to find interest amounting in round figures to &#163;7,250,000 upon the debts, and therefore the Federal Treasury would be no better off. Whether we had to pay back that amount to the States, or paid it in interest charges upon the debts, we should still have to find that amount, which is probably somewhere about the sum which everybody will agree, irrespective of the Braddon section, ought to be paid to the States. </para>

                            <para>- How long has my honorable friend displayed this pathetic faith in the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest? I should have much more faith in that saving of 5s. per &#163;100 if it were made by the men who hold the stock. I decline to believe that the shrewd financiers of London will give up the stock of unquestionably solvent States, unless they receive a full <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> for it. There may be a possible saving when those loans fall due and have to be renewed. The Federation may then be able to obtain money for redemption purposes at lower rates of interest, but that is a saving which could only take place as the loans fell due, and is in no sense an immediate saving. Whether we take over the States debts, or give back to the States an amount equal to the interest upon them, we are in the position that on our present revenue Estimates we have practically exhausted the money at our disposal, and seeing that we have a growing expenditure, it means that we are almost shaking hands with a deficiency. On the present year&#39;s Estimates we have &#163;103,000 over and above the amount which we are legitimately entitled to retain. That is all the margin between meeting our requirements and any contingent expenditure. If we had paid our way, and met all the obligations which could be fairly charged against us, then, instead of having &#163;103,000 to the good, we should have been seriously to the bad, because the present Estimates take no account of interest upon transferred properties. If we add that liability to our annual expenditure, then instead of having &#163;103,000 to the good, and being in a position to  hand it back to the States, we should already have to face a deficiency. One of the biggest and most serious financial mistakes ever made by the Commonwealth was made when we started to hand back the surplus over the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue without insisting on its being regarded as part payment for the transferred properties. We have given back some millions of pounds in that way. </para>

Instead of giving back that amount - I will not say as a gift, because it was collected from the people of the States, and we are under an obligation -to return everything that we do not. require - we, as business men, ought to have said to the States when handing the money to them, &#34; Please regard it, not as an unconditional payment to you, but as part payment for the transferred properties, the total balance on which will be adjusted when you have made your valuations.&#34; Had that been done we should have found when the valuation was made that from 60 to 80 per cent, of the transferred properties had been paid for, and would have been to-day unencumbered Federal property. </para>

                            <para>- I should not occupy the time of the Senate in stating it if I did not believe it. At any rate, the Commonwealth would have been in a better position if that course had been followed. If the States do not like to husband their resources, that is a matter entirely for themselves to deal with. It would further have lent considerable force to the demand which exists in New South Wales that the State Government should have economize as the Federal authorities took over certain expenditure. Even assuming that there were  no contingent liabilities, such as transferred properties, to set against this surplus of &#163;103,000, we have already committed ourselves, if not legally, certainly indirectly, to other expenditures which will far more than absorb it. Simply to enumerate the headings which must throw expenditure upon the Commonwealth, I take the following: - Papua, Northern Territory. No more important subject ever called for the attention of Parliament than the .development of that portion of Australia. I will not say that it is the one weak spot, for I am afraid there are several, but undoubtedly it is the most dangerous spot in the  coast line of Australia. No man can affirm that at this very moment some hostile landing is not taking place there. Whatever the cost - and that is an unqualified remark - Australia has to take up the burden of the Northern Territory. . That means a very considerable call upon the public Treasury. Then we have, I do not say by any means the unnecessary or excessive, but undoubtedly the enlarged calls which the new defence policy makes upon us. The Estimates for this year, whilst they contain an enlarged defence vote, do not take cognizance of that larger expenditure which is .involved in the policy of the Government. I am not Questioning the wisdom of the policy. I am merely pointing out that in order to give effect to it we have to face a larger expenditure than is provided for by the present Estimates. In two items - the small arms factory and the ammunition factory - these Estimates only make provision&#34; for half the amount required, and make, of course, no provision for the annual upkeep of those establishments. Another project dear to the hearts of honorable senators, but which cannot be carried through without money, is the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway. The Government stand practically committed to carry out that work, irrespective entirely of what the survey mav disclose. The Vice-President of the Executive Council shakes his head, but the principal argument used for that work was &#34;the moral obligation!,&#34; which was not for a survey but for a railway, and, as the Government based  their action upon the promise of a railway, then, whether they are right or wrong, they stand pledged to carry that railway out. That is a matter upon which I cannot promise the Vice-President of the Executive Council any great assistance, but it is one of the obligations to which the Government stand committed, and which must entail a very considerable drain upon the public Treasury. </para>

Another matter which also involves some expenditure - if it is to be seriously regarded, and treated as other than a subject for levity, and I believe the Senate is prepared to deal honestly and fairly with that portion of the Constitution - is the question of the Federal Capital. The appointment of a High Commissioner must be considered. We cannot support a  fully  equipped Commonwealth office in London without a considerable annual grant. We shall not obtain our mail contract in the future except at a price in excess of that which we have hitherto paid. </para>

I have no doubt that that item indicates merely expenditure in connexion with torpedoes. I have, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> remarks, left out altogether the additional expenditure which will be involved at any stage of the establishment of an Australian Navy. &#34;I have shown that, .on the figures of our present revenue, the moment we attempt to carry out not all, but even two or three of those obligations, we shall be face to face with financial difficulty. But that position becomes accentuated if we assume that the Tariff proposals of the Government will be carried, and have the effect which, all protectionists assume that they will have. I have gone so far on the basis of the revenue as it stands this year. But no protectionist will say that the Tariff, after being in operation for some time, will continue to yield as  large a revenue as it does in its early stages. </para>

It is not often that protectionists and free-traders agree upon a fiscal question, but in this case, even a hidebound protectionist like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> and a thoughtful free-trader like myself, agree that the Tariff, sooner or later, must give a diminishing revenue. In proportion as the Tariff, .by reducing the purchasing power of the people, or by shutting out imports, tends to diminish the revenue, to that extent will the deficiency which is already looming close at hand, be increased and hastened. </para>

If we are so close to a deficiency with a revenue of over &#163;13,000,000 we clearly must expect to have to face a deficiency if the Tariff should prove effective, and so cause a diminished revenue from Customs. Therefore, the effect of the Tariff, whether beneficial or not, in other directions must be to. hasten arid accentuate the financial difficulties to which I have referred. </para>

Having dealt with what might be called the pessimistic aspect of the financial proposals of the Government, so far as they have been disclosed, I might refer to one redeeming feature in connexion with our finances, and that is that so far the Federal Parliament has paid out of revenue for the construction of works and buildings a large amount, which under the practice in the various States would have been paid from loan money. </para>

                    <para>I believe that at the Imperial Conference it was decided that the oversea self-governing Colonies or States might in future be designated as &#34;Dominions.&#34; The occasion to which the motion I have moved refers marks an important era in the history of New Zealand. We have many sympathies, and many interests in connexion with trade, in common with that country. We find in New Zealand a market for a number of our products, and we reciprocate, by being customers of New Zealand, as our import returns show. The good . feeling which at all times has existed between what is now the Dominion of New Zealand and ourselves has been such as warrants us in adopting the motion I have proposed. I am sure we are all agreed that the marked prosperity her people have hitherto enjoyed, the advance they have made in the settlement of many social questions, and the courage shown by her statesmen, entitle New Zealand to recognition as one of the most important portions of the Empire. I am confident, therefore, that the Senate will deem it a privilege and a pleasure to have the opportunity on the occasion of the assumption by New Zealand of the new title of &#34; Dominion &#34; to offer her people its sincerest and heartiest congratulations. </para>

It is not necessary that I should, by additional phrases, seek to enhance the expression of fraternal greeting which, in suitable words, has been so appropriately submitted by him. I, therefore, content myself with seconding the motion, and I do so with a great deal of pleasure. </para>

                        <para>. - I have, I think, only to point the moral of the facts which, perhaps, I have wearied honorable senators in relating. The financial position of the Commonwealth is, to my mind, quite obvious. That is to say, we are steadily and rapidly drifting into a position in which we will have to face a deficiency. If does not appear to me to be in accord with common sense, or business-like to wait until the deficiency absolutely arises before we consider our position. An ordinary business man would scorn the idea of waiting until he was in difficulties before he took stock of ways and means. The .obligation which, in such circumstances, would rest upon any individual in the community rests upon Parliament, and, in a special manner, upon the Senate, for the reasons which I mentioned&#39; in my opening remarks. I say that the position of some of the States has been extremely acute. I refer especially to Tasmania. No State has suffered so seriously in connexion with its finances as the island State of the Union. </para>

                            <para>- The &#34; people of Western Australia do not carry the somewhat serious burden of direct  taxation which the people of Tasmania, have to bear. However, it does not affect my argument to say that one State is more seriously injured tha&#39;n another, nor do I suggest that, however serious the injury &#39;to any State&#39; may  be  at the present time, the ultimate benefit of the Union will not more than compensate for it. But I point out that one of the obligations specially resting upon this, the States&#39; House, elected to guard the interests of the States, is to see that we do not travel a reckless financial road, which might lead, not only to throwing Federal finances into confusion/ but to seriously hampering the States in carrying out the great work still left in the hands of their Governments. The question is : What can the Senate do to prevent this? The Government submits certain proposals, and the alternative to accepting them is, possibly, some hostile action which would bring into play every party feeling. I do not wish- to take such action, but I do think that it is  incumbent  upon the Senate to inform the Government, and honorable senators may do so in their speeches, that &#39; we are not prepared to go on as we have been doing in the past, blindly appropriating large sums of public money without the slightest intimation from the Government as to where they are to come from. For all practical purposes, we have passed a&#34; Bounties Bill ; we are now asked to pass a Bill appropriating about  &#163;750,000,  and no one here has the slightest idea of what are the Government proposals for raising the revenue required to meet that expenditure. We have not the slightest idea as to where the Government propose to raise revenue to meet the important contingent liabilities to which they stand committed. All we know is that for the ensuing twelve months we have reason to suppose that our income will be sufficient to meet the expenditure for which we are providing, if we leave out of sight the contingent liabilities to which I have referred. Beyond that, all is confusion and chaos. Certainly no business people would carry&#39; on) their business in that way, and while I think we may say that another branch of the Legislature has not given that close attention to the finances which the position demands, it is incumbent upon us to exercise the utmost caution in dealing with these proposals. Above all, I invite honorable senators to make it quite clear that the Senate will not go on indefinitely granting large sums of money until there has been a frank and full disclosure of the financial proposals of the Government. Earlier in the day, I contemplated moving an amendment which would enable honorable senators to express their opinions in that direction, but, after conferring with many of my honorable friends on this side, I came to the conclusion that perhaps at this juncture it would serve the purpose which I and others have in view, if I were to refrain from such action, and so enable honorable senators to express their views without the introduction of any element of party feeling. I invite the Senate to recognise the opportunity presented to it to become the guardian of the finances of the Commonwealth, and the advocate of sound and honest finance. It is in order that honorable senators should be induced to accept this responsibility and obligation that I have taken the opportunity of addressing myself to them as I have done this afternoon. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sure that we have all listened with considerable interest to the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> Every member of the Federal Parliament, and, indeed, every Federalist in Australia must recognise that the honorable senator has given a fairly accurate forecast of the financial problems that confront us. But, after-all, what we have to think of is not so much the recognition of those problems as the necessity of deciding what we shall do to meet them. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> what he proposes to do in connexion with this Bill. </para>

                    <para class="block">Can the honorable senator suggest any means by which, in dealing with this Bill, we can &#39; solve the problems to which he has referred? So far as I can see, it is not possible for us, in connexion with this Bill, to take any action to bring about what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and others believe to be necessary. The various financial proposals of the Government must be assented to by both Houses of the Federal Parliament before they can be carried into effect. If they receive the assent of Parliament, then, presumably, a majority of the people of Australia are in favour of them. </para>

If they return a Parliament pledged to cut down the revenue from Customs, there is only one alternative before them - they must be prepared to accept direct taxation from the Federal Parliament. There is no other alternative, except national bankruptcy or dishonest finance. </para>

                            <para>-Their commonsense should have taught them that that is the position. They should know that if they demand a protectionist policy which will destroy revenue from the Customs House, and at the same time pledge Par-&#34; liament to works involving very great public expenditure, they must be prepared to face the alternative of direct taxation. I rather rejoice at that prospect. I do not put that forward as &#39;a doleful tale, because I think it is a thing to be desired. </para>

                            <para>- I think, we can get over that objection in a very satisfactory way, though perhaps this is not the proper time to say how  Ave  shall raise the money for that purpose. One objection always crops up whenever a Bill of this kind is brought forward by a Ministry. A Bill is submitted which ostensibly commits the Commonwealth to an expenditure of &#163;600,000, whereas a great portion of that sum was voted in the previous year. Public works proposals are submitted, both Houses sanction the proposed expenditure, but the vote is not expended within the financial year. This Bill, for instance, provides . for a total expenditure of &#163;241,824  on  works and buildings for the transferred Departments, but of that sum no less than &#163;60.847 was voted last year. That may not be dishonest finance, but, at any rate, it is very awkward finance. We get the credit of being extravagant, because we vote money twice. People say, &#34; Look at what a tremendous sum the Commonwealth proposes to expend,&#34; when,, perhaps, we know, as a matter of fact, that at least &#163;100,000 of the sum will not be spent within the financial year. One reason  why  a vote is not spent in the smaller States is that our public works are carried out through the State Department of Public Works at a percentage charge. If it happens to be busy, then the Commonwealth public work has to wait until the State work is completed. The works for the Defence and Post and Telegraph Departments are carried out1 through the Department of Home Affairs. First of all, one has to get the Post and Telegraph Department to agree that the erection of a post-office is necessary, and having done that, to persuade the Department of Home Affairs to get the State Department to take up the work of preparing plans and calling for tenders. When all that has been done, the State Department has to be asked to keep its eye upon the Federal work while it is in progress. That is cumbersome in the extreme. We have three Departments, one of which is beyond our control, dealing with public works. The State Department can always snap its fingers at us and treat us as&#39; if likes. The erection of a small  post-office  is sanctioned; but twelve months elapse and the vote for the purpose is not spent. That accounts largely for the large number of re-votes on the Estimates. I know of small works for Western Australia) which appear on the Estimates year after year, simply because it is almost impossible to get the money spent within the year. The remedy for that state of things is not to let one Department have anything to do with the carrying out of the public works. I do not see why the Department of Home Affairs should interpose between the Post and Telegraph Department and the State Department of Public Works. I can understand the Department- of Home Affairs taking the control of Federal works in New South Wales and Victoria, because in those States it calls for tenders and supervises the carrying out of the work. But why should it be interposed between the Post and Telegraph Department and the Public Works Department of Queensland? If we are prepared to allow the latter Department, which is equivalent to our Department of Home Affairs, to carry out a public work, why not let the whole business be transacted between that Department and the Postmaster-General ? I think it is owing to the interposition of the third Department that the delay occurs. In the case of several works in Western Australia, we have had to approach the Department of Home Affairs. On several occasions where there has been delay, we have been met with the excuse that the fault lay with the State Department. Having decided that a post-office in a place is necessary, the Postmaster-General and his Department are naturally interested in getting the work carried out. The Department of Home Affairs feels no particular interest in the matter. If, however, the Postmaster-General were acting directly with the State Department, he would be specially interested in seeing that a work was kept going &#39;and was carried out promptly. I consider that in those States where Federal works are not directly carried out by the Department of Home Affairs, it should not interfere, but the business should be transacted between the Department directly concerned and the State Department. If honorable senators will glance at the schedules of these Bills, they will find that re-votes are very largely caused in that way. Another point which strikes me is in connexion with the expenditure on the Postal Department in New  South  Wales. I am not complaining of the amount of the proposed expenditure, or opposing it. No doubt it is necessary. Although in this Bill we are asked to authorize an expenditure of &#163;13,600 for the purpose, the total &#39; expenditure to which that vote will commit the Parliament is- &#163;51,000. It is somewhat singular that, whereas in the case of comparatively small, offices, the total sum to be voted is denoted by a footnote,- there is no footnote stating that in voting &#163;13,600 in connexion, with the Postal Department in New South Wales we are committing ourselves to a further expenditure of &#163;38,000. I welcome the fact that at last the Government have screwed up their courage to establish a small arms factory. They have not come to that decision a moment too soon, I think. I trust that in the selection of a site they will put out of consideration every question of State jealousy, look upon Australia as. one country, and choose the best site, irrespective of whether it is within a stone&#39;sthrow of Melbourne, Sydney, or any other place. With regard to the construction of a building in the Strand, London, I think we are justified in taking the step proposed. Undoubtedly we wish to build up a white nation, and to populate the country, so that in time of trouble we may have sufficient defenders. I have never been, nor am I now, a supporter of a State-aided&#34; system of immigration&#39;. But I recognise that in England there must be a large number of persons who now go to the United? States, Canada, and other countries, who* would make excellent citizens here. They have the necessary capital to come here and make a start, but they are attracted to Canada and other countries simply because those countries come more directly under their notice than does Australia. </para>

I recognise that the secret of a successful immigration policy is to make the country attractive by providing openings for labour and capital. I would be out of order if I were to indicate the policy which I think is the right one to pursue. But I recognise that, no matter how good our conditions may be, it is necessary to let the people of the world know what they are, and the erection of London offices will afford us a means of disseminating that information . How tremendous are land values in London is shown by the ground rent which is asked for the site in the Strand; 18s. a square foot seems to us rather stiff. I believe that the Government will spend the money wisely. It is responsible to Parliament, and before any further expenditure can be incurred, parliamentary sanction must be obtained. The item has my cordial approval. I regret the absence of certain items from the Bill. I had hoped that the Government intended to grasp the nettle of naval defence. I understand, however, that their proposals have been delayed largely owing to the unfortunate illness of the Prime Minister. </para>

The naval defence of the Commonwealth is a pressing problem, and one upon which the Government should make a statement at the earliest moment. I do not think that we are called upon at the present time to consider the financial outlook as regards the Braddon section. In my opinion it is absolutely essential to the safety of the Federation that the Government should deal with the question in a firm and unflinching manner, being just to the States and also to the Commonwealth. They should recognise that it is absolutely impossible to secure an agreement between six State Premiers, with six different sets of conditions, and the Federal Treasurer. What is wanted is a Government strong enough to come down and say, Here is what we propose to ask the people&#39;s representatives in each House of the Commonwealth Parliament to sanction, and if sanctioned, the States must accept it as the wish of the people.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and it is very doubtful whether six State Parliaments would approve of them. If we are going to wait until the States come to an agreement amongst themselves, we shall have to wait until the crack of doom. The financial condition of the various States is continually changing. Take the position within the last five years. At the Hobart Conference, only one of the States Treasurers out of the six was able to say, &#34; I have a surplus,&#34; namely, the Treasurer of Western Australia. But, on the occasion - of the last Premiers&#39; Conference in Brisbane, five of the Treasurers were able to say, &#34; We have surpluses,&#34; whilst the Western Australian Treasurer had a deficit. The position was entirely reversed. How then can we expect agreement between the States Treasurers? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator has only to read the reports of the Conference to obtain an answer to his question. The Treasurer of Western Australia assumed quite a different tone at the Hobart Conference from that which he assumed at the Brisbane Conference. At Hobart, &#34; Everything in the garden was lovely.&#34; He did not mind what proposal was adopted. Western Australia had a surplus ; she had a sinking fund for her loans; her revenue was buoyant, and so forth. </para>

                            <para>- It was an advantage to the State Treasurer undoubtedly. We want a Government that will come forward with a scheme, or a set of proposals, and . lay them before Parliament.  Surely,  we can&#39; trust the representatives of the people in the two Houses of the Federal Legislature to see that justice is done to the States. Can we believe that the Senate will assent to proposals which would mean the insolvency of the States ? I have sufficient confidence in the Senate to believe that any proposal adopted would be fair to the States, and at the same time fair to the Federation. The Federal Government occupies a strong position. When the Braddon section expires, the Federal Government can, if Parliament approves, take the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue. Consequently, it holds the whip in its hand. This Parliament can, if it chooses, determine to return nothing to the States. </para>

                            <para>- I am doubtful about that being done. From what <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> have seen of members who have been returned to this Parliament, I should say that before their return they held a much more exalted opinion about States rights than they did after they got here. After their return, we find that &#34; State finance &#34; becomes &#34; State extravagance,&#34; and &#34; States rights &#34; become &#34; Federal rights.&#34; I believe we shall always have a Federal Parliament that will be prepared to assert itself as the predominant partner in any scheme of Federal finance ; and I hope that we shall some day have a Federal Government that will be strong enough to take the lead, and not one that will wait upon the States in this matter. In Canada, the Dominion Government is the dominant partner -in relation to finance, and lays down the law with regard to the financial arrangements with the States.  . </para>

                            <para>- New South Wales has been doing very well in that direction since Federation. We have had no indication from the Government that they are. prepared to deal with this question, and 1 am not very hopeful for the future. The greatest danger for Federation lies in weak government. The strength of Federation will lie in a Federal Government and a Federal Parliament with a financial policy on this most intricate question which they are prepared to carry through. But if we have a weak Government, with little or no  policy.  allowing itself to be pulled hither and thither by various conflicting State interests, as represented by the amount of. noise kicked up by those who advocate those interests for the time being, we shall &#34;make no progress. I still hope to see a Government which will be able to tackle the problems indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and to lay down a financial policy that will be advantageous to both Federation and States. In the meantime, we can do nothing but pass this Bill, because it provides for works which are absolutely necessary. </para>

The Government are not,  like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Micawber,</inline> faced with the necessity of toeing miserable. They have the  proverbial sixpence in their pocket. It is when the Government have to find the sixpence that they will be in a difficulty. While we have a surplus of &#163;103,000, I do not think that we are called upon to consider the means of raising revenue, but when we come within reasonable distance of a deficit, we shall have to make arrangements to provide for our needs. In the meantime, I support the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- - What has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> accentuates what some of us have been thinking for a considerable time past. That is that the Commonwealth will soon be over-running the constable if it goes on paying for public works out of revenue. That policy suits a certain .section in Parliament, who wish to force us to go in for direct taxation. I do not belong to that party. I do not want to see the Federal Parliament imposing direct taxation for many a year. That source of revenue ought to be left to the States. Whether we like it or not, we shall soon be faced with the necessity for a loan policy. Take the case of the London offices which it is proposed to erect. I suppose the cost of them will be between &#163;300,000 and &#163;400,000.  Suppose they cost .&#163;400,000. If we paid for them out of loan money the interest at 3 per cent, would be something like &#163;12,000 per annum. It is much easier to pay &#163;12,000 per annum than to make provision for the whole cost out of one year&#39;s income. </para>

                            <para>- We have given them some of their own money back; that is all. I should like to have further information with regard to the obligations we shall incur by voting the &#163;1,000 on account of the Commonwealth offices in London. &#39; Is that sum to be a deposit which will be lost if we do not carry through the contract, or will it commit us in any way ? I find no fault with the proposed expenditure on defence. There is, however, a question which we shall have to think of before long, and that is what we propose doing in regard to immigration. Depend upon it if we have a larger population we shall be able to spend more money out of revenue on public works. If our population were one-fourth larger than it is we should have one-fourth more revenue from Customs and Excise. It is true that the Commonwealth has been able to pay to the States something like &#163;5,750,000 more than they were entitled to under the Braddon section. But, while that is true in the aggregate, I am not far from the mark in saying that Queensland considers that she has not had her fair share. </para>

                        <para>. - Apart from the particular question that has been the principal subject of debate, I think the public will be gratified at the attention that has been devoted to the financial position. I indicated in my speech on the Bounties Bill that I had some anxiety about the financial position. I feel pleased, and I am sure the Senate is more than pleased, with the excellent speech which has been delivered from this side of the Chamber concerning the position into which the Commonwealth is either deliberately going, or senselessly drifting. This is a very convenient and useful opportunity, without making any party move, to point out the situation for the grave consideration of the  Government, because the question will have to be decided very shortly either by the present or some other Administration. It appears that a sum of .&#163;1,000 is asked for something, and it also appears that it is not quite clear what that something is. My objection to the course taken by the Government is that they had a very long recess, during which the Prime Minister and one of his colleagues spent some time in </para>

                    <para>London. In those five or six months, the subject could have been discussed more or less leisurely. They knew that the Premier of Victoria was looking for a site in London, and, according to what&#39; we have gathered from the debates in another place, and from what has appeared in the press, there was actual competition or rivalry then with regard to this site.- Yet, after that lapse of time, we are practically asked now to vote &#163;1,000, although, notwithstanding the ingenuity, and, to a certain extent, the candour of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, the destination of the grant, and the probable result of sanctioning it, are not yet quite clear. That is why, in a somewhat hostile sense, I interjected, &#34; Is this a second mail contract business?&#34; I hope the Government will profit by the very severe lesson they received in that connexion about the difficulties and dangers of dealing with deposits and options on contracts. </para>

                            <para>- We are particularly anxious to have the Tariff dealt with, and, notwithstanding the strong grounds of objection that there are to this particular vote, or to the works and buildings policy of the Government generally, we should not be doing pur duty now by assailing the position of the Government on a minor issue. We feel tEat our duty to the country is to let the Government bring the Tariff before both Chambers as quickly as possible, because it is the supreme desire of the country that that question should be settled at once for a considerable time to come. Although it is not the custom on the other&#39; side of the Chamber&#39; to give us credit for generosity or political magnanimity, still, as in time we become better acquainted&#39; with (each  other&#39;s  desires, I hope that a better understanding .will prevail, and that&#39; they will recognise that sometimes -&#39;we. refrain from &#39;doing things which might give us a&#39; party advantage, in order to help forward what we consider to be the supreme interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that no remark of mine can be taken as disparaging the ability of this side of the Chamber to do so. We had the opportunity,  if we had wished to resort to mere party tactics, of embarrassing the Government considerably by making  a  rather warm attack on&#171; these Estimates. But I am delighted, personally, that nothing of that sort is to be done.  I  hope that nothing will be done to give the Government an excuse to allege that we on this side  are delaying  the settlement of the Tariff. Whether the Tariff&#34; is to be free-trade, protectionist, or prohibitive, the whole of Australia, is anxious that we should settle it. What I have stated shows that we are perfectly earnest and sincere in our desire to give effect to the supreme desire of the mercantile, commercial, and working classes of Australia. Probably the opposition to this large vote for works and buildings would have been very much warmer and longer sustained&#34;but for our recognition of the fact that the whole of Australia fervently desires that the Tariff question, affecting  as  it does important industries- </para>

                            <para>- I hope, at any rate that part of the object of the erection of Commonwealth offices in London will be the initiation of a systematic effort to secure immigration. If I could see that the Government intended to make some practical effort in that direction, I should assent much more readily to this vote of ,&#163;1,000. I do not intend to offer any opposition to it now. I -am glad to see that earnest and serious thought will be given to the subject by honorable senators on the opposite side, for I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> to some extent, reflects their wishes. I am very  glad -that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has brought forward the question of how long we can continue to draw upon our one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue for -money to carry out the works and buildings policy of the Commonwealth. I do not think that any of the States can object to the increase in the vote for defence purposes. It is vitally necessary, considering the trend of events in the Pacific, with which we are necessarily immediately and seriously concerned. The time is not far distant, in the course of human affairs, when the whole of Australia will have to face the situation. Every one of us may fervently send up our prayers that that contingency may be averted. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. I say, with Cromwell, &#34; Trust in God and keep your powder dry.&#34; I agree with&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> that we must seriously consider how long we can continue to finance entirely out of revenue the undertakings necessary for the development of the Commonwealth. I am not in favour of anything like the extravagant expenditure which has characterized the financial administration of many of the States in the past. The States, from a financial point of view, have left themselves seriously open to the adverse criticism of the financiers of the world by their administration of loan expenditure. I believe that there has been gross extravagance to some extent in the past, but that is no reason why the Commonwealth Government should decree that for all time none of our works must be paid for out of loan money. Whilst the taxpayers of the present day have no right to be extravagant and call upon posterity to- bear an unfair burden, the converse is equally true. We .should not bear the whole of the burden of works built now, &#39; but intended also for the benefit of our descendants for years to come. That is a sound principle which all the nations of the world have adopted. Whenever development by permanent public works is undertaken, by which posterity will benefit more largely than we shall, posterity should take some of the burden. The only way in which that policy can be given sound effect to is by a well administered and economic loan system. I am happy to say that such a system appears to have been adopted by Western Australia, and, &#34;to some extent, is in force in Queensland, where provision is made for the redemption of loans, and their redemption is extended over a period of fifty or sixty years. That is a sound policy to adopt. The Western Australian Government are adopting the principle that, in connexion with every loan, a sinking fund must be established, so that in a number of years the payments to that fund will gradually pay off &#39; the loan. In Queensland we have a provision that every surplus on the year&#39;s expenditure must be set aside for the redemption of loan indebtedness. Sooner or later the Commonwealth Parliament will have to face this problem. We cannot continue to call upon the taxpayers of Australia to pay directly for works, the benefits of which will be largely enjoyed by posterity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said that the policy so far pursued will probably result in direct taxation. The honorable senator is not so much interested as others are in bringing the Government sharply to took in this connexion. I am with him when he says that it is about time that the Government should distinctly declare what the position of the Commonwealth is likely to be, and the measures they intend to take to meet that position. I have indicated how I think our difficulty should be met. I think that we shall have to enter upon a loan policy, and arrange with the States with regard to further contributions, and as to how the States debts are to be treated. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in demanding from the &#39; Government some direct explanation  of their policy in connexion with the important financial questions with which we are confronted. </para>

We are rapidly approaching a time when we shall be expending more money than we are receiving, and when we shall be face to face with a deficit. I am exceedingly anxious to know how the Government propose to add to the revenue of the Commonwealth in view of the fact that the Braddon section cannot be interfered with for at least three years. It is estimated that we shall require to use the whole of our one-fourth share of the net Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth, with the exception of &#163;103,000. </para>

In the last session of the last Parliament, the Government made an attempt to pass a measure under which the people were to. be asked to give this Parliament power to raise additional revenue by the imposition of special duties for the establishment of an Old-age Pensions scheme, and for other purposes. I am quoting the words used by ex-Senator Playford, who, on the occasion I referred to, was not at all definite. He said he would not bind the Government down to old-age pensions, but that the money raised by the special duties imposed might be and undoubtedly would be, used for a numbe of other purposes. </para>

                            <para>- I am not so sure about that. In any case, I&#39; am not now dealing with the States or the Tariff, but with so much of the Government policy as has been disclosed. I do not know whether the&#39; Government intend to carry out the financial policy of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. The public have never been informed as to why that right honorable gentleman left the Cabinet, whether it was because his financial policy was not indorsed by the other members of the Government, because of his disgust at being kept. in power by the Labour Party, because he had had a surfeit of eating dirt, or because lie was offended? at not being continued in the position of Acting Prime Minister. We do not know for which of these reasons he left the Government. My own opinion is that he left for one or another of these reasons, it may be for- a combination of them all, but, in any case, and without disrespect to the right honorable gentleman, I do not- think he is much loss to the Government. What we are particularly interested in now is to get some disclosure from the Government of their intended financial policy. It has been said that Federal expenditure is mounting up year after year, but I defy any member of the Senate to put his finger on any particular item in the schedule to this Bill, and say that the expenditure proposed in connexion with it is unnecessary and might be cut out. We have to deal with the question of defence. It is admitted on every hand that the Commonwealth must provide much more effectively for its defence than . it has hitherto attempted to do. If that is to be done, additional expenditure must be incurred. Then we cannot always sit in the house of our friend, no matter how hospitably inclined that friend may be. Some day we must establish a Federal Capital, and that also will involve a very large expenditure of money. Whether the money will be raised by loan, or paid out of revenue year by year, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> seems to suggest, no one here can tell. The one thing. we know is that the Federal Capital must be established, and that it will cOst a very large sum of money. </para>

                            <para>- I remember all that, but I hope that if the Federal Parliament spends a similar sum of money upon parliamentary buildings, we shall see that every yard of space is properly utilized, and that the members of the Federal Parliament are as conveniently housed as modern ideas of architecture will allow. It is &#39;admitted on every hand that we are not only morally bound to take over the Northern Territory, but that the safety of Australia depends, not merely on our taking it over, but on our peopling and developing it. All this involves more and more money-, and where is it to come from ? Then we require to make provision for our old-age pensions. I am very glad to find that State after State is establishing a system of old-age pensions, but I think it will be agreed that the Federal authority must ultimately, and within a very limited period indeed, take over the matter. What is desired is that an old-age pension shall be payable to every man or woman who has lived a certain number of years, not in any particular State, but in Australia, and until the Federal authority makes provision for a Federal &#39; system of old-age pensions that cannot be done. Then there are the harbors and lights to be taken over ; tthat, again, will mean additional expenditure. Last, but not least, at present, I would mention the question of penny postage. I know that a number of honorable senators are opposed to that proposal, but I think that within a very short period the system must be adopted. That also will cost some money. When the whole of &#39; these -services, and others which might be mentioned, are added together, we find that the additional expenditure to be borne by the Federal Parliament will be very large indeed, and must be provided for in some way or other. In these circumstances, I think it is only fair to ask the Government how it proposes to meet that additional expenditure - not only how it proposes to tide over the interval between now and 1910, but also what it intends to do in that year. Does it intend to continue the Braddon &#34;blot&#39;: as it is at present, or to abolish the &#34; blot &#34; or to modify the &#34; blot,&#34; or to substitute a fixed payment for the &#34;blot,&#34; and, if not, what does it intend to do&#34;? The Parliament and the country want some leading on this very important question. <inline font-style="italic">We</inline> have the States with their own ideas of finance. The States, if I gather their decision from the last Conference, want the Braddon section  continued in another and, what I believe to be, a worse form ; they want a fixed payment per annum. In that way they claim that Federal and State finance will be completely separated. I hold that if that idea is adopted we shall be a very long way indeed from severing State from Federal finance. The Federation will be, to all intents and purposes, pinned down to a revenue Tariff. We shall have to pay each State probably more than it is being paid at the present moment ; and we shall have to pay that money whether it is obtained from the Customs or not. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that the States and the Federation will grow, but I trust that our revenue from the Customs will grow smaller by degrees and beautifully less. I believe that the raising of revenue by means of Customs duties is one of the most cunning devices ever contrived for robbing the poor man and allowing the rich man to escape. I believe that it is largely responsible for one of the most serious evils which afflict Australia to-day. If we had had a proper system of finance&#39;, there would not be any land monopoly here to-day, because the land, being quite open to bear its fair share of taxation, could not possibly be held by monopolists, as is the case now, and has unfortunately been the case in the past. </para>

It does not matter how many  other things we settle, if we leave that question untouched and unsettled, the Continent will continue to be in exactly the same unsatisfactory position as it is in today.

I am exceedingly anxious to know what is the policy. of the Government in that regard. As: I said a little while ago, the States Treasurers want a fixed payment. If that idea is adopted, the Federal Parliament will be bound down so long as the arrangement lasts to a system of indirect taxation. I do not want that, and therefore I am opposed to. anything in the&#39; way of a fixed payment. Does the Government propose to abolish the Braddon &#34; blot &#34; if it is in power in 1910, which is very problematical? </para>

                            <para>- I admit frankly that I would prefer the States to impose direct taxation. In the ultimate it really matters very little whether the Braddon section is continued or discontinued. If it is continued, and the States must get their three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, as at present, the Commonwealth will be compelled to raise revenue in some other way. </para>

                            <para>- Order. I ask the honorable senator how he proposes to connect these remarks with&#39; a proposal to pay out of the Consolidated Revenue a sum of &#163;686,824 for the purpose of carrying out the public works specified in the schedule to the Bill? He will be in order in pointing out obligations which the Government will have to meet as a reason for not voting for the Bill, but not in discussing the desirability of adopting some other form of taxation. If there is a desire to make an alteration in that regard, it should be dealt&#39; with either on a specific motion or on a Bill introduced by the Government; but it is not in order for the honorable senator to pursue the topic as he has been doing. I should be very sorry if I had to stop the honorable senator, but I cannot allow him to go any further in that direction. </para>

                            <para>- One or two of the speakers - I think Senators St. Ledger and Walker - declared themselves in favour of a loan policy. While they acknowledge the good work which has hitherto been done by the Federal authority in erecting public buildings out of revenue, they seem to think it is not desirable that that state of affairs should continue. I do not believe that there is a country under the sun, except Australia, which, when it wants to build a post-office, borrows the money at the other end of the world. The whole affair seems so ridiculous that I am astonished that any self-respecting citizen of Australia should entertain it for a single moment. I am not in favour of borrowing, but I believe that there are many enterprises which could hardly be carried out without loan expenditure. Australia would never have reached its present stage of development but. for the &#34;loan industry,&#34; of which we have heard so much. </para>

                            <para>- It is not. It is merely taking money out of one pocket and putting it into another. If, as the honorable senator suggests, the Commonwealth were to borrow &#163;10,000,000 to pay for the properties, it would hand that sum over to the States. Is that what the honorable senator wants us to do? </para>

                            <para>- There would be no loan whatever. The Commonwealth would simply become responsible for the principal. If particular loans could be earmarked, I suppose some arrangement could be made to the effect that when those loans fell due the Commonwealth would either have to pay the principal or renew them. But, so far as concerns loans for post-offices and works of that character, I trust that the Commonwealth will continue the policy that it has initiated, and pay for them out of revenue. </para>

                            <para>- I do not see that. There is nothing to prevent us from erecting a Capital city. But adopting a phrase which was used by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest in another place, I am not going to jump that fence until. I reach it. If, when the matter comes before us, it seems to me to be desirable to pay for the work out of revenue, out of revenue it will have to come, so far as my vote is concerned. With regard to the London offices of the Commonwealth, I have again to complain that the Government have not taken the Senate into their confidence. It appears that negotiations have been going on for some months. It is only to-day that we are asked to vote &#163;1,000 practically to commit the Commonwealth to an unknown expenditure, and it is only to-day that information on the subject is vouchsafed to us. With all respect to the Government, I say that that is not treating the Senate in a proper fashion. If Parliament is to exercise any control over expenditure, and if the Senate is to look after the interests of the States, as it is supposed to do, we ought to have fuller opportunities of examining proposals of this kind. If I were a member of the Opposition, I should be very much tempted to do everything within my power to defeat the Government in connexion with this matter. The Government ought to be taught a lesson not to treat the Senate with the contempt which they apparently feel. </para>

                            <para>- No, I do not; but I think that we ought to have been treated less cavalierly by the Government. I suppose that they ha,ve depended largely upon our unwavering loyalty. But when I think the matter over probably the Government are not so much to blame after all. There has been so much danger of the business of the country being submerged by floods of eloquence in another place that probably the Government thought discretion was the better part of valor, and did not bring their proposals before Parliament until the last moment, knowing perfectly well that had they been brought up twelve months before, the debate would have continued all the time. </para>

                            <para>- I am simply showing why the Government is, perhaps, not wholly responsible for what I have been complaining about. Probably the Opposition in another place may be called upon to bear some share of the responsibility. But I complain seriously that 1 have not been furnished with earlier information. We are told that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne has to-day cabled for more particulars. I observe that it is stated that the option was continued for two months. What was the option ? I suppose- it was this - that the London County Council reserved this particular piece of land for two months until the Commonwealth had an opportunity of considering whether it would, make an offer. If the option expired to-day, and has not been renewed, I presume that the County Council will be in a position to treat with other persons who have made offers so that we shall have competitors in the field for this piece of land. It appears to me that the Acting  Prime Minister ought not. tq have left his decision over until &#62;the last moment. An honorable senator has referred to the question of immigration. The  President  ruled him out of order. But I find that in one paragraph of the document that has been circulated in connexion with the London offices it is stated that it is - proposed to erect offices which will accommodate the High Commissioner for the Commonwealth, and  permit of the transaction of emigration, financial, as well as the ordinary agency business of the London Office. </para>

I am sorry that we did not have a better opportunity of scrutinizing this proposal, but I suppose that after all the Government have, done the best they could. While we have a Government we must place some confidence in them, and, that being the case, I think I shall support the Government in their proposal, so far as I can see at present. </para>

                    <para>In spite of that, I understand that the honorable gentleman sent a cablegram on the very day on which the option was to expire for information on these subjects. If he had the information before, why has he not made use of it? The object of this expenditure is stated to be the acquisition of a site for Commonwealth offices in the Strand, London. Are the offices intended for business, social, or ornamental purposes? If for business purposes, the Strand is not the best site that could be got. If for ornamental purposes, the site is certainly not the best; and if for social purposes, it is one of the worst. Business is done in the city, where all the great financial institutions have their head offices. The Agents-General in a report which they made a short time ago, at the request of the Government, in regard to the appointment of a High Commissioner, stated that offices might easily be rented in London at an annual rental of from &#163;1,000 to &#163;4,000, according to the purpose for which they were required. </para>

                            <para>- If we are to emulate Canada, the first thing we ought to do is to follow her example in the matter of immigration. We should get the money which she is getting, and then we could talk about building a &#163;400,000 office. It has been suggested that the High Commissioner should live in the proposed building. He might as well live at 77 Bourke-street. The proposal is simply absurd. What is really required is a business office. The Strand site, of which I know something, is not suitable at all. </para>

                            <para>- It should be in the city, where business is concentrated. We should consider what work we are going to undertake there. If the building is to be principally for the use of the High Commissioner, there will be very little for him to do until the States concede to the Commonwealth the power to deal with their financial operations. We have not that power now, and I cannot see any necessity whatever for hurrying this proposal on. There is a sum of &#163;900 under the Department of Home Affairs for additions, sundry offices, Tasmania. I should like the Minister, when the schedule is&#39; being dealt with, to give me some information as to what is included in that vote. </para>

                        <para>.- A great deal of the money which it is intended to spend on a large building in London would be better spent in putting up buildings to be occupied by persons who are now in the service of the Commonwealth. Certain sums are put down for post-offices in various places. I believe they are badly required, but there are a great many more places where they are equally badly wanted. Some of the buildings that people have to live in and do business which brings in revenue for the Commonwealth are simply ridiculous. </para>

                            <para>- It is the fault of the Federal Government during the last six years, at least. In plenty of buildings used for post-offices men have to work and live in little rooms with a galvanized iron roof within a few feet of their heads. They are not fit for men to live in and? transact business. It is different in this State, where the men have large and palatial structures to work in. I am not finding fault with the Government for expending the money they are going to expend, but I should willingly have supported! a larger amount. The same applies to the vote for defence. I hope that the Government will increase these votes in supplementary Estimates. If they do I shall be prepared to support them in that direction. </para>

                            <para>- It is not a. palatial building that will attract them here. The people we want are in the country districts, whither we shall have to send agents and lecturers, and money will have to be found for that purpose. I object to passing this vote of &#163;1,000 to-night, because I agree with other honorable senators, who have spoken that we have not . been given sufficient information. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in reading the cablegrams to us to-day, distinctly stated that the Government had wired to Captain Collins, in London, to obtain information, and that he was to send it out by mail. These negotiations started in May last, and it was well known to the Government - no one could know it better - that the option expired on 26th September. We did not hear a word of this, but were kept in the dark until the very last day. Then we were given certain .information. I cannot see why the information which is now asked for from London could not have been procured in that long interval. I suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent,</inline> when he made his deal, knew whether he would have, to pay rates, and the exact position in which he would stand. The Commonwealth Government, on the other hand, began negotiations for the land in May last, and yet up to the present they have not made the necessary inquiries. If any business man approached his shareholders with a request that they should vote money, and told them at the same time that after negotiating for six months he was only now beginning to make inquiries, he would he laughed out of court. I have noticed the Vice-President of the Executive Council smiling when honorable senators have been speaking. He may  well smile, because he knows, as was said in another place, that the numbers are up. That is a well known fact. Several honorable senators on the other side of the Chamber have supported our contention, but have wound up by saying that the Government were not altogether to blame, and that they would vote for the project. I do not think they really mean it. They must have been laughing up their sleeves while pretending to criticise the Government, knowing that they were going to vote for the Government&#39; after all. The Vice-President of the Executive Council would not have attempted to lay the proposal before the Senate in this manner if he had not known that He had a majority, and that they would back the Government up whether right or wrong. Those honorable senators have denounced the proposal on the floor of the Senate. In fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that the Commonwealth was drifting to ruin, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> who is a supporter of the Government, although he says that he is not, condemned them in stronger language than I am likely to use.  His  criticism was so strong that the Vice-President of the Executive Council, by interjection, asked him what he wanted. I suppose the honorable gentleman was anxious lest he should lose a supporter, but the honorable senator wound up nicely by saying that he would support the Government. That is the position we are in, and it is not a nice position. We have members of the Senate who do not believe in the policy of the Government, but who, for party purposes, will continue to support them. What sort of legislation can we expect in these circumstances? If the Government secure the approval of Parliament to this vole of &#163;1,000, the next time they make a reference to the matter it will be to say that they have spent the money, and made all the arrangements, involving further expenditure. I believe that in order that they may be able to do that, the Government are concealing certain information from the Senate. Once this vote is. passed, we shall hear no more of the matter until the Government announce that the Commonwealth is pledged to certain expenditure. I have read the debates which took place in the House of Representatives, and I am convinced that I have indicated, the position which the Government will take up. If they do take up that position, they will be quite within their rights, because I hold that by passing this vote we shall authorize them to purchase the land referred to. I have seen the statement reported that at 13s. per foot the total annual rent which will have to be paid for this land will be ,&#163;1,400. How do such statements come to be published? Another statement published is that the amount that will have to be paid *s &#163;2,70&#176;- Some people may believe these statements, and yet we have been informed to-da.y that if we get the land at 13s. per foot, the rental will amount to &#163;6,500 per annum. Then the Government do not know whether, on top of that, they will not have to pay taxation to the extent of 10s. in the .&#163;. </para>

                            <para>- The Government do not know what they will have to pay in the way of taxation, and they are wiring Home to Captain Collins to obtain the information, and send it out to Australia by the next mail. If we must wait until the arrival of the next mail for this information, why should there toe so much hurry about the passing of this vote? Honorable members in another place were told that the matter was urgent, and that unless it was dealt with to-day it would be too late to deal with it. When the Vice-President of the Executive Council was asked to say what the option was, he said that there was no option. In another place, honorable members were told that there was an option, and that it would expire to-day. How are these contradictory statements of Ministers to be reconciled? From what has transpired, I think there must have been something in the nature of an option given to the Federal Government. If we were supplied with all the information to which we are entitled as to the terms on which this land may be secured, I might be disposed to support the proposal, but the Minister representing the Government in the Senate cannot tell us what they propose to do with the  &#163;1,000  when they get it. He is unable to say whether it is to be paid as a deposit to bind the London County Council or what is to be done with it. It is a vote for something that is unspecified, and in the Queensland Legislative Assembly I have known a vote for unspecified railways to be &#34; stone-walled &#34; for a week until the Government explained what they required the money for, and on what lines it was to be. expended. </para>

                        <para>House of Representatives last night agreed to Government opening negotiations with County Council, and if conditions found suitable an offer will be made. Information first desired on following points. What happens at end of ninety-nine years. What is furthest time that would be allowed for commencing building. What rates and taxes are lessees liable to pay? It is considered that conditions should provide for renewal on expiry of lease on re-appraisement or building paid for at valuation. Obtain building conditions and forward by first mail. Offer if made will probably be for whole Strand frontage with depth of sixty-five feet. </para>

                            <para>- It cannot be denied that the Commonwealth Government advertised for men to work on the machines, and therefore I consider that the operators are Commonwealth servants. . I shall endeavour to prove presently that in the advertisement certain conditions were offered, which tempted men who were employed in other &#39;States to accept positions offered to them by the Commonwealth Government in the hope that, within reasonable limits, they would have some security of tenure. When the linotype machines were first installed in that part of the State printing works which is set apart for Commonwealth use - that is about four years ago - an advertisement appeared in the daily newspapers in the various States calling for thoroughly competent linotype operators, and offering them constant employment at. a weekly wage of &#163;4 10s. The promise of constant employment has not been kept, despite the fact that some of the men had an understanding in writing that they would have an assurance of constant work. I may mention in passing, that one employe in that branch of the service has been gazetted, and thereby placed on the classified list of civil servants. I refer to the gentleman in charge of the machinery, who, I believe, is termed the engineer. I do not say that the act of placing him on the classified list of civil servants was wrong, but why should he be singled out and the other men passed over? He must have competent operators, otherwise the machines would be useless. On the completion of the first issue of the Commonwealth rolls the operators were employed for a time as compositors at the reduced rate of &#163;2 17s. per week. That was a rather large reduction in the wage&#39; at which they were engaged. At the beginning of the next session the setting of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> by the linotype machines was adopted, and the operators returned to them, but they had to accept a minimum rate of &#163;3 10s. per week. After various deputations had waited upon the Commonwealth Treasurers who were in office at different periods, the operators, about twelve months ago, succeeded in getting the reduced minimum increased from  &#163;3 10s.  to  &#163;3 15s.  day shift, and  &#163;4 5s.night  shift, at which rates they are now employed. </para>

                            <para>- Owing to the dissatisfaction which existed amongst the operators, nine left the Department. They saw no hope of getting constant employment, and now they are engaged in outside offices in Melbourne at a wage ranging from  &#163;410s.  to  &#163;5,  and working hours varying from 35 to 48 hours per week. Eight or nine months after the installation of the machines, a few of the men who were originally engaged were dismissed on the score of not being competent ; and, strange to say, those very&#34; men have been engaged ever since then in private offices at a wage varying from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> per week. </para>

                            <para>- Then the Commonwealth has been the means of bringing to Victoria good men, who have been snapped up by private firms. It all goes to prove that there must have been something wrong in the Department, and also that the men must have been engaged, as it were, under false pretences. At different times during the last four years, memorials have been presented - always through the Victorian Government Printer - to the Commonwealth Treasurer. I am tempted to depart from the text of my motion and to refer to the question of where State printing  work  overlaps Commonwealth printing work and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa;</inline> but I shall refrain from introducing that phase of the subject. It might distract the attention of honorable senators from the particular matter that I am submitting . The first memorial was fruitless. </para>

                            <para>- They may receive good wages, but I call attention to the fact that they work under abnormal conditions. Most of their work is done during the night. While Parliament is sitting the operators are called upon to work long hours. They start at 6 p.m.,. and work until 3.30 a.m. That is the usual shift; but in the event of either House of Parliament sitting late, or. perhaps all night, they have to work on until all copy is finished. The work occasionally carries them close on to 8 a.m., when the day-shift comes on. This work is done without a break, except half-an-hour from. 10 to 10.30, supper time, and a quarter of an hour at 2 a.m., smoke time. They start work again at 6 p.m. the same day. </para>

I could, if I chose, give particulars concerning wages earned in outside offices as compared with the&#39; wages which these men are receiving. But I will not detain the Senate by giving details, except to say that in the leading printing offices in this State, and in Melbourne particularly, the wages range from &#163;3 10s. to &#163;5 5s. per week, and the hours of work from thirty-two to forty-eight. I contend that if the Government engages men under certain conditions those conditions should be respected and observed. Apart from that, the Government should always be a model employer. These men are working always at night, and any honorable senator who has had experience of night work knows this- </para>

                            <para>- That question might come up for discussion under another heading. We might deal a little more justly with these men than we have done in the past. Honorable senators have already referred to this phase of the question during the years 1.904-5-6, as regards, not only the overlapping of State and Commonwealth work, but also the hours which the men were working without being paid for overtime. If they work more than a certain number of hours per week, they have to cut the rest out, although they have actually worked the overtime. </para>

                        <para>.- I second the motion. If the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> be correct, then there ought to be no honorable senator who would not support his proposition. I do not doubt for a moment that the men were induced to leave their employment in different States to come to Victoria under the conditions set forth by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> But if they were engaged - and some of them have it in writing - on a promise of permanent employment at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> IOS. per week, and if representations, have been made to the Government by them that they have not been treated in accordance with the terms of their engagement, it seems strange to me that the Government have not given their position serious consideration and meted out justice to them.  If the Government are sheltering themselves behind some technicality, when permanent employment was offered to the men, by giving them in the first place the stipulated wage of  &#163;4 ros. and afterwards, because they were unable to keep them fully employed on Commonwealth work, finding State employment for them at &#163;2 17s. per week, then there has been a distinct violation of the contract. I have . not the slightest hesitation in saying that the whole of the men could be fully employed year in and year out on Commonwealth work if the office was placed on a proper and business-like basis. I have raised my voice in this Chamber before against the system followed in regard to all work required for Commonwealth purposes. It is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> said that a certain portion of the Government Printing Office was set apart for Commonwealth printing. That has application only to the building in which the linotype machines are placed. In the. Victorian Government Printing Office, printing and linotype machines, type, stereotyping plant, and other property belonging to the Commonwealth &#39; Government are inextricably mixed up, according to some people who work over there, with State property. &#39;Although the </para>

                            <para>- I know what I am speaking about, and my statement is not nonsense. There is a life to a printing as well as to a human machine. When those machines are, worked, as they have been almost &#34;since the inception of the Commonwealth, at high pressure, they must wear out much more quickly than - would be the case if they were utilized wholly and solely for Commonwealth purposes. We have expended a total of from &#163;36,000 to &#163;38,000 upon machinery, plant, and material. </para>

There is nothing unfair in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> &#39;s request that these men shall be not only permanently employed, but placed upon the same footing as permanent State employes in the printing office. It may be said, as the Vice-President of the Executive Council interjected, that when Parliament is not in session sufficient work cannot be provided to keep them fully employed, but, as one who has worked in the Government Printing Office, I know that the permanent State employes are fully occupied year in and year out on State work. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but the permanent schedule hands, and also a number of what I may call permanent casuals, are kept fully employed from one year&#39;s end to the other. At abnormal times, when the State Parliament is in session, and when the State rolls are being printed, additional hands are taken on, but there is no doubt that the men who are supposed to be Federal employes have for some time past been working at very high pressure on Commonwealth work. As a matter of fact, the linotype operators have not been able to cope with all the work required to be done for the Commonwealth, and have been largely assisted by the State employes in the office. Honorable senators will have noticed recently that some of the printed matter supplied to us, particularly Customs returns - work which ought to have been done by the Commonwealth under Government supervision - has been turned out by . private offices in Melbourne and Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. In the purchase of the type a&#34; large amount will be involved. That private firm will have the advantage-of the type, because they are not going to lose by the transaction, and would not undertake the work without some guarantee that they would have the printing of it for some time. If the Government made an exhaustive inquiry into the working of the office and its expenses from a Commonwealth point of view, they would find that expert and unbiased men would unhesitatingly recommend that the Commonwealth should establish a printing office of its own.  I should like to see all who are permanently employed in Commonwealth work in the Victorian Government Printing Office treated in the way that the motion desires the linotype operators to be treated. </para>

                            <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> were acquainted with the nature of the work and the system that obtains in the Victorian Government Printing Office, he would admit that it is not a satisfactory system. Competent men, accustomed to&#39; work in other offices, have gone into that office, and since it takes some men longer than others &#39; to accustom themselves to new conditions, honorable senators will understand that a man who is under some disadvantage in securing necessary material may not put up as good a record as another more fortunately situated. It will be admitted, also, that the man putting up the best record is not necessarily the best workman. I shall not discuss that phase of the question, but if the Government desire to give satisfaction to these men, and. that Commonwealth printing shall be turned out satisfactorily, the time is opportune for the creation of a new Department - a Commonwealth Printing Department. I understand that there is only one permanent Commonwealth employe&#34; in the State Government Printing Office, and that he is in a measure subordinate to the Acting Government Printer of Victoria. The Acting Government Printer&#39;s first consideration is naturally for the State Government, whose employe&#34; he is, and, whilst it is true that, in common with those under him, he does all he can to facilitate the despatch of work to be done for the Commonwealth, it is impossible for him to give absolute satisfaction to the Commonwealth and State Government at the same time. </para>

                            <para>- I think that it , would cost much less than we are paying for our printing at the present time. In. addition to the amount to which I have referred as having been expended on machinery and plant, honorable senators will find, in the schedule to the Bill which we were considering this afternoon, a vote of &#163;2,000 for further machinery and plant, and year after year our printing bill is mounting up. I should like to know whether the State expenditure has been on the same basis during the time Federal! work has been done at the State Government Printing Office. I trust that the Government will see that a necessity has arisen for a departure in connexion with the system adopted to provide for Commonwealth printing. It is most unsatisfactory that the Commonwealth Government should be told, as they frequently . are, that the authorities of the State Government Printing Office are unable to give any guarantee that work required for various Commonwealth Departments will be turned out in the time desired by the heads, of those Departments. Because they have been unable to get such a guarantee, much of the printing done for the Commonwealth has had to be done in various parts of Australia. The head of a Department requires to be in a position to exercise close supervision of all the work done by and for his Department. If the principal, officers of the various Commonwealth Departments are to be continued in Melbourne for any considerable time, it would&#39; be much more satisfactory to establish a Commonwealth Government Printing Office, which would be better able to consult the wishes. of the heads of Commonwealth Departments, and would cost  less than Commonwealth printing is costing us at the present time. I hope that when the Government make inquiries into this matter they will ascertain how many men, in addition to the linotype-operators and officers referred to in- the motion, are permanently engaged on Commonwealth work. I trust, also, that when the report reaches us we shall follow it up&#62; by instructing the Government to at once establish a Federal Government PrintingOffice. </para>

                            <para>. - After listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> I have begun to doubt whether &#171;the motion before the Senate is that moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> It would appear that, under cover of the motion, we are not dis-  cussing whether the men employed in connexion with Commonwealth linotype machines shall be placed on the same footing as other servants of the Commonwealth, but whether the Commonwealth printing is being carried out as promptly, cheaply, and effectively by the Victorian Government Printing Office as it might be by a printing office managed and controlled by Commonwealth authorities. It seems to me that that is not what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> aims at in his motion. I take it that he desires to place a particular class of operators on a certain footing, and, having some knowledge of the business, I have a great deal of sympathy with the object the honorable senator has in view. But if we are to pursue the argument used bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> we must recognise that the honorable senator has made some rather serious statements. One is that, in addition to linotype machines costing some  &#163;&#91;10,000,  there is nearly  &#163;30,000  worth of Commonwealth machinery located in the Government Printing Office of Victoria, supposed to lie used for Commonwealth purposes, but over which we appear to have absolutely no control, if we except the control exercised bv one individual. Should the Acting Government Printer of Victoria find it advantageous to use that machinery - and I imply nothing unfair - the question would arise whether the Commonwealth would be getting a reasonable return from the State Government for its use? </para>

                            <para>- In dealing with a matter which came up on the motion for the adoption of a report presented by the Printing Committee, I was informed - I think by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> - that certain economies which I suggested ought to be ma.de in our printing bill could not be easily effected because we had to take our printing from the State Government Printing Office of Victoria, and had no real control over the internal management of that office. I do not wish to discuss the advantage or otherwise of the arrangement the Commonwealth Government have with the State Government </para>

                    <para class="block">Printing Office; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> who speaks on the matter with a good deal of technical knowledge, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> who spoke with technical knowledge, and also as a member of the Printing Committee, have pointed out that the authorities of the Victorian Government Printing Office use our machines, and that we have no efficient control over them. If that be so, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has done an excellent thing in submitting a motion which has given us the opportunity to direct the attention of the Government to the existing state of affairs. In connexion with the motion itself, I gather that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> is seeking to improve the status. of a certain number of men, but if he had come forward with a motion to reform the Commonwealth printing arrangements so that all the men engaged on a certain class of machine - and they must be very skilled men to do the work they are called upon to do - might be put on the Public Service list, I would be with him to a, greater extent than I am on the motion submitted. The honorable senator cannot really be <inline font-style="italic">au fait</inline> with the work of a linotype operator when he says that it takes twelve months for, a man to leant to operate a linotype, a monoline, or monotype machine. These are all intricate machines, on which similar work is performed, and I say that &#39; it requires a three years&#39; apprenticeship to enable a man to become thoroughly competent not merely to work, but* to look after these machines. Any honorable senator who has a knowledge of the business will bear me out in that statement. To expect a young man, after twelve months&#39; practice on a linotype machine, to be entitled to be classified as a person thoroughly competent to operate and look after these machines is to expect him to be a. genius of a rather striking description. I notice that the Vice-President has urged as an objection to the motion the fact that these linotype operators cannot be employed all -the year round. That may be correct, but it seems to me that during what one might call the parliamentary slack season a great deal of work has to be done which might be done by linotype machines. When I speak of linotype machines, I include monoline and monotype machines. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> informed us that certain electoral rolls were set up on linotype machines. I believe that such work could be done more satisfactorily by hand, but if it is done bv using the linotype machines, there is an enormous amount of tabulated matter, book matter, indices, and so forth, which could be set up on these machines. That being the case, I am rather inclined to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> that during the parliamentary recess work could be found for the fifteen men to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> refers in his motion. But I would ask what is the present position of the members of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, against whom I wish to say nothing? Are they not members of the Public Service? I take it that unless they can get extra work, or may be called upon to perform departmental work during the time the Parliament is in recess, they are employed only during the time Parliament is sitting, and if they are entitled to be put on the Public Service list, I should say that the men referred to in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> &#39;s motion are also entitled to be put on that list. I do not propose to discuss whether the men are paid good or bad wages while they are employed by the Commonwealth Government. But I understand that between the Commonwealth and State Governments there is an arrangement by which when Commonwealth work has to be done the time of the men is charged against the Commonwealth Government, and when the men are employed on State work their time is charged against the State Government. </para>

                            <para>- The two explanations do not agree with each other, but no doubt they are quite correct as far as they go. It is impossible for any one to say that we must put the operators on the classified list when we know that they are not employed solely by the Commonwealth Government, but are employed in an office which it does not control. The Commonwealth Government, by some arrangement, is paying the men for a portion of their time, and as regards the balance they are employed and paid by the State Government in the same office. </para>

                            <para>- I do not propose to discuss whether men are paid sufficient or what wages they earn - that is under the Commonwealth and under people outside - or what hours they work. It seems to me that we shall get right away from the object of the motion if we discuss whether men work so many hours and are allowed a quarter of an hour in the middle of the night for smoking, or a half-an-hour for supper. That has nothing to do with the question. What we have to decide is, first, whether the linotype operators are a class who should be put on the classified list, and, secondly, whether the Government is at present in a position to take that course. &#39; I believe that if the men were permanently in the employment of the Commonwealth or any Government they should be put on the Civil Service list. I know the class of men exactly. Many of them have to be skilled mechanics, apart altogether from being skilled operators on very intricate machines. What I. cannot understand is why Senator Needham should have excluded other men in the printing business, many of whom, I should say, are equally competent, expensive, and skilled. There are not only the foremen, but also the machinists, who work the lithograph machines and the ordinary printing presses, and the  men who do marbling and binding. All these men are highly skilled operators, and just as much entitled to be put on the classified list as linotype operators, to say nothing of the men who work the monoline and monotype machines. I ask my honorable friend why he excluded those men from the motion, unless he has come down here specially with a brief for fifteen linotype operators? </para>

                            <para>- Do I understand that all the work which is done for the Commonwealth Government is done entirely by State officials except the fifteen men who work the linotype machines? I think that my honorable friend has got himself into a tangle. I would advise him to reconsider the motion, and see if, by an amendment, he cannot make it more acceptable to those who, I think, understand something about this business, and know the difficulty of carrying into effect such a proposition. As regards the value of these men, we have in the Public Service many clerks who are being classified. I believe that when a man becomes a classified civil servant he receives a salary of &#163;120 or &#163;125 a year, and that is after he has served a probationary term. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> men are. paid by the Government from &#163;160 or &#163;175 up to a considerably higher amount per year, and by private individuals from &#163;200 to &#163;450. </para>

                            <para>- That is not a bad salary either. That payment is considerably higher than is given to some men on the classified list. If we regard the matter from the point whether the men are well paid, and judge their skill according to their salaries, it is reasonable that they should be put on the classified list. -But can the Government put the men on that list? We have been told that the Public Service Commissioner should take the matter in hand straight away, and that he is to blame if the men are not put on the classified list. But if it is a fact that the men are casually employed, partly by the  Commonwealth and partly by the State, then I fail to see how the Commonwealth Government can possibly put them on the classified list. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> points out that a very much more satisfactory position will be created if we have a Commonwealths Printing Office. I believe that he is perfectly correct, but I do not see how we are going to create a new printing office in. Melbourne. As soon as my honorable friend gets the Federal Capital established in a place which has not a reasonably convenient printing office alongside it, then we might propose to establish a permanent printing office. </para>

I hope that the arrangement for our printing will be put on a better footing before very long, but I do not see how it will be possible or reasonable to establish a Government Printing Office right alongside the State printing works in the hope that we shall obtain greater economy with the prospect, at no very early date, of the Seat of Parliament being removed to Canberra or Dalgety or to the height of Mount Kosciusko. I would advise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> to try to secure an amendment so that his motion will provide, first, that a general classification should be made, not including one class of operators only ; and, secondly, that that classification should be postponed until the Government is in a position to act in consequence of being the sole employer of the men whom it is proposed to classify. </para>

                    <para>. - At no stage in the history of the Commonwealth has it been more necessary to seriously view such a proposal as is contained in this motion than it is at the present time. Recently we have experienced  a failure in connexion with the mail contract. I do not propose to traverse the various arguments which have been adduced in both Houses in favour, and in condemnation, of the negotiations to secure a satisfactory mail contract. We are about&#39; to enter into another contract. I hope that the effort will be more successful than was the last one. It must be recognised that Australia is at the mercy of a shipping ring. It has been objected by some hon&#39;orable senators that the Commonwealth is asked by this motion to make an experiment. I do not think that it can be fairly called an experiment. We have had considerable experience of railways, tramways, and other services having been conducted by the Government for the benefit of the people,, and I do not see v/hy the Commonwealth could not operate a fleet of steamers with equal success. In the matter of railways and tramways, I believe we have set an example to the world ; in other countries it is about to be copied. But, as regards the connexion of mail steamers and railways, the Old World sets us an example. In Scotland, two leading railway companies have provided a very extensive fleet of steamers to cope with the traffic which is brought to the shores of the Firth of Clyde by their railways. If it pays the proprietors of private railways in the Old World to provide fleets of steamers to  carry  the traffic which their railways bring to the wharfs, I see no reason why we in Australia cannot do the same thing. On my first visit to Sydney some few months ago, I was struck by the evident success of one of those ventures which have been termed by some honorable senators socialistic. I found there, not only State-owned railways, but also a State-owned tramway system. I venture to say that the tramway service of Sydney compares  favorably  with the tramway services that I have seen in&#39; many cities of the old world. </para>

                    <para>Evidence given before your Commissioners shows that a system exists by which a rebate of 10 per cent, on the freight paid is credited to the shipper, and is paid to him at the end of a term of six or twelve months. Payment, however, is conditional on the shipper remaining &#34;loyal&#34; to the ring - that is, should he ship in the <inline font-style="italic">interim</inline> by a rival line it would be forfeited. We have no evidence to show that the Western Australian Shipping Association is interested in this item. Your Commissioners were  surprised  to learn from some of the witnesses that they knew nothing about this rebate, and had never received it, expressing their gratitude to the Commission for making it known to them. It is, however, allowed to the. State Government. </para>

                        <para>- Many of the shippers did not even know that they were entitled to receive them. Out of about forty-nine witnesses who gave evidence, there were only a few who received the rebates. The others knew nothing about them. Suppose, for instance, that a certain firm shipped goods in the vessels of the Western Australian Shipping Association during the year 1906. The rebates would be due to them on the 31st December, 1906. But they would not be paid until the 31st December, 1907. If during 1907 they shipped with any other line they would forfeit entirely the 10 per cent, rebates which, had been deferred. I also desire to call attention to the fact to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> alluded the other day, that there is a law in America entirely forbidding the payment of deferred rebates. I quote again from the report of the Commission - </para>

                    <para>The attention of your Commissioners has been directed to certain Acts of Congress of the United States, which might well be copied by &#39; the British Empire. The  Harter  Act renders nugatory in all bills of lading signed in the United States clauses which are so .conspicuous in English and Australian bills of lading, and which practically contracts the ship out of all liability. </para>

                    <para>The profits made are divided amongst the shareholders only, and are, of course, derived from the excessive rates of freight which are paid by all freighters, including the State Government. It will  be seen by Appendix No. VI. that the net profits of the Western Australian Shipping Association during the nine years ending 31st March, 1904, were ^&#39;97,825, an average of ^10,870 per annum. To attain this result, a capital of about ^3,000 to ^&#39;4,000 was employed, the maximum being reached in 1903-1904 when it amounted to ^4,292 10s. It will be seen, therefore, that the net profit during the period under notice averaged about 300 per cent, per annum. These profits are divided as follow : - One-fifth to dividends &#39; on share capital, three-fifths on a tonnage basis to shareholders who are freight contributors, and one-fifth to reserve fund. </para>

One of the principal desires of those who favour the motion is to give every possible assistance to people engaged in agricultural pursuits in Australia. We desire to afford them facilities for cheap transit for their goods from Australia, and for whatever they may find it necessary to import. The value of our imports for1906 was &#163;44,729,506, and the value of our exports of strictly Australian produce was &#163;66,299,874, which, added to an export value of&#163;3,437,889 from other sources, gives a total value of exports amounting to &#163;69,737, 763. Surely, then, the time has arrived when we ought to- grapple seriously with this question. </para>

                        <para>- That is not a new question. We have managed so far to construct! all our works out of revenue. I do not think that we can manage to build bur fleet of steamers, which would cost something like &#163;3,000,000, in that way, but, although I am decidedly against borrowing money - except for reproductive purposes - I. should be quite prepared to vote for a motion empowering the Federal Government to borrow money to embark upon this venture. I believe that if we did depart from the course we have followed in the past, we should not need to follow the bacl example set by the States, and go to London to ask for the money. We could find it within the confines of our island continent. We could use this fleet of steamers for other purposes than importing and exporting articles of commerce. They would be handy, as have been the merchantmen of Britain, in times of defence. Even the highest naval authorities agree that the vessels could be so constructed as to be useful for that purpose. </para>

                        <para>- It would mean nothing of the sort. I had eleven years&#39; experience in building vessels of all sizes in the ship-building yards of Britain, and I know that vessels of the kind that we should require, if this motion were given effect to, could be built for the purposes of trade, and also for use as auxiliaries to our defence forces in times of war, without very much increase in the original cost. I am thoroughly in accord with the motion. I hope that the time will soon arrive when we shall get beyond the mere stage of affirming by resolution, either in this or the other Chamber, that a certain thing is good for the people, and put our ideas, which in this case I believe are backed up by the people of Australia, into practical operation. By so doing we shall be able to say that we have acted in the best interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that that is the intention. I have made inquiries in the meantime, and looked up what was said in another place. The discrepancies between what was said there and the information given to us by the Vice-President of the Executive Council warrant delay. I cannot see why so much time has been allowed to elapse without anything being done. It was distinctly stated in another place that we had an option, and that unless the vote was passed before the 26th of this month the option would expire. I have come to the conclusion that  the Government have not given the Senate full particulars. I am afraid that there is something hidden from the Senate and the country. If we allow the item to pass - and this may almost be regarded as a surprise motion - I fear that the whole of the money will be expended without the consent of Parliament, and then Parliament will be twitted with having already approved of the scheme by passing the item. The Government would smile then like the Vice-President of the Executive Council is smiling now. He knows that if he gets the vote through, the Government will be able to undertake the whole work. He would not . be taking things quite so easily otherwise. He is not at all troubled, because, although honorable senators denounce the proposal, and think that it. is not the right thing to do, they all wind up by saying that they will support the Government. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator did. He said that this was not the right way to bring it forward. So far as I could understand, he was thoroughly opposed to the principle which the Government had followed, until nearly the end of his speech. He did not think that the Senate had been given sufficient information, or that the matter was of such great urgency as to warrant the course taken. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot remember the exact words without obtaining a copy of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but I can remember the tenor of the honorable member&#39;s speech and the impression it made on honorable senators on this side of the Chamber. One honorable senator here remarked, &#34; There is the  Chairman  of Committees strongly opposed to the Government.&#34; But the honorable senator wound up like a sucking dove, and announced his intention of supporting them. We have heard a number of speeches of that kind. Many honorable senators on the other side condemn the Government time after time, but when the division bell rings, if they think the Government are in danger, they support them. If, however, they know that the Government have a big majority through honorable senators going over from this side to help them, they come across to this side and say, &#34;What grand fellows we are! We do not want to support the Government.&#34; I am very sorry that some older member of the Senate has not thought fit to move an amendment. If that had been done, I should have supported it. The leader of the Government in this Chamber is laughing in his sleeve. . He practically says,&#34; Let us get this through, and you will hear no more about it.&#34; If the question goes to a division, I shall vote against it. I hope that it will go to a division, so that we may see, after the speeches that have been made, how honorable senators vote on this item of &#163;1,000. I have no fault to find with the building programme of the Government in the Commonwealth itself, but if a great deal of the money which is to be expended in London for various purposes was spent in the Commonwealth in erecting buildings in various parts, it would be better spent. In my own State, Government officials have to live and swelter under a tropical climate in buildings with iron roofs, without any ceilings, within a few feet of their heads. </para>

                            <para>- No; but they are under the control of the Commonwealth Government, and I say that before we spend money in erecting a palatial building in London, we should see that the servants we employ are better housed. Some Commonwealth officers with families have to occupy buildings in which there are only three rooms, one of which is&#39; the office in which they have to perform their duties. That is the way in which the public servants of the Commonwealth employed in remote districts are treated. </para>

                            <para>- I do not believe it would. Judging by the extraordinary ideas which some honorable senators appear to have, the Parliament House to be erected in the Federal Capital will alone cost &#163;2,000,000 or . &#163;3,000,000. We know how easily Governments spend money. We are considering a vote for &#163;1,000, but we know what is behind it. We really do not  know what price will halve to be paid for the land referred to, but we know that we may have to pay a rental of as much as18s. per foot for it. No business man would entertain such a proposition as that which is being submitted to the Senate. No board of directors would meet their shareholders, and no business man would submit to his firm such a proposition. We are asked to give the Government  &#163;1,000,  which is to authorize them to make a deal about which we know nothing. We are here to protect the interests of the people of the Commonwealth, and to see that their money is properly spent. I do not believe that such a proposal was ever submitted to a Parliament without being resisted to the bitter end. We are being asked to give the Government <inline font-style="italic">carte blanche</inline> to do as they think fit. We are not even told what this  &#163;1,000  is to be voted for. We do not know whether it is to be paid over as a deposit to bind a bargain with the London County Council. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt, when honorable senators opposite have made up their mind to vote for this proposal, all that is said from this side on the subject is &#34; blank cartridge. &#34; The only information  given concerning this vote is that it is an amount which is to go &#34;towards the construction of a building in the Strand, London, for Commonwealth offices.&#34; We know that  &#163;1,000  would be sufficient only to pay about one month&#39;s rent for the land referred to. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has distinctly stated that if we pass this vote, no agreement will be submitted to us for ratification, we shall not be told how much is to be paid for the lease of the land, or what taxes will have to be paid in connexion with it. From the way in which this matter has been engineered, I expect that , bv the time Parliament meets again, a contract will have been entered into by the Government, we shall then be informed of its terms, and will have to submit to the expenditure involved. If the Government are, as I believe they are, in a position to force the passage of this vote, I need not say any more on the subject, but I enter my protest against the proposal. It does not speak well for the Senate that honorable senators should vote money without knowing how it is to be spent. </para>

                        <para>.- I agree with many of the honorable senator&#39;s arguments, but I do not agree with his conclusions. I believe that this Bill is likely to pass. I have been gratified to hear the speeches made by Senators Millen&#39; and Pearce, and by the honorable senator who has just resumed his seat. They have pointedly directed attention to our financial future, and that is the most important question which Parliament, at the present time, can consider, as it certainly most seriously affects the interests of the people. The speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was worthy of the honorable senator. I hope it will arouse honorable senators generally to a sense of their duty, so that they may more closely watch the finances of the Commonwealth in the future than they have done in the past. I was very pleased to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> speak so strongly of the necessity of coming to some financial arrangement with the States as to the future, and of the danger of allowing the present nebulous condition of affairs to continue very much longer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> also directed attention to the same question. Whilst I disagree, as I generally do, with many of the honorable senator&#39;s remarks, I was very glad that he also should have devoted himself to a consideration of this question. I think that we could not, on this Bill, have expected from the Vice-President of the Executive Council a full disclosure of the financial proposals of the Government, but the honorable senator might have informed the Senate as to where the money was to come from to meet the expenditure to which we are now being asked to agree. Perhaps the honorable senator, in his reply to the debate, will be able to afford some information on that point. I should like to add my word of warning with respect to the financial position. On the 1st of January, 1911, the Braddon section of the Constitution will cease to operate. </para>

                            <para>- However, I do not think it would be wise to continue the operation of &#34;the Braddon section after the time referred to. To have to raise &#163;4 for every  &#163;1  we require is not good business. I mention this in order to emphasize the necessity for doing something to meet the difficulties with which the States will be  faced when the Braddon section ceases to operate. The question must be tackled, and the more attention is called to it at the present time the better the States will be prepared for what must follow. It must be admitted that public expenditure by the Commonwealth and by the States is mounting up very rapidly indeed. &#39; The expenditure of the Commonwealth has been increased by over &#163;2,000,000 in excess of its expenditure in the first year of Federation, whilst the expenditure of the States has been increased by some &#163;4,235,000 over and above the States expenditure for 1899-1900. This indicates a very serious position, because, in addition to this increased expenditure, the States have been relieved of expenditure to the extent of over &#163;3,000.000 since the inauguration of Federation. The anticipations of those who took part in the agitation for Federation, and of the people who voted for it, that, in bringing it about we should not increase our expenses unduly, are being sadly disappointed. If, when the Commonwealth Bill was submitted to the people, they were told that at the close of the sixth year of Federation the Commonwealth would have increased its public expenditure by&#163;2,000,000,and the States their expenditure by &#163;4,235,000, the chances are the Bill would never have been accepted. </para>

It ought never to be forgotten that Commonwealth and States charges have to be paid from the same pockets. We have to face the fact that expenditure under the Commonwealth must be still further increased. That cannot be helped. We have other functions of government to take over from the States. We have to make ourselves known in the world, and to develop the country, and, without going into detail, it may be taken for granted that the legitimate expenditure of the Commonwealth must be very considerably increased. That being so, it is our duty to exercise our very best care, and to avoid committing the </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to vote for the establishment of a Federal system of old-age pensions. That will involve legitimate expenditure which we must incur. As compared with the House of Representatives, the Senate represents the States in a special manner, and we should bear in mind our dual obligation of loyalty to the Commonwealth and the States. We are bound to economize so far as we can, and we should insist that the States Governments shall economize also. They cannot expect to go on, as in the past, increasing their expenditure. If they do, the people&#34; will rise in judgment and sweep us and them out of the way. Another matter which should lead us to be careful in dealing with financial questions is the fact that there is a prospect before us of a bad season. During the last three years we have been favoured with exceptionally good seasons. In my experience - and it has been a very long one - I have not seen a season break so badly in a great portion of northern Victoria and Riverina as this season has, since the year of the great drought. That we shall experience a bad season in the greater portion of northern Victoria, Riverina, and a considerable part of western New South Wales - I do not know about Queensland - is an absolute certainty, I think. That is another reason why we should be very careful. A bad season does not come alone. When we get one bad season, we generally have two or three more. That will bring us up to the time for the next general election. Unless we mend our ways, the electors will talk at that time, I think, to some purpose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said that a strong Government is needed to produce a financial scheme which will insure fair treatment to the States and at the same time enable the Commonwealth to pursue that course of development which it should take in order to achieve the end for which it was created I do not know whether such a Government lies in the immediate future or not. I certainly doubt if we have such a Government at the present time. The present Government reigns, but does not govern. It is in the hands of a party which is always ready to spend. It will be very difficult indeed to put on the brake and keep it within reasonable bounds. </para>

                            <para>- The Labour Party is entitled to no more credit for that decision than is any one else. But, of course, they claim the credit for every good thing which is done, and try to fasten upon others the discredit for every bad thing which is done. I am very strongly of the opinion that the present Government will retain office for nearly three years. I do not see how any change is likely to come about. It has been pointed out that when the Tariff is out of the way, we may get a change of Government. I do not think that there is the least chance of that taking place. The party which is supporting the Government now will continue their support until the next general election, because it is bound to the Government by the strongest of ties. It is not a tie of affection or interest or community of interest, but a tie of fear, and that is the fear of a general election. </para>

I am glad that a warning note as to our financial position has been sounded here to-day. I trust that the Government will be prudent, and so far as they exercise prudence and care, and practice economy, they will have the support of honorable senators, no matter where they may sit. I have no special interest in any items in this Bill. No person has sent to me a request for a post-office or other work. </para>

                            <para>- No. My interest in the Bill is purely an abstract one. I certainly do take an interest in the vote for a site, in the Strand, London. I agree with many of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers&#39;</inline> arguments, but not with his conclusions. The members of the Government: who have to deal with this question have fully maintained their reputation for unbusinesslike capacity. I find that the Acting Prime Minister has stated that on the 17th May to had an interview with the valuer to the London County Council, in company with Captain Collins, and received information as to the building conditions, terms of the lease, &#38;c. Those are the very items in respect of which the Vice-President of the Executive Council said to-night&#39; the Government has cabled to London for information. Can you, sir, imagine any&#34; one going to London on a mission of this importance, and coming away with the meagre tale which we heard here to-night ?. </para>

                            <para>- That was one of the purposes to which the Minister applied himself when he was in England, and he acted in a very incomplete way. 1 undertake to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent</inline> did not come out so meagrely supplied with information as did that honorable gentleman. Surely the information which was available to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent</inline> was available to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne ! He was not there alone. He was accompanied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt and two or three other Government officers, to whom he could have said, &#34; Go and look into this business, and bring me all particulars as to rents, rates, and building terms, and the position at the end of the lease.&#34; All that information could have been obtained, but I suppose that the honorable gentleman was too busily engaged in spreading himself at Birmingham and other places to look after such humble matters as the interests of the Commonwealth. Reference has been made to the failure of the mail contract. While this business may not be such a fiasco, still, so far as it has gone, it reflects as little credit upon the Government as that business did. But, putting aside the question of the capacity or incapacity of the Government, let us consider this matter fairly in the . interests of Australia, and . see whether we really need in London &#39;a building which will pro- . perly represent this continent. In the first place, we want a building in order to concentrate Australian interests in London. We desire the Commonwealth to be represented on one spot, and the various States to be represented on that spot, to show the products which we can produce, and to impress upon the people of the old land the suitability of this continent as a place for the Anglo-Saxon race. We need in London a building in which the States can rest under the shadow of the Commonwealth, each State doing its own work in its own way, and the Commonwealth doing the great business of Australia. We do not require costly Agents-General for the States to wear the paraphernalia of office and attend distinguished society functions, but shrewd and patriotic general -agents who will push the interests of their respective States, and in doing so, promote the interests of Australia to the best of their ability. Two years ago I spent a considerable time in London. If there was one thing which used to grieve and anger me it was the dense ignorance of Australia which was displayed by the people.. The Vice-  President  of the Executive Council and I used to discuss the question together. Unless a man goes to London and moves about among the people, he is really unable to comprehend the dense ignorance about this country which prevails there. London people know more about Timbuctoo, Paraguay, and other such places, than they know of their kith and kin in this country. The need of Australia in London -of course, I mean Great Britain - is representation to expose the evil things which are said about us, to present our good points, to explain what a good place Australia is for the English race to come to, to describe the conditions of life under which we live, and to depict our fineclimate. </para>

                            <para>- I did not say that there were any misrepresentations. At any rate, that is hot the question with which. I am dealing. We want to be represented by competent men, with a knowledge of the country. We desire our products to be exhibited in a central building, and information to be supplied therefrom. That,., of course, involves the appointment of ar. High Commissioner. An appointment should be made with as little delay as possible. If it were possible, I would like to see a High Commissioner chosen even before this building is erected. He could occupy temporary premises at an annual rental of &#163;1,000or&#163;1,500. That would answer while the permanent building was being: erected. He could be gradually getting, used to the place, ascertaining the lay of the land, acquiring a knowledge of the people, and thus preparing himself for the time when he would be able to carry out , his work in larger premises and on a wider scale. Is it a good site which has been selected? It is said that it is not a good site, because it is not in a business or central street. I do not profess to know all London, but to my mind it is an excellent site. It is not what may be called a business street, but it is a busy street. </para>

They will know where to go. It is a site that stands out well. I have heard it stated that people do not go there. I will mention a fact to show whether people go there or not : At the time when the Vice-President of the Executive Council and I were in London, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Torrey</inline> was holding great religious revival meetings on -almost the very spot where it is proposed io acquire land for the Commonwealth. A temporary church had been erected there. Surely, if it were not the kind of place to which people would go, a building would mot have been temporarily erected in which to hold meetings of 17,000 or 20,000 people. </para>

                            <para>- It is near to Westminster, near to the National Gallery, where thousands of people go, near to Covent Garden, near to St. Paul&#39;s, and not very far from the Bank of England. The plan before us would seem to show that it is nearer the Bank of England than is really the case. As a matter of fact, it is -about a mile and a quarter away, but it is quite near enough to the heart of the city. Indeed, a site within the city itself would mot be suitable for the purpose. It is also very near to the river. The next question is whether the price we are paying is too high. That is a matter as to which we cannot very well judge. If we want land anywhere we shall have to pay the price for it, and land in London, as we know very well, is very, very- dear. It is not &#34;very long ago since the London County Council took this district in hand, bought up the buildings, pulled them down, and de-cast the whole neighbourhood. </para>

                            <para>- There is always .a danger of being too extravagant on the one hand, or too miserly on the other. We require to get the right mean as between the two: But we do want to be known, in London and in Great Britain, and we have to take some risk to secure our end. We  must make up our mind to spend some money, I believe that it would have been better, had it been possible - I3o not say that it was possible- to consult the States as. to their willingness&#39; to join with us in this matter. I feel confident that if the site is secured and the States are taken into the confidence of the Government as to the building that is to be erected, and if they are invited to make use of it, not one single  State Government in Australia will stand out. They must see that&#39; it- : will .be; much to their advantage- to have quarters  in , a group of buildings where all Australia will be represented, rather than have their offices scattered about in holes and corners in various parts of the city. I have no doubt that the States will join. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> is very dubious as to the success of this experiment, and as to the expenditure, which he says we are giving the Government permission to incur. But that is scarcely the case. We have been told very frankly that the Government want this &#163;1,000 in order to enable them to&#39; get a leg in - to make a start. They want to secure the land. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has been perfectly straightforward in what he has told us. He has assured us that in regard to the building and the design for it, Parliament will be consulted. I do not think we can ask for more than that at this time. But if we lose this chance of getting an eligible site, we mav have to wait a long while before we get another chance. If Canada is going to build alongside of us, so much the better. Certain &#39; points which are very important have been mentioned. One is as to what will happen at the end of the ninety-nine years - whether there will be a re-adjustment of rent, or compensation for improvements, or a right to a renewal. Those points will, of course&#39;, receive due consideration. Another point is that while we may take the land at once, we are not expected to pay the full rental at once. In the first year, no rent will be required. They will give us an opportunity to build or to commence our foundations&#39;. In the second year, they will charge a quarter rent, in the third year a half, in the fourth year three-quarters, and in the* fifth year the&#39; full  amount will be payable. We shall therefore have time to complete our arrangements before the full rent is paid. .. I urge upon my fellow senators that it is high time we were properly represented in London. It is time that we made the pace a little bit. faster there than we have been doing. I do not say that we should Le extravagant. We must certainly be careful. But there is a carefulness that makes for loss, and an expenditure that will make for advancement and profit. Australia expects to make progress. The question of opening up new markets, the question of encouraging immigration in order to people this continent, have to be dealt with. We have two great competitors for the vast stream of emigration from England - Canada, and the United States. If we desire to cope with them, and to have any chance of securing a proportion of the emigrants who leave England every year - going to the United States to the extent of 1,000,000 per annum., and to Canada to the extent of 200,000 or 300,000 - we shall have to do something more than we are doing at present. We are taking the first step in the right direction. We cannot see our path clearly all the way. We cannot see far beyond the present. But as we enter further into this matter, the way will open in front of us and we shall be able to see directions in which our position can be improved. I believe the Senate will be wise in agreeing to the vote. I trust that it will be passed, and that the Government will proceed cautiously, carefully, but at the same time, with determination and vigour, to secure for us in London - and that means in the heart of the Empire - a habitation and a name worthy of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Since it has been my fortune to be a member of the Senate, I have been led to regard honorable senators opposite as a sort of constitutional party who boast of being very precise and correct in their method of dealing with public business. But I have been astonished on this occasion to find honorable senators ready to charge the Government with the absence of a financial policy. I desire, however, to congratulate the Government upon once more determining to construct public works out of revenue, and not to go in for the borrowing policy which has characterized the States in the past. But a demand has been made that the Government shall come forward with a financial policy. I do not know that there is any necessity for a Government at any time to provide more money than is required for the annual services and for public works out of revenue. Thanks to that &#39; &#39; extravagant &#39; &#39; party to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> referred - the Labour Party - the Commonwealth has no debts, and, therefore, does not require to provide a sinking fund. But the Government&#39;s financial policy, up to the present, has been such that if it were necessary they are in the fortunate position of being able to provide a little money for a sinking fund. </para>

I very much regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> was a little wild, and almost inclined to be raving, in some of his utterances ; but I am glad to know that the honorable senator has at last mustered sufficient courage to say in the Senate what he has been saying to the people outside.

                            <para>- Practically all the honorable senators opposite who have spoken, have said so; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> indorsed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> words to that effect. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was very narrow in dealing with this question from ah Australian point of view. The honorable senator drew an alarming picture of expenditure which he said was contemplated by the present Government ; and the position of honorable senators opposite is rather remarkable. When the Bounties Bill was under consideration, - honorable senators opposite declared that the industries would never bet commenced in Australia ; but when they came to deal with the financial aspect of the matter, they emphatically declared that many hundreds of thousands of pounds would be required in order to pay the bounties. They seem to. forget that if the industries are not started no bounties will be collected j and such argument as they used is hardly fair. Then, again, those honorable senators make all sorts of calculations as to the cost of penny postage; although they are confident that that project will not be carried out. Is. it fair, on their part, to ask the Government to provide ways and means for meeting expenditure which they are anxious shall not be incurred, and which they will use every possible effort to prevent? As to defence, I am quite alive to the fact_ that the Commonwealth cannot make satisfactory provision, so long as they are compelled to continue the present annual repayments to the States. If we desire, to establish, anything like effective de-&#39; fence, one of two things must happen ; we must either cease contributing so much to the revenue of the States, or we must borrow. There is only one other alternative,  and  that is direct taxation. Honorable senators opposite always fight to retain the  Tight  of the States to draw as much revenue as they possibly can from the Com monwealth^ while they, at the same time, object to any .additional direct taxation, particularly in the form suggested by honorable members on this side. We now have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> claiming that it is owing to the elf efforts of honorable senators opposite that the Commonwealth did not adopt a policy of borrowing. That honorable senator, who poses as the champion of economy, desires to have- the Commonwealth represented in a worthy manner by the erection of grand &#34;offices for the High Commissioner in the Strand, London. I do not know whether the proposed site is -a good one or not ; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> &#39;s idea is to have the States&#39; representatives grouped around the High Commissioner in the new&#39; premises. But what sort of economy is it to establish a High Commissioner, and then have around him ai number of little, satellites, in the shape of Agents-General, drawing money from the taxpayers of Australia? </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that the duties of the general agents differ much from the&#39; duties of the Agents-General,  01  that the change of name means any reduction in the salaries. If I thought that the appointment of a High Commissioner would mean the duplication of the States representation, I should certainly oppose any such scheme. I am .in hopes, however, that when a High Commissioner is appointed, the States will see the wisdom of economizing by withdrawing their Agents-General, and leaving the representation of Australia to the High Commissioner. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> charged the Labour Party with being bound to the present Government, not by sympathy, but by fear; and I believe that to be just about the position. Personally, I do not support the present Government altogether because of any particular love - for them. I want to be candid in this matter ; and I may explain that I. have a terrible fear that if the present Government were/displaced, honorable senators opposite might come into power. That, in  my opinion; would mean disaster to Australia,- because, then we should have extravagance as in the days of old. We have been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> that when he was in London - he found great ignorance prevailing in regard to Australian conditions. But what can we expect? Very few labour speeches made in this Chamber are cabled to- London, but the utterances- of. the so-called anti-Socialist, constitutional, all virtue party  are&#39;  read in the old country. When the speech  of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> is cabled over, and  the&#39;  people at home see that,, in his- opinion, the present Government, are kept in power by  a  party, whose only desire is to grab something, I can quite imagine Australia being deemed a good place to be out  of.  If honorable senators opposite would adopt  a  reasonable attitude, and deal with facts, it would be more to the interests of Australia. I again congratulate the Government  on  their financial .policy, and especially upon the fact that they have provided for the necessary public works  of  the Commonwealth without borrowing. Although they are paying for public works out  of  revenue, they are still&#39;, able  to  provide  a  little for the benefit  of  the States over and above the three-fourths  of  the Customs and Excise revenue which the Constitution compels  us to  return. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> expressed the fear that some wildcat scheme was- going  to  be inaugurated at the instigation  pf the  Labour Party. Has the Labour Party ever thrust any &#39;wildcat schemes upon .the people  of  the Commonwealth? I can not&#39; only enumerate  a  number  of  such schemes which have been proposed and carried by honorable senators opposite, but can mention more than one which has. been responsible for building  up  the public debt  .of Victoria -  introduced by Governments  of  which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> was   al  member. For those he must bear his fair share  of  responsibility. When the Labour Party have the responsibility thrust upon them  of  conducting the Government  of  the Commonwealth, when they bring in wild-cat . schemes which end in building  up a  national debt, when they fail  to  make provision for the redemption  of  those debts,  it  will be time enough  to  condemn them for bringing in wild-cat . schemes. Governments, in which  a  large proportion  pf  honorable senators opposite have had a share, have built  up  the debts  df  the) Australian States, and when_ those honorable senators are asked for a remedy they&#39; say, &#39;.&#39;The.&#39; Commonwealth Government and&#39; Parliament are dominated by the Labour Party.&#34; Consequently, I ask those extravagant, would-be-wild-cat people  to  relieve  us of  the accusation  of  bringing in wild-cat schemes, and  of  the responsibility for the debts created in the past. I am- glad  to  know that the Commonwealth has lived&#39;  so  far without going into debt. I&#34; hope that the anti-borrowing policy will continue as the permanent policy of the Commonwealth, and that when the Government bring down a defence policy,  including the construction of &#39; an Australian Navy, they will recognise thati the working man of Australia has really very little interest in&#39; defence. He has at least not nearly the same interest as have the class of people whom honorable senators opposite have the honour to represent. What has a man who merely has his labour to sell, who has only his hands wherewith to obtain a living, which, when obtained, is barely sufficient to keep his wife and children, to defend ? We do not want to tax him to defend the country. When that defence policy is brought down, I hope that the Government will say, &#39; &#39; As we are going to defend the property of the Commonwealth-, the men who own it ought to pay for its defence.&#39;.&#39; When that day arrives, I hope that the necessary direct taxation will be levied upon those who have something to defend, and that defence will not mean impoverishing the poorer people of this country. </para>
