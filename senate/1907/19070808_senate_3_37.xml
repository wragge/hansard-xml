      <para>1. Is it a fact, as reported in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 8th August, that, as the contract between the Commonwealth Government and the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, in respect to the cable service between Tasmania and Victoria, will expire in March, 1909, the Government have decided to lay a cable of its own ? </para>
      <para>2.  Is it a fact that the Government have de cided to have a survey for such proposed cable at a cost of&#163;1,000? </para>
      <para>3. Will such sum of&#163;1,000 be treated as &#34; other &#34; expenditure, or as a charge on the States chiefly concerned, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> Victoria and Tasmania ? </para>

      <para>8. Before committing Parliament to any ex. penditure, will the Government givethe Parliament an opportunity of expressing its opinion whether, in view of the success of wireless telegraphy, it is advisable to spend money on cables, where wireless telegraphy can be successfully installed ? </para>

          <para>. - I have no desire to find fault with the Printing Committee, but to referto a matter which I believe is occupying their attention, with a view to indicating a way in which economy can be effected. A report of experts in connexion with the Bounties Bill was laid on the table of the Senate and printed. Later on or before that time there were excerpts from that report, together with excerpts from a report by a Queensland official, printed and laid on the table. I notice that both papers contain a large quantity of matter which is precisely the same. In the report on the Bounties Bill certain excerpts are printed in one kind of type, but in the other report they are printed in another kind of type, showing that a quantity of matter was re-set, and a great deal of unnecessary expenditure incurred. What I suggest to the Printing Committee is that where they find that tables and other matter which are likely to be used in two or three reports have been . set up, <inline font-style="italic">they</inline> should <inline font-style="italic">try to</inline> arrange that such matter should be stereotyped and the stereos kept until they are required again. That would avoid the resetting of a large quantity of matter, and consequently insure considerable economy. </para>

I ask the honorable senator when he isreplying to say whether the report has omitted any reference to those documentswhich the Printing Committee think should not be (printed, either because they are lengthy, or for any other reason. I believe that the Senate will appreciate the reports of the Printing Committee more if they enumerate, not merely the documents which are recommended to be printed, but alsothose which are not so recommended, if any. I do not think that it would make the reports very lengthy if they stated that for certain reasons the Printing Committeehad decided not to recommend the printing of certain papers. </para>

          <para>. - In reply to the very friendly criticism by Senators Chataway and Clemons, I desire to say that the Printing Committee are trying to do what they can in the directions to which they have referred. At to-day&#39;s meeting of the Joint Committee, a subcommittee was appointed for the purpose of devising a form of report which would keep both Houses fully informed in connexion with all papers which have been tabled. We hope to have a form devised by next week. We are anxious to find out the best method of drawing up an index which will show the number of papers tabled in each House, what recommendation the Printing Committee have made in respect of each paper, and, probably, the reason for its recommendation. Every member of the Senate would then be able to see at a glance what had been done with the papers, and where they were to be found. I may inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> that so far the Printing Committee have been exceedingly careful not to order the printing of any document which was already  in  type. Before taking any action, we have caused inquiries to be made at the Government Printing Office, to see whether the type had already been set up or not. I may point out that, while we may recommend papers to be printed, we have no control over the printing of them. But we take every possible precaution to see that a paper which is already in type shall not be printed again, and that the type shall not be set up twice. Beyond that, I do not think we can, go, unless, of course, the Senate should invest us with control over the Government Printing Office, which I do not think it is likely to do. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has correctly answered the inquiries of my honorable friends. We have taken the steps which Senators; , Mulcahy and Clemons have indicated, and at more than one meeting we have spent considerable time in discussing the complications to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chatawayhas</inline> alluded. We find, however, that despite our best efforts, we shall not be able at any time to cope with the difficulty, inasmuch as there are so many reports on a subject made. Each report may have a particular relationship to a certain amount of correspondence which has been prepared for another report. If the honorable senator will look up the reports of Commissions and Conferences, he will find that the same matter has been printed in three, four, or, perhaps, halfadozen papers, and probably in each case  it  appears in different type, and is set to different measure. The Printing Committee think that, at the present time, it is utterly impossible to avoid such complications; but, if it can be avoided, it will be done. </para>

            <para>- In connexion with the cases referred to a strange condition of affairs exists. The State Government of Queensland is harassing certain public officials there in utter defiance of the decisions of the High Court. I feel that I am justified in bringing the matter forward, as evidence of the manner in which some of the Governments of the States are seeking to harass persons in the employ of the Commonwealth, contrary to the law as laid down by the High Court. It should be remembered that we have onlyjust passed through the Senate a measure confirming the finality of appeal in that Court. It is reported, in the most authoritative manner, that the following is the state of affairs at present existing </para>

        <para>As the High Court ruled that the item of costs should be attended to by the States Governments concerned, Federal officers naturally concludedthat their interest in the matter was at an end. </para>
        <para>This is not so, however. Notwithstanding that the High Court unanimously refused to grant leave to appeal to the Privy Council, the Crown Solicitors in New South Wales and Victoria are approaching the Privy Council and asking that august body to permit an appeal to be heard practically in defiance of the High Court&#39;s ruling. In Queensland the trustees of the fund raised by the Association for the defence of Commonwealth officers have been notified that the State Government has succeeded in obtaining a further adjournment of the seven cases pending in the District Court until the decision of the Privy Council is known. </para>
        <para>It will be remembered that when these appeals first came before the District Court an adjournment was asked for until theHigh Court cases could be heard, and the Crown Solicitor opposed the adjournment asked for en the ground that the State was losing interest on the money in dispute. The learned Judge, however, granted the request, and advised the parties that failed before the High Court to immediately abandon the proceedings before the District Court, otherwise they would be mulet in costs. </para>

            <para>-Whether it accomplishes that intention or not, it is not for me to say. Notwithstanding that fact, and notwithstanding that the High Court has refused leave to appeal- by a unanimous decision, not merelyby a decision of the majority of the Justices - we find the Queensland Government harassing these eight officers with litigation and by piling up costs. We know very well that, however costs are finally adjusted, even if they are recoverable against the Crown, no one in litigation ever recovers the full amount of his outlay from the other side. These officers are, I assert, being treated in a manner that is not consonant with the dignity of any Government; and it opens my mind to the fact that in proposing to afford the States Governments an opportunity, as this Bill does, to attack the public servants of the Commonwealth, we are affording them an opportunity to carry on this system of harassment to a greater extent than they are already doing. I hope that honorable senators will see chat it is a very dangerous thing to afford States Governments further rights of worrying and harassing than they already possess, and that this particular clause, proposing to afford them additional liberty and licence, ought not to be agreed to in its present form. </para>

          <para>. - I donot like this clause for many reasons. The object of it is to make it legal for any State to impose taxation upon the allowances granted to Federal members of Parliament, and to override the decision of the High Court to that extent. I think that it would be verv much simpler - and I cannot see any real objection to such a procedure - if we were to say definitely, in making the allowances paid to Federal members taxable, that the whole of the taxation in respect of those allowances shall be paid to the State which the member represents either in the Senate or in the House of Representatives. What reasonable objection can there be to that? </para>

            <para>- I do not think so. It wouldrather be upholding them. It is a simple and a fair way of dealing with the question, and would certainly save an infinity of trouble. For instance, take the amount of taxation payable in respect of the allowance to a senator or a representative from Tasmania. The question arises, first of all, as to the amount to be paid to the State of Tasmania, and, secondly, to the State of Victoria, in which the member or senator for a certain period resides. How is the proportion to be decided? That would be by no means an easy question for any tribunal to determine, and it would be difficult for any lawyer to advise upon it. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> will agree with me as to that. We should escape that difficulty altogether if we simply provided, in making these allowances taxable, that the whole of the taxation shall go to the State that the member or senator in question represents. </para>

One is that wh&#39;ich he incidentally mentioned, that if we are to pay income tax we should all prefer - and it is only fair - that it should be paid to the State in which we are domiciled. As things stand at present in the body politic in Australia, income tax is levied by the States and not by the Commonwealth. If there were an universal income tax levied by the Commonwealth it would be a differ - ent matter. But we are dealing with a State form of taxation; which stands, to a large extent, in lieu of Customs and Excise, of which the States previously had control. Their reservoir of taxation is their income tax, and, it may be, their land tax. Therefore we should all prefer - and I think it is consistent with the principle upon which (the tax is levied - that we should pay the tax as citizens of the States which we represent. We are here in. Victoria by the accident of our membership of the Federal Parliament. We are not residents here. </para>

            <para>- I do go home every week, and J hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is as fond of his home as I am. If he is not, it is one of the defects of a very fine character. It seems to me to be obviously the just principle upon which to proceed that we should, if we are to pay this tax, pay it to the States of which we are citizens, inasmuch as it is in respect of our citizenship that the tax is levied. But there is another reason, and that is that the clause as it stands will give rise to a great deal of confusion, and perhaps to litigation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has referred to hardships in Queensland in regard to the salaries of Federal officers. The claims there made are made on account of salaries earned within the State. But in the case of allowances paid to Members of Parliament - which my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> had in mind - only a proportion is, so to speak, earned within a particular State. How is it to be apportioned? How much of the salary of a Minister representing, for instance, New South Wales, is earned in Victoria? How much of the salary of the Minister of Home Affairs is earned in Victoria ? It may be said that the whole of it is earned in Victoria, but the Minister may dispute that. Will Victoria, &#39;which has been referred to as exacting this tax to the uttermost farthing, be content merely with a Minister&#39;s assertion - &#34; I earned the greater part of my salary in Queensland, as I resided there during the six or seven months of the recess?&#34; Every one of these things would be a matter for investigation. Personally, although I think that the incidence of the tax ought to be just and fair over allowances and everything else, I would much rather have struck out of the Bill the t taxation of the allowances of members and salaries of Ministers than have the confusion and the disputes which are sure to ensue if the clause is passed as it is. I am quite ready to agree that all these allowances and salaries should be taxed, but I think the tax ought to go to the State of which the man is a citizen, being leviable in respect of his citizenship, and not because he happens to come to Victoria, for instance, for a little while. When the original claim was made upon me here by Victoria, it was made upon the whole of my allowances. That would be unjust, and an extortion. Why should I - I do not mind, because I am used to it - or other people, who are not so familiar with the atmosphere of Courts as I am, be dragged into them, in the endeavour to reach what can only be at best a rule of thumb proportion between the amount earned in Victoria and the. amount earned in the State to which he belongs? The thing on the face of it seems perfectly absurd. I hope, therefore, that the VicePresident of the Executive Council, who, I believe, has the  same  object in view as I have, will endeavour to draft some provision that will do the thing directly and not in this round-about Way, which will simply plunge us all, Ministers and members, into a Court of law in order to determine the question of how much of our allowances or salaries are earned in one State and how much in another, <inline font-style="italic">o</inline> It must be .remembered also that the proportion may vary from year to year in different States. The whole question is so beset with difficulties that it would be far better to settle it in a direct and simple way, and upon what I conceive to be a just principle. </para>

            <para>- I should be very glad to assist in drafting one. When I discussed the Bill before, I had framed an amendment in substitution of the whole of the second paragraph, but, unfortunately, I have not got it with me. In the form in which the clause now stands, it may be claimed that it is implied that the whole of the salary is earned within the State for which the member is elected. Perhaps that is what my honorable friend means. If that is the intention, then the only object is to have it directly and clearly expressed. At present, it is in such a state that it will merely lead to disputes and differences, and the calling in of some tribunal to settle them. That ought to be avoided, because many members may feel that they are mak-* ing a concession in respect to this income tax question,- and that, as they are doing it on high grounds, as I think they are, it ought to be done directly and clearly so as to avoid the possibility of involving either State or citizens in disputes. _ I should like to say a word as to the situation <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> referred to. It is an anomalous and difficult position, which I am afraid .will not be redressed to any great extent by this measure.  I refer to the difficulty in connexion with the finality of appeals. Ever, since I have had anything to do with Federal affairs, I have always advocated - and I do so as strongly now as I did ten years ago - the finality of the High Court in regard to appeals affecting our own domestic concerns, except on matters concerning other parts of the Empire. My criticism, to which the VicePresident of the Executive Council incidentally referred when I interjected with regard to the other Bill, is not at all in derogation of the attitude I have always taken as a national Australian. I was simply pointing out that that was not the way to do it. My honorable friend, referring to my. interjection, put it that there was a difference of opinion  as to what the effect of the Bill would be; but I only want to make it quite clear that I do not believe in - the word I used the other day was punishing - but I will say in depreciating the State Courts, or taking away from them jurisdiction which they are perfectly competent to exercise, as though they were in fault, when it is not their fault at all, and when there is a direct, easy, and effective remedy in another way. I said before that it was not my fault that that great policy which we all agreed upon in the Convention was not carried out, but the criticisms which I offered upon this clause were in respect of the second part of it, to which I invite the Minister&#39;s attention. It is in effect a legislative reversal of the decision of the High Court, whether right or wrong. It is a legislative declaration that that decision must have been wrong, as we are reversing it. We are asked to declare that the imposition of this- taxation shall not be an interference with the exercise of any power of the Commonwealth or with its instrumentalities, as though we were a Court of -Appeal ourselves from the High Court of Australia; while at the&#39; same time it does not advance one hair&#39;s breadth the object we have in view. It does not give the High Court that finality, limited only in the way I have referred to, which I for one wish it to have in the national polity of Australia. It is a legislative reflection, of course not intentional, upon the High Court. It declares that the decision of the High Court - that the imposition of income tax by the States was an interference with the- instrumentalitiesof the Federation, and with the exercise of Federal powers, and therefore could not stand - was wrong, because we are asked to declare that that taxation shall not be deemed to be such an interference. I hope my honorable friend will endeavour to frame this clause without the necessity of putting in that provision. I endeavoured to express my views before as to the attitude of the High Court in relation to these measures, but I want to protect the High Court from this reflection, if we can accomplish the legislative object&#39; we have in view without it. I certainly think we can if we adopt the idea <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has thrown out. </para>

          <para>. - I want honorable senators to bear in mind that the law, as laid down by the High Court after full reconsideration of their previous judgments, .and after the decision of the Privy Council, is that the salaries of Federal officers and Federal Ministers are not liable to taxation by the States. This measure provides that the States shall be at liberty, if they choose, to tax the salaries of Federal officers and Federal Ministers, and the allowances&#39; of Federal members, in common with other salaries,, so far as they are earned within that State. So if an honorable senator from Queensland finds it necessary in the discharge of his duties to  spend six . months in Victoria, and then resides at his own home in Queensland for the remaining six months, according to the terms of the Bill the Queensland Government is only to be at liberty to tax him in regard to the six months in which he resides in Queensland. </para>

            <para>-  In the case of a Minister, the honorable senator says he will not be liable in Victoria at all, but will be liable for the six months he spends at his own home. Then the Government are making him liable in Queensland in respect of the salary which he does not earn in Queensland, but are allowing him to escape in respect of the salary he earns in Victoria. </para>

In other words, they are to be regarded as only earning their salaries in their own States when they are residing there. </para>

            <para>- In Victoria the exemption is, I think, ^200 on incomes under a certain amount. If honorable senators think that the several States should tax in regard to the whole of a salary, then I do not want&#34; to obstruct their wish. I have sought to make it clear that, if a senator from Queensland spends one-half of the year in Victoria discharging his parliamentary duties, during that period he should he not be liable in his own State? Victoria or in his own State. </para>

            <para>- If, however, he spends the other half of the year in Queensland, he is to be liable to that State in respect of that period. I hope I have made it quite clear that a member of Parliament will only be liable to income tax in respect of that portion of his salary which is earned in his own State. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has referred to the subject of finality. He has again stated that the Bill is a legislative reversal of the decision of the High Court, and a legislative reflection on that body. Such is not intended, and the Bill cannot possibly bear that construction. We admit the law as laid down by the High Court to be sound law, but we say that its effect is the creation of a privileged class, and consequently we seek to get away from that position. With limitations, the privilege is extended to the States, if they think proper, to impose income tax in respect of Federal salaries and allowances. If the Judiciary Bill be passed in its present form, it will insure absolute finality, because it has been held by the High Court that the income tax cases involve questions as to the limits <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of a State. Under that Bill, when a question of the kind is raised, the action will at once be transferred to the High Court, which, of course, will have fina! jurisdiction. If in a State Court a Judge ruled that a case of the kind did not come within section 74 of the Constitution, an appeal would lie at once to the H;gh Court, and the jurisdiction of the latter Court would again be asserted. There is no getting away from the fact that under any possible circumstances final itv must be reached under the terms of the Judiciary Bill. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> unintentionally did me an injustice when he mentioned that I made an inaccurate statement in regard to certain proceedings which had been initiated in various States by the Commissioners of Taxes. Probably we were talking at cross purposes at the time. I was referring to what had taken place in Victoria. A large number of cases were instituted here, and the judgment of the Privy Council was applied by the State Court. On appeal to the High Court the decision in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Deakin</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Webb</inline> was re-affirmed in the cases of Baxter and Flint. In Victoria the Income Tax Commissioner practically abandoned a large number of /oases in which he had instituted proceedings, because in Flint&#39;s case the High Court had declared that a Federal officer was immune from State income tax. If the proceedings had been, continued, the Commissioner would have been mulcted in costs. He took the only course which could be followed in the circumstances. In the cases of Baxter and Flint an effort is being made by New South Wales and Victoria to obtain special leave from the Privy Council to appeal against the decision of the High Court. I consider that the Federal servants have nothing to fear. We trust in the High Court, and seek in every possible way to support it. It is for honorable senators to determine whether or not the several States shall be at liberty to tax the whole of the income of a member of Parliament or only a proportion of it. The Bill provides that a State shall be at liberty to tax the proportion which is earned therein, and under the circumstances we deem that to be fair and reasonable. </para>

          <para>. -I am sorry to say that I cannot agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best&#39;s</inline> interpretation of the clause, nor with his opinion as to the way in which it will be interpreted and worked. He has stated that if a member of Parliament resides for one part of the year in Melbourne, while Parliament is sitting, and spends the remainder of the year in his own State, he will be taxed by his own State in respect of the time which he has spent there. I cannot agree with the honorable senator&#39;s view. But if it is right, let us see what will happen : A senator for Queensland or Western Australia will say, &#34; If I continue to reside in Victoria&#39; for some time before and for some time after Parliament meets, so that, instead of spending, say, six months of the year in Melbourne, I decide for purposes of my own to- spend ten months here, I shall thereby escape taxation by my own State, except as regards the proportion which I earn therein.&#34; It may be a temptation to a member of Parliament to stay in Melbourne </para>

            <para>- I think the honorable senator must recognise that those limitations are not precise or defined. I have pointed out that there might be considerable dispute on the question of domicile, or whether a man is a resident of a State. In the imposition of an income tax we often find that regard is had to the place in which the income or allowance is paid. The allowances to Federal members are paid in Melbourne in nine cases out of ten. Income tax is frequently levied in respect of an occupation carried on in a particular place. Who will say that the occupation for which we get an allowance of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;400</inline> a year is not carried on in Melbourne? It certainly compels us to be in Melbourne, and we are occupied in Melbourne. </para>

          <para>- - I intend on this occasion to vote against the Government. Reference has been made to Queensland, Tasmania, Western Australia, and New South Wales, but no reference has been made to South Australia in this connexion. At present, unless some honorable senator kicks over the traces, and keeps us a day longer here, honorable senators from South Australia, from the time they leave their homes, are two nights and part of two half-days in the train. They are &#34;two days or a little more in Melbourne, and may be at home for two or three days in each week. I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> in the circumstances, to explain how the tax is to be divided. The common-sense view is put forward in the amendment, and I am prepared to support it.  I will do so for another reason, and that is to escape the filling up of the income tax schedules. I am going to tell honorable senators a secret with respect  to the schedules which have to be filled up -in South Australia. They were so complicated during the time that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> was Chief Secretary in the Kingston Ministry that the AttorneyGeneral of the day, who is now a Judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia, told me that rather than go to the trouble of preparing his own taxation return he hired a man to do it for him. I shall be  found on this occasion voting with honorable senators on the other side, who are usually my opponents. </para>

          <para>.- There is a desire on the part of the Government to carry legislation which will, so far as Victoria is concerned, enable the State Government to levy income tax on all Federal officers, and  members of the Federal Parliament representing that State. I do not believe there is a representative of Victoria in either House of the Parliament who will offer the slightest objection to that. However, a feeling has been expressed in the Committee that members of Parliament should not be placed in any different position from that in which Federal officers generally are placed. I believe that the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Clemons would make an invidious distinction. </para>

            <para>- I shall endeavour to show in what way. In the Federal Parliament there are representatives from States in which income taxation is levied and of States in which there is no such taxation. This may be a far-fetched case, but I take a Federal member representing Western Australia or Queensland. He might have to remain in Victoria for eleven months of the year, and at the end of the session might go to Western Australia or Queensland and remain there for a month. If an income tax is in force in the State from which he comes, he will be liable only in respect of the amount of his allowance covering his month&#39;s residence in the State. </para>

That is not a fair position. &#39; I do not object to pay income, tax, and I think it would be unfair that any honorable senator should, in respect of income taxation, be placed in. a position different from that of any Federal officer or employe1. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator &#34;</inline> Clemons&#39; proposal would make that distinction, and I say that it would not be a fair one to make in the interest of the States or of the employes of the &#39;Commonwealth. </para>

The proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> would have this effect as compared with payment to two States : If there were payment in one State only, there would be only one exemption. But if there were payment in two States, there would be two exemptions; and if the exemptions were liberal in character, very little would remain to be taxed. </para>

            <para>- Reference has been made to- the fact that in Western Australia there is no income tax. Let me also point out that within a few months there will probably be none in New South Wales, where the abolition of the tax forms a leading feature &#34;of the programme of the present dominant party. In the past, New South Wales has never sought to collect income tax upon the allowances of Federal members, or, if the tax has been tendered by them, it has not been accepted by the State. The New South Wales Income Tax Commissioner has respected the decision of the High Court. As to the difficulty of determining the amount payable, let me point this out : Some time ago, when the Victorian Income Tax Commissioner, with the help of the Crown Solicitor, was worrying members of this Parliament, I pointed out that my services as a senator were not rendered to Victoria, but to the whole Commonwealth, and I expressed a willingness to pay to each State one-sixth of whatever amount of income tax might be due. That suggestion did not meet with the approval of the Crown Solicitor, and some further correspondence ensued. It happened that in that particular year the Senate had only met something like 129 days. I pointed out to the Crown Solicitor that as I had been so little in Victoria, the Commissioner surely could not claim taxation from me on account of the period  when I was in New South Wales. Thereupon, he sent to me an intimation that the amount of the allowance which I had earned in Victoria was within the statutory exemption of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;12 5</inline> Now I take it that it would be quite as easy to adjust the amount payable to various States in the future as it was in that case in Victoria. There was no trouble. It was very easy for me to ascertain how many days I had been in Victoria: A list of attendances is issued at the end of every session, and, adding one or two more days when I might have been in Melbourne, though not in attendance in Parliament, I was able to make up an account of the time that I had spent in this State. I feel sure, however, that if the Bill were passed, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons&#39;</inline> amendment, it would not be at all what the Victorian Government wants. They want to get at as many members of Parliament as possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> proposes, in effect, to take it outside the category of possibility that the Victorian Government shall obtain income tax from any members of the Federal Parliament except those residing within the State. </para>

            <para>- That has nothing to do with the proportion or the incidence of the taxation. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> appears to be confusing two matters. He says that the law is that Victoria cannot tax the allowances of a member of this Parliament, but, as a matter of fact, the law is that none of the States can tax them. But this Bill will have the effect, according to some authorities, of making taxation payable partly in Victoria and partly in the State of domicile. </para>

            <para>- An obligato to one&#39;s little solo is very pleasant, but the present obligato almost reaches orchestral effects. As I have said, I shall vote against this Bill, and against all proposals to make it more comprehensive, because I have a rooted hatred of the informer -character of income taxation. I have fought it whenever I have had an opportunity in my past life, and I shall continue to fight it. Although I am not liable to income tax, and although the Government of my State has promised the abolition of it there, I desire that the people of the rest of Australia shall, as far as my vote and voice can go, enjoy the same freedom from a hateful impost which is obnoxious to every man who has a mind above grovelling and key-hole legislation. </para>

          <para>. - I have listened with considerable attention to the discussion, and must say, with all respect to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, that his position is not at all clear. I am not sure that as the Bill stands the Victorian Government would not be able to claim taxation from Federal members. It seems to me that they would not only be justified in doing so, but would be incited to come 011 and levy taxation upon the whole of us. No doubt the Bill has been carefully considered by the Cabinet and by the AttorneyGeneral, but I cannot see the scintilla of an exemption so far as the members of thisParliament are concerned. I assume for a moment that the Victorian Government would have power under this Bill to come down upon the members of the Federal Parliament. </para>

          <para>. - I presume that an arrangement between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger and the Minister does not settle the matter altogether. There seems to be a good deal of confusion about it, although the explanation of the VicePresident of the Executive Council made it quite clear to me. The position seems to be that members of this Parliament, by the decision of the High Court, are at present not liable to income tax. The Bill makes them liable under certain condition^ and limitations, which are, so far as members are concerned, that they shall be liable only to the States in which they are elected, whilst residing in those States. The Victorian senators under that provision will be in a position somewhat different from that of senators from other States. As they reside altogether in Victoria, they will be liable for income tax during the whole year, ^whilst senators from other States will be only liable to their States in respect of the period in which they reside in their States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> is still not quite satisfied, and desires to make it still clearer by an amendment. Does he propose to make members liable in the State in which they reside for the whole year, or only for the time that they do reside there? </para>

Victorian senators have certain advantages as a set-off to the position which they will be placed in in this regard, seeing that they are not under the expense which senators from other States have to incur when they reside for a certain part of the year in Victoria. So far as the little extra cost in income tax to Victorian senators is concerned, I think members- from other States would be glad to exchange with them, in order to have the advantage of residing in the State where the Parliament sits. </para>

          <para>.- I have always had two leading thoughts with regard to this Bill - first, that it ought to be only a permissive Bill, allowing the States to tax Federal allowances and sala ries in such a way that we should be subject exactly to the same income tax, with all its incidence and regulations, as other citizens of our own States ; and secondly, that the income tax should be payable wholly to the State which a member represents. &#39; For that reason I shall support . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons&#39;</inline> amendment. Although the clause may mean the same thing, yet, if, the amendment be not made, the Income Tax Commissioners may . raise all kinds of complications under the words &#34;earned within the State,&#34; as to whether a member who is six months out of, say, Tasmania attending the Federal Parliament, helping to make the laws, and earning his salary, has earned it in Tasmania or in Victoria. In order to obviate that difficulty, it would be better to accept the amendment. I am in favour of the whole of the salaries or allowances of members being taxed by the State in which the taxation is .payable. I take it that we are all domiciled in our States for perhaps six or seven months, and residing here for five months. But while I am absent here my home is still in Tasmania. My children may be educated there. I get the benefit of the whole upkeep of the Tasmanian Government the moment I .put my foot on Tasmanian soil. While I am here the Victorian Government gets something out of me on. all I wear or consume. But I deny that they ought to get five-twelfths of my income tax simply because I reside here for five months. </para>

            <para>- At the same time, the Victorian Government began to send out notices to all of us in respect of the money we earned for the whole of the seventeen and a half months of the first session while residing in Victoria. For all that, we were not all domiciled here. I am domiciled in Tasmania. The Tasmanian Government protect me and my property, and I want to pay the whole of my income tax to them, less such exemptions as the law of Tasmania permits to me in common with every other Tasmanian citizen. </para>

          <para>. - I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is quite consistent in making his latter . remarks, after saying that he thought the Bill should be merely permissive. The object of the Bill is to relieve the position that has occurred owing to the decision of the High Court of Australia, and to make the salaries of Federal officers and members  amenable to the taxation laws of the various States. We are asked, however, to go further, by trying to correct the anomalies of the various States Income Tax Acts. We might very well leave the States to arrange those things &#39;themselves, and to deal with members who earn portion of their salaries over here in the same way as with other individuals whose incomes, although taxed in their States, are not entirely earned there, as, for instance, the captains or crews of ships, and commercial travellers. Surely we can leave the States to deal fairly and justly with us as they do with other people in a similar position. It is preposterous that we should be asked to pay income tax in Victoria because Parliament happens to sit here for a few months in the&#39; year, especially in view of the principle that there shouldbe no taxation without representation.We have no representation in the Victorian Parliament, and consequently there is no obligation on us to pay income tax to Victoria. </para>

            <para>- I certainly do not want to do so. The payment of&#163;400 a year that we receive is either a salary or an allowance. It cannot be both. If it  is a salary, then for income tax purposes an allowance ought to be made for suchexpenditure as is incurred in performing the duties of the office of a member of Parliament. What are those duties? I live in Queensland. I am elected to the Federal Parliament, and summoned to Melbourne to attend its sittings. That is portion of my duty as a senator. I am provided by the Commonwealth with a free railway pass to Melbourne, but I do not get any other allowance for expenses. The Commonwealth member of Parliament is placed in a quite different position from the ordinary civil servant. If a Commonwealth civil servant lives in Melbourne and the Government send him to Brisbane on Commonwealth business, he is allowed not only his train fare like members of Parliament, but also an allowance of, say, a guinea a day for expenses. This is in addition to his ordinary income. If our payment of , &#163;400 a year is a salary, then when we are asked by the Commonwealth Government to come from our residences in other States to Melbourne on Commonwealth business, we ought to be treated exactly as are other Commonwealth servants, and given an allowance for expenses. No honorable senator has proposed anything of that kind. Another duty which no member can evade is that of travelling around his own and other States on Commonwealth business. Here, again, he is placed on quite a different footing from other &#34;Commonwealth servants, if his payment is a salary. When other servants of the Commonwealth travel on public business they get their train fare and steamer fare, and also a daily allowance for expenses. I claim, therefore, that if our payment is a salary we ought to get all the allowances that are made to other members of the Commonwealth service. If on the other hand it is an allowance, then we ought for income tax purposes to be permitted to deduct such sums as are spent in doing the business of the Commonwealth. </para>

        <para class="block">We ought to be allowed a sum when we come to Melbourne on Commonwealth business, and when we travel &#39;round the country on such business as we are compelled to do. If there is anything left over and above what is spent out of the allowance in performing the duties of the office, then members of Parliament ought to be subject to taxation on the net amount just as other members of the community are subject to the same sort of taxation. Take, for example, a commercial traveller who receives an annual salary of .&#163;500, and a daily allowance of <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;i</inline> is. for his expenses.

            <para>- An Income Tax Commissioner does not tax a Federal officer on his travelling expenses. If, for instance, a Federal officer receives a salary of ^400, and travels on 200 days in the year with an allowance of one guinea per day, the Income Tax Commissioner does not charge him income tax on the ^210, as that is merely an allowance to cover the expenses. We are in an exactly similar position. The .&#163;400 is not a&#39; salary, because it is not subject to the same conditions as is a salary. It is an allowance for expenses, and ought to be treated in the same fashion as are allowances paid to Federal officers. . Under the Constitution, and in practice, we give our services as members of Parliament for nothing, but we are allowed a sum of ,&#163;400 a year to cover the expenses which we incur in performing our duties. I commend the amendment with confidence to the sense of justice and fair play, which I am sure dominates the mind of every member of the Senate. </para>

On what grounds can we possibly be justified in formulating a scale of exemptions for ourselves? The object of the Bill is to place members of Parliament, so far as allowances and salaries are concerned, on exactly the same basis as other members of the community. Why should we dictate to the States as to how they shall formulate their income taxes, what exemptions they shall allow, and how they shall treat certain members of Parliament?

            <para>- Yes. Suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> resides in Victoria for six months in a year. The proportion of the ^&#163;400 which he earns here is ^200. During that period expenses are being incurred and, properly speaking, should come out of that slim.. But when he gets back to Queensland, the other ^200 will be earned, and the expenses which he incurred here should not be deducted from that sum. That might be the effect <inline font-style="italic">oi</inline> his amendment. Strictly speaking, it is only while he is in Victoria and earning the <inline font-style="italic">-&#163;200</inline> that he should be entitled to make a deduction. When he is at home earning the other <inline font-style="italic">&#163;200</inline> - which alone his State will have the right to tax - why should he be at liberty to deduct from that sum the expenses which he incurred in Victoria, and for which he has already been paid? We, as members of Parliament, are not justified in creating exemptions for ourselves. That is essentially a matter for the States to deal with. It will really be against the dignity of the Legislature to attempt to create privileges for ourselves which other members of the community are not to be- permitted to enjoy. In the circumstances, I urge my honorable friend not to persist in his amendment. </para>

          <para>- - There is one remark made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> which I resent. It was entirely uncalled for. If he had followed my argument he would not have delivered the speech which he did, and he would have seen my position clearly. I said that, instead of trying to create privileges for members, of Parliament which other members of the community did not enjoy, my object was to prevent members of Parliament from being penalized as he proposes they shall be. </para>

            <para>- People will say &#34;This avaricious senator for Queensland wishes to exempt himself from all taxation.&#34; If I deny the statement it will be pointed out that the Vice-President of the Executive Council rose in his place and directly charged me with doing so, and that another senator from Victoria was guilty of the same offence, and, being&#34; found guilt v on the evidence of two such worthy individuals, I shall be sentenced to some punishment. I do not want that to happen. I do not wish to be exempted from&#39; a single farthing of taxation which other members of the community are called upon to bear. I am quite willing to pay income-tax on <inline font-style="italic">ray</inline> net income, but I most decidedly object to be called upon to .pay income-tax on the gross income.- Every one who has been in Parliament for -any time knows that an average member has to spend nearly all his income in getting a seat, attending the meetings of Parliament, and&#39; travelling up and down the country. That is one of the responsibilities of the position. If he does not do so, he will not be a member of Parliament very long, because he will incur the hostility of the electors. If the Minister will make it absolutely clear to me that members of Parliament, can only be charged income-tax on their net income </para>

            <para>- Ordinarily a member of Parliament maintains a home in his own State, while he comes to Melbourne to attend to his parliamentary duties. Will the honorable senator say that he ought not to be allowed to deduct his&#39; living expenses in Melbourne while he is away from home on Commonwealth business, and earning his allowance? Again, the senators from Queensland and some members of the other House have to travel over an entire State. I have to travel over the whole of Queensland, and spend a great deal of money in1 doing so. I have to do that in the interests of the Commonwealth. Am I to incur all that expense, and, in addition, to be taxed on the very money which I have laid out? </para>

            <para>- That is the position in which some honorable senators wish to place members of the Federal Parliament, and, because I protest against it, I am charged with trying to create a privileged class. It only shows how fearful of public opinion a large number of people are, and how, rather than face it manfully as they ought to do, they are willing, not only to submit to injustice themselves, but to impose injustice on others. I wish, before I vote for this clause, to have it made perfectly clear that under this Bill, which gives the States power to fax salaries, which the High Court has declared are not taxable, I shall not have to pay taxation on such money as I spend, so to speak, in earning my income. If that is made clear, I shall be satisfied. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> must know that I neither directly or indirectly reflected upon him in what I said. No one could attach such a meaning to the words I used in seeking to show what would be the effect of the honorable senator&#39;s (proposal. I have, in the meantime, striven to work the matter out in figures. On the scale the honorable senator has suggested, his expenses would amount to an average of something like <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> per week. I assume that he is in Melbourne for six months - during the period of a session.  During that time, of course, he is not liable to this taxation. Half of &#163;400 is&#163;200, and that, therefore, without deductions, would be the amount on which he would be liable for taxation in Queensland.  His  expenses at&#163;5 per week for twenty-six weeks would amount to &#163;130, and, deducting that amount from the&#163;200, &#163;70 would be the balance left on which he would be liable for taxation. I come now to the next feature, and it is that in Victoria, and probably in the other States imposing income tax, a certain amount of income is exempt from taxation. The amount exempted in Victoria is &#163;200, and it would probably be something like that also in Queensland. In these circumstances, there is no possibility of the honorable senator having to pay income tax in the State of which apparently he appears to be so fearful. Assuming that no portion of income were exempt in Queensland the honorable senator, in the circumstances I have described, would be liable for income tax on , &#163;70 only. </para>

I may be mistaken, but I was under the impression that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> intended under the amendment he has suggested that each member of the Federal Parliament should make a return of&#163;400 as his yearly income from this source to the State from which he comes. If that were so, there would be a good deal of force in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> remarks. It must be remembered that under the judgment of the High Court we are not liable for&#39;&#39;income tax. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> says that if we are going to change the effect of that decision we should see that we are not charged income tax on the expenses we incur in living away from our homes. Honorable senators coming from such distant States as Western Australia and Queensland deserve our sympathy in this matter, and I should be disposed, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> amendment were pressed to a division, to vote for it if only to show my sympathy with honorable senators coming from distant States. </para>

          <para>.- When this matter was last discussed I drafted an amendment which was designed to meet certain criticisms that had been levelled at the language employed in the Bill. But after moving it I had a consultation with the Attorney-General, and learned from him that the amendment drafted was open to practically all the objections that might be levelled against the clause in its original form. After further consultation with my colleague I now intend to ask the Committee to pass the clause as it stands, and to allow me to withdraw the amendment. The objection to the clause, so far as I remember, was not so much to what it sought to achieve as to its form. I said at the time that the effect of my amendment would be precisely the same as the effect of the clause. It will be seen that, as we have power to prescribe what are the essentials of a bill of exchange, it is also open for us to say that a bill of exchange shall not be subject to stamp duty in any State except as we prescribe. Another mode of arriving at the same conclusion, which seemed to meet with some approval, was that we should simply provide that a bill of exchange was not to be inadmissible in evidence if it did not bear the stamp of a State. But that indirect method of obtaining our object might lead to some difficulties whilst achieving no better result. We consider, after giving further thought to the matter, that it is better to leave the clause as it stands. In my speech in moving the second reading I pointed out that it is competent for us to provide that a bill of exchange shall not bear any stamp at all, or that a stamp shall not be essential to its validity, or to its admissibility in evidence. But we do not propose any such thing as that. We do not desire that bills of exchange shall be exempt from stemp <inline font-style="italic">duty</inline> altogether. What we do desire, however, is that bills of exchange shall be subject -to one stamp duty only. At present a. bill of exchange may be drawn in one State and negotiated in another, and may, under the laws of the two States, have to bear the duty stamp of the State in which it originated, as well as duty stamp of the State in which it is negotiated. </para>

            <para>- The clause will take away a certain amount of States revenue, but nothing like so much as would be the case if we provided that bills of exchange should not bear stamp duty at all. A small amount of revenue is affected at present. The object of the clause is to make these instruments of commercial transactions more easily negotiable than they are at present - that is to say, to make a bill of exchange drawn in one State negotiable throughout the Commonwealth, instead of being subject to additional taxation when made negotiable outside the State in which it is drawn. Although my amendment wasnot circulated in a printed form, I had formally moved it, and I now ask leave to withdraw it in order that the Committee may have an opportunity of adopting the clause as it stands. </para>

        <para class="block">The object of my amendment is to abolish the taxation of bills of exchange, cheques, and promissory notes. No doubt if the amendment is carried it will mean a loss of revenue to the Treasurers of the States, be- cause they have hitherto been in the habit of raising a considerable sum from these sources. But my object is to place our system of taxation upon a scientific basis if I can. I do not think that industry and the currency ought to be taxed, nor should instruments that are practically tools of trade be subject to taxation. Every one will admit that the taxation of promissory notes, bills of exchange, and cheques is a hindrance to business transactions. A tax on a cheque is practically a tax on the currency. A cheque is given to pay an account in order to save the passing of money. It is practically a labour-saving machine. It is a portion of the currency, and for that reason it ought not to be taxed. Why should any one be called upon to pay a tax of one penny when he signs a cheque in payment of an account? If I pay an account of twenty shillings with a sovereign I am not taxed, but if I hand the shopkeeper a cheque, which is just as good as a sovereign if my bank balance is on the right side, I am taxed to the tune of a penny. Where is the justice in that ? The men who give promissory notes are not the rich, who can get credit. If a poor fellow like myself is not able to pay a debt, his creditor asks for a promissory note for the amount, and the debtor&#39;s poverty compels him to give it. He is immediately taxed, so that instead of being a tax upon wealth, the stamp duty on promissory notes is really a tax upon poverty. A large number of persons engage in business with insufficient capital, or, beginning with a very small capital, their business speedily develops to such an extent that they are compelled not only to give accommodation to their debtors, in which case they may demand promissory notes, but also to get accommodation from their creditors, in which case they, in turn, have to give security. Why should these transactions be subject to taxation? There is no reason except that it has been the custom, and that successive Governments have adopted it as an easy means of raising revenue, apart from any question of its justice or injustice. The Senate ought to seize every opportunity of placing the contributions of the people to the cost of government upon a sound financial basis, and honorable senators should recognise that no basis can be sound which is uncertain. This means of raising revenue is very uncertain, because if money is plentiful promissory notes and bills of exchange become correspondingly rare, and the revenue falls off. A reference to municipal taxation will show the ridiculous system of State taxation that obtains in Australia. Municipalities raise their revenue from property. They assess the ratepayers on the value of their property. </para>

            <para>- That system is also a survival, in many cases. The collecting of money in that fashion ought to be abolished. We ought to remove every impediment to the freedom of trade and industry. No one can deny that the stamping of these documents is an impost on industry. I have shown that the rich escape the tax altogether. A man with  a  small business, issuing a number of small cheques, promissory notes, or bills of exchange is being continually taxed, whereas another engaged in huge enterprises and paying in large sums, rarely dealing in promissory notes in such a way as to have to pay the stamp duty on them, evades the tax. Some honorable senators will claim that my amendment is an invasion of State rights, and an attack on State revenues. I admit that that, in the circumstances, is unavoidable. We are given power by the Constitution to make laws regulating the issue of bills of exchange, cheques, and promissory notes. We have the power to say whether they shall be stamped or unstamped. Having been given power to make the laws regarding these instruments, we ought to assume the whole power, and not merely a part of it. If Parliament thinks they ought to be taxed, then the revenue from them should come to the Federation and not go to the States. I  am,  of course, opposed wholly to their taxation, but if my amendment is defeated, I shall support any other amendment, if such is moved, to reserve the revenue from them to the Federation. The Minister of Home Affairs intimated, when the Bill was previously under discussion, his intention to provide that these instruments should be accepted as evidence in a Court of justice, whether stamped or unstamped. Is that provided for in the Bill as it now stands? </para>

          <para>. - As I have not copies of the various States Acts, will the Minister of Home Affairs tell me whether sub-clause 1 of clause 7 will, as a matter of fact, repeal the provisions that the States have made for taxing bills of exchange, cheques, and promissory notes ? In other words, if the Committee rejected sub-clause 2 of clause 7, would it be necessary also to reject sub-clause 1. ? I suppose it would. </para>

We cannot alter it, and I object to our altering it in a small matter like this. I object to this Parliament saying to the States, whether it knows the details or not, &#34; You do not know how to provide proper taxation on, cheques and bills- of exchange.

            <para>- My answer is that if we endeavour to secure uniformity we shall certainly be telling some States, perhaps the majority of them, that they do not know anything about the proper way in which to tax &#39;bills of exchange and promissory notes. It was never intended by the framers of the Constitution that we should try to rectify every possible anomaly in the various States. It does not give this Parliament the right to say to the States, &#34; There is only one right way in which te* tax bills of exchange and promissory notes, and it is our way.&#34; If we adopt the amendment, I do not know what we may interfere with. I feel certain that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> does not know more about this form of taxation in his State, or the effect which the amendment may have in Queensland or Tasmania, than I do as regards my own State. It is wrong for us to be alwaystinkering with taxation in the States when we cannot face the question thoroughly. We have been informed that the effect of the clause as it stands will be to deprive some States of a certain amount of taxation. Why should we pass it? Why should we say to the States that we know better than they -do how these instruments ought to be taxed? Why should we say it is desirable that the States should receive lessrevenue? The one answer to the inquiry is - to produce uniformity. To what extent will the blessing of uniformity spread ? We all know that if it is a blessing it will only affect a very limited class, in spite of what - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> says. The percentage of persons who deal in these instruments isvery limited. He must know as well as I do that they are almost entirely confined te*  large commercial houses. An ordinary private individual has very little to do with bills of exchange and promissory notes. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator is trying to induce the Committee to believe that it is a good thing that private persons should be floating promissory notes and dealing in acceptances. No matter what a man&#39;s credit may be, it is an utterly bad thing for him to be floating promissory notes. I hate them. I like to pay for an article if I have the money, otherwise I am always prepared to do without it. I admit that the clause is much better than the amendment ; but I shall not be a party to any capricious interference with the rights qf- the States to raise taxation in the way they think fit, where the Constitution enables them to impose that taxation. I intend to vote against the clause. </para>

            <para>- I should naturally expect that, on account of the construction of the Bill.. But I understand that the honorable senator intends to abandon the -question of stamping, and to deal only with these documents as a matter of evidence. If sub-clause 2 is to stand, the honorable senator will receive strong resistance from me. I suggest that it should be deleted. I am anxious to know what modification he intends to propose. I gathered from his remarks that it is to the effect that notwithstanding that a bill of exchange or promissory  note  may not be stamped according to the law of the State- in which it may be required to be produced in a Court, it shall not thereby be rendered inadmissible in a Court as evidence. On a former occasion, I believe he pointed out that, having consulted with the AttorneyGeneral, there was some difficulty even as regards that view of the question. I can quite understand the difficulty which may arise because, constitutionally, we have not the power to interfere with the law which regulates evidence in State Courts for State purposes. Clause &#39;2 raises a very contentious question. I shall resist any attempt on the part of the Commonwealth; Government to interfere with the right of the States to tax in any form. It was suggested from this side, and I think that the suggestion met with support from -the. other side, that it would be a dangerous thing at the present time to interfere with the exclusive taxing power which the States have possessed so far. </para>

          <para>.- I am in favour of the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> because I want the Commonwealth Parliament to assume to the fullest possible extent the trust reposed in it by the people of Australia. When they approved of the Constitution; Bill, they gave this Parliament full, and if we choose to use it, exclusive power to deal with bills of exchange and promissory notes. It_ is known to every one that when the Government introduced the Quarantine Bill in another place, their only authority for doing so was paragraph ix. of section 51 of the Constitution. That contains only one word &#34; quarantine,&#34; which, of course, must be read in conjunction with the prefatory part of the section. In their Bill, the Government propose to take the largest and widest powers in regard to quarantine, both internal and at the ports. I approve of their action. They would have been false to the trust reposed in them if they had not accepted the responsibility with which they were saddled by the people. Our legislative authority, in regard to promissory notes and bills of exchange, is just the same as in regard to quarantine. The people of the Commonwealth have saddled the Government and the Parliament with the responsibility of dealing with those instruments. When we are told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger and others that the Bill is an unwarrantable interference with the rights of the States, I reply that that is not so, because the people of the Commonwealth have deliberately said to the States, &#34;You shall not have the right to deal with this subject. For various and good reasons we give it to the Federal authority.&#34; </para>

            <para>- Exactly. The States were deprived of that right by the people of Australia seven years ago, when, for good and sufficient reasons, it was handed over to the Federal authority. The legislative power was also framed in the Convention for good and sufficient reasons. It was generally recognised that it was extremely desirable to have uniform legislation throughout the Commonwealth in regard to bills of exchange and promissory notes, that the traders in one State should not be handicapped with respect to instruments of trade and commerce as compared with the traders in other portions of Australia. How are we to secure that uniformity which the people of Australia and the framers of the Constitution said we ought to have, unless we accept the responsibility of depriving the States of the right to impose differential taxation? I take it that if this power is left to the States we are bound to have differential taxation in accordance with their differing weeds. One State might be experiencing a financial crisis at the same time that another was in a highly prosperous financial condition, and the State suffering financial stress might turn to these sources of revenue for relief, and exact heavy stamp taxes on instruments which the. people of the Commonwealth have said should not be subject to differential taxation. This power was handed over to the Commonwealth in order to secure uniformity-, so that those who  make  use of these instruments of commerce should not in any particular State be subjected to a handicap. But even though we were to adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> amendment there would be no reason why the States should be deprived of any revenue. The Government, acting as a Committee for this Parliament - and, after all, that is what the Government is - might cause to be made an investigation of the taxes at present levied on these instruments of commerce throughout the States, might strike an average, and impose such a tax as, would enable the Commonwealth to return to each of the States, as we now return surplus revenue, an amount equal to that at present derived by the States from this form of taxation. </para>

            <para>- I prefer to be permitted to judge for myself what I am doing, and I say that I should welcome such a proposal. If we are to undertake the large and varied enterprises which the Government seems inclined to embark on at the present time, and to carry out some more of the functions imposed upon us by the Constitution, I foresee that by-and-by we shall be in need of money. We cannot carry out those functions without relieving the States of expense, and if we do that we shall be justified in using- revenue hitherto enjoyed by the State from the performance of those functions. Is it not a fact that amongst the matters with which it was intended that the Federal Parliament should deal was the question of old-age pensions. How have we discharged our responsibility to the people of the Commonwealth in that respect ? Many old people have died in misery, want, and poverty because of our supineness in the matter, and because we have not had the courage to do the right thing. Honorable senators who are in favour of the establishment of a Federal old-age pension scheme have been against our doing anything in the matter because we have hot sufficient revenue. The reason why we have not sufficient revenue is that we return to the States, under the Braddon section, three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise, and we have gone so far  as to have returned up to the 30th June&#34; of this year very nearly ;&#163;6, 000,000 over and above what we were compelled to return under the Constitution. </para>

            <para>- We could if we chose exercise exclusive powers of taxation and deprive the States of the right to tax these instruments. What we have to consider always is the interest of the Commonwealth as a whole, and the achievement and advancement of that interest with as little friction and as little interference as possible with the individual freedom _ of the States. We should always keep that in mind. That is the Federal spirit. The States are sovereign within certain prescribed lines, and the Federation is sovereign also within certain prescribed lines. In the exercise of our Federal functionsthere will continually arise occasions in which we can, without any derogation of our powers, leave to the States a littlegreater freedom than we need leave to them,, if we chose. Whenever we can do that, we should do it in exactly the same way as we concede to each other wherever we can as a matter of courtesy, good breeding, or good fellowship, some of our own rights. I have no wish to discuss the whole measure, but I wish to say that it is important that the Federal spirit should permeate all our deliberations and all our acts. It is often quite possible to do what is necessary in the interests of the Commonwealth without exercising our powers too rigidly. Of course, if we can only conserve the interests of the Commonwealth by a rigid and complete enforcement of our powers, we must so enforce them ; but then only with regret that the circumstances compel us to do so. </para>

I am with him in his desire to force the Governments of the States, as well as the Commonwealth Government, to adopt a more equitable system of taxation.

I feel that it is incumbent upon me to speak in the interests of those States which are &#34;temporarily suffering in respect of their revenue. I was rather struck by the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> In seconding the amendment he said that he was prepared to go the length of transferring the power of raising taxation from the States Governments to the Federal Government in respect of promissory notes, cheques, and bills of exchange. If that were done there would be no difference so far as the public are concerned. We should simply relieve the States Governments of this particular power of taxation, and should to that extent encroach upon their revenue, whilst there would be no immediate intention on the part of the Commonwealth Government to adopt this particular form of taxation itself. To carry this amendment would be most regrettable from the point of view of some of the States. It would have the effect of intensifying the smouldering* feeling of discontent that at present exists between some of the States and the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- I do not. I am also in agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> in my desire to exercise to the full the powers with which the Commonwealth Parliament and Government are invested. I believe that it is a good thing  for us to exercise those powers which the people have placed in our hands. But it is one thing to have a giant&#39;s strength, and quite another to use it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> may argue that because it is proposed to utilize the full powers of the Commonwealth in regard to quarantine, it is justifiable to exercise our powers to the full in regard to this particular form of taxation. But it ought to be remembered that the Commonwealth has waited seven years before taking action in regard to quarantine. Why was not that power exercised at the outset? </para>

            <para>- I should say that the reason why this power, in common with other powers of the Commonwealth that are still dormant, was not exercised earlier was that it was realized that it was wise policy to introduce the authority of the Commonwealth in various directions gradually, and thus obviate the confusion that might arise from any sudden or rash employment of our power. To carry the amendment would be to bring about an immediate dislocation of the finances of the States. I quite agree that the States Governments should be made to realize that they ought to adopt a more equitable system of taxation than they have at present. But the price that we are now asked to pay for making them take that step is too great. There is need to obviate as much as possible all friction, such as would be caused if the amendment were adopted. I, however, intend to move an amendment, which would have the effect of preventing a form of taxation to which I, in common with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> object, from pressing unnecessarily harshly upon persons who may be unfortunately in a condition of poverty. That object would, I think, be attained by adding a new subclause <inline font-style="italic">d -</inline></para>

            <para>- The purpose of the Bill is a worthy one. It is to secure, as far as possible, uniformity in reference to the instruments of commerce with which it deals. It is desirable that uniformity should be obtained in our business relationships. It is also within our power in dealing with this Bill to lighten the burden of taxation resting on the poor. I fail to see why a duty stamp should be required  on a bill of exchange or a promissory note in the case of a person who, perhaps, has to get his furniture on time payment,, or who has to avail himself of the good will, generosity, or desire to help a fellow man, of some person in more affluent circumstances. </para>

          <para>. - I do not approve of this clause at all. It appears to me that we are unnecessarily depriving the States of revenue. Notwithstanding the philanthropic desires of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> which I appreciate, it would, I think, be an unwise step to take taxation out of one pocket and put it into another. One or two points in connexion with the clause appear to me to be rather strange. A State will be able te tax an English bill of exchange to any extent it likes, but it will not be able to tax a bill between Victoria and New South Wales. It is also a curious fact that thepayee of a bill of exchange is not the person who pays the tax, but the drawer of it. </para>

            <para>- But the clause says that the tax shall be paid in the State in which the bill is drawn. It ought to be paid in the State in which the bill is payable. That is a blot upon the clause which ought to be altered. Similarly, in the case of a promissory note the State in which the note is made is to receive the tax, instead of the State in which the note is paid. Perhaps the Minister will consider whether amendments cannot be made in these directions. </para>

His  suggestion is that, even if we take away from the States the power to impose stamp tax upon promissory notes and bills of exchange, it would still be competent for the Commonwealth Government . to impose similar taxation. He has suggested that the money thus raised could be applied by distributing it amongst the States. </para>

            <para>- If any StateLegislature thought fit to pass legislation which was inconsistent with Commonwealth legislation it would be void and of noeffect. Having the full power to legislate with regard to these instruments, we cam legislate to the effect that so long as they, comply with certain conditions they shall be negotiable throughout the Commonwealth. We can legislate that they shall be producible in evidence in any Court of law or any arbitration proceeding, or at anyhearing. We can legislate to the effectthat no person shall be liable to any penalty under any State law for not complying with any additional requirement that a State law may impose with regard totheir negotiability. Earlier in the debateon this clause, an honorable senator asked me whether sub-clauses 1 and 2 of thisclause were inextricably associated - whether, if sub-clause 2 were negatived, we should also have to negative sub-clause 1. I said, &#34; No.&#34; Sub-clause 1 applies tocertain States Acts, which are set out <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the schedule, and says that they shall not apply to bills of exchange and promissory notes after the commencement of this measure. The reason why the two sub-clauses are separable is this : That the Acts set forth in the schedule are State Acts, which deal with the features of bills of exchange just as decidedly as this Bill does. But they have no relation whatever to the imposition of stamp duty on bills of exchange, promissory notes, or cheques. In each of the States that provision, is made by separate enactment. In Tasmania, it is provided for in the Stamp Duties Act 1882, and subsequent Acts. Under that Statute, which I shall only quote as an illustration of State legislation, inland bills of exchange, and promissory notes not exceeding <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5,</inline> are subject to a duty of 3d. ; exceeding <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> and&#39; not exceeding ^25, 6d. ; and for every succeeding <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2$</inline> or part thereof, an additional 6d., payable by the drawer or payee An inland bill there is a bill drawn and payable in Tasmania, whereas in most of the other States an inland bill is a .bill drawn and payable within the area specified in the- Bill now before the Senate - the whole of the Australian States, Fiji, and New Zealand. The Tasmanian Stamp Duties Act further provides that a foreign bill of exchange shall also be taxable at the same duty as an inland bill of the same amount and tenor. To illustrate the present position, a bill is drawn in Victoria; a stamp duty is imposed on it ; it is subsequently negotiated in Tasmania, and another stamp duty is imposed on it by Tasmania. On the other hand, an inland bill in Tasmania is subject only to one stamp duty, even if it is drawn in the north and negotiated in the west, and the same applies in every individual State. We come down now with a comprehensive measure to define all the features applicable to bills of exchange and promissory notes from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. For the purpose of this measure there is no boundary line between the States. We are legislating in respect of these instruments for the whole of the area comprised within the Commonwealth. We desire that that area shall be regarded as entire and indivisible, just as each individual State has regarded its area heretofore. Is there anything unreasonable in that? Would it not be ari anomaly to- propose anything else? It would be absurd if, after legislating to define all the features and characteristics of bills of exchange for the whole </para>

        <para class="block">Commonwealth, and setting out the conditions as to their negotiability and the responsibilities of the parties concerned in them&#62; applicable to the whole of the Commonwealth, we were then to leave it to each State as a bill came within its borden to impose upon it whatever taxation it liked. It may be argued that this Bill, a.c it stands at present, still leaves it to thf State of origin to impose taxation. But 1 have already pointed out that in all the States the law generally relating to bills of exchange is contained in one measure, and the law imposing stamp duty in another. So far the Commonwealth has not entered upon any species of taxation which resembles the stamp duty taxation of the States. We have no proposal even for such a measure. We have no machinery at present for giving effect to it. If before we had anything of the kind we were to sweep away entirely the powers of the States over these instruments there would necessarily elapse a certain interval during which a considerable amount of revenue would be lost both to the States and the Commonwealth.

            <para>- That could be done just as effectively in the way I have indicated. We should make sure of our hare before we proceed to cook it. If we intend to give effect to the honorable sena-. tor&#39;s suggestion, we should make sure first of a Commonwealth Stamp Duties Act, making these instruments subject to Commonwealth stamp fluty, and then make provision for the use of the resultant revenue either by relieving the States of certain obligations or distributing it amongst the States. <inline font-style="italic">At</inline> the present time State stamp taxation is in operation, and we propose to limit it only in the way indicated in this clause. Some honorable senators have had communications from the Governments of their respective States. We have been informed by one honorable senator that the </para>

        <para class="block">Premier of Tasmania estimates the loss of revenue to the Tasmanian Treasury under the provisions of the Bill as it now stands- at &#163;I,000 per annum, whereas if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> amendment were carried  it would be &#163;10,600 per annum. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has informed us that he has reliable information that the loss to the Queensland Treasury by the abolition of the right to impose taxation upon bills other than Queensland bills would be about &#163;1,000 per annum. The bulk of the revenue derived by the States from this source comes from the taxation of cheques. For instance, the revenue in Tasmania from Inter-State bills is &#163;1,000, from inland bills &#163;1,600, and from cheques &#163;8,000. I assume that these figures will apply proportionately to the other States, although I think that in Western Australia the loss would perhaps be greater. I believe it was estimated that the loss to that State by the carrying of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> amendment would be &#163;18,000 per annum. It is rather hard to determine what the actual loss to Victoria would be. </para>

            <para>- I can quite imagine that it would be. In these circumstances, I earnestly urge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> not to persist with his amendment, which will produce no other result than the dislocation of the States&#39; finances, simply for the possible prospect of getting some of the States to reconsider their fiscal provisions, and re-adjust their taxation on what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> would regard as a more equitable basis. The Bill, as it stands provides that there shall be only one stamp duty imposable upon a bill of exchange or promissory note, and so each of these documents will carry with it throughout the whole of the Commonwealth that Federal feature that is, and should be, most prominent in anything that comes within the scope of Federal legislation. </para>
