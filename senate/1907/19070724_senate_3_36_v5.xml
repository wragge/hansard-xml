                        <para>- Yesterday I received from the Acting Prime Minister, a communication which had been forwarded to him by, I think, twelve new members of the House of Representatives requesting that arrangements be made to enable them at the end&#39; of this week to visit the proposed Federal Capital Sites at Canberra and Dalgety. At the present time, arrangements are in course of progress, and inquiries are being made through the Government of New South Wales, in order that provision may be made for the travelling of those honorable members who desire to visit those localities. The same facilities will be afforded to any members of the Senate , who desire to visit the two sites at that time. I would earnestly ask those who desire to visit the sites, and can do so at the end of this week to supply their names as early as possible to the Government, because it is desirable that the exact number who intend to go should be made known  as soon as possible in order that the necessary arrangements may be made. If the contemplated arrangements in progress are brought to a head, it is proposed that the party should leave Melbourne on Friday next by the ordinary express train for Svdney, and be brought back to Melbourne by the ordinary express train from Sydney reaching here on Tuesday next. If any honorable senators desire to be members of that party, I shall be very glad to have an intimation to that effect from them at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing definite has yet been arranged ; but if there is a number of honorable senators who desire to visit the sites, perhaps they may be able to meet the Government by arranging with the members of another .place to have the visit made on a date which would be convenient to them and the Government. We desire to place no obstacle in the way of any honorable senator who desires to inspect the sites, in order that he may be able to give a vote on any question which may arise concerning the location of the Federal Capital. </para>

                    <para>A week&#39;s work for the linotype operators constitutes  42  hours, whether worked by day or night. This is also the practice in private firms. Those engaged on night duty work more than eight hours per night, but any time over  42  hours is paid for at overtime rates. As compensation for night duty they are paid  10s.  per week extra. </para>
                    <para>Compositors and others on night duty also work more than eight hours each night, but these also receive compensating advantage, as their week&#39;s work consists of  42  hours instead of  47&#189;  hours as worked by the day . staff. Any time, above  42  hours is paid for at overtime rates. These employes do not commence their work till  5.30  p.m. on Tuesday, and a large number of them prefer longer than eight hours to avoid coming in on Monday. </para>

                </para>
                <para class="block">*ax on Commonwealth salaries and allowances - had been dealt with in the ordinary way, separately. I believe that honorable senators will agree with me in that respect when we come to consider them in detail. But as it is the wish of my honorable friend, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, to deal with both&#39; at the same time, and in the same debate, I defer to that wish, and am glad on this occasion to follow his example. At the same time, I may as well mention to honorable senators why it appears to me that it would have been more convenient to deal with the measures :separately. The two Bills are not, it appears to me, correlated in any way  whatever.  They are not the complement the one  of the other. Each is independent of the other. One of these Bills might be enacted or rejected without affecting the other in the slightest degree. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend assents to what I say, but he adds that it is a matter of convenience to deal with them together, as though I were reflecting upon his own desire in that respect. I am not reflecting upon that at all. But I differ entirely from him in the matter of  convenience. The one Bill - the Salaries Bill, as I may call it for shortness - is a Bill to impose taxation upon certain persons or classes of  persons  who have been declared under the Constitution to be exempt from that taxation. The other Bill is one, as I think, to take away powers from States Courts which they already under the Constitution enjoy, and which they were intended to enjoy ; and to that extent, in my view, to impair the status of the States Courts, which the framers of the Constitution were distinctly anxious to preserve. So that the two Bills are really for entirely different - in point of fact, entirely opposite - purposes. And I doubt very much - in fact, I do not suppose that it will be suggested - whether it will be possible, except as regards discussing the two Bills together in one speech instead of two, to deal with the two together in Committee. </para>

                        <para>- Or to -deal with them contemporaneously. Therefore, it appears to me that we are  dealing  with two measures at the same time, which are entirely distinct in their nature and intention, and that .it will be necessary for us ,to apply our minds to each of them separately. Consequently, in the remarks which I propose to offer for the consideration of the Senate, I shall deal with the Bills separately, one following the other. But there are two points of similarity which I desire to indicate. The first is that they probably owe their origin to the same cause. That is to say, in all probability they come before us now in consequence of the same set of circumstances. Another point of similarity is that both of these Bills appear to be the outcome, according to a statement contained in the exceedingly interesting speech which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> delivered, of advice or direction from the members, or some of the members, of the High Court, in consequence of whose decision - without reflecting upon the decision itself - this difficulty has arisen. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> laid great stress upon that in introducing the Bills. In one place, after quoting the advice that was given by the learned Chief Justice in regard to the method of escape from the consequences of his own judgment, he said this- </para>

                    <para>I am referring, of course, to the Commonwealth Salaries Bill. My first answer is that we have the authority of the High Court for enacting it. That is good enough for me, and I think it ought to be good enough for Parliament. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Now, I beg leave to offer the very strongest objection to any such position as that being submitted to any Parliament, or being offered as a justification or excuse for the introduction of legislation into this Parliament which may &#39;be the subject of question and  litigative  action hereafter. It ought not to be good enough for the Government or for Parliament. It is an unusual thing, as, I think, every honorable senator, and certainly every lawyer, will agree, for any tribunal to suggest or advise particular legislation as an escape from the consequences of its own judgment. The duty of a Court is to expound and apply the law  as it is. It has nothing to do with the consequences, whatever they may be. Its duty is solely to expound and apply the law. It is not its duty to recommend legislation to Parliament, to anticipate its own decisions in respect of that legislation, or to do that which may in time - I ask the serious attention of honorable senators to this - become a precedent, and may develop into a direction or a kind of dictation which Parliament would undoubtedly resent. But the great mischief is this : It is obvious that the statement of the Chief Justice is being relied upon by the Executive Government to diminish their own responsibility ; and not merely to diminish their own responsiblity, but it is being used as a prophetic judgment of the Court before whom that challenge of this legislation must, at least may, come to be heard. Now, I say that that sort of thing, if permitted, would be disastrous to our judicial system. I regret the suggestion for another reason also. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> in another connexion used the expression <inline font-style="italic">obiter dictum.</inline> This is worse than any <inline font-style="italic">obiter dictum.</inline> It is a pronouncement which is not binding even upon the learned Judge who used the words, and took upon himself to give the advice. When even he himself has this challenge brought under the notice of the Court it will be for him, irrespective of what he has previously said, to consider the arguments that are addressed to him, and to come to a conclusion upon those arguments, and- upon the view submitted as to whether or not this measure infringes the Constitution - whether it is valid or whether it is not. Can he do that now with an open mind ? But we have another learned Judge saying most distinctly that as to one of these points he does not agree, and as to another point he reserves his opinion. What a position members of this Parliament are asked to put themselves in ! They are invited to disregard the constitutional objections which may arise in their own minds, and solve the doubt as to the authority of Parliament to legislate in this particular way, on the ground, as my honorable friend put it, that a Judge without argument and gratuitously, has already offered an opinion as to the validity of this prospective legislation. I deeply regret that suggestion. I shall not say that we ought to resent it, because I do not wish to use any words of that character, but it is a humiliating position for this Parliament to be placed in if the question arises for our solution, and we are to say that we can pass this proposed law, whatever doubts we may ourselves entertain, because a Judge or Judges, without argument, have expressed the opinion that we have authority whilst other Judges take the contrary view. On this, I would add that if there is one thing plainer than another in connexion with the Supreme Court of the United States, it is that that exalted tribunal will not give any abstract opinion, that it declines to give any prophetic opinion, and that it will not decide any question, constitutional or otherwise, unless it comes before it in a concrete shape, in the form of a lawsuit between parties who happen to be affected. I say that is a fine rule. Honorable senators and I are concerned in this matter. We may or may not &#39;feel that as we are immune from State taxation in respect of our allowances, they ought to be, by some such legislation as is now proposed, made subject to that taxation, and if so, are1 we to be prevented or intimidated from challenging this measure and claiming the right to argue the whole question before the Privy Council or the Judges of the High Court who may have to determine it, by reason of an anticipatory expression of opinion that was not called for in any way whatever by the circumstances of the case? The two points to which I have referred are the only points of similarity between the; two Bills now before the Senate - that they were the outcome, I shall not say probably, but without any doubt, of the same set of circumstances, although they relate to totally different matters, and that the doubts of Parliament as to our competence to pass valid Acts taking away this immunity from persons declared to be free of this particular taxation under the Constitution, are to be removed by an anticipatory judgment, without hearing, parties, without argument, and without that consideration which is essential to the adequate administration of justice, volunteered by one or more Judges who may hereafter have this very question before them for argument and decision. I do not think that many of the questions which have been alluded to, as to the powers of appeal and so on, arise for our consideration now. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> discussed them at great length, and dealt with a multitude of citations relative to the! powers of appeal and so on, but with these, except in so far as they have a bearing, and no very important bearing, on matters involved in these two. Bills, I do not think it is necessary to deal. But I wish to make it clear that I do not at all assent to the proposition my honorable friend has put forward in his interesting address. The honorable and learned senator referred tq the question of the conflict of law. That there is a conflict no one can doubt, but I do not think it arises quite in the way which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> supposes. The awkward, I will not say intolerable, position, is in my judgment not due to the Privy Council, but rather to the High Court. To whoever it may be due, I must say that I do not agree with the following statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best-</inline></para>

                <para class="block">I venture to think that Parliament has not that responsibility at all. If Parliament could do it, that would be another matter, but we have the authority of the Chief Justice of the High Court himself, for saying that the powers of appeal to the High Court do not arise from or depend upon the Judiciary Act at all, which is the work of Parliament, but depend on and arise from the Constitution, with which Parliament cannot deal by means of an ordinary Act.

                <para>That is not the question. I venture to say that there is no such conflict at all. I have seen no evidence in anything that has taken place of a conflict of that character.

                    <para>We find that what we regarded as the High Court, whose duty it was to decide on the questions I have indicated is not the sole and final arbiter ; on the contrary, the Privy Council has asserted that it has certain powers, with the result that we have now . two final Courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction to deal with the same subjects. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Now the Privy Council has not asserted anything of the kind. It has decided a matter brought before it in the ordinary way of litigation, and which was considered by the Judge who sent it there, and by the Privy Council, to be a matter within its competence, and on which it could decide - a matter which was not an appeal from the judgment of the High Court under section 74 of the Constitution at all. The Privy Council dealt with that matter, believing and declaring that it was - as I think it was, though that does not amount to anything except that we are all entitled to express our own opinion&#39; - a matter as entirely within the competence of the Privy Council as any other question that might come before it. The Privy Council, without seeking to diminish by one iota the high status and functions of the High Court of Austria, decided that question, and if I may say so, decided it, in consonance, at any rate with the universal feeling of Australia that justice was done. </para>

The Privy Council is not to be subordinate to the High Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> says that they overrode the law, but if the High Court gives an expression of opinion or a decision on a matter with which it is competent for the Privy Council to deal there is no overriding of the law if the Privy Council differs in opinion from the High Court. </para>

I say that the question now before us is not as to whether the High Court is or is not the sole and final arbiter of the Constitution, or whether the judgment of the Privy Council has destroyed  that position, in the words which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> made use of in a later part of his speech, and which I think ought to be dissented from - </para>

                <para class="block">I say it has done nothing of the kind, and if it did I say that the whole of that is irrelevant. It might influence or inflame our minds to deal with it as a relevant case, but even if that be so, neither of the Bills before us will alter the position. In fact the Bill with regard to salaries, as I hope to show in a word or two, is an affirmation of the judgment of the Privy Council. It declares, in effect, that the judgment of, the Privy Council is just, that there should be no exemption and no immunity. I do not say at present whether there ought or ought not to be, but is not that what the Bill says? Is not&#34; that what we in this Parliament are called upon to do? It is not the judgment of the Privy Council that affects the status of the High Court. It is this Bill. It is this Bill which -says &#34;You, the High Court, decline to follow the opinion of the&#39; Privy Council, which is consonant with what the community as a whole believe to-&#39; be just. Parliament says that it should* be followed.&#34; That is the effect of this&#39; Salaries Bill, and, therefore, we may  well  ask what is it that, to use again the language of my honorable friend the Vice-&#39; President of the Executive Council, &#34; has destroyed the status of the High Court as-&#39; an integral part of our Constitution, unsettled the respective powers of the Commonwealth and the States, and destroyed! the finality of the High Court&#34; ? According to my honorable friend, it is the judgment which we now, by this Bill, are asked to affirm. It is the most novel situation; I have ever heard of. If the Government had asked us to pass a Bill to confirm* the judgment of the High Court, if such a thing had been possible, that in all probability would have been consistent. </para>

                        <para>- I think we will leave <inline font-style="italic">Dred Scott</inline> out of it at: present. I do not want to import more &#39; American notions into this than I car* help. My honorable friend has rather&#39; misunderstood the point which I have been, putting, and that is - I think he will agree with me - that the position as put to us by the Government is either that the High&#62; Court is right and the Privy Council wrong, or that the High Court, having the power, has decided wrongly, and1 the Privy Council, not having the power, &#39; has done justice, and we are asked by an Act of this Parliament to adopt the decision of the Privy Council, and reject the decision of the High Court. If that be so,  I venture to think that it is a very strong: argument for saying that instead of restricting the avenues of access to the Privy Council, we ought to widen them. Still,, that is not the question before us. I lis- &#39;tened with very great interest to the speech of my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, and to his account of the history of the appellate provisions of the Constitution. I shall give a short version of that history &#39; myself, which does not run quite together with the version which my honorable friend gave. History, &#39;of course, is very often&#39; surrounded with a considerable haze, and the haze&#39; lends enchantment at times to the_ history. My honorable friend&#39;s version of the history had a good deal of that poetical haze about it. This increased its attractiveness, but what it gained in attractiveness, I fear it rather lost in accuracy. &#91; will put the history very shortly, and I think my honorable friend will see from what  I state as an actor in those events that the Convention at any rate proceeded upon principles which were a little different from those which he inferred from the actual results. </para>

                        <para>- In some features there is not very much difference between us. We need not dwell long upon that, because this proposed legislation is not to settle difficulties at all between the relative powers of the two Courts. Those powers are not in controversy before us now. I say these things as a kind of apology to honorable senators for not following in detail some of those matters with which they are quite as familiar as I am. We are not re-adjusting the powers of appeal. We are not asked here now for any reason to limit the powers of one tribunal or to extend the powers of the other. If we were asked, of course we could not do it, because those powers themselves depend upon the Constitution, and not upon any Act of this Parliament. It is of less moment again, because, as I have ventured to say already, the just and legitimate scope and status of the High Court under the Constitution is not, in my judgment, imperilled at all. The reason of that i&#39;s that the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court is given by the Constitution and not by the Judiciary Act, and is removed in that way from our interference. In very shortly stating the bit of history that may be material in connexion with these two Bills, I wish to say, first, that there is no sacred halo or mystery about the jurisdiction of the High Court. People are very often in the habit of using language in connexion with the High Court as though it were a mysterious or sacred body. It is nothing of the kind. Its functions; under the Constitution are simply those of a court of law to decide cases. Our Constitution is an Imperial Act of Parliament, assented to by the three Estates of the Realm - the King, the Lords, and the Commons - in the same way as the Acts of the Commonwealth are assented to by the King through his agent, the Governor-General, the Senate, and the House of Representatives, and in exactly the same way as the Acts of the States are assented to by the King, . through his representative, the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council. The High Court, under our Imperial Act of Parliament, which we rightly, describe as the Constitution, is simply a court of law created to decide cases, with certain limitations as to appeals to the superior tribunal of the Empire, the Privy Council, just as there are other limitations upon appeals, such as the limitation of amount, and the limitation that security, differing in kind according to the nature of the case, must be given. All those are limitations, and there are other limitations upon the power of appeal under our Constitution, but the Privy Council is still the ultimate Court of Appeal of the Empire. It is still the highest Court of the Empire. _ I wish to say here most emphatically that the Privy Council is a most august and learned tribunal, worthy of standing, as it does now, not even second to the House of Lords, in the foremost position among the tribunals of the Empire of which we are a part. There was undoubtedly a time, a good many years ago, when the position pf the Privy Council was different from what it is now. But the Privy Council to-day, so far as regards its <inline font-style="italic">-personnel</inline> for the adjudication of cases, is absolutely as great a Court as - I am not sure that it is not, for reasons which I need not enter into now, a greater Court than - the House of Lords. Whether we differ from it or not, I think we shall all agree that no Court need hesitate for a moment to follow, or think that its dignity is impaired or its usefulness lessened by following, the decision of such a tribunal. Most jealous as I am of the powers of our own Court - and I want to show that the provisions as they now stand in the Constitution are not those to which I assented - I think that the judgment delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins in the recent case of the <inline font-style="italic">Commissioner of Taxes of New South Wales</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Baxter,</inline> to which free allusion has been made, contained a sound, wise statement of the constitutional position of the High Court of Australia. It is a mistake, which is not calculated to strengthen its powers or to enlarge its capacity for exercising the great functions reposed in it, that efforts in any direction should be made to alter that:  position or place it on the .same footing, which it does not occupy under the particular terms of our Constitution, as the Supreme Court of the United States. One radical difference - I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins referred to it or not, but I think we ought all to be indebted to him for his exposition of that particular point - is that the status of the High Court is simply that of a court of law, created by an Imperial Statute, and dispensing justice as any other court might, but with a further limitation of the rights of appeal to the higher and superior tribunal. There is a radical difference from the position of the United States Supreme Court under the Constitution in this respect : that that Court - and all of us who had to do with the framing of the Constitution recognised the fact - literally stands for the King under our system. It is not necessary to make a qualification for the purpose of the views I am submitting. As the Privy Council pointed out, and as is apparent to every one, the Congress of the United States legislate as they please, uncontrolled by the States, and the States legislate uncontrolled by the Federal authority. There is no King who is part of the system as there is under the British Constitution. The King is a part of the legislative authority under our system. No Bill of this Parliament, or of a State Parliament is worth the paper it is printed on without the assent of the King or his representative. That is not so in the United States, where each State legislates as it pleases. Owing to that gap, so to speak, there was no controlling power over the States, and the only power that could fill the gap was some such body as the Supreme Court of the United States with power to interfere as widely as it thought fit with the legislation of both the Federal Congress and the States. The essential radical difference is that, the one is a republic and the other is a monarchy. We are simply a part of a monarchy, and in the Convention we sought to the best of our ability to assimilate as far as we could the position, but as we recognised over and over again absolute assimilation was impossible, because we could not get absolute assimilation between republican and monarchical institutions. That is one radical and fundamental difference in the two situations which ought to be remembered, and which in one aspect was dwelt on by the </para>

Let me anticipate for a moment another matter, which has been referred to more than once, and which, has been widely canvassed, and that is, the so-called interference by a State with the conduct of the Commonwealth Government. Such a thing could not be tolerated. We have first - it is like the adage to  first  catch the hare - to show that there is some interference. For example, if a Bill were passed by a State Parliament professing to take control  of the fortifications within the State, of course it would not be assented to for a moment. With us it is a case of one King. That particular part of the legislative power of the whole of the British Empire is common to Commonwealth and to State. We must be sensible beings when  Ave  are dealing  Avith  these things, and we cannot assume for a moment that that particular part of the legislative  power  of the Commonwealth  would  assent to an interference  Avith  the  power  of a State Government </para>

                        <para>- That is, as I am venturing to point out, where the High Court does not come in. What I am pointing out is that under our Constitution, although there are implications from the words, of course, there is no scope, to such an extent, for such a doctrine as  was  invented in America. There is no need for it, and  we  must remember that that implied prohibition is not a prohibition implied from  words  in the Constitution. It is something altogether outside the Constitution. In the Constitution there are no words from which we are to imply - -that is one kind of implication. We get certain words which express something, and carry with them a certain implication, but this prohibition is a separate and independent doctrine which was framed or invented to meet a situation in the &#34;United States, which is not paralleled under our Constitution. But it is not necessary to dwell upon it. I think it is a far-fetched and fantastic doctrine, certainly as applied here. Still, they have it in America, and have followed it. We do not need such a doctrine here. I do not wish to canvass the judgment of the High Court in that respect at all, but only desire to point out the difference between the two systems, and the two Constitutions, and to show that it does not follow that because it was thought necessary in America to create this doctrine of implied prohibitions- </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it does not follow that because it was thought necessary in America to create the doctrine of implied .prohibitions or implied powers to the extent which they did, it would be equally necessary or equally proper to introduce it under our quite different monarchical system of government. Remembering that radical difference, I now refer to the position of these provisions. First of all, the language of section 74 of the Constitution is not that of the Convention. I shall show what language it is. Whatever ambiguity or confusion, if any, or difficulty of application there may be in connexion with that language it is not due to the Convention. In the next place - remembering, as &#39;I have ventured to submit from my point of view, that the High Court is simply a Court of law under an Imperial Act of Parliament, with it may be an additional limitation on appeals; remembering that, what we strove to do in the Convention, and what I particularly wished, was to have a much stronger limitation on the appeals - it was never dreamt for a moment that owing&#34; to the particular position of the Constitution we could deal with the High Court in any other way than as a Court of law created by an Imperial Act. But we desired very greatly to increase the limitations on the power of appeal to the superior court - the Privy Council - and we wished to do it to the entire exclusion of appeals in all domestic or Australian national affairs. </para>

                        <para>- Irrespective of everything. I shall show the extreme length to which I was prepared to go, and to .which we did go. I thought then, as now, that there were only two courses to prevent difficulty and trouble. One was to permit unrestricted appeals, or to practically end them. The view of the Judiciary Committee of the Convention, of which I had the honour to be  chairman,  was that any middle course was calculated to lead to trouble, that if we were to put in qualifications, the more we put in the more we should leave matters to be determined by some tribunal, and it was diK cult to distinguish which tribunal should determine them. Under section 74, as it now stands - without pronouncing a positive view one way or the other about it - it is difficult to see which Court, under the terms of the Constitution, is to determine the question of when a dispute is a dispute as to constitutional powers <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> between Commonwealth and State. That power is a preliminary matter. It has not been vested in the High Court, not in express terms. If a matter comes before the Privy Council, they take the view that it is not a dispute as to limits <inline font-style="italic">inter se,</inline> or that it is not a judgment of the High Court as to limits <inline font-style="italic">inter se,</inline> it is difficult to see why they should not. Or they may say it is a matter between the Commonwealth and a State as to limits <inline font-style="italic">inter se,</inline> or that only such disputes as these are precluded from going before the Privy Council when they arise on a judgment of the High Court. All these matters arise on language which has been used, and which, unlike the language which was used in the Convention, lends itself to differences and controversies in the way I have suggested. Therefore I think that honorable senators will agree with the Convention, at any rate will agree with its Judiciary Committee, that in dealing with this matter it was better either to have unrestricted appeals, subject only to special leave, which is a mere matter of regulation, or to practically put an end to them. I also wish to say that the broad ground upon which it was desired to do that - although discussion took place, and in the heat of the argument things were said and  unsaid - was not because of any inferiority, or any suspicion of the kind, in respect of that great Imperial tribunal, the Privy Council as now constituted, but because we were endeavouring to take the first step in Australia towards union and nationhood, and we considered that it was right as an attribute of the nation which we were seeking to establish that it should dispense final justice to its own citizens. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend quite rightly reminds me that the clause was carried against the views of some of the members of the Convention. But the broad ground upon which it was carried was that we were elevating ourselves - elevating Australia - into the position of a nation. That was the great inspiration we had; and one of the first things which we considered that we ought to try to do, was to dispense our own justice finally. I say that because of certain remarks which I regret should have been made by the Chief Justice of the High Court, reflecting upon the Privy Council, and attributing to us in the Convention reasons for the course that we took, which were not the real fundamental reasons upon which we. acted. Following out that plan, and on that basis, the Judiciary Committee of the Convention at Adelaide, and again at the beginning of the session in Melbourne, recommended a clause in the following form&#39; - </para>

                <para>That swept away the right of appeal from a Court of a State and from the High Court, in that particular class of matters. But then the clause passed on to the Drafting Committee, of which two of the present Justices of the High Court were members. Strangely enough, the Drafting Committee altered it so that it no longer extended to appeals from the Supreme Courts of the States1. It left appeals direct from the States Courts&#39; to the Privy Council just as before. I think that was an accident. I will not say of the distinguished men who were members of that Committee that what they did was careless, or anything of that kind, but it was unfortunate. These matters only came before the Convention a day or two - if so much - before the Convention broke up. Then my honorable and learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> rose to point out the grave alteration with a view to having it rectified. But at that stage, when a large number of the members of the Convention had departed, for their homes, to have re-opened the question on these so-called drafting amendments would probably have imperilled the work which the Convention had done. It might have imperilled the Bill altogether. An alteration was deprecated ; it was not made ; and so the clause appeared in the Bill as submitted to the referendum in this shape. It was the celebrated clause  74 - </para>

                <para>Honorable senators are aware that when that clause, as I have read it, and as it was carried at the referendum by the people of Australia, went to England, and the Bill containing that .provision went before the Imperial Executive and the Imperial Parliament, art attack was made upon* it. That attack was in order that it should be, if not struck out, at least so altered that an unrestricted power of appeal should be preserved. An alteration was made, and no one gave greater &#39; assistance to the attack that was made on that provision as assented to by the people of Australia, than the present Chief Justice of the High Court of </para>
                <para>Australia himself. It has to be remembered that, no doubt rightly, according to his judgment, every effort was made by him, occupying at the time a very elevated position, as he does now, in order, as many of us thought, to thwart the wishes and intention of the people of Australia in regard to this right of appeal, and to preserve the appeal to the Privy Council which has now apparently been found inconvenient. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. I do not wish to dwell upon that now. The efforts to which I refer were made, I am sure, in the belief that they were justified, and that the Privy Council was a great Court adequate to the determination of all these questions. I have no reason to doubt that they were made because of a belief that the Privy Council was an august and learned Court, more competent, in the judgment of the persons making these efforts, than any Court that could be constituted in Australia. _I did not agree with that view, but I attribute to those who made those efforts a belief that the Privy Council was a Court with sufficient knowledge of the laws of Australia and of the Empire, to do justice in respect of any such appeal. It is, therefore, with great pain, and with some astonishment, that I read the opinions that are now expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith about this tribunal to which he, seven years ago, thought all these appeals should go. I find, in the judgment which has been alluded  to in Baxter&#39;s case, disparaging attacks made upon the Privy Council, which I think ought to have been avoided.

                        <para>- Yes. I take exception to that statement, and I can speak from personal knowledge. I have lately been in Canada, and I found, because I made inquiries on the subject, that there is there the greatest satisfaction with the appellate jurisdiction of the Privy Council. That does not affect the principle for which I have always contended, that is to say, the principle bf a National Court. I know that Bourinot, the great constitutional writer in Canada, has eulogised the decisions of that Court over and over again, and has attributed to the decisions of the Privy Council - because we must be fair - a beneficent effect in soothing the susceptibilities and overcoming the racial differences, as I may call them for want of a better term, arising from legislation on different matters, between the two different races which inhabit Lower Canada.. There is, therefore, no warrant for the statement I have quoted. The Chief Justice of the High Court went on to say - but also that the Constitution of the United States was a subject entirely unfamiliar to English lawyers, while to Australian publicists it was almost as familiar as the British Constitution. It was known that even if there should be any members of the Judicial Committee familiar with the subject - </para>

                <para class="block">What a condescension that is - it was quite uncertain whether they would form members of a Board that might be called upon to determine a question on appeal from an Australian Court, by which it must necessarily be dealt with in the first instance.. It could not be predicted of the Board which would sit to entertain an appeal that it would be constituted with any regard to the special familiarity of its members with the subject. </para>

Was this known when all those efforts were made to secure an unrestricted right of appeal to the Privy Council, or has  this  doubt arisen only now, when, to use the expression employed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, there is a jealousy of the interference of the Privy Council with the jurisdiction of the High Court. </para>

                    <para>It is said that such a state of things as would follow from a difference of opinion between the Judicial Committee and the High Court would be intolerable. It would not perhaps have been extravagant to expect that the Judicial Committee would recognise the intention of the Imperial legislature to make the opinion of the  High  Court final in such matters. But that is their concern and not ours. </para>

            <para class="block">It was not the intention of the British Legislature, but the intention of the people of Australia that was in question - was to substitute for a distant Court of uncertain composition imperfectly acquainted with Australian conditions, unlikely to be assisted by counsel familiar with those conditions, and whose decisions would be rendered many months, perhaps years, after its judgment had been invoked, an Australian Court, immediately available, constant in its composition, well versed in Australian history and conditions, Australian in its sympathies, and whose judgments, rendered as the occasion arose, would form a working code for the guidance of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- Perfectly so in the Convention. The views of the Convention, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> interjection reminds me were broad-based upon a national administration of justice, were sought, and sought successfully by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, to be undermined by views which could not&#39; have been the views to which I have just referred if the efforts which were made were, as I am bound to believe they were, conscientiously undertaken. That is the short history of this provision. With its re- adjustment, its extension, or limitation, we are not now concerned. We have, as a result, several decisions of the High Court, and a decision of the Privy Council, and we are asked to do something, not to settle the possibility of a difference of that sort occurring again, but to give effect to judgments of a kind which are described as being not altogether in sympathy with Australian aspirations. We are asked to do something which shall give effect to the judgment of men who are described by the High Court as not being in sympathy with Australian aspirations, or with what I may call the sense of justice of Australia - and to legislatively declare it is the judgment of the Privy Council and not that of the High Court which is in conformity with the universal sense of justice in Australia that there shall be no privileged class in respect of this income taxation. It is certainly an extremely odd position, but that is where we are. How is it to be met ? This Bill says that a State cannot tax its own citizens or a certain class of them without the consent of the Federal Parliament, and it professes to give that consent. It is a very serious inroad, I venture to say upon - I do not want to use that much abused term &#34; States rights &#34; or anything like it, and in any case I do not think that defines what I mean - but upon what we have always regarded as a principle of self-government, that a State should be entitled to tax its own citizens. That is the plain simple way in which I view this question. One would expect to find something expressed in the Constitution to justify our assuming a right to interfere between the State and its citizens. We should, however, look for something expressed to enable this Parliament to make liable to taxation persons whom our High Court has said the Constitution exempts from liability. The situation itself is shortly this : The High Court decided in the cases of Deakin and Lyne that State citizens receiving salaries from the Commonwealth were exempt from State income tax in respect of such salaries; in fact, that the taxing power of a State over itS own citizens was paralyzed so far as regarded that portion of their property or income which consisted of salaries drawn from the sacred fountain of the Commonwealth Treasury. It was not denied that the Commonwealth servants  are citizens&#39; of the State in which they reside, receive the protection of the Government of that State, and share its benefits like all other citizens, yet, according to the judgment, they are to do so without paying one penny for it so far as the &#39; income tax is concerned. They pay for their food and their raiment, and there would seem to be no more reason in justice or principle why they should not pay their share for their police protection than for the other things they require in the State. The one is just as essential to the necessities of humane or civilized life as the other. </para>

                    <para>- There is free education in all the States, and if there is only an income tax Federal public servants do not contribute towards the expenses of the education of .their own . children, if they send . them to the, State schools, simply because they happen to draw their salaries from the Commonwealth Treasury. I do not canvass these judgments at all ; we are not here for the purpose ; we are not  a  Court of Appeal, to say who is right or who is1 wrong; but we are here to look upon this matter as plain men, and I say that not merely is that the position to the plain man in the street, but it creates what I think, every one of us in these liberal days, detests -  a  privileged class set down in our midst. I do not wonder that at the time this decision caused considerable sensation. It shocked, as it might well do, the good sense and the sense of&#34; justice of the community. There is another thing that the plain man in the street may remember in this connexion. The technical view that has been taken overlooks the fact that there is  a  dual citizenship ; that everyone of us is  a  citizen of the Commonwealth, but that we are also citizens of the particular State to which we belong. </para>

                    <para>- I agree with my honorable friend that it has been overlooked. The State citizenship is not taken away because we are citizens of the Commonwealth. It is by virtue of our State citizenship that we are liable to State taxation. If I chose to draw  a  salary, or it might be fees - but I do not suppose I could, as lawyers who are members of Parliament are not allowed to draw fees from the Commonwealth - or if some other member of the profession who is not in Parliament, and so is more fortunate than I  am in  that respect, were to draw fees from theCommonwealth,&#39; would those fees be exempt from taxation ? It would be  a  most grateful&#39; thing to the profession if they were, and&#39; indeed that must be so, if &#39; they are to be exempt as emoluments, because such  a  man is, I suppose,  a  Federal instrumentality just  as  much as an ordinary Civil servant. These people are liable by virtue of their State citizenship, but then it is said that because their means of living come from the Commonwealth Treasury, they are not to be liable in respect of that  money  Without discussing the matter from the technical or legal point of view, with which we are not concerned, it is liberally making-  the State Treasury pay for .what the citizen, whether in regard to education or anything else, should pay for himself. </para>

                    <para>- Precisely so. He is taxed in respect of his income like any of the rest of us in the State, and it is an extraordinary thing to me that that income after it reaches his hands - he receiving the protection of the State in respect of his individuality - should be exempt from taxation simply because it comes but of the Commonwealth Treasury. </para>

                    <para>- I am glad to have these objections raised, because we want to elucidate this problem as much as we can, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has put his finger on the fatal defect. You could not predicate it of any Legislature, or of that portion of the Legislature which is also a portion of our Legislature - the King. It is of no practical moment to us to imagine the possibility of a state of things happening which would lead to the entire disruption of the Empire. </para>

                    <para>- I, as a lawyer, think that the decision in <inline font-style="italic">Mcculloch</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Maryland</inline> has been given undue weight in the consideration of these matters. The State having the power to tax its own citizens - a power undiminished and unaffected by the Constitution - and these persons being its own citizens and having an income, however derived, which gets into their hands and then loses the glamour attaching to Commonwealth money, we should expect something in. the Constitution to prevent their taxation if that were intended. In the Constitution there is nothing forbidding such taxation. All the State powers are conserved, except those which are expressly taken away. There is nothing, so far as I can see, to take away from a State its power to tax its own citizens. TIle Constitution is an Act of Parliament, and is to be construed like every other Act of Parliament. That is the view which was taken, and if I may say so with all deference, rightly taken by the Chief Justice in the Tasmanian case, in which, in answer to an argument which was being put by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> he said - </para>

                was contending for inferences, and so on, in connexion with a claim which was made by Tasmania to some Customs duties collected in Victoria, and the Court then supported the argument that there is no clear intention in the Constitution that duties shall go to the State of consumption. I hold that in the Constitution there is no expressed intention that the citizens of the States shall not be taxed in respect of moneys they receive from the Commonwealth as well as other moneys. Again, in giving judgment, the Chief Justice said -

                <para>We were invited by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> to apply in construing the .Constitution some higher rule of construction, to look beyond the letter of the Constitution. </para>
            </quote>
            <para class="block">The Court declined to look beyond the letter of the Constitution in that case. Why should it not have equally declined to look beyond it in such a case as the one under discussion ? The Court rejected the opinion that the ordinary rules for considering Acts of Parliament do not apply to the Constitution. Perhaps honorable senators will agree that that is a fairly sound view to take. But, instead of that being done, we had imported from America this doctrine described by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs, when at the Bar, as a doctrine of implied prohibitions invented by Chief Justice Marshall. I do not want to discuss that, except to say that it does not mean, as I gathered <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger thought, an implication derivable from the language of the Constitution. This is a doctrine invented, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs said, at that time, or really evolved from the judicial consciousness, in order to meet what was considered to be a particular defect in relation to the American Constitution, which, otherwise it was supposed, and probably rightly so, could not be met. But it was a doctrine altogether outside the written Constitution, and it was exten&#39;ded here to the Public Service as an instrumentality. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> venture humbly to agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins said - that this tax involved no interference in any respect with the efficiency in the discharge of their duties of the Commonwealth public servants. It was not directed against them in any way, and I cannot do better than read two or three words <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs uttered near the end of his judgment, and to which I am unable to add anything better, taking the broad view which he did, which, I think, will commend itself to all of us - </para>

                <para>But the State Act touches no function of the officer, it intrudes its operations into no public act that he performs, it affixes no condition, and imposes no qualification upon the discharge of his duties, it makes no demand upon his public time, and seeks no service at his hands; it merely requires of him his just share of the ordinary burden of his fellow citizens in return for the protection and benefits the State affords him. If this be so, the Statute attacked in each case has not intruded into the exclusive domain of Commonwealth executive action, it has not invaded the powers, interfered with the means, or interrupted the operations of the central Government, and, therefore, should, in my judgment, be declared to stand as a valid exercise of State legislative authority. </para>

            <para class="block">That, I venture to submit, is not the question as it would commend itself to most of us. The question really is : Can the&#39; Commonwealth, or is there anything to enable the Commonwealth to, without express power in the Constitution, give immunity to any individual or class of State citizens from the lawful taxation, by the State, of its citizens? Putting aside the law, with which we cannot deal; putting aside technical interpretations and the consideration of cases to which much reference has been made, and with which we cannot deal ; and looking at it from the broad point of view as citizens of the Commonwealth, and as citizens of our respective States, I venture to say that the answer to that question must be &#34;No; the Commonwealth cannot do anything of the kind.&#34; </para>

                    <para>- My honorable friend is always acute. That is so, and that is one of the defects of this-&#34; particular measure. If the individual is not immune, then he is not immune as to the past, and as to the position up to the present date we are still left to face the difficulty which has arisen. There is this further point, that if the Bill is merely of that character - partial - the question is whether, from that point of view, it is one that we can safely pass. </para>

                    <para>- From my point of view, I see no difficulty. I think that the difficulty arose on the decision in the cases of Deakin and Lyne, when the High Court declined to give special leave to appeal to the Privy Council. Look.ing at the nature of the inquiry, and at the fact that every person in the Public Service of  the Commonwealth, from the. Judges themselves - even the Governor-General, because I see that- he is to be expressly exempt under the Bill - down to the humblest official whose salary would come within the ambit of a State income tax, was affected, I venture to think that it would have been wise, on that wide ground alone, to have had the matter referred to a tribunal which was not in the Commonwealth, and which was altogether independent, for ultimate decision. I think that, probably, if that had been done it would have saved the whole of this trouble, and no question would have been raised as to the propriety or otherwise of the High Court bowing to the decision of the Privy Council. Of course, I am not prepared to say anything now as to the application for a certificate. I rather take the view, looking at what the two new Justices of the High  Court  have said - I allude to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins - that it might have been as well to have solved the difficulty by a reconsideration, uninfluenced by that jealousy to which reference has been made, but from the point of view of trying to secure a solution, by giving weight to what the Privy Council has said on the merits of the question, and by making some approach, at any rate, to die views of the eminent Judges who are the latest additions to the High Court Bench. I regret that course was not adopted, and it is not for me to say any more about it. </para>

                    <para>- Another matter to be considered is that what we are asked to do by this Bill is an act of justice, by making persons liable to income tax to which the High Court says they are not liable - to declare, in fact, that the Privy Council was right, and that these people ought to be subject to taxation. I entirely agree with the view that it is just that this immunity should be swept away, but I doubt whether this is the right way to do it, or whether this Bill will have the effect of doing it. The position would be no better if this were a Bill to declare that the Privy Council was right. If the judgment of the Privy Council is right, it stands for what it is. If the judgment of the High Court is right, it stands for what it is, and we must find the remedy in the Constitution itself. If an amendment of the Constitution were necessary, it would have to be made. </para>

                    <para>- He would have to fight them both under this Bill. The difficulty cannot be got over by such a measure as this. But my point is that this Bill would not make the position any better. Another matter to be considered is that this is a Bill to impose taxation upon those who are supposed to be not at present liable to pay the tax in question. The Bill does not fix the tax, but leaves it to be fixed by the States. We impose a liability by this Bill, and we refer it to the States&#39; to say how much, within certain limits, should be paid. It is a matter for consideration, therefore, how far this Bill is one which is properly before us at the present time. It is undoubtedly a taxation Bill. It is a Bill to impose taxation. </para>

                    <para>- I mention that because it is a pity that we should go on with the measure if it is not properly before us. It would be very much better for us to discuss this point in all its bearings than to have it thrust upon us in some Other way by another place. Then, again, as has been suggested, the measure is partial and incomplete. If it is to be uniform, surely it ought to apply to all officers. But there is an exception in the case of the Governor-General. There may be constitutional reasons for that, but a measure of this kind ought to be made general, unless there is some overriding reason why it should not be. If the judgment of the Privy Council stood, it would be a question whether it applied to the Governor-General or not, and it would not be for us, and it would not be for the States, apart from constitutional questions, to declare that immunity. A State might declare immunity from its own taxes, but it is not for the Commonwealth Parliament to do so. </para>

            <para>The High Court has said that to. tax the salaries of Federal officers is such an interference. Can we say that it is not? Because, if we can, and do, we shall certainly be flying in the face of all that we suppose that we can do under the Constitution, and; flying in the face also of the principle of the Constitution that the High Court is a co-ordinate factor in the Constitution with the Parliament. There are three bodies - the Executive, the Legislature, and the Judiciary ; and if we can by an Act of Parliament say that, although the High Court has pronounced a particular judgment, we declare that it shall be of no avail, we shall very seriously interfere with the position of the High Court. I invite honorable senators to consider the question from that point of view. </para>

In expressing these opinions in regard to the question, I am not speaking upon it for the first time. We had the question before us in  1905  ; and honorable senators will find, if &#34;they look at the proceedings of the Hobart Conference, that when it then cropped up it was mentioned that I had expressed an opinion, in the Government of which I was the Attorney-General, that the matter could not be rectified by Parliament or in the way proposed by this Bill. I am, therefore, not expressing any new opinion on the subject. </para>

                    <para>- I have dealt with that. I have said that I think it was unwise that that suggestion should have been made. It is not binding upon the High Court. It is not binding upon the Judge who made it. It was dissented from by one of the Justices of the High Court, and nothing emanating from the High Court is binding upon themselves or binding upon the Parliament and people of this country unless it is a formal judgment upon a case presented to the Court by the parties concerned, and upon which they have an opportunity of being heard. I think it is a dangerous thing for members of this Parliament to jump at suggestions of that character which emanate from any Judiciary as ways of escape from a judgment they pronounce. </para>

            <para class="block">I conclude these remarks in reference to this particular matter by saying that we are not going to the root of it. The root of the matter lies in the Constitution. If the Constitution had been framed as those who thought with me desired, this difficulty would never have arisen. What does the Constitution say? That is the question. The Privy Council says that there is no prohibition against a State tax, and that there is liability unless there is an express prohibition. The High Court says that there must be an express authority to impose it. That is the position as it now exists. I should have thought that it would require an express prohibition to interfere with the right of a State to tax its own citizens. Under the Bill, it is sought to put an end to the difficulty by enacting the direct liability, and we immediately have by this measure a conflict between the Constitution and the Bill itself. I wish just to say one or two words on the Judiciary Bill, and they must be even more emphatic as to the undesirability of passing it. If there was one thing that the framers of the Constitution desired, it was to magnify the States Courts and to place them in the position of being Federal Courts exercising Federal jurisdiction wherever possible. We desired that the great and expensive system followed in the- United States should not be made applicable here. In the United States, immediately their Constitution was agreed to, they&#39; had to establish, not merely their Supreme Court, but District Courts and Circuit Courts throughout the length and breadth of their then dominion. To prevent that expense and the necessity of having a network of Federal Courts all over Australia, the Judicial Committee recommended, and the Convention approved, that there should be power to vest the States Courts with Federal jurisdiction. That was provided for. We raised their status, and gave them that jurisdiction. We left with them a direct appeal to the Privy Council. That, I think, was not desirable, but it was done. We have since, by means of the Judiciary Act of  1903,  interfered with that status to a very considerable extent. V&#39;e have disfigured it in a manner that was certainly not contemplated by the framers of the Constitution. We did that, which I see is the subject of some discussion in this morning&#39;s newspaper - we enabled appeals to take place direct from single Judges, to the ignoring of the States Supreme Courts and from the States inferior Courts of Quarter  Sessions or County Courts, I am not certain how they are termed, direct to the High Court. To my mind, that was exceedingly inadvisable. It was passing by the Supreme Courts of the States, placing them in an inferior position, and doing that which was certainly not in the contemplation either of the Constitution or the framers of the Constitution. </para>

                    <para>- I am perfectly aware that appeals have gone from the Chief Judge in Equity in New South Wales. I am also aware that attempts were made in South Australia to the same end, but the position of the High Court is entirely different from that of the Privy Council in this respect, and the view I take is that the special leave which has been used so freely was not intended to be used in that way at all. It is a totally different thing for leave to be given by the King in Council to any citizen anywhere in the King&#39;s Dominion to approach him through the Privy Council for redress of grievance and justice, and for the same power to be assumed by the High Court when it does not occupy the same position as the Privy Council and the King, whose direct instrument the Privy Council is. I venture to think that the Judiciary Bill will have the effect of still further humiliating the States Courts. What is proposed ? There is an appeal direct from them to the High Court. What is the object of this Bill ? It is to stop appeals direct from State Courts to the Privy Council by taking away from the Supreme Courts of the States the power to entertain or determine the matters referred to. I say that that ought not to be done. It is a circuitous way of preventing appeals direct from the Supreme Court of a State, as the Constitution enables them to go, to the Privy Council. I say that we cannot, and if we could, we ought not to do what is intended in that way. </para>

                        has expressed it exactly. It is not a straightforward way of doing it. The Constitution has- given these powers to the States Courts. The true inwardness and object of this Bill is to stop appeals such as that in the case of
                        <inline font-style="italic">Webb</inline>
                        v.
                        <inline font-style="italic">Outtrim,</inline>
                        which went direct from the Supreme Court of Victoria to the Privy Council. If such appeals should be stopped, let us stop them in some direct and straightforward way. If we think it just and proper to prohibit those appeals the direct and straightforward way in which to do it is by an amendment of the Constitution. Let us. not be parties to what is not a straightforward way. That is
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline>
                        term, but it is not nearly strong enough, because it is not merely a circuitous method, but one which involves the humiliation of the States Courts, the withdrawal from them of jurisdiction which the Constitution gave them, and which they are competent to exercise. The men occupying seats on the States Courts Benches are as able as the men occupying positions on the High Court Bench, or, for the matter of that, in the &#39;Privy Council.. I should be sorry to assent to a Bill which gives the States Judges a slap in the face with a view to accomplish some other end, which, to my mind, will not be accomplished in the way proposed, and which, if it could be accomplished, should not be attempted in this way. The end in this case does not justify the means. Tha provision would be futile, and if not futile, it would be grossly unfair to the States Supreme Courts and the men who constitute them. Though I may be wrong, I think it would be futile even in such a case as that which has been referred to, because it was there held that the matter in question was not a constitutional one, or, at any rate, that it was one which could be entertained by the Supreme Court here, and on which there could be an appeal.

                        Hodges held that the matter did not involve a question of Federal jurisdiction in the sense that it precluded him from giving leave to appeal to the Privy Council. With deference. I am bound to say that, while thinking, that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline>
                        Hodges was perfectly right, even if he were mistaken, seeing that there is no tribunal free from error, it would be better to let such mistakes continue, unless we amend - the Constitution, than to disparage our States Supreme Courts, and relegate them to the position of inferiority from which the framers of the Constitution intended they should be raised into what I might describe as the Federal hierarchy, and made Federal Courts, invested with Federal jurisdiction competent to deal with every matter with which the High Court can deal, subject to whatever appeal may lie in any particular case to the High Court itself, or to the Privy Council.

                    <para>- I am greatly indebted to honorable senators not merely for having so attentively listened to the observations I wished to make, but for their indulgence in enabling me to refer to the proceedings that took place before the Convention, and which, so far as they are material to the matters we are now dealing with, will, I hope, be of service, at any irate in ascertaining what was the original intention of the Convention, and how that intention was frustrated. They will show that the position that was taken up with respect to appeals to the Privy Council was not so taken  up  because of what may have been said in the Convention in the heat of debate, as to any inferiority, or any imputation, upon what is equally with the House of Lords, the foremost Court in the Empire, but because we desired to rest upon the principle that as we were seeking to create a nation self-sufficing in every respect, there ought to be as an attribute of that position power within ourselves to dispense final justice within our own boundaries. That unhappily was not carried out, not owing to any fault of the Convention, but to the circumstances to which I have alluded. I regret as much as any one that this situation has arisen. I do not wish to distribute the praise or the blame in any way. In the free exercise of my opinion I have indicated that the High Court itself might have found an easy way - a different way from that which is now proposed - out of this difficulty, without any lessening of their dignity, or any sacrifice of those great interests of which they may rightly be jealous. They might have taken, if I may so express it, a larger, wider, and wiser view of the situation, in the directions upon which I have offered a remark or two. As I say, I do not desire to apportion the credit or discredit one way or the other, but in that respect I agree to some extent with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> that the High Court held, and still hold, the solution in their own hands. I believe that most implicitly. I believe they hold that solution in the ca!&#93;m and dispassionate application of what is probably the wisest of all doctrines - to do what is best for the cause of justice, and to let that course prevail which makes for the highest interests of the community. </para>

                (New South Wales) &#91;5.46&#93;. - We seem to have got into rather a difficulty through discussing two measures at one time. I admit that in the earlier stages it seemed that this method would be a convenience, and was regarded as such, but now it seems to be an inconvenience. If the second Bill under discussion were sufficiently before the Chamber I should certainly ask your ruling, sir, upon it, and I cannot doubt what that ruling would be. I do not know that at present the alleged Salaries Bill is sufficiently before the Chamber to permit of your giving a ruling upon it, and therefore we are discussing a Bill which, if it were properly before the Chamber, might be found to be improperly before us, on the ground that it was entirely out of order and
                <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline>
                of the Constitution. I wish to make a few remarks upon the Salaries Bill rather than upon .the one the second reading of which is immediately before us. I wish to raise no historical questions connected either with the framing of the Constitution or the wording of the Judiciary Act, but rather to point out a few plain and, I think, common-sense reasons why the Salaries Bill should not be adopted. My remarks will, of course, have some relation to the Judiciary Act, and therefore I take it that I shall be strictly in order. First and foremost, let me point out that I come with my colleagues from a State which for many years resisted tha. imposition of income &#34;taxation, and which has very recently in the most emphatic manner announced its abolition. Therefore no representative of New South Wales can possibly be regarded as an interested party through this proposal affecting in any shape or way the munificent incomes that we are supposed to derive from the groaning taxpayers of the Commonwealth. One question that I submitted to the honorable and learned senator who has addressed the Chamber with so much eloquence and so much acceptance this afternoon, was whether the officers of the British Army or Fleet serving in the Australian States are subject to income tax. I believe they are not, but that is not because there is any section to the contrary in any Income Tax Act in Australia. They are not subjected to income tax for the very good reason that the lesser Government recognises its inability to tax the higher. In other words, the Colonies have all along recognised their inability to tax Imperial incomes, and in largely the same way the Commonwealth has as &#34;much right to expect the incomes of its officials to be immune from State taxation as ;has the British Government to expect the salaries of its officials to be so immune. I do not see that there is any difference except, of course, the wide one between the magnitudes of the Governments in the two cases. It is proposed specially to exempt the emolument of  His Excellency  the Governor-General. I suppose that is because there is a statutory obligation to pay him a certain sum. If the Governor-General has a right to the fulfilment of his bargain and to receive unimpaired the salary that is stipulated to be his in the Constitution, then I submit that, in precisely the same manner, members of the Legislature are entitled to receive their little statutory allowances just as free from invasion by the States as  His Excellency  the Governor-General is to receive his very different sum. In the one case, it is a salary, in the other, an allowance, and an allowance, we ali know, is to cover expenses. This is one of the first proposals that has ever been made to require any man to pay income tax on his hotel bill and travelling expenses. I can confidently appeal to your knowledge of the matter, sir, for you had the honour of discharging the duties of a Minister of the Crown for many years in New South Wales, when I say that there, and also in the other States, it is customary for Ministers of the Crown to draw whatever sum is necessary to meet their travelling expenses when abroad about the country&#39;s business. Who ever heard of a Minister of the Crown paying income tax upon the amount of his allowance as travelling expenses ?

                    <para>- I was just going to leave official life, and come to the humdrum of the business world. Was any commercial traveller ever required to pay income tax on the amount of his hotel bill ? That is what we are asked by that Bill to do. I am asked to pay income tax to Victoria, because every year I spend a considerable sum of money in hotel accommodation within her borders. Could any proposition be more radically absurd from a common-sense stand-point? I will go further, and say that, so far as I know, no Premier but the Premier of Victoria, who was the means of inviting us here - if it was not the present Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Bent, it was a previous Premier - would ask us to take up our abode in his State, and then submit us to the experience of finding, as soon as we got there, an official hand trying to get into our pockets. That is one way of serving one&#39;s guests, but I have always Thought that there never was: a more detestable piece of conduct on record than for a man to invite people to his house in order to borrow money from them, or to get at their pockets in some way. </para>

                    <para>- To take them down, as my honorable friend says. I never heard that it was possible to invent in the pages of a novel any more dastardly character than that of a man who invites people to his house in order to take them clown, but that is what has happened to members of this Parliament in Victoria. I am not prepared to support a proposition of that kind. Somewhere or other, sooner or later, there will be a Federal Territory, and a Federal Capital, and the amount of money which is now being spent in Melbourne will be spent within the limits of that area to a very large extent. Al) the large salaries of Commonwealth Administration will be earned, and paid within that Territory. The parliamentary allow&#39;ances and the Ministerial salaries will be&#39; chiefly earned within that area. What,&#39; then, are we proposing to do, but to enable&#39; one State, more than all the other States put together half-a-dozen times over; to de-&#39; rive a little revenue for a few years, and then to lose it for ever? Leaving aside, all questions of honorable senators&#39; interests an the matter, I come to the question of&#39;  the salaries in the Commonwealth Departments. How can the Commonwealth Government and Parliament equitably  adjust  the salaries of its officials if those salaries are to be subject to unequal depletion in every State of the Commonwealth? We pay a certain salary for a certain class of work, and yet, because one man lives in New South Wales, he suffers no deduction for income tax, while another, who lives in Victoria, has a drain upon him which his colleague across the Murray knows nothing of. In&#39; the other States, also, differing amounts will be deducted, according to the conditions of taxation in the separate divisions of the Commonwealth. Whatever may be the constitutional or legal position, the propositions I am submitting must appeal to every man possessed of any business knowledge, acumen, or experience. I do not know that I shall take up any more time in discussing this matter, because there may be an opportunity later on, when the second reading of the Bill is moved&#39; - if it is moved. But, on the other hand, no such opportunity may offer, because a point of law might incontinently knock the little bantling on the head, and I might then have had no chance of uttering these few sentences. Although I do not intend to say anything regarding the legal aspect of the case, I may, perhaps, be forgiven for pointing out that we ought rather to conserve the authority and reputation of the High Court than to do anything to  dimin-ish  it. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> said, we have not a perfect Court in the High Court. We never shall have a perfect Court anywhere in the world, because, so long as Courts consist of frail humanity, so long must there be frailty occasionally in the decisions given from the Bench. But if we are to diminish or destroy the prestige of our High Court in any way, what is to become of the Commonwealth ship ? We constitute a part of the crew ; but the hand that is on the helm of the Commonwealth ship is the hand of the High Court. We may set the sails ; but it is the High Court at the helm that determines a great deal of the navigation. It holds the chart. It studies the compass, and we, as a community - I am speaking now in a most general sense - are in a very large degree dependent on the wisdom, reputation, and distinction that surrounds the High Court for the interpretation of the Constitution and our laws. Honorable senators who were here prior to its establishment will remember how many hours and days were spent in laboriously endeavouring to come to a conclusion as to whether or not it was in our power to do this, that, or the other. All that has been saved to us in having an interpreter of our doings. &#39; It may seem that we ought to know what we intend to do, but, unfortunately, our process of lawmaking is such that very frequently it happens that the Legislature does not exactly know what it wants. Votes are given blindfold. Votes are given because somebody sits on one side of the Chamber or sits on the other side. I am not condemning the Chamber. </para>

I am not going to comment on the actions of the Chamber ; I am but only relating what any honorable senator, with experience, knows happens &#39;in every legislative chamber on the continent. Apart from haste, however, we are not all abstruse lawyers, and we may take an entirely different view of the meaning of certain words from that which it attached to them by minds trained in the interpretation of Statutes. There are these reasons why it is essential that there should be an authority at the helm of the Commonwealth ship with undiminished influence to carry out that which is the true intent of the laws which we pass. </para>

                    <para>- I am very pleased to find by his interjection that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> is in agreement with what I am saying, because he is the Minister in charge of the Bill&#39;, and is a politician of sufficient experience - not only in the Legislature, but also in Ministerial office - to know the importance of the apparently simple views which I am expressing. I do not think that we should lightly take any Step which is calculated to diminish the feeling of authority and confidence which we repose in the High Court. Even supposing that there has been some difference of opinion - we should not have so many lawyers in the world if it were not for lawyers&#39; differences of opinion - and eminent lawyers may be found to differ with the decision of the High Court on this taxing question, I suppose it will be just as easy to find equally eminent members of the profession to support for all they are worth the view of the High Court. Therefore are we, a small party, consisting, chiefly of laymen, who, of course, are not versed in the interpretation of Statutes - are we, because we have been elected here, to set vip our puny views against the erudite decision of men who have been selected and appointed to the highest judicial positions in the land by reason of their supposed capacity, ability, and experience? I, for one, do not feel disposed to take up that attitude. Whether all the good which isi sought to be achieved by the measure can possibly be of the value which the Acting Premier of Victoria seems to attach to it, I do not know. I doubt whether it is worth the time that we are spending upon it. For the reasons I have given, I do not feel disposed to lend any assistance in the direction of belittling either the High Court or the Supreme Court of a State to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has1 so eloquently referred. Certainly I am not disposed for one moment to give a vote that will aid in maintaining what I have always regarded as a pernicious method of taxation, one which gets at the pockets of the energetic and the industrious, whilst the sluggard is passed by the income tax collector. </para>

                    <para>- I shall make only one remark in reply to the interjection. It was about this month in 1886 when I had the honour of moving in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, an amendment which utterly destroyed the first income tax ever introduced there. I refer to the income tax of the Jennings- Dibbs&#39; Administration. To show that my opposition to an income tax is no new thing, if the honorable senator will look up the New- South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of a few years later, when the Dibbs Administration introduced an Income Tax Bill, I think that in the index he will find against my name no less than sixty-five entries of speeches made in opposition to the Bill. </para>

                    <para>- There was no &#34; stone- walling. &#34; The longest speech I made occupied only fifty minutes. I did not speak at any length, but I fought the Bill day and night, because I was opposed to the principle. I am still opposed to the principle, and it is not likely that I shall come here to assist in interfering with the salary of one man as against the salary of another. If the income tax were made equal throughout Australia there might be something in it, but so long as it is a differing quantity - differing in some States and not existing at all in others - I shall not assist in placing an unequal burden of taxation on public servants doing the same class of work, and supposed to receive the same emoluments. I shall not be a party to a method of making a man pay income tax on his hotel bill. For the reasons I have given, that seems to me to be absurd. An allowance is an allowance, and a salary is a salary. If it is a salary it may be taxable under certain conditions. If it is an allowance it is notoriously for the purpose of discharging the liabilities that a man incurs in the doing of his work. I shall not assist in any way to impose such an utterly unreasonable burden on any man. The State which sends me here only imposed an income tax to take the place of much more burdensome duties which had been repealed, and it is on the point of removing from the statute-book a tax which has been found a burden on industry, inquisitorial, unfair, and unreasonable in its incidence, and particularly costly to collect. </para>

                    <para>. - I had not the pleasure of hearing the Vice-President of the Executive Council deliver his speech, but I have had the advantage of perusing the official report, and I thank him for the very clear and ample way in which he stated the case. I believe that we must all now feel that we are better informed, after having heard the very interesting speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> The matter at issue, though, is not so much an examination of the mistakes of the past as the finding of a way out of the very serious difficulty in which we are placed. So far as I can see, there are three ways out of the position. The first is to accept the two Bills with such amendments as may be suggested. But the Government Salaries Bill appears to me to be absolutely unconstitutional, and merely waste paper. The second way is to go into the whole matter, and then, when we have really made up our mind as to what we want, to express our meaning. But the third way, and the one which I rather favour, is that we should fall back on the very useful judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, and see if we cannot prevail on the High Court to, or let it know that we desire that it should, follow the superior Court of the Empire, because the judgment of the Privy Council accords with our sense of justice and gives effect to our intention. But, instead of the High Court following the judgment of the Privy Council, we are asked to escape from the difficulty which has been created by passing two Bills, running the risk of their being unconstitutional. As one who has been a family solicitor all his life, settling other people&#39;s affairs and doing business of that kind, I do not profess to be much more competent to speak upon a matter of this kind than is any intelligent layman. I desire, therefore, to speak as a layman and a senator, and whatever I have to say will be said with the greatest deference to the Justices of the High Court. But still I am here to give reasons for my votes, and to express my views on the terrible constitutional muddle in which we find ourselves. I could understand the method proposed by the Government to get out of the present difficulty if the High Court had given a decision of which all of us approved as being in consonance with justice. But the reverse happens to be the case. The Privy Council have given a decision which we all believe to be in accordance with justice,, and with what the Constitution intended. It is the Privy Council that has told us that the fact that our public servants pay State income tax does not interfere in any way with the Federal authority. That, also, is what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs has said. It does not limit the Federal control over the officers of the Commonwealth, nor does it affect in any way the authority of the Federal Parliament. But our own High Court has given the decision which has got us into all the trouble. It is the decision of our Court which we do not believe to be in accordance with justice. It is its decision which absolutely ignores the fact that we are all citizens  of States, as well as citizens of the Commonwealth. </para>

Rightly, or wrongly, the income-tax case went before the Privy Council. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges, of the Supreme Court of Victoria, held that it was rightly sent there, and the Judges of the Privy Council itself held that it was rightly before them. They have decided it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins has pointed out in clear and lucid language that we belong to an Empire, and that the Privy Council is the fount of justice and the highest Court to which we can appeal. Nothing but trouble can result if we refuse, to follow its judgments. I should not, however, be inclined to do so if I thought that the Judges had done something foreign to the genius of . the Australian! people. But, as a matter of fact, they have done everything that we approve of. It is the High Court, in refusing to -follow the highest&#39; Court in the Empire, that has done that of which our own people disapprove. It does not appear to me as &#39; if the Judges of the High Court really, saw the importance of trie decision which they gave* </para>

                        <para>- I fall back upon the judgments of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs, and the Privy Council, which are in accordance with our views of the justice of the case, and argue that instead of Parliament being compelled to resort to the roundabout way of passing two Bills, one of which is said to be illegal - although the Chief Justice has suggested that we should pass it - the High Court itself should have got rid of the difficulty. If, according to the judgment of the High Court, every Federal officer has a constitutional right to be exempt from the payment of State income tax, what is the use of one of the Judges of the High Court telling us that we should pass a Bill to put the matter right? We cannot pass such a Bill if Federal officers have the constitutional right to be exempt. I understand, from reading <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best&#39;s</inline> speech, that he quoted a large number of cases which all depend upon the maxim that the man who has a privilege or right conferred upon him can waive that privilege or right. But other authorities which my honorable friend quoted at the end of his speech were not, to my mind, in point. Let me tell the Senate why. The case of <inline font-style="italic">McCulloch</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Maryland</inline> was quoted. That case had relation to a bank set up by the Federal Government of the United States. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend will see my point if he follows the argument. When the Federal Government in the United States set up a branch of its bank in Maryland, the State Government commenced, not to tax the Federal officers, but the notes issued by the bank. It was with regard to that note tax that Chief Justice Marshall said that the power of taxation might, or might not, mean the power of destruction. But there is all the difference in the world between a State taxing an institution of the Federal Government and taxing a Federal officer. That distinction runs clearly through the whole of the cases which my honorable friend quoted at the end of his speech. He contended, in accordance with the case of <inline font-style="italic">McCulloch</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Maryland,</inline> that a State cannot tax a Federal institution, and cannot do anything which would embarrass or control the Federal Parliament in carrying out its functions. But simply to tax the salary of a Federal officer after he has received it from the Treasury, . and has it in his pocket, is quite another matter. It appears to me that in the judgment of the High Court no attention whatever  is paid to States rights, or to the fact that every citizen of the Commonwealth is also a citizen of an individual State, the rights of which have to be protected. I find that Lord Halsbury, in his judgment, alluded to this point, and quoted section 1 06 of the Constitution, which says - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">What is there in the Federal Constitution that takes away the right of each State to tax its own citizens by an income tax? As Lord Halsbury puts it, we cannot take away the expressed principle of the States Constitutions by trying to read into the Federal Constitution some implied authority. The States Constitutions emanated from the Crown, and they remain with the States except so far as the Federal Constitution takes power away from them, or in some way limits or controls their power. As to the power of taxing by income tax in each State, nothing is taken away. There is no limit and no control. I do not find in any judgment of the High Court that it has considered the question of what are the rights of the citizens of each State, and what are the rights of the States under their Constitutions to tax the incomes of their citizens. But the High Court has gone out of its way to read into the Constitution implications which I do not see there. Even if there are implications in favour of the judgment of the Court, they cannot, I contend, be set up against the direct and positive powers given to each State over its own citizens. </para>

We all know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidston</inline> has suggested that the States debts should be taken over as soon as possible by the Commonwealth, and that we should establish a Federal bank to deal with them. Suppose we established a Federal bank, with a branch in Queensland. We should have three factors, the Federal institution, the shares in the bank, and the Federal officers in charge of it. Now, I think that the case of <inline font-style="italic">McCulloch</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Maryland</inline> has nothing to do with the salaries of the officers after they have received them from the Commonwealth Treasury, although it may apply to the bank itself and to shares in the bank. </para>

                        <para>- The Vice-President of the Executive Council will see that I draw a distinction between three factors ; the Federal institution, the property in that institution, and the officers of that institution. The officer, being a citizen of a State, is subject to the Constitution of that State, and it, therefore, appears to me that the decision in the case of <inline font-style="italic">McCulloch</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Maryland</inline> cannot apply to the taxation of his salary. But it is of no use to take up time in arguing about the past. The question is how is the difficulty which has arisen to be overcome ? I feel that we need to come to close quarters with those who know something about this subject. We shall never settle technical matters of this kind by a debate; we require, rather, to sit around a table and have a discussion upon them. I find that the Criminal Appeal Bill was referred, in England, last year, to what is called there a Grand Committee. One of the members of the Imperial Parliament pointed out this year that that was not at all a proper tribunal to which to refer such a matter, and that it ought to go before a special Committee. We have provision only for Select Committees in connexion with the Senate, and I feel that this is a Bill which should be referred to a Select Committee, in order that we might get at close quarters with the facts, and be in a position to examine barristers who have practised in the Appeal Courts, and who know something about the matter with which the Bill deals. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has not considered whether we should deal in this measure with the right of appeal from one Judge of a State direct to the High Court. Articles on this subject have appeared in the newspapers, and I think that most of us recognise that it involves a very important question. If the existing state of things is to be continued, it is quite certain that the High Court will have more work to do than it can accomplish. Additional Judges will have to be appointed, and even then the Court will not be able to overtake the work unless an arrangement be made by which three Judges would sit in Melbourne and three in Sydney, whilst two or three more were travelling about in the smaller States. If that plan were adopted, it has been properly pointed out that it would be open to the objection that there would probably be conflicting decisions given&#39; by the different sections of the Court.&#39; I think chat it is the bounden duty of the Government, whilst considering this important Bill, to review the whole question of appeals. We should not let this measure leave the hands of Parliament until it is so framed as to deal with the whole subject. I point out that there is still the question whether the present Judiciary Act ought not to be amended and made clear. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges has said that the income tax case was rightly sent on appeal to the Privy Council. The Privy Council expressed the same opinion, but the High Court, with a great deal of justification, I think, decided that the case was not rightly before the Privy Council. That is another matter which must be set at rest. If I may use the expression, I think that a &#34;botch &#34; will be made of the business if this Bill is permitted to pass without dealing with the whole question of appeals, and the work to be done by the High Court and the States Courts. With regard to the Commonwealth Salaries Bill, we have the authority of the High Court for saying that it is unconstitutional. The High Court has in the clearest way, and by a full and ample judgment, shown us that there is embedded in the Constitution a right inherent in every Federal officer to be free from any State income tax. If that be so, how can it be suggested that the Federal Parliament, which cannot alter the Constitution, can pass a law taking away a right held by every Federal officer. I quite understand that a gift or privilege conferred upon a person or a body can be waived by that person or body. But what we are dealing with here is a gift inherent in each Federal officer. When we talk of the Federal </para>

                <para class="block">Parliament waiving its right and consenting, if we had established a Federal bank, to the taxation of the shares in that bank by the States, that is very different from the giving up of rights vested in individual officers. They are citizens of the different States, and as such the High Court has decided that they are exempt from the income tax imposed by the States of which they are citizens. If we .pass the Commonwealth Salaries Bill exactly in the form in which it is before us, and a Federal officer disputes payment of the income tax of a State on the ground that this legislation is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> what on earth is the High Court to say to it? We have their answer already. They have decided that the right of Federal officers to be exempt from State income tax is embedded in the Constitution. It, therefore, seems to me that the proposed legislation must be regarded as <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> since the High Court will be bound by its own judgment. The difficulty cannot be got over in the way proposed. In connexion with the amendments suggested, &#91; am bound to say that I differ from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> on two points. First of all, I think it would be a fatal blunder for us to make any exception in our own favour, or to make any difference in the way in which the law shall be applied to a State as compared with a Federal officer. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> proposes that such a distinction shall be made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has asked, &#34;Whoever heard of a man paying income tax on his hotel&#39; bill and travelling expenses?&#34; That may be an ingenious but it is not a proper way in which to put the matter. I admit that the honorable senator possesses considerable knowledge of such taxation, not through paying it, but probably in trying to obstruct it. But I point out that it is one of the provisions of legislation imposing an income tax that the expense incurred in earning the income may be deducted in estimating it. But a man is not entitled to deduct hotel and living expenses. He must pay them out of his income minus the tax. </para>

                    <para>- - I did not intend to intervene in this debate. We have heard opinions from different sides of the Chamber to the effect that the method proposed by the Government is the only one by which the difficulty which has arisen can be avoided, and on the other hand to exactly the opposite purport. In a matter of this kind, as a layman, I would not presume to offer an opinion at all. It seems to me that somehow we have got into a difficulty, but apparently the High Court as the interpreter of the Constitution holds the kev to the position for the present. Speaking with all due deference, it does seem to me that any legislation that we may pass will be what the lawyers call <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> if any one cares to contest it. Now, with regard to the Commonwealth Salaries Bill and the income tax, I submit that members of the Federal Parliament stand in quite a different position from any other section of the community, so far as this matter is concerned. Assuming for the time being that what we receive is a salary- </para>

                        <para>- I ask honorable senators to compare the position of a member of the Federal Parliament with that of an ordinary civil servant. If a civil servant is sent from Melbourne to Sydney on Commonwealth business he is allowed his train or steamer fare and a guinea or a couple of guineas per day,, according to to his class, as expenses. Contrast that with our position. We get a fixed allowance of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;,A&#176;&#176;</inline> a year. Out of that we have to defray our expenses in attending the meetings of Parliament, and we are also expected to go up and down the country like roaring lions&#39;, or like cooing doves, as honorable senators please, giving an account of our stewardship to the people who elected us, and to whom we are responsible. The expense incurred in that way can be looked upon as incurred in attending to the business of the Commonwealth. For that also on every ground of equity we are entitled to claim an exemption. That way of looking at the matter cannot fairly be contradicted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> said that we ought not to differentiate between ourselves and other public servants. The honorable senator evidently wishes to place members of Parliament in a very much worse position than ordinary civil servants so far as the payment of income tax is concerned, and that is exactly what I am opposed to. I agree with every word that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> said on the subject. Why should we be called upon to pay income tax, not on our net income, but on our expenditure? In the case of a commercial traveller, with a salary of &#163;500 a year and an allowance of a guinea a day for expenses, would the Income Tax Commissioner be entitled to ask him to pay tax upon ^500, plus 365 guineas? He would never dream of making such a demand, which would be scouted in any Court of justice. The traveller would undoubtedly be called upon to pay on the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;$&#176;o,</inline> but no one would ever think of asking him to pay taxation on the expenses incurred in the prosecution of his employer&#39;s business. When we come to Melbourne, we incur expenses in carrying out the work we are sent here to do, and I submit, with all deference, that we ought not to be called upon to pay taxation on the money paid us to meet those expenses. I do not wish to escape my liability as a citizen of the Commonwealth any more than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> does, but I object to being treated unfairly. We ought to have fair play all round, and no man should be asked to pay more than in fairness and justice he ought to pay. My intention is to vote against the second reading of the Salaries Bill, and if the second reading is carried I shall attempt to amend it in the way I have given notice of. If members of Parliament are not treated in the way I have advocated, they will be compelled to submit to an extortion to which they ought not to be exposed. Consider the case of Queensland members. If I have to pay income tax on my full ^400 a year, it will mean a decrease of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> in my salary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> tells us that the income tax is to be abolished in New South Wales, so that the allowance of a New South Wales member would be ^400, and that of a Queensland member ,&#163;390. I think the income tax in Victoria would amount to between <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4.</inline> I do not know what it is in South Australia, while in Western Australia there is no income tax. </para>

If my allowance for expenses is &#163;400, and my expenses amount to &#163;100, I am quite willing to pay on ^300, but if my expenses amount to &#163;400, I consider that I should be allowed to escape scot free. I trust honorable senators will not be led away by the ideas put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> Probably it is not a matter of very much concern to him whether he&#34; pays income tax or not, but I can assure him that it is a matter of some consequence to me. My expenses as a representative of a very large State are already considerable, and if they are to be added to by another demand upon my purse for taxation, not upon my income but upon my expenditure, it will mean that I shall be asked to submit to an injustice. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not wish to address myself at any length to this Bill, but we are forced to the conclusion, not only by the Bill, but by the remarks of the Minister in introducing it, that the Government are going to make no serious effort to overcome what is recognised on all hands as a serious difficulty. I refer to the position which has arisen under the Judiciary Act and the Constitution, of appeals going direct from a single Judge of a State Court to the High Court. It is universally admitted that that position is regrettable. I believe it is not suggested by any one that the Full Courts of the various States should be relegated to what must be a most inferior position, but that is the position into which they are rapidly being forced as the practice extends. </para>

                        <para>- The States cannot remedy it. When the matter has been discussed it has been said that it is outside the province and power of this Parliament to remedy such a state of things by such a Bill as we are now discussing. Apparently Ministers also hold that view, because I cannot believe that the Vice-President of the Executive Council, if he had seen the possibility of altering it, would have failed to indicate his ready desire to do so. I  am assuming that the honorable senator will not for one moment defend, as a right and proper thing the decision that an appeal may go direct from one Judge of a State to the High Court. I should like the honorable senator to say so, if he will. I have not heard directly or indirectly that he regards such a state of things as desirable. I can quite understand that he might regard it as a difficult matter to get over, or that he might imagine, for instance, that before we can put it right we shall have to go through the cumbersome process of altering the Constitution. I shall be glad if the Vice-President of the Executive Council will indicate whether he is desirous of applying a remedy by legislation, if practicable. As the honorable senator will not give that indication, I should like to point out that section 73 of the Constitution says that the High Court - shall have jurisdiction with such exceptions and subject to such regulations as the Parliament prescribes to hear and determine appeals. . . . </para>

                        <para>- It seems to be a provision that would appeal to everybody, but if a majority of this Parliament does not feel disposed on the actual merits of the case to put such a provision in this Bill, I could suggest another way in which the difficulty might be got over: It is desirable that we should not belittle the States Courts. I do not think the Federation has anything to gain by trying to relegate every State Court, especially the Full Courts, to a most inferior position, or by taking from the States Full Courts most of their work, nor will it gain anything if we compel the High Court to deal with innumerable cases which ought never to come before it. I should decidedly -prefer that we should indicate at once, and definitely, that no appeal should lie to the High Court until the appeal to the Court of last resort in the State had been exhausted. The other way I was going to indicate out of the difficulty is this: I see no reason at all why we could not provide in our legislation that it shall bi necessary in the case of an appeal to the High Court from a single Judge of a State Court for special leave to be obtained from that Judge, and, if necessary, from the High Court itself. I do not wish to address myself to any other aspect of this Bill, but I do feel that the present position with regard to the Judicature demands our serious attention. If it is within the province and power of this Parliament, as I hold it is, to give redress, I certainly think we ought to give it. It is my intention, when this Bill gets into Committee, to move, if no one else does so, first in the direction I have indicated, that the appeal to the State Courts shall be exhausted before the High Court is approached, and next, if I cannot carry that, to provide for special leave to appeal. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not going to address myself at any length to this subject, because, after the lengthy remarks we have heard from a very learned senator, it is no wonder that an ordinary layman like myself should feel bewildered. I desire only to extract from the Minister in charge of the Bill an explanation of the position a litigant would be in if, when his case was being tried in a State Court, the Judge decided that it was not a matter affecting the limits <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> pf the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those o&#39;f any State or States, or the limits <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> of the constitutional powers of any two or more States. Supposing that the matter was really in truth and in essence a case coming under those definitions, would such a litigant have any remedy to enable him to have his case bi ought before the High Court? I can easily conceive of a Judge of a State Court feeling that, under the amended section 40A of the Judiciary Act as set out in clause 5 of this Bill, he alone was called upon to decide whether or not a matter was one that came within the category I have mentioned. He would have full and absolute jurisdiction to decide that it was not a case affecting the limits <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> of the. powers of the Commonwealth or States, and he might do so even in face of the fact that in truth and in essence it was such a case. What would be the position of the litigant if the Judge of a State Court gave such a decision ? Would it arm a single Justice of the Supreme Court of a State with full power to decide the question when, at the same time, it is reserved exclusively for the jurisdiction of the High Court? </para>

                        <para>- I beg the Minister&#39;s pardon. I thought that the  President  was going to put the question, and that the debate would then have closed. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> I feel very bewildered with regard to the Bill. I feel that it is an attempt to remedy a position which has been termed intolerable ; but I fear that if the Bill were allowed to go through as it is, the position would be even more intolerable afterwards. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that, if any thing is to be done at all, the Bill should not go through in its present skeleton shape, but should deal with other questions which have come up as regards appeals from a single Justice of the Supreme Court of a State, and thus be made a comprehensive measure. The speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> this afternoon seemed to me to riddle the Bill, and I fear that no good would result from its passage. I think that, before we can remedy a great injustice, we shall have to go to the fountain-head, and that is to the people. Therefore, unless the Minister, in his reply, can clear away the objections which have arisen in my mind, I shall certainly deem it my duty to vote against the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I was rather surprised at the attitude of the Government in connexion with my motion to adjourn after a very close debate on a Bill of such importance. On a previous occasion, an adjournment was allowed after there had been far less discussion than there has been to-day. In view of the very serious pronouncement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and the important speeches made by other honorable senators, I think it would have been only reasonable on the part of the Government to consent to an adjournment. When I saw what did happen, I was very sorry that I had not communicated my wish to a greater number of honorable senators, but the debate seemed to be collapsing so suddenly - not even the Minister made an attempt to rise - that I moved for an adjournment. </para>

                        <para>- Then I beg the Minister&#39;s pardon. But, even if he was prepared to speak, I do not think that other honorable senators have had a fair opportunity of considering to-day&#39;s speeches. I have listened very carefully to the whole of the debate, with the exception of the Minister&#39;s very important speech, which I was prevented from having an opportunity to hear. I have endeavoured, however, to make myself acquainted with the position. From the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger spoke until the present moment nothing has been said which has had a tendency to clear the minds of honorable senators. The discussion has all  gone to make the confusion worse confounded. We have  had  those who declare themselves constitutional authorities differing widely in their views. We have had the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who is a lawyer of no mean standing, opposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> who, as a constitutional authority, can scarcely be questioned; with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> and several other honorable senators of less importance coming in between, and all differing. </para>

                        <para>- According to the honorable senator, when no one understands a measure it is bound to be right, but I do - not hold that view. If I do not understand a proposal perfectly, I like to prolong the discussion as long as I can, in the hope that some light may come to me and to others. We have heard the history of the sections in the Constitution relating to the Judiciary. The whole discussion has hinged on the meaning of section 74. I heard a great deal about that provision in South Australia seven years ago, when the whole country was agitated, and recriminations were thrown broadcast with respect to the attitude taken up by certain prominent men in Australia. I heard them called - well, I shall not say what they were called. I was very pleased to-day to see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> had so cooled down that he was prepared to admit that they might think that they were right, but still those gentlemen who endeavoured to thwart the aspirations of the people of Australia in making the High Court, so far as the Constitution was concerned, the arbiter of their destinies, ought, I think, to be called names which would scarcely be allowed in the Senate, or anywhere else. We have heard all this history repeated to-day, as we have done on a previous occasion, but to-day&#39;s version might be called a revised version. We had the original version ; then we had it revised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger; and next we had a further revision by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> I am prepared to adopt the revised edition of the revised version, and to take the opinions of the honorable and learned senator in contradistinction to the opinion of any other honorable senator, at least on this question. It must be remembered that this is a double-barrelled discussion. We have to discuss a Bill to amend the Judiciary Act, and also a Bill dealing with a matter with which I do not think this Parliament should attempt to deal at the present time.. It should be left to the Courts. We have been told by as good a constitutional! authority as we have in the Senate, that if we pass the Bills in the present form they will be practically no better than wastepaper. Consequently, the Commonwealth would find itself in no improved position* with respect to the interpretation of the Constitution, or the difficulties that have arisen in reference to the income tax, than it is in now. When I find that such is the case I am still more surprised that the Government should not allow more time for consideration. After all that we have heard* about the Australian Constitution being the best instrument of government in the world, it is rather disappointing to find* that there is something in it that has-&#39; brought confusion both to the States and to the Commonwealth. I believe that the High Court of Australia should have full and complete control over all judicial matters in this country, and that there should&#34; be no other Court to appeal to, unless the High Court itself determines that a particular case ought to be sent on to the Privy Council. </para>

                        <para>- That is what the people of Australia originally voted for, and wished to be the law, and that is what they would glory in to-day. Instead of bringing up two measures like those before us, it would be far better for the Government to take steps to amend the Constitution. Perhaps Ministers will reply,. &#34; Look at the expense and delay that that would entail.&#34; Well, Australia has been living under the Federal Constitution for  seven years, and nothing very serious has happened through Federal officers not paying income tax in the States. There is nothing in the circumstances that would not . justify a little further delay in order to-&#34; enable the Constitution to be amended, so as to define clearly the position of our Courts and the relationship between the Commonwealth and the old country. Why should we not delay this matter, even by voting against the second reading of this Bill ? </para>

                <para class="block">Why should we not delay it by doing everything possible to compel the Commonwealth Government to do what is straightforward And just? If what I suggest were carried out, it would simply mean a delay of three years, when, without any serious additional cost, the people of Australia would be able to say in what direction they required the Constitution to .be amended, and whether they were prepared to permit appeals, not only from the High Court, but from  subordinate  Courts in the States to the Privy Council. The people should have power 4o express their opinion on that point; and I am certain, in view of the feeling existing between Great Britain and the Commonwealth of Australia, that if the people of this country showed any desire in the direction of vesting their own High Court with complete powers, the Parliament and the Executive of Great Britain would willingly agree to it. They are beginning to see that Australia is capable not only of governing itself, but of governing itself independently; and for that and many other reasons if an amendment of the Constitution in this respect were submitted to the British people and the British Parliament, I have no doubt that their sanction would be given. Then we should remove doubts, and the difficulties that now exist would disappear with them. Suppose we carry the Bills now before us. In what position shall we then be? The Government is endeavouring to do something which will discredit the Supreme Courts of the different States, arid cause greater friction to arise than at present exists. It is proposed to allow appeals to be brought from almost any Court in a State to the High Court. At present, it appears, there is power to appeal to the Privy Council independently of the High Court, except in constitutional cases. Now, by a side wind, to mv way of thinking - honorable senators will pardon -me for using such an expression - the Government are endeavouring to do what  ought  to be done by an amendment of the Constitution. Whenever a proposal of that nature is submitted to the Senate, unless I am assured that very great benefit to the people of Australia will be derived from it, 1 shall not support it. I would rather have some amount of delay than assist in carrying a measure such as is now before us. How has this&#34; question arisen ? We should never have heard of this amendment :in our Judiciary legislation had it not been for the unfortunate position first created by the State of Victoria, in endeavouring to levy income tax on everybody connected with the Commonwealth who resided, if only for five minutes, in Victoria. I myself got a wheelbarrow full of notices about the income tax in this State. </para>

                        <para>- The interest has accumulated, and- can go on accumulating, for all I care. Now, I come from South Australia. All those who come from that State know very well that we generally spend two nights per week in the train, two nights in Victoria, and three in South Australia. How should the income tax be divided? Should liability to pay it begin at Serviceton, or at Adelaide, or at Melbourne? How is it to be equitably collected ? I cannot understand. A remarkable feature of the proposed legislation is that the Bill dealing with income tax on the salaries of public servants exempts the Governor-General. - That is a nice little dodge. Probably I should not use that word. I will say that it is one of those harmless little courtesies that are paid to great people. If we are going to make a provision of this kind in such a Bill, let us see what it means. The Governor-General comes to Australia to live in the Federal Capital - when we have one. Melbourne is the present Seat of Government. Well, the Seat of Government should be considered, so far as the Governor-General, members of the Federal Parliament and Federal officers are concerned, just in the same way as the Federal Capital will be considered when we get there. Now if the Governor-General were residing in Federal territory, he would say to himself, &#34;I am in a funny position. If I go to Victoria to reside for three or four weeks, they will make me pay income tax. I had better stay where I am.&#34; Probably he would like to go to South Australia for a few weeks, as &#39;that country is very beautiful during some portions of the year. </para>

                        <para>- What is the exemption for? Does it not show the absurdity, the little pettiness of a measure of this description, when the Government put things into it simply .for purposes of padding? I refer to these things merely to show the absurdity of legislation of this description. If we consider the second Bill, I ask where is the guarantee that if we pass the Commonwealth Salaries Bill the High Court will not rule that it is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> and that we shall not have rules <inline font-style="italic">nisi,</inline> injunctions, mandamuses, and all those things flying about thicker than duck eggs n spring time. That is another reason why we should delay if it were only to give the subject further consideration. The Government appear now to be in a great hurry in this matter. In whose interests is this haste? Is it in the interests of Victoria ? I  think it&#34; must be because the Government of that State seem to be most eager to get hold of every possible penny they can secure from the unfortunate Commonwealth public servant or member of Parliament. I should be quite prepared to pay income tax in South Australia at  any  time if I had sufficient income for the purpose. I should be happy to pay  &#163;100  a year as income tax. But in South Australia the members of the Federal Parliament have never been asked to pay income tax on their salaries. I shall endeavour to show why the South Australian Government are sensible in making no such demand. I do not believe that there is a single representative of South Australia in either House of the Federal Parliament who would not be willing to pav income tax to the Government of that State. They are patriotic enough and love their own State sufficiently to be prepared to do what they can to advance its interests. But, as I -say, we have never been asked in South Australia to pay income tax, and why? I come back again to the Federal Capital and the Federal Territory, by which it is to be surrounded. </para>

                        <para>- We have a certain number of public servants who would be permanently located in that Federal Capital or in the Federal Territory, and none of the States Treasurers would have any power to compel&#39; them to contribute to the States revenue by way of income tax. They would in that Territory be exempt from any taxation except that which the Commonwealth Parliament itself proposed. I do not object to the Federal Parliament imposing .an income tax if it should be necessary. Despite what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has said, if ever there is a proposal of that kind made, I shall probably support it. Our public servants, while in the Federal Territory, would have to pay no income tax. As I have already said, while the seat of the Federal Government is in Melbourne, those public servants should be as exempt as they would be if located in the Federal Capital or Federal Territory. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of Federal servants who would be, from the nature of their \york, permanently located in the Federal Territory. I go a little further, and show the anomalies which would exist even under those circumstances. I do not object to income tax being imposed on the salary of a Commonwealth officer who is a permanent resident of any State. That may be his fortune or his misfortune. He may, by being compelled to live in a State where an income tax is levied, be relieved of disabilities to which he would be subject in the Federal Territory, and the relief from which would compensate him for the tax imposed on his salary. But I wish now to draw a comparison. Let us take the case of a public servant who, according to the Public Service Commissioner&#39;s classification is in class 5, and lives in the Federal Territory j he will be exempt from the income tax imposed in any of the States. , There as another gentleman in class 5, who may have a roving commission, against his will, and consequently be obliged to reside sometimes in one State  and  sometimes in another. He might sometimes have to pay income tax, and at other times would escape the tax, but would he not be placed in a position of disadvantage in the matter of salary as compared with his fellow servant in th; same class permanently located in the Federal Territory? That is an anomaly which should be considered when we are dealing with legislation such as that before the Senate at the present time. We should also ask ourselves whether it is right that Imperial officers coming to the different States should be exempt from income tax in those States whilst Commonwealth officers occupying very similar positions would be liable to the tax. I know that the public servants of the Commonwealth do not object to bear their fair share of the Government in any part of Australia in which they may be located, but they do object to be treated differently from officers in the same class occupying similar positions in other parts of the Commonwealth. It is for these reasons that I intend to vote against both of these Bills, In order that time may be allowed for further consideration of the matter, and that ultimately an amendment of the Constitution may be brought about which will&#39; give the High Court of Australia an opportunity to decide between the States and the Public Service of the Commonwealth, and between the States and the Commonwealth itself. If, with the assistance of others, I can, by opposing this measure, secure that, I shall have done my duty, not only to the Commonwealth, but to the States, because I believe that if we pass these measures in , their present form we shall find that within the next three or four years they will have cost the States, the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth public servants, a great deal more in litigation than the trifling amount of income tax that would be claimed by the States within the same number of years. I hope that the second reading of these Bills will not be carried, at all events, to-night. </para>

                    <para>. - Probably a layman like myself might be expected to approach the consideration of a Bill dealing with a grave constitutional question with a great deal of diffidence. But I do not approach this Bill with any such diffidence, nor do I offer any apology for the remarks I have to make upon it. Seeing the confused mess in which we have been landed by the greatest legal authorities of the Commonwealth, I think that the attitude of the layman to the lawyer in these matters should be one of the greatest disrespect. That is my attitude to the lawyers as a body when I consider that the highest legal talent, not only in this country, but in the old country, has landed us in our present position ; and now, after they have all dealt with the subject, we have only confusion worse confounded. We had the advantage at the Conventions of the combined wisdom of the highest legal authorities of the Commonwealth. Then all the legal talent in Australia offered advice, and in some instances impertinent advice, to the House of Commons and the British authorities when passing our Constitution Act, which, as we were properly reminded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> is an Imperial enactment. Then we had all the legal intellect of the Judges of the States Courts focussed upon the question for a considerable time. They arrived at one  conclusion. The matter came before the High Court, who arrived at another, and then it went before the Privy Council, who arrived at a third. In the circumstances, what respect can any one have for the consistency or continuity of a legal opinion on this or any other question? I listened for three hours to a dissertation upon these Bills &#39;from another lawyer, in  the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, and I have to confess that I was then in a greater fog than I was before, because the honorable and learned senator made the matter as- clear as mud. These are some reasons why  1  feel no diffidence as a layman in approaching the consideration of this question. I believe that an ordinary intelligent layman is as capable of offering a valuable opinion upon this or any other legal matter as is any lawyer. No matter what question is raised, we can find an equal array of legal talent on either side of it prepared to argue till all is blue that the other fellow is wrong. Divesting the question of all legal quibbles and technicalities, it will be admitted that this Parliament is not competent of itself to enact an amendment of the Constitution. If there is a defect in the Constitution, it is mere surplusage on the part of this Parliament to try to amend that defect in the way here proposed. We are being asked now merely to affirm what we think the Constitution ought to be, but that will not make the Constitution any different from what it is. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that, . instead of passing tinkering legislation of this kind, we should go straight to the point and amend the Constitution. It will be said that in order to do that we must wait for three years, until there is a general election, but we need not do so if we are prepared to pay the cost of a referendum this year, which would probably not amount to more than ,&#163;40,000, and which I believe would be money well spent, since it would probably save us three times that amount in actual cash, by preventing the enormous litigation with which we are likely to be faced should the course proposed by the Government be adopted. It would also be of great value in putting an end to the heartburnings and jealousies arising between the Commonwealth and the different States. The Government recognise that in this matter they are in a hole, and the legal authorities of the Commonwealth are of the same opinion. While with the most cheerful lightheadedness they acknowledge that we can do nothing, they say, &#34; Let us try to do something.&#34; I do not want to be placed in any such ridiculous position. When we are faced with a difficulty, we should grasp the nettle with courage, and it will not sting us at all, but if we go on tinkering with it in this manner, we shall be liable to get innumerable stings. It is proposed by these two Bills to do something which one at least of our judicial authorities has thrown a grave doubt upon our ability to do. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, of the High Court, in, delivering his judgment in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Flint</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Webb,</inline> as reported on page 86 of the Commonwealth Law Reports, vol. 4. {1907), said - </para>

                        <para>- If we did pass these Bills, and the States claimed that the collection of income tax was entirely within their province, the State, of Queensland might say, &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has escaped long enough from the payment of income tax. We are entitled to a little from him now.&#34; Supposing then they proceeded to demand income tax from me and I objected, as most people do object when their pockets are touched, they would sue me in a &#39;local Court, claiming that it was entirely a State matter, and get a verdict. I would appeal to the High Court, who would support my contention that I should not pay. Then in another case the State might sue some other officer of the Federation in a State Court, which following the precedent set by the High Court in my case would give a decision against the State Government. They would then appeal to the Privy Council direct, and we should have the same confusion over and over again. I cannot see for the life of : me how these two Bills are going to alter the position. One tenth of the rOw would not- have been kicked up about this income tax question if it had not been that the State of Victoria, in her desire to get at. members of the Federal Parliament and Federal&#39; public servants doing work for the other States wanted to tax their &#34;screws &#34; because they were here in Melbourne. The Seat of Government is situated in Melbourne for the time being, and will remain here for some time owing to a set of adventitious circumstances for which the Government of New South Wales are responsible, keeping us here against our will after we had selected a Capital site. Consequently, all the administrative officers have to live in Melbourne, and the members of the Commonwealth Parliament are located here for the greater portion of the year. The State of Victoria, egged on by some of the journals published here, wanted to make a grab while it bad the opportunity, and that was the cause of the outcry. I think, however, that there is an easy way out of the difficulty. I would first point out that the taxation of officers in the several States by means of income tax may be fraught with the greatest injustice. Two Federal officers of exactly the same status and classification, and performing the same work, may be stationed in adjoining States, which are divided by nothing more than an artificial line across a map. There is no division, between them in the Federal sense, but in one of those States there is a heavy income tax, and in the other none. The consequence is that the Federal officer in the one State is at a disadvantage, to the extent of the income tax he has to pay, as compared with the officer in the same class and doing the same work on the other side of that imaginary line. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so, but he may be removed by the Commonwealth in the course of departmental arrangements to-morrow, and another officer may be sent to take his place. Thus there would be constant change and uncertainty, and a palpable injustice might be done. The remedy I would suggest is that the Commonwealth should make good out of the Consolidated Revenue the amount of each officer&#39;s income tax, and pay it to the State in which he lives. The States would then get that money practically into their hands, but it would be deducted out of the amount returnable to them by the Commonwealth, out of the surplus over and above the three-quarters of the Commonwealth revenue to which .the States are constitutionally entitled. </para>

                        <para>- If I began to argue with a legal light on that point we might be here for a long time. We have ample surplus revenue over and above the three-fourths which we are compelled to return to the States to enable us to do what I suggest. It is a simple way out of the difficulty, and would remove all the heartburning. It is proposed to tax the allowances of members of this Parliament as if they were salaries. I am utterly opposed to such an iniquitous proposal. It is proposed bv the Government, in the other Bill, to allow the State represented by a member to levy income tax on the full amount of his allowance, and, so far as I can see, the Bill will not prevent him from being taxed by two States. Any man receiving, as a fixed salary, either from the Government or from a private firm, an income equal to the allowance provided for each Federal member, is granted almost as much more for travelling expenses if he has to do as much travelling as Federal members have to da The net income of a person, and not his gross income, is the amount that should be properly subject to income tax. If a man is to be taxed upon what he has to spend in order to earn his income it is an unfair discrimination between him and other people in the community.  A Federal officer receiving a fixed salary of &#163;400 a year, which is the amount of the allowance paid to a Federal member, would be allowed full travelling expenses for every inch of travelling he did from one year&#39;s end to the other. Even if he went from the Commonwealth offices in Spring-street to Spencer-street he would be allowed cab hire or tram fare, and if he had to be away from his home for a single day he would draw a guinea in expenses. But under this iniquitous proposal, even though a member of this Parliament may live 2,500 miles away from the Seat of Government, as I do, and have to leave his family there, or break up his home to bring them down here, it is proposed to treat his allowance for travelling expenses as if it was his net income, and make him &#34; ante up &#34; on the whole &#39;^400 as! though he had not <inline font-style="italic">\o</inline> spend a single shilling in travelling. I never heard a more iniquitous proposal, and it was a cowardly surrender to an outcry by interested people outside for the Ministry to bring it down in that form. I do not object to pay income tax like any other individual in my State, but if I am compelled, in the interests of my State, and on its business, to be down here attending to mv duties, I object to pay it both in Victoria and in Queensland. I do not object to pay income tax upon &#39; my net allowance in Queensland, the State which I represent, but I object to paying it on an income which* I do not enjoy. </para>

In Queensland the income tax officer, if he is not satisfied with a man&#39;s statement, will tax him up to the full amount he thinks he ought to pay, and the only remedy of the citizen is to go to law. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is entitled to be the judge of what he ought or ought not to do, and I claim the liberty of judging as to what ought or ought not to be done. Inasmuch as the Constitution Act does not call our parliamentary allowance a salary or an income,, and as it really is not a salary or an income, I do not think that that portion which is essential for my travelling expenses, and which I must necessarily spend in order to fulfil my duties, should be taxable as income. Therefore, I am opposed to that proposal in the Bill, and will endeavour to defeat it. I am inclined to agree that we are merely engaged in a work of supererogation in dealing with these Bills ; if we are to take the testimony of the highest legal authorities in the land, amongst whom I include <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> we are assured that the Bills are not worth the paper on which they are written ; that, at the very utmost, the Judiciary Bill is only a reaffirmation of what we think the Constitution ought to provide, and, as I pointed out before, it will not assist one iota to alter the Constitution. It seems to me that the measure, if passed, will be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> For these reasons, I am in a quandary as to what I ought to do. I wish to see the States get a fair deal. I also want to see every citizen in a State pay his full quota to its Government, but, above all things, I desire to uphold the Commonwealth authority and the status and dignity of the High Court. If I can be assured that the passing of the Bill will assist in any way to uphold the honour, the dignity, the prestige, and the power of the High Court, I shall vote for it, but, at the present moment, I am not fully assured in that regard. In fact, I am rather assured that we cannot do that except by a referendum and an alteration of the Constitution. I regret more than I can express that the original proposals made at the Convention by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> and which I know from personal knowledge he did his very utmost to defend when the Constitution Bill was being enacted by the Imperial Parliament, were not adopted. I think that all Australia has cause to regret that those proposals were not adopted. If they were the law, we should not be in the mess in which we are to-day. I hope that something will be done which will get us back to that position, enable us to follow out our destiny without having reference to a Court beyond the water, and assist us to build up a High Court which will be satisfactory to the people throughout the Commonwealth, and fully capable of adjusting all differences between the Commonwealth and the States. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sorry that any little misunderstanding should have occurred to cause a degree of friction in regard to an adjournment of the debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> must know that at all times I am anxious as far as possible to yield - as it is my duty to do - to any general expression of opinion when honorable senators desire further time for the consideration of a measure. The Bill before the Senate was introduced on the 12th July. In the meantime, there have been several adjournments of the debate, and these were all protested against. I was aware that there was, as the division list shows, a number of honorable senators who were desirous of going on this evening, and who, like my honorable friend, were ready to speak. In the circumstances, I had no alternative but to call for a division. Perhaps my honorable friend does not know that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> resumed his seat shortly before the dinner adjournment, the motion for the second reading of the Bill would have been put but for an honorable senator rising to speak. I hope that the various speeches which have been delivered have assisted towards an elucidation of the question at issue. I do not deny its complexity. But I say that every care has been exercised in regard to the provisions embodied in the measure and in establishing, so far as research can do, their validity if passed. I want my honorable friends to realize that the two Bills have not been introduced in a haphazard way. Apart from the Attorney-General, we have in his Department officers of great experience, who, with other members of the Government, have given thoughtful consideration to nearly every objection, certainly to every fundamental objection, which &#39;has been taken by my honorable friends. I am prepared to acknowledge that we are indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> for a very informative speech, and also for the interesting way in which he disclosed to us some of the more historical aspects of the case. Of course, it is with the greatest respect that I differ from my honorable and learned friend. He will recognise at once that there is the most ample room for a variety of opinions. </para>

I have also another authority, to which I regret that my honorable and learned friend did not refer, and to which I shall be obliged to refer a little more fully. I have pointed out that to all intents and purposes the United States  were practically met with the same complex problem at the outset of their national life. </para>

                        <para>- I shall try to deal with the points one after another if I can. My honorable and learned friend suggests that the Commonwealth Salaries Bill is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> Of course, if his contention is true, we are wasting time ; but I hope to show my honorable friends that there is a very valid constitutional reason for the exercise of our powers under the Constitution as we propose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> suggests that the only alternative is an amendment of the Constitution. There is no doubt about that being a complete way of dealing with the question. There is no doubt that if there were no other way available that would be the proper course to follow. But I do not think that we are justified in resorting co that step when we have the right under the Constitution to do what we are now attempting to do. My honorable friends cannot get away from the fact that an alteration of the Constitution is a serious matter. It is serious from the stand-point of the expense, the delay, and the friction which will have been caused within the States by reason of the decision of the High Court. </para>

It must be remembered, too, that, during the session of 1906 there were very grave and important matters which occupied the close attention of Parliament. In those circumstances this measure was crowded out. </para>

                        <para>- I shall take it in that way.  The Judiciary Act was the subject of very careful research and consideration. What was done was done after great deliberation. By virtue of our constitutional powers we have the right to create, first, the High Court, which we have done. We have also the right to create our own Federal Courts. But we have the additional right, according to the terms of the Constitution, of utilizing the various States Courts as part of the Federal Judicature, for the purpose of exercising Federal jurisdiction. What we did by the Judiciary Act was, in terms of section 77 of the Constitution, to divest them of jurisdiction, so far as Federal matters were contained in the Constitution itself - namely, contained in sections 75 and 76 - and to invest them with Federal jurisdiction. In doing that, what we said was that when we were investing the States Courts with Federal jurisdiction we had the right to invest them with it upon our own terms, namely, that there should be a right of appeal only to the High Court itself. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. By section 38 of the Judiciary Act we gave exclusive jurisdiction to the High Court in certain matters. As regards the balance of matters contained in sections 75 and 76 of the Constitution, by the 39th section of the Judiciary Act we gave Federal jurisdiction to the States Courts, subject to the limitations as to appeal to which I have referred. The manner in which we did that was no doubt the subject of consideration by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges, who held that we had no right, first of&#39; all, to divest the States Courts of jurisdiction, and then practically to invest them with new jurisdiction. The Privy Council appeared to take the same view. I hope later on to refer to that point more fully. But I point out that when we -passed our &#39; Judiciary Act we had no idea whatever, and no one ever suggested, that we were attempting to humiliate the States Courts. I do not think that my honorable and learned friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> who gave us the benefit of his assistance, suggested that at any time. </para>

                        <para>- That was one of the effects of the measure. The point that I am arguing is that it has been suggested that we have attempted by our Judiciary Act to humiliate the States Courts. I claim that we have done nothing of the kind. In the exercise of our Federal jurisdiction, we have done with the Slates Courts only what we were justified by the Constitution itself in doing, and never by the States Courts themselves, and never - speaking subject to correction - by any honorable senator when the Bill was before Parliament, was it suggested that we were humiliating the States Courts. I am verv sorry indeed that my honorable and learned friend saw fit to accept certain incautious words used by my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> to the effect that we were seeking to secure the supremacy of the High Court in a manner that was not straightforward. . I ask, &#34; What advantage is it to the Government to do anything in this connexion to achieve the great end in view by anything but a straightforward method ? </para>

                <para>I hope honorable senators follow that. We have been given, by section 76, power  to  make laws conferring original jurisdiction upon the High Court in any matter arising under it or involving its interpretation. By the section 30 of the Judiciary Act we exercised that power, and conferred on the High Court original jurisdiction in regard to matters arising tinder the Constitution or involving its interpretation. We are given power by the Constitution expressly to make laws conferring original jurisdiction upon the High Court. The next thing that we did in our Judiciary Act was to exercise certain other powers which were conferred by section 77  of  the Constitution. According to that section - . </para>

                <para class="block">The last two sections referred to are sections 75 and 76, one of which - section 75 - confers original jurisdiction in regard to five important matters upon the High Court. In pursuance of that section, and  of  paragraph II. of section 77, we, by section 38 of the Judiciary Act, gave exclusive jurisdiction to the High Court in regard  to  some of the matters mentioned in section 75 of the Constitution. Then, as regards the balance of the matters contained -in sections 75 and 76, we, by section 39 of the Judiciary Act, took away from the States Courts jurisdiction and &#39;substituted in its stead Federal jurisdiction. Now what are we doing by this Bill? Honorable senators will see that by clause 2 we simply provide that - </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that they held anything of the kind. All that they decided was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges had held that the Commonwealth Parliament had not the power to take away the jurisdiction under sections 75 and 76, and substitute Federal jurisdiction in its stead, with the right of appeal. In that case, an appeal was permitted from the State Court to the Privy Council, and all that the Privy Council held was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges was right in the view he took that the Federal Parliament had not the power of divesting and then investing; but not one word appears in the judgment of the Privy Council to show that they decided that these were not questions <inline font-style="italic">inter se.</inline> That is the position which my honorable friends opposite must face. In this connexion, I point out as to section 39 of the Judiciary Act, limiting the right of appeal so far as the exercise of Federal jurisdiction is concerned, that four of the Judges of the High Court held that the exercise by Parliament of that power of limiting the right of appeal was absolutely sound and good in law. I am at a loss to understand why honorable senators should be anxious to get away from the judgment of men in whom we have confidence, and who, by their legal erudition and research, have upheld the dignity of Australia and the best traditions of the English Bench in our own High Court. These men held, as I have explained, that this Parliament was right in exercising its right of limiting appeals in the way it has done. The Privy Council thought otherwise, but as to questions <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> arising the point was not dealt with by the Privy Council at all. I have already expressed the disappointment I feel in this matter that the High Court, having decided that in these income tax cases questions of constitutional powers <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> did arise, their judgment should not have been accepted as the Australian law, and respected accordingly. In leaving this Bill for the present, I will only say that we have not attempted to touch section 39 of the Judiciary Act, because it was not necessary for our purpose to do so, since we are quite content with the High Court judgment in that regard. But what we have done is to exercise other powers, and secure exclusive jurisdiction, which we are enabled to secure under section 76 of the Constitution, to which I have already referred. I ask my honorable friends opposite to look for a moment at section 74 of the Constitution. </para>

                    will see, in the light of what I have already said, that if it was a question &#34;howsoever arising&#34; - a mere question that occurred in any case - it would inevitably, by the terms of this Bill, if it came before the Supreme Court, find itself ultimately removed to the High Court. Section 74 goes on -  as to the limits
                    <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline>
                    of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of any State or States or as to the limits
                    <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline>
                    of the constitutional powers of any two or more States, unless the High Court shall certify that the question is one which ought to be determined by Her Majesty in Council.
                </para>
                <para>Then the certificate has to follow. In this connexion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator SymOn</inline> sought to differentiate between our High Court and the Supreme Court of the &#34;United States. There may be differences, but there is no difference i&#39;n this connexion. While it is possible that the High Court does not possess the whole of the powers of the Supreme Court of the United States, although it does possess nearly all of them, it is clearly appointed by this section as the Court to interpret questions as to the limits <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and the States, or of the States as between themselves. That is the important factor that we want to make absolutely certain of. Those are the terms of the Constitution which I have already referred to, which enable us to carry out section 74 in its full meaning and in accordance with its spirit. I come now to the Commonwealth Salaries Bill, which my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> said would be held to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> That was his general criticism of the measure, but he also went on to doubt the capacity of the Senate to entertain it at all, because he suggested that it was a taxing measure. I submit with, great respect, that there is not one trace of a taxing measure about it. It is a declaratory measure. All that it attempts to say is that if the States choose to exercise their rights of taxation under certain circumstances, then they are at liberty to do so ; in other words, that we are not going to interfere. But as for putting a tax on anybody by this Bill, we do not attempt anything of the kind. We simply say that if the States choose to exercise taxation on the salaries of officers of the Commonwealth, it shall not be taken - </para>

                        <para>- My honorable and learned friend knows that as the law now stands - I want to impress this upon honorable senators, because it will show them their responsibilities - if the Commissioner of Taxes of Victoria were to sue an officer of the Commonwealth, and the Supreme Court followed the Privy Council, as no doubt it would, it would then be competent for the officer to appeal to the High Court, when he would be held to be immune from taxation. If, on the other hand, the Supreme Court followed the High Court, it would-be competent for the Commissioner of Taxes to go to the Privy Council, which would declare that the officer was subject to taxation. That is the difficulty which we are in, and which we have to overcome with the least possible delay. It is with that object that the Commonwealth Salaries&#39; Bill is submitted. </para>

                        <para>- If that Bill is passed the States will be at liberty, subject to certain restrictions, to impose taxes Upon. Federal officers. My honorable friend also raised to that Bill the objection that it humiliates the High Court by declaring the Privy Council decision to be right. I submit that it does nothing of the kind. All that it says is that we acknowledge the law&#39; as laid down by the High Court that the State has no right to tax, but we claim, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> well argued, that that would create a privileged class. Therefore, so that a privileged class may not be created, we bring in a Bill, which practically foregoes or waives the Commonwealth exemption which was established by the High Court. </para>

                        <para>- No, it is a Commonwealth exemption, because the High Court, in their anxiety to protect all Commonwealth agencies, were fearful that this particular taxation by the State might interfere with the transaction of Commonwealth business and the free exercise of Commonwealth powers, and, in their jealous regard for those powers, they held that Commonwealth officers could not be so taxed. We are not disputing their law at all, but we are waiving the Commonwealth exemption which was thereby created. I have pointed out, first of all, that we have the direct authority.-, of, and, indeed, the suggestion, of the High Court&#34; for this legislation. I am sure honorable senators will not lightly disregard that feature. What we seek to declare by the terms of the Salaries Bill is that . where the Federal Legislature authorizes or permits State legislation it cannot be fettered or controlled by it. I do not feel justified at this late hour in quoting passages at length, as I did in my opening remarks on the 12th instant, to show the difficulties that the people of America were met with in this connexion, and to point out that, when by the decision of Chief Justice Marshall, in <inline font-style="italic">McCulloch</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Maryland,</inline> certain Commonwealth agencies were relieved of taxation in precisely the same circumstances as exist here now, the Congress of America enacted a law similar to what we are now proposing. My authority for this Bill is, first of all, the authority of our own High Court, and, secondly, what was done under the American Constitution, which, to all intents and purposes, is the same as ours. That- same law as enacted by Congress has been tested year after year in the- Courts, and I have set forth various authorities showing where it has been tested. The last case cited by me was in 190 1. It was there referred teas sound and good law, on the general principles then laid down. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said that it would still be competent for the Victorian Commissioner of Taxes to tax Federal members under that Bill. Of course honorable senators know the limitations of the Bill. I know that it is a. controversial question whether the allowances of members of this Parliament should be taxed, but it will no doubt be fully discussed in Committee, and possibly amendments may have to be considered in that connexion. The point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> made was, that .it would still be competent for the Commissioner of Taxes for Victoria to seek to recover from Federal members taxation on the income earned in Victoria. I have already pointed out that if that was attempted the Supreme Court of Victoria would, no doubt, follow the decision of the Privy Council, and then, by going to the High Court, we should be relieved. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite impossible to pass an Act of Parliament to say that there shall be no litigation, but persons are not going to litigate without some reasonable expectation of success. The answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> contention is that if any attempt of the kind is made this -Bill automatically removes the case to the High Court, and protection is thereby given. I should have liked to deal more fully with the question of implied power. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> referred to the implied powers of America, as established by case law, the value of which no one can deny. </para>

                        <para>- It is hardly in issue, and therefore I shall not deal with it at this stage, further than to say that there can be no reasonable doubt within this Senate as to the implied powers under the Constitution, which are essential to its effective carrying out. I have endeavoured to show honorable senators that, in this Bill, we are simply exercising constitutional powers. We are called upon to exhaust our Constitution before attempting any amendment of it. </para>

                        <para>- I shall be perfectly frank with my honorable friend. That question has not been considered by the Cabinet, and in those circumstances I do not feel justified in making any statement on it. But, of course, I cannot ignore the fact that it has been referred to so strongly and ably by several honorable senators. I submit that the Bills now before the Chamber have for their object the establishment of finality on the part of the High Court, that we are doing this in terms of the Constitution, and that we are called upon to exhaust our Constitution first. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council a question in regard to a measure in which most honorable senators have taken considerable interest, and that is whether he can fix a date that will be convenient to him on which a determination may be arrived at regarding the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill? </para>

I would suggest that the division should take place not later than 3 o&#39;clock on Friday week. </para>
