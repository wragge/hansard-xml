N. Carbines, an elector of Corio, because of his support of a certain candidate for parliamentary election, and, if so, whether he will communicate the result to the Senate ? </para>

                        <para>- When the matter was referred to by the honorable senator a little time ago, it was forwarded by me to the Crown Law officers for advice, and at the end of last week I was advised by them in a somewhat lengthy opinion that the circumstances set forth did not disclose a case which called for prosecution. In other words, we were advised that, in their opinion, a prosecution could not be maintained. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know whether there is any objection to that being done. Any honorable senator may see the opinion, and if that is not suitable I can lay it upon the table of the Library. There may or may not be an objection to laying it upon the table of the Senate. I do not know of any. A member of either House will be able to see the opinion, for I shall put it on the table of the Library. I may lay it upon the table of the Senate, but I will first ascertain if there is any valid reason why I should not do so. Any member of the Senate may see the opinion this afternoon if he wishes. </para>

                                <para>- In order to elucidate that point in connexion with the mail contract, and free it from the confusion of being regarded as a question of law, may I ask the Minister if what he intends to convey to the Senate is that the Government feel that they are not in a position to recover the £25,000, but that they may be able to recover in respect of whatever damage they may sustain by accepting a tender now at a higher rate than that which was offered by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Laing and Sons? </para>

                    <para class="block">The main measure - the parent Act - was passed on the 24th September, 1906, in the face of, as honorable senators now present will well remember, considerable opposition. Much reproach, and - shall I say? - scorn was heaped upon the Government because of its introduction. It was urged against it that it was too drastic and too high-handed in its terms, and that it would be a useless piece of legislation, because we had. not in our midst any combines or trusts, and certainly none of a mischievous character.. It was urged, indeed, that we were not so much as threatened with any trusts or combines of the kind. A little over twelve months have elapsed-- </para>

                            <para>- I said that we have now to reckon with combines or trusts which are alleged. to exist in regard to those matters. Of course, it was obvious, and has been so for the last two or three years at the very* least, that the trend of trade was such that it was inevitable that sooner or later we should have, to deal with those institutions, and the Government therefore deemed it wise . 'that a precautionary measure of the character of the existing Act, known colloquially as the Anti-Trust Act, should be introduced. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has already reproached us with the allegation that that Act has been a failure, or at least that it requires amendment. We admit at once that if the object of the Act is to be fully achieved, an amendment is required, not in regard to its fundamental features, or the fundamental offences which are made punishable under it, but only so far as additional machinery is necessary to facilitate the procuring of .evidence in proof of those offences. The problem of effectively dealing with trusts or combines is of considerable difficulty and complexity, <inline font-style="italic">hut,</inline> notwithstanding that, it is the bounden duty of the Government to grapple firmly and drastically with them if they do exist to the detriment of public interests. It will be. the duty of every Government, in the interests of the Commonwealth, where  experience shows or suggests that the object of the parent Act is not being achieved, to follow relentlessly every evasion of the Act with the design of ultimately securing effective legislation, even should this involve amendment year after ' year. No Government ner:d be ashamed, in view of the difficulties of the question, to introduce amending legislation* where it is necessary to do so in the light, of experience. </para>

Honorable senators will recollect that there is a section in this Act of the most drastic description which not merely enables every possible information to be obtained and documents to  be procured,  but which prevents any one, who is concerned in a matter of this kind, from refusing to discover all documents or to answer questions that may be put. to 'him in respect to the matters at issue on the ground that they are likely to incriminate him. Everybody concerned in any proceedings that may be brought in respect of an infringement of the Act is liable in-, respect to the discovery of documents, and is compelled to reply to all questions, even if the result of his answers may be' to render him liable to a criminal prosecution.

                        was obviously under a misapprehension when he made that statement, because reference to section 11 of the principal Act will show that the sub-section which he quoted refers only to civil cases, and not to prosecutions or criminal cases at all. The honorable senator was obviously under the impression that those broad and general powers of securing information existed in regard to all the offences under the Act. The main object of this Bill is to give to the Government - the Attorney-General - the powers which my honorable friend thought were contained in the existing law, and to make them apply not only to civil but also to criminal matters. The Bill seeks, amongst other objects, to confer those powers. I have mentioned on more than one occasion that the Crown Law Department, when alleged combines or trusts have been brought under notice, has discovered the greatest difficulty in securing the necessary evidence upon which to found prosecutions. The officers who were concerned in efforts to secure that evidence are men of experience and skill. One serious difficulty which arose was that, although the various combinations must have had for their foundation some agreement or contract, the Government were quite unable to secure either the original or a copy of that agreement or contract, or the necessary evidence in regard to it.

We have had a very curious revelation in connexion with the inquiries made concerning the Confectionery Trust. When seen on the subject, the solicitor to the Trust apparently in a very friendly way, was quite prepared to admit that there was a combination amongst the confectionery manufacturers, and to let the Government have a copy of the agreement, but it transpired that this particular  combination of individuals confined its operations to the State of Victoria. </para>

I believe that similar Acts are in force in the other States, and I have particularly noticed the Queensland Act. The Act to which I refer is the Victorian Trade Unions Act of 1890. I quote this Act as it is the one with which I am most familiar, and the one depended upon by the Confectionery Combine. I find that according to section 3 - </para>

                            <para>- It distinctly says so. I have just read the section. In view of the American experience in connexion with combines and trusts, I make no apology for the introduction of this Bill. Honorable senators will be aware that year after year, during the last twenty years, efforts have been made in America, not only by the Federal Government, but by various States Governments, to render their antitrust legislation more effective, and that it is only by recent legislation that that has been accomplished. Notwithstanding this- fact, as we all know, the United States are the home of trusts and combines, and they still flourish there. I am free to admit that a great difference exists between America and ourselves in this connexion, because the great carrying companies and railway companies there have been enabled, by means of preferences and discriminations, to assist the creation of trusts, and to combat all efforts made to restrict them. But it is singular to note 'that, although there, is drastic legislation on the statute-books, not only of Congress, but of the States Parliaments, by the exercise of extreme ingenuity the trusts have been able from time to time to evade the full effect of them. Legislation of this kind in America was started in 1887 with the Inter-State Commerce Act, which forbids any restraint of trade on the part of carriers or shippers in regard to Inter-State commerce. It also prohibits arrangements for -discrimination in preferences. Shortly afterwards, in 1890, there followed the Sherman Act, which declared trusts and combinations in restraint of trade illegal, and persons engaged in them guilty of misdemeanour. In 1894, the Wilson Act was passed to prohibit, in regard  ato  importations, combines in restraint of trade. Then again, in 1903, what was called the Expedition Act was passed for the purpose of insuring a more expeditious dealing with prosecutions against trusts. In the same year, the Commerce and Labour Act was passed, and a very important Statute, known as the Elkin Act, which prohibited rebates, drawbacks, and' discriminations, and declared these to be unlawful. </para>

No less than twenty-seven States and Territories of the United States have passed more or less drastic anti-trust laws.

This leads me to ask the special attention of honorable senators to the drastic character of the American legislation on this subject.  1  have already mentioned that the United States Commerce Act was passed 'in- 1887. It applies to all common carriers engaged in Inter-State commerce. I do not pretend to give the wording of the provisions ot these Acts, but I have made -a brief note in accordance with their tenor, and honorable senators are, of course, at liberty to consult the Acts themselves. This Act provides that all charges for transport must  be reasonable, and prohibits pools or combinations in Inter-State traffic. It. provides for the appointment of an Inter- State </para>

Under section 20, this Commission is given extensive powers of investigation of the affairs of all common carriers subject to the Act. The Commission is enabled not only to require reports from all common carriers, subject to the Act, but -to fix the time and prescribe the manner in which such reports shall be made, and further, to require from such carriers specific answers to al} questions upon which the Commission may need information. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The Act sets out the form in which these several corporations shall formulate their reports, and says, moreover, that these reports must contain such information in relation to rates or regulations concerning fares or freights, agreements, arrangements or contracts for common carriers as the Commission may require. I especially point that out - that these reports must contain such information regarding fares, freights, or agreements, arrangements or contracts with other common carriers, as _ the Commission may require. Further, the Commission may, within its own discretion, require all common carriers to have. an uniform system of accounts, and mav prescribe such uniform system. Now . I come to the Act of 1906!. The section of which I have just given an epitome was amended by a law of .29th June, 1906, which gives still more extensive powers of  investigation to the Commission. Under that law of 1906 these reports have to be  made on oath, and any failure to file the report within the prescribed time, or to make specific answer to any question authorized by the section itself, that is to say, any question on which the Commission may need information, -is punishable by a fine of $100 per day. The Commission may also require Inter-State carriers to file monthly reports of their earnings and expenses, or special reports within a specified period under a similar penalty. The Commission has access at all times to all accounts, records, and memoranda to be kept by Inter- State carriers, and it is unlawful for a carrier to keep any other accounts, records, or memoranda than those prescribed or approved by the Commission. The Commission may furthermore employ agents or examiners who have authority under the order of the Commission to inspect and examine all accounts and records kept by any common carrier. The penalty for refusing or failing to keep such accounts or to submit such accounts to the inspection of the Commission, or any of its authorized agents or examiners is $500 for each offence, and for every day of the continuance of the offence. Any failure to make true or correct entries, or any mutilation thereof, is a misdemeanour punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 or not more than $5,000 or. imprisonment for from one to three years; or both fine and imprisonment. Compliance with these requirements mav be secured by a writ . of mandamus issued bv the circuit or district Courts. The special agents or examiners appointed by the Commission have also power to administer oaths, examine witnesses and receive evidence. The Act also contains other provisions with regard to the protection of witnesses. My honorable friends will thus see that nothing can be more drastic or comprehensive than the powers conferred upon this Inter-State Commission in regard to the 'securing of information that it may seek or require as to the management, organization or carrying on of these combines or trusts. </para>

                            <para>- That is so undoubtedly. I am describing these American Acts for the purpose of showing exactly what has been done in the United States. It has been urged against this measure that it is high-handed and drastic, and that it proposes to make wide and alarming inroads upon, the liberty of the subject. I reply, that as regards common carriers, all these drastic powers are already given in the United States. I also point out that, by the terms of the 1903 Act, a Bureau of Corporations has been established which has for its object the investigation of the affairs of corporations generally. By section 6 of the Act, a' similar obligation is imposed in regard to making full disclosures of transactions and answering questions, and submitting books and records for inspection as was imposed upon railroad and carrying; companies in the United States by the Act of 1887.. In February, 1903, the United1 States Congress established a Department of Commerce and Labour. . Section 6 of the Act of 1903 enacted that there should" be in this Department a bureau, to be called' the Bureau of Corporations, with an officer known as the Commissioner of Corporations at its head. This Commissioner has power to make investigations into the organization, conduct and management, and* the business of any joint stock company, or corporation, or corporate companies engaged in Inter- State commerce, except common carriers, who are dealt with under the Inter-State Act of 1887. It is provided that the information so obtained, or as much thereof as the  President  may direct, may be made public. In order to accomplish these purposes, the Commissioner has, with respect to all corporations or combinations engaged in Inter-State commerce, all the powers which are conferred by the Act already referred to upon the InterState Commission. That is to say, he has all the powers that are contained in' the Act of 1887, and any amendments up to- 1903. I have described these precedents to show the extent to which the1 Congress of the United States has seen fit to go with the object of exercising some -control over corporations, and over trade and commerce as affected by them. It is the duty of this Bureau of Corporations to issue reports from time to time ; and, although it has the large powers to which I have already referred, yet it. is seeking additional powers. Amongst other things, I notice, from its Report of 1905, that reference is there made to a scheme 'or plan which was proposed, whereby a corporation should be permitted to carry on its business, only under a Federal licence ; and, on page 18 of volume 26 of the Department of Commerce and Labour Reports they say - </para>

                    <para class="block">My honorable friend will be aware of the work that has already been done by this Bureau of Corporations in the "United States. I speak subject to correction when I say that the transactions which recently took place in reference to the Standard Oil Company were the outcome of the investigations made by the Commissioner of Corporations. The drastic powers that he had enabled him to enter, and investigate, and search, as deeply as he chose, into the affairs of the various railroad companies, oil companies, and other corporations, with the result that we have recorded the colossal fine of something like ^5,500,000 for breaches of the anti-trust laws of the United States. These investigations enabled the Commissioner to reveal  the most alarming scandals in connexion with trusts. Amongst other things it was shown that in 1899 the value of the assets of the Standard Oil Company was £5,500,000. In 1906 the value had risen to £74,500,000 in value, and the total profits earned in the meantime were something like £98,000,000. The dividends distributed amounted to something like ^61,500,000. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; the Bureau of Corporations no doubt controls corporations only. But those corporations in the United States, as my honorable friends will be well aware, have in some cases been enabled to defy Congress, and. to take into their own hands the control and direction of a large part of the trade and commerce of the United States. . It is our duty - it is the duty of the Government and of the Commonwealth Parliament  - to  see that the public of this, country are not menaced by such colossal and octopus organizations. I do not think that it is possible, by reason of the fact that the railways of the States of Australia are owned by- the Governments of the States, for trusts and combines in this country to approach the tyrannical powers or the magnitude of the American corporations. But they can be, perhaps, not less mischievous within their own more limited circle. The Government proposes - provided, of course they are enabled to do so by the passage of this measure, . to attach one «or two officers to the Attorney-General 's Department, with a view of investigating these cases of combines or monopolies which <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> are engaged in committing offences against our anti-trust law. The special duty will be cast upon these officers </para>

                    <para>Df  making investigations. Where evidence can be procured by the making of rigid investigations, they will procure it, and upon it will be founded the necessary prosecutions where the evidence is sufficient. I wish honorable senators to understand me when I say that I do not for one moment assert- that all trusts are necessarily bad. We have good trusts, and we have bad trusts. As a matter of fact, in the United States they do not attempt to discriminate between good and bad trusts. According to the' Sherman Act, where any restraint of trade exists by means of a combination an offence is committed. But under the Commonwealth law, there is a distinct discrimination, and an offence is only committed in regard to those -corporations or combines that are detrimental to .the interests of the public. In those cases only do we desire to prosecute. </para>

                            <para>- That may be a good trust. It may be quite legitimate to control trusts and to regulate trade in such a way as to pay a fair return on capital and fair wages to the workers. That in itself may be a perfectly legitimate operation, and that would not be regarded, I think, as furnishing evidence of the existence of a vicious or injurious trust. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot stop to argue that at the present time. I am merely laying down the general principle that it is possible for good trusts and bad trusts to exist, and that the object of our anti-trust legislation is only to get at the mischievous or bad trusts. Clause  4  of the Bill refers to sections1  4,  5,  7,. 8,  and  9  of the principal Act. In order to illustrate fully what I mean, I wish to draw the attention of honorable senators to the terms of the Act, and to show how we seek to get at only vicious trusts.

                    <para>It will be seen, therefore, that in submitting the Bill we are not attempting novel legislation, but are only seeking to apply to trusts and combines that machinery which has proved itself eminently successful in the cast of imports. We do not propose to take more drastic powers as regards searching books and acquiring information than are contained in well-known American legislation. We are, therefore, not attempting any greater infringement of the liberty of the subject than the circumstances of the case completely warrant. We do not aim at discouraging individual effort, individual competition, or individual enterprise ; but we do aim at controlling, as far as possible, or, if possible, destroying, vicious combinations which are detrimental to the interests of the Commonwealth - which means the interests of the public. We are seeking to control them thoroughly and effectively so far as we can, and thereby to establish fair dealing. But we cannot look with equanimity on the growth of combines or trusts such as I have referred to without asking Parliament to make some effort at the very earliest stages of the Commonwealth to place them under proper and effective control. In all these circumstances I submit to honorable senators the measure for the amendment of the parent Act with some amount of confidence, and in the hope that the object which we have in view - the public good - will be achieved by its passage. </para>

                        SYMON (South Australia) [4.17]. - It may be well upon a Bill of this description, although a little further time for consideration might be valuable after the second reading has been moved, that
                        <inline font-style="italic">any</inline>
                        of us who have a clear understanding of what the Bill means should at the earliest moment express our views. I therefore take the opportunity now of offering some remarks for the consideration of honorable senators, following as closely as possible the speech to which the Senate has just listened from the Vice-President of the Executive Council. In two or three respects I agree wilh what he has said. In the first place, I suppose that we are all .animated by the desire to promote, so far as we can, the industrial and trading prosperity of the Commonwealth, and also to prevent the possibility of injury being done to the consuming public within the Commonwealth by a too inordinate desire on the part of those engaged in trade and commerce to accumulate wealth in a hurry. It is also common ground with all of us to deprecate in the strongest possible way any organizations, known by the denomination of combines or trusts, which might be in their working and management inimical »to the best interests of the people of the country. I agree also with the honorable ' senator that there may be good and bad combines. \ou cannot predicate of an association, whether of companies or_ of ' individuals, that it is vicious or likely to prove harmful to the community simply because it happens to be a combination or arrangement amongst a number of different individuals or different corporations. To say that would really be absurd, because every partnership is a combination of individuals.

                            <para>- That is true. I am obliged to my honorable friend for reminding me of it. I shall have occasion shortly to allude to the point of view which he suggests. We are all agreed that where anything that is vicious and detrimental to the public - any thing 'of evil effect - is shown to exist, an effort ought to be made in some direction and by. some means to put an end to it. It does not matter what shape it takes. If that evil result is produced by a combination of companies or of individuals, undoubtedly no effort ought to be spared to bring about legislation that will grapple with it. and,  when we get that legislation, to bring it into operation. I say that now", as I said it when the Bill which is .sought to be amended was under the consideration of the Senate twelve months ago. I do not think that any man, unless, perhaps, some one who is himself concerned in a mischievous trust or combination, would be prepared to s.\y that he was not anxious to bring about and cany out legislation to put an end to mischievous combinations of any kind. As we are all agreed upon that subject, the only real point for consideration is whether we already have machinery which, if properly carried out, ought to be efficacious, or whether the Government are justified, whenever they are called upon to enforce the law as it exists, in immediately hanging back - that is the timidity of which I spoke  - and saying, " Oh, no, we are not going to try to bring the existing law into operation. We are going to let things slide until we can- get a further amendment of the law." </para>

                            <para>- Yes, when you are stuck. But what some of us said when, the matter was under discussion recently was that you can pretend to be stuck in order to bring out the other horse. The Vice-President of the Executive Council says that I reproached him: - I. hope that I did not do it in an unkindly way - or reproached the Government, with not_ having brought into force the existing legislation. He then, in an emphatic utterance, said that the Government were going to firmly apply the law, and to put a stop to iniquitous or mischievous trusts or combinations. They mean, said he, to go on, to assert the law, even if that should involve-and this was a kind of anti-climax - amendments of the legislation year after year. That is what I complain of. That is the attitude of the Government to which I alluded the other day. I am glad that what was said then on both sides of the Senate has stirred them up to consider the matter. I stated then that their attitude reminded me of the class of American politicians who are apt to say, "I am for the law, but agin' its enforcement." That was the only reproach which I offered. What I said was, in effect, that the Government seemed to believe too much in the virtue of the printed Statute, and too little in the efficacy of carrying it into effect. I thought, and still think, that, with regard to the particular matter brought under the notice of the Senate on that occasion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> there was quite sufficient to justify the initiation of proceedings, if the Government thought that proceedings under that particular Act were applicable. Of course, upon that point they must be guided by their own law officers. I consider that there was ample provision in the existing law to deal with that particular case. I am obliged to the Vice-President of the Executive Council for pointing out the limitation upon the power of discovery in section11 of the principal Act. It is quite true that that limitation does exist, but there would have been no such limitation if the Government, through their Attorney-General, had sanctioned the taking of proceedings by some individual - by for instance, those who were refused coal. </para>

                            <para>- Probably. I am not questioning that position, but if the facts were as reported in the newspapers - and the persons who made those statements would have been bound to depose to them when placed in the witness box - the existing legislation was amply sufficient to meet the case. I referred on that occasion to the provisions of section11 of the principal Act, and I frankly acknowledge that the limitation to which the Vice-President of the Executive Council refers does exist, but that could have been got over. The Government were entitled to say, "If you who make these complaints in the press are personally injured, as you must be if your complaints are well founded, we will sanction your taking proceedings, and there will be no bar." </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, the Vice-President of the Executive Council knows that it was only in that respect that any remarks of mine which he regarded as reproaches were used. Then my honorable friend says, "We have had this Act, and we all thought that it was going to meet the cases which were then under the contemplation of the Legislature." One of my main objections to the Bill which is now an Act was that it sought to interfere - and this is a matter to which my honorable friend referred in passing -with the rights of the States, because it not merely dealt with foreign corporations, but embraced trading or financial corporations formed within the Commonwealth. As at present every State has its own law with regard to the establishment of companies and the formation of corporations, it was pointed out that if  a  law of this kind were, applied within the States you might have under State jurisdiction a combination of individuals on one side of the street carrying on a mischievous business to the detriment of the community, and on the other side of the street a combination of corporations which the Commonwealth legislation professed to touch, while it could not touch individuals who were doing mischief, lt was shown that the law was one-sided in that it dealt or attempted to deal only with corporations. I mention that in passing, to show that the objections taken to the Bill which is now an Act were not exactly those to which the Vice-President of the Executive Council refers as a justification for this measure, but were taken very largely because of the inequality and unevenness of the legislation, and its practical inapplicability to that sphere - the States sphere - which it was intended to cover, and where, if it worked at all, it would produce those anomalous results to which I have, casually referred. Having mentioned those general matters, the Vice-President of the Executive Council commends this Bill because he says that it introduces no novelty in our legislation hi relation to matters of  this sort. That statement was not very well considered or well-advised. The provisions of this Bill, are, I venture to say, in relation to this subject-matter, absolutely unique. Similar provisions do not' appear on the statute-book of any. other country, so far as I am aware. I took the liberty of interrupting my honorable and learned friend to ask him whether there was any American legislation like this. The honorable senator said, in reply, that he was going into the matter very thoroughly, and I anticipated that he would mention some) legislation corresponding to it. But the honorable senator mentioned none. He sat down without submitting to the Senate anything at all parallel to the clauses in this very short Bill in relation to the subject- matter with which it is supposed to deal. The honorable senator referred to the provisions of the Inter-State Commerce Act of America - and let me say parenthetically that if there is any country in which we could expect to find a precedent for legislation of this description, it is that land of rings, trusts and combines, the United States of America. The Vice-President of the Executive Council will probably agree with me that we need not look for help in this matter to the legislation of any' other country, and that if we "do not find such legislation in the United States we are not likely to find it anywhere else. The honor, able senator referred to the Inter-State Commerce Act, and to the powers conferred upon the Inter-State Commerce Commission by the original Act of 1887, and the Act passed last year in the United States. The first observation to be made in this connexion is that the American Inter-State Commerce Commission is a Court. It is a tribunal, and the power given to that body to call for evidence of every kind, for the production of books belonging to the parties who come before it, or might come before it, are powers incidental to those of a tribunal that can regulate and control a matter of the kind. It is an extension of just the same power as that which is contained in section 11 of the Australian Industries Preservation Act, with the limited scope which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has rightly pointed out. Once a matter comes before the Court, so that on its responsibility the Court can say whether or not  a  particular discovery should be made, I should be prepared in every way possible to assist the Vice-President of the Executive Council in securing the fullest powers of discovery, and in taking away all privileges in regard to statements likely to criminate. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, and doubtless the reference is to the shipping ring which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> de, fended just now, and whose operations, I think, require investigation more than anything else within the borders of Australia. But if these combinations and others enumerated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> who, I think, mentioned particularly a confectionery trust, do exist in Australia, it only shows either that no attempt has been made to enforce the provisions of the Australian Industries Preservation Act, or that they have not frightened people from entering into improper combinations. I was referring to the fact that the position of the American Inter-State Commerce Commission under the Inter-State Commerce Acts of  1887  and  1906  has no bearing upon this particular subject, because, in this Bill, what is proposed is that before a prosecution is commenced there may be an investigation of the whole of the books and affairs of a trading corporation or firm, because it is not limited to corporations except in so far as there may be a limitation imposed by the original Act. Under this Bill, before any proceedings are commenced, persons may be obliged to answer questions and produce documents under a penalty of  £50,  merely if . the Comptroller-General believes - and it does not say on . what grounds or whether they are to be reasonable grounds - or thinks that an offence has been committed. I say that there is no parallel to that kind of legislation anywhere. I have said, that I am prepared to assist in every possible way to give these powers to a Court after proceedings have been instituted, just as in America these very wide and drastic, powers have been given to the Inter-State Commerce Commission, which is a Court. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly we might. I put it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> that under this Bill there might be a thousand men harassed throughout the Commonwealth, whilst only one prosecution might follow. Where proceedings are actually commenced, I say we might make the law as drastic as we please for the purpose of securing evidence. We might put the men charged in the box, and make it obligatory on them to answer questions. We might make it, not merely permissive that they should give evidence in their own behalf, but that they should be compulsory and compellable witnesses for the prosecution. That is the remedy. But I say that if we make the provision set out in this Bill, we may harass a thousand manufacturers and traders of all kinds, and then have no prosecution, or only one. </para>

                            <para>- We might have a provision to penalize persons who make such statements with the object of bringing the law into operation and do not substantiate them. I agree that it is most mischievous that statements should be made by irresponsible persons to the press, and agitations got up without foundation. What I am afraid of is that if such an agitation is got up, there is under this Bill endless possibilities of inflicting injury, inconvenience, and a harassing condition of affairs upon scores of persons against whom there is no possibility of an offence being proved. The Government sends these three or four officers, who are to act as detectives, into the counting; houses and offices of the manufacturers and merchants all over the country, simply because the Comptroller-General thinks or believes - it . may be without any grounds- whatever- </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree with that. But it is not proposed, under this Bill, to impose penalties on account of what has taken place after investigation before a Court. If the Comptroller-General thinks that an offence  has been committed - the Bill does not say upon reasonable grounds, or after hearing evidence, or after calling the man who is accused before the Comptroller-General: - a&gt; penalty may be imposed. </para>

                            <para>- The Comptroller- General is not even made a judge. If a person says, " I must decline to answer that question," he is liable to a penalty of £50, and the magistrates, before whom the proceedings are taken with a view of enforcing the penalty, will have to impose it without inquiring into the validity of the man's reason one way or the other. My desire is, as I have said, once the proceedings are begun, to assist in every way in giving the most ample powers to the Court to require evidence to be produced. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> in that respect. But if this means, not that evidence is to be obtained in a proper manner, but that the Comptroller-General is to make use of the press, by indicating paragraphs which have been published, that is the sort of evidence that I would not give five minutes' attention to. </para>

                            <para>- I think it is a very mischievous Bill - a Bill which, if it becomes law, will simply cause a very serious interference with the trade of' this country. The Minister's answer to that is that we can trust the Comptroller-General not to proceed except when he has good grounds. My view is that we ought not to give these extended powers. It would be very much better to restrict the powers within reasonable limits, so that no one can abuse them, particularly when we are dealing with that which is so sensitive as the trade and commerce of the country. Proposed new section 15c in clause 4 deals with the action of the Comptroller-General when a complaint has .been made to him in writing. There, again, it does seem rather unfair that the Comptroller-General should act upon a complaint, if he believes it to be well founded, without any hearing of the other party. We should surely give him an opportunity of having the party before him, and hearing what he has to say, before these very strong powers are put into force. There may be no foundation for the complaint. But the complaint having been made, the Comptroller-General is to send his officers to explore the books and the accounts of the accused. </para>

My honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> sought to show that such powers as this Bill proposes to confer are now exercised in the United States. I have shown that the special powers conferred upon a tribunal like the Inter-State Commission of the United States have no relation to such powers being conferred upon a Government officer. My honorable friend also suggested that there was some precedent for these powers, and referred to the Commerce and Labour Act passed by Congress in 1903. </para>

                            <para>- That is what it was. It was a kind of Royal Commission to obtain evidence with a view to legislation. And that, of course,- is a perfectly proper thing. It is quite  right  to inquire with a view of obtaining information to be submitted to Parliament in considering legislation. But it is not a proper thing to make such an inquiry the foundation for an investigation . into the books of trading concerns, manufacturers, or merchants, with a view to prosecutions. Of course, if the information becomes public, we cannot prevent people making use of it in  any  way they please. But that is not the object. The Bureau was established, like our own Tariff Commission, for the purpose of netting information to enable Parliament to legislate. The information becomes public  just  in the same way as the information obtained by our Tariff Commission becomes public - </para>

                            <para>- We should not expect to find it in Great Britain to the same extent as in ' America, which is said to be <inline font-style="italic">far excellence</inline> a country of rings and combinations. There is none in England, as my honorable friend reminds me, and there is none in America, where certainly we should expect to find it. I do not know whether honorable senators think it is a good thing to embody in a Bill of this kind the principle contained in the proposed new section,  15A,  which means practically that every man is to be presumed to be guilty until he proves himself to be innocent. Of course, what it does mean is that the moment a company embarks in business it can be brought into Court as one which is <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> guilty until it proves its innocence. That is a very necessary thing in many respects, and in many branches of the administration of the Customs Act. But, surely, it is not necessary in matters of this kind, where some effort ought to be made, not by a person who is. communicating irresponsible paragraphs to a newspaper, but by some responsible person, who will get into a witness-box, and, under the sanction of an bath, state facts upon which proceedings may be founded, and unless in a case such as that we ought not to presume any trader to be guilty until he discharges himself of that imputation. </para>

                            <para>- What is the good of my. honorable friend making that remark ? The qualification is the one which is contained in the Customs Act, and that is that the intent must be proved. The moment a man goes into Court he is presumed to be guilty, and if they fail to prove the intent he may still be thought by the public, or those with whom he has to do, to be guilty of the charge of being engaged in a combination.' I think that we ought to read the Bill a second time, even if only to affirm the intention of the Senate in regard to trusts and combinations which are supposed to be mischievous. But I venture to say  that this is a measure without precedent, and one which if passed will prove inimical and hurtful to the best interests of the traders and manufacturers in this country. We ought to be slow to agree to these clauses at all, and certainly slow to agree to them without considerable amendment with a view to their improvement. </para>

                LEDGER (Queensland) £5.8]. - If it is true, as has been said here so often, that almost anything can be grown in Australia, I dare say that it is possible to grow dates. I believe that, experimentally, a few date trees have been grown in or near Barcaldine, in Queensland. When I was there quite recently I was told about the few date trees which are grown .in that locality. Possibly the Minister, with that exemplary diligence which he has displayed in the conduct of this Bill, mav be able to find in Australia another place where date trees have been grown, and where they can be grown successfully. I have searched in vain for such indications outside the little district of Barcaldine. We should be furnished with more definite information than is contained in the report of the experts before we are asked to approve of this bounty. Is it to be paid upon the production of the dates in a natural state or in a marketable condition? I have not yet heard of a single place in Australia where a date has been made marrketable. .We are entitled to receive from the Minister some evidence that the grant of this bounty is likely to be attended with a reasonable degree of success. . I have not yet heard of any place in the world where a bounty to the amount of £15,000 has been voted on the mere assertion of experts that an article might possibly be grown in a locality. I may possibly again lay myself open to the charge of looking out for Queensland all the time, and yet sometimes voting against its interests. I do not care two straws about that. . Notwithstanding the fact 'that a few date palms are growing in the central portions of Queensland-

                    <para>- Then, no doubt, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will be able to point to the fact that there are vast oases in some portions of that awful locality, where even date palms are growing. But can he say whether any dates from those palms, apart from those grown for experimental purposes, have been put upon the market as a marketable transaction ? There are a few date palms growing in Queensland, and, according to the report, the character of the climate and soil in that particular locality goes to show that if a man has faith, .and if some amount of industry and capital is put into the industry, possibly the dates may become a marketable article. I do not know whether the Minister of Home Affairs will wait until he hears more of the possibilities of the date palm in South Australia and Queensland. I am giving the extent of my local knowledge in regard to Queensland. I believe that what I have stated has also been mentioned in the experts' reports. Of "course experts have a remarkable strength, or weakness, for giving evidence in favour of that particular industry, or occupation, or department of which they are in charge, in order to exalt its importance. I am delighted to hear now that Queensland has not a monopoly of a few date palms. I have had an opportunity of travelling over a large section of the State of Queensland. I have seen its mining and agricultural districts from the Gulf' of Carpentaria to Brisbane, and during the whole of my travels I only heard of a few date palms in the State. Possibly now that I have drawn attention to the fact that we really have .a few struggling or straggling date palms- </para>

We generally seek it somewhere else, as honorable senators opposite probably know. As South Australian senators have something to say from their personal knowledge about the prospects of the industry in that State, no doubt the intelligence of the Chamber will be added to. and we shall obtain some light on the subject. I see no sufficient reason so far for offering this bounty of £15,000 for dates. </para>

Under those provisions the administration will be properly safeguarded. A considerable industry in date production exists in other countries, and if Australia can grow dates there is no reason why we should not offer some inducement to our people to endeavour to cultivate them for the Australian market. It takes five or six years before the tree comes into bearing, and even then it is from twenty to twenty-five years before it attains its full bearing capacity.

                    <para>.- I have asked a great many gentlemen the very simple, but to me very interesting, question of how the dates become dates. Are they taken green from the tree, or do they dry naturally into the very nutritious and delicious article that we see in the shops? Is any process gone through to dry them? </para>

                        <para>- Are they dried into dates like grapes are dried into raisins? Before grapes are dried into raisins they require to be carefully dipped in a solution containing soda and other ingredients. They have then to be dried in the sun, but if rain is allowed to touch them, their value for raisins is destroyed. The clouds have to be watched, and the moment there isa sign of rain, all the trays have to be taken inside or covered with tarpaulins. How is a man to proceed in cultivating the date palm? Is very rich land required? I understand that date palms are of great size. As only 150 apple trees - in some cases 165 - are planted to the acre, I cannot conceive how it is possible to grow 500 date palms to the acre. What part of Australia will they grow in? Is it only in the direction of Oodnadatta? That is a very unsettled district. </para>

                        <para>- If that is so, and it is news to me, why on earth should we give a bounty for planting date palms on arid.  and bad land? If there is a decent industry in the cultivation of the date palm, would it npt be taken up without this bounty? Shall we not be attracting the energies and capital of white men away from industries which pay much better? Can we ever make a permanent industry of it? I should say not. Although a proportion of this great continent may be in the tropics, it does not at all follow that it is capable, as many honorable senators suggest, of growing every tropical plant that we have ever heard of. I am satisfied that we shall find that Australia is not suitable for the production of some of the articles on which we have agreed to grant bounties. It is possible that other tropical countries may be suitable for the- cultivation of the date palm. Apparently the Minister has to depend in these matters on the information given by experts, but in this case I think the experts have not looked up their case, have not given much attention to it, and have entirely overlooked the practical side of the proposal. I think that in this case, as in the case of some of the other items, even the expert information supplied has been absolutely misleading. . We have gone quite far enough with this Bill ; we have voted for the granting of enormous sums of money as bounties, and I am not prepared to support this item. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> speech has brought me to my feet. The honorable senator may be a very good lawyer, but I do not think he is much of. an agriculturist. I do not profess to know much about date-growing, but in my travels in South Australia I have seen date palms growing well at several places. I do not think that their successful cultivation- depends so much upon a particular character of soil as upon a sufficient water supply. There are artesian bores where the date palm is grown in South Australia, and these provide a sufficient supply of water. I am justified in saying that splendid dates are grown in South Australia. I have eaten them; they are really good, and I am only sorry  that I have not some to give to the honorable senators as a sample. We have in connexion with this item heard the old  cry,  which has been raised dozens of times during the consideration of the Bill, that we are proposing to squander a lot of  money,  and I again point out that, if the articles on which it is proposed to grant these bounties are not produced, there will be no money spent under the Bill. If, by offering  to  spend this money, we shall induce people to go in for the production of articles that are not at present being produced in Australia, we shall be doing good work without any risk at all. I have much pleasure in supporting the item. </para>

                    (New South Wales) [5.35].- I cannot but regard this Bill, and particularly this proposal, as a mischievous attempt to induce people to abandon reasonable industries, and attempt to obtain a living  at the public expense by mere outside experiments. The date palm is not a tropical palm. It is found chiefly in Arabia and other portions of Western Asia and in Northern Africa. Small groups of date palms are found surrounding springs in oases in desert regions. I must say that I have no knowledge of the elaborate cultivation of the date palm in  any  country, and if it is so cultivated it is probably in Syria, from which the largest supply of dates is received. I complain that the item is submitted to the Committee in a most crude form. Dates have no earthly value unless they are treated. The fruit as it comes from, the tree is of no value, and it must be sweated and pressed, and undergo different processes.

                        <para>- I think it is the duty of the Minister to advise us in this matter. I am opposed to the proposal  because  of ' the exceedingly crude manner in which it is submitted, though I should be prepared to vote for it if I were supplied with information which, in my opinion, would warrant me in doing so. I do not believe that the date palm can be grown successfully in Northern Australia. In the coastal districts of the north the atmosphere is damp, and is, therefore, unsuited to the growth of the date palm as we know it. Inland we get to the plateau country, which possesses a dry climate, suitable for the growth of the palm, but I' believe there are few there and no sufficient supply of permanent water. </para>

                        <para>- If the date palm can be grown successfully in Australia only by putting down bores to secure artesian supplies, I am afraid there is but a poor look-out for any one who may expect to obtain this bounty. In the inland districts we may find a suitable atmosphere, but I am doubtful about the suitability of the soil, because I have no means of comparing the sand of the desert of Sahara with the soil of the interior of North Queensland. If we have to go to Central Australia to grow dates, we must consider the bearing on the proposal of the question of carriage, an important matter which very many people overlook. </para>

If the Minister would, say whether the proposed bounty is to be granted for green dates or for the sweated, pressed, and packed dates of commerce, we might know what to do, but with the information at present before me I am unable to support . the item. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not altogether agree with the attitude <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has adopted in connexion with this item. It seems .to me that it is in quite a different class from most of the items we have been discussing. It is probable that the Government have introduced this item with the idea of doing something towards lessening the death-roll of the unfortunate people who endeavour to make their way from north to south through the centre of Australia.. I remember that, in reading one of the reports by a South Australian botanist or explorer, I found he proposed to plant date seeds along the line between Adelaide and Port Darwin, and in the middle of the continent. For some unfortunate reason the seeds did not come to hand, and so he did not plant them. From what I know of the habits of the date palm, I am inclined to think that it would grow very well in that country, and that if it were planted good results might follow to Australia generally. I believe the date palm could not be successfully cultivated on our tropical coast-line, where we have a heavy rainfall, whilst the attempt to cultivate it might be successful in the interior of Australia. I. direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that we have passed bounties in respect of certain items where the plants come into bearing in five, seven, or eight years. Here we have a plant which, if sown from seed, does not come into bearing for from ten to twelve years, and, according to one authority, does not come into full bearing for from twenty to twenty-five years. I notice that the bounty is spread over a period of fifteen years, and, in view of the" fact I have mentioned, that period would be "too short a time, unless it is the intention of the Government that the bounty shall be spread over a period of fifteen years from the date when the first of the trees earning the bounty come into bearing. That is a matter to which the Government might give some attention. A much more serious matter is that, in spite of my interjection, the Minister not only declined to give any information as to the form in which the dates must be presented to earn the bounty, but, further, said that he would not agree to make any provision on the subject in the Bill, as the matter ought to be left to regulation. The honorable senator quoted a clause showing that the bounty is to be paid only on goods of a quality prescribed. - </para>

                        <para>- Yes, of a merchantable quality. If this item is proposed to enable travellers through Central Australia to get green dates - and the inside ' leaf of the palm is just as wholesome as cabbage and exceedingly good eating, whilst certain liquids which can be got from the palm are useful for drinking purposes - the least the Government can do is to tell us so. I might then be more inclined to vote for the item. But if the idea is to induce people to establish groves of date palms on a considerable scale in order to put the date of commerce on the market, the word "dried" should appear after the word " dates," in order that it may be perfectly clear that the item refers to the date of commerce, and not to green dates. I have here a copy- of <inline font-style="italic">Chambers'</inline><inline font-style="italic">Encyclopadia,</inline> which I looked up to make sure of my ground.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline>
                    has just said with regard to the indefiniteness of the proposal. He has pointed out that there is nothing to show- whether the item means that a bounty is to be given on the production of so many pounds of green dates for so many pounds of fruit which have been subjected to the process of drying. As the Bill is worded, the bounty may be claimed both on the green' and the dried fruit, because clause 4, though it- enables the Minister to prescribe as to " merchantable quality," does not enable him to prescribe, as to the form, or as to whether the goods shall be subject to any particular process. The clause says that the bounty shall be paid in respect of goods which are of a merchantable quality. That may mean either the green fruit or the dried. The schedule does not define whether the bounty is to be paid upon the production of so many pounds of green fruit, like apples or pears, or whether the dates are to be dried and packed. In the case of fish, the bounty is not to be given upon the fish as caught from the sea. If the schedule said merely " fish," clause 4 would not enable the Minister to say that the bounty should be given on preserved fish only. But the schedule requires the persons obtaining the bounty to preserve, dry, or smoke the fish. The word "quality," in clause 4, does not -mean the condition or form of the goods. As applied to fruit, it means its quality as dried fruit, or, if green, its quality as green fruit. If we desire that the bounty shall be paid on dried dates, we shall have to insert a definition in the Bill.

They are grown near Hergottin South Australia, upon what has been referred to as an oasis, and more excellent dates were never grown anywhere, I should think. They are packed and prepared as an article of commerce in very nice boxes. They are very much more fleshy than those usually seen in grocers' -or fruiterers' shops. In the case of, the next item, fruits, the schedule says, ' ' Dried (except currants and raisins) or candied, and exported." The object is not to -give a bounty on fresh  fruits, because there is npt a country in the world that is better fitted for the growing of fruits than Australia.

                    <para>. - I propose to ask the Committee to accept two amendments in- this item. The first is one altering the date from 1st July, 1908, to 1st January, 1909. The reason for that is that I am informed by practical men that the machinery cannot be obtained in Australia, and put in working order, before the 1st January, 1909. Then, again, with regard to the rates .of bounty, it will be observed that it. is proposed that for two years it .shall be i£d. per lb., and there-  after for three years1d. per lb. My informant, a practical man, is prepared to put . £50,000 into this business, and he tells me that he would like the bounty to be1½d. per lb.for three years,1d. in the fourth year, and½d. thereafter, making it a tapering bounty. One reason why I support this bounty is because the machinery for making tops is imported, and will have  to bear a duty of 25 per cent. If machinery to the value of , £50,000 is imported it means that those who start the industry will have to pay £12,500 in duty upon it. Here is a case which shows the way in which heavy duties act adversely to the establishment of industries in Australia. Therefore, one reason why I am in favour of the bounty is that those who desire to enter into the industry are hampered by the heavy protective duties on machinery. I invite the attention of honorable senators to a specimen of tops made from Australian wool by German manufacturers while I read a few extracts from the experts' very interesting report on what promises to be quite a new industry in the Commonwealth - </para>

                    <para>It is stated that the project of turning wool into tops in Australia and the Argentine has been inquired into by Continental firms during the last few years, but no further progress has been made, the principal objections being the cost of manufacturing owing mainly to the higher wages rate. </para>
                    <para>It is stated that if by means of a bonus the manufacture of tops were established, it would be of distinct advantage to the wool trade, from a wool-grower's and seller's point of view, by increasing competition, and this would be more especially so in the case of tops made from sheepskins. This would react favorably on value of sheep and on the frozen meat export trade by increasing the value of the sheepskin. </para>

The report continues -  after which, if conducted on a large scale and in proper hands, the industry should well be able to stand alone, and once it has been demonstrated that it can be conducted successfully it should take rank as one of the first industries. </para>

                <para>Within the past few years a marked change has taken place in the conditions of Australian trade as regards the raw material referred to. At the present time, it is well known here that the woollen manufactures of Bradford and other great Yorkshire towns have received a considerable stimulus of late. This fact so far, however, from damping Australian aspirations, would seem rather to encourage the belief - rightly or wrongly - in some directions that the Commonwealth is destined ultimately to become a great centre for working up the raw product into all marketable articles of woollen manufacture, and for their export from the Southern Australian coast towns to the vast neighbouring populations of Asia, as well as to Europe and America. Personally, I can offer no opinion on the subject, except that I can see no early prospect of finding the requisite expert labour. But the syndicate identified with the proposed undertaking is understood to have raised , £50,000 in New South Wales, and is reported to have made arrangements for an additional£50,000 to be subscribed in London to start with. Should the scheme realise the anticipations of the promoters, they indulge the hope that it may eventually absorb many millions of British and Australian capital . </para>
                <para>The chief arguments in favour of the contemplated scheme may be briefly noticed. The first is the alleged economic advantage of having factories for utilizing raw materials as near as possible to the regions where these materials are best grown. The plan contemplated in Australia is to grow wool as at present, in Australian areas suitable for pasturing sheep, transfer the product by rail or steamer direct from the sheep-runs to manufacturing centres in the Commonwealth, and convert the wool into cloth by skilled white labour, imported, in the first instance, from England and the European Continent. It is affirmed that millowners here could afford to pay imported hands higher wages than prevail in Europe. The notion is gaining ground that the costs now incurred in sending buyers of wool to Australia from distant countries, in exporting the raw material from Australia to the countries where it is non extensively made into cloth, and in shipping the manufactured article to remote destinations from British and other ports could be saved. </para>

                    <para>I am glad to note that you are now going in for the manufacture of "tops." The importations to Japan are gradually on the increase. During 1906 they amounted to 5,421,337 lbs., valued at£602,555 16s. ; and, judging from conversations I have had with principal importers, I should say that all grades up to 70's are imported. If you can deliver the tops, as mentioned, at½d. per lb. below European quotations for similar qualities, you can rely that business will be transacted. In Japan everything depends upon the price quoted. </para>

                <para class="block">We ought to be able to do that, because at present we have to send the wool to England, bring it back in the form of tops, and send them to Japan. Surely if we were to manufacture the tops here we could afford to send them to Japan for½d. per lb. less  than English or European tops could be sent there for. </para>

                    <para>Of course, if the bonus be granted the venture is not one to be made lightly, for, -in addition to the probability of others going into it when a pioneer has paved the way, the wool market (always an uncertain factor) might easily go against one to a much greater extent than the 3£ per cent, to 5 per cent, of value to which the bonus would amount. Notwithstanding this, I feel pretty certain that if you can see your way clear to advocate and secure the suggested alteration, it will enable me for one, and I shall welcome the co-operation of any one who proposes to go into the industry, to add to my present works the necessary plant to demonstrate the practicability of successfully exporting tops instead of raw wool, with the resources at the command of myself and my friends amounting to ^50,000. </para>

                        <para>-  I am not a protectionist ; but if we impose heavy duties persons who are punished by them have a right to expect some little bonus until they get over their initial difficulties. How is a man to import £50,000 worth of machinery and pay a duty of 25 per cent., and yet be able to compete with persons who can get that machinery without any duty? The fault of the protective system is that once you protect one part you have to follow suit to some extent with other parts, and a very bad thing it is from the start. </para>

I have been told by -the very best of authorities - a man who was some time ago the wool expert of South Australia - that although a great many of .the small manufacturers in that State at present make their own tops, it would mean a saving of id. or 1½d., or even more, per lb. if the tops were manufactured in a large establishment such as was described by

                    <para>- No. The difficulty is to induce people to start the industry. As we desire to encourage such a large industry as this in Australia we should grant this bounty, and also agree to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> amendment, because, as it may be the end of this year or the beginning of next year before the Bill becomes law, it would be impossible for any manufacturer or company of manufacturers to obtain their machinery and have everything in order by July next. Even an extension to 1st January, 1909, is hardly sufficient; but as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has information that justifies him in thinking that that' will give sufficient time, I shall be only too glad to support him. One reason why we should encourage the manufacture of tops in Australia is that when our wool goes to the old country, even the great factories where the tops are manufactured have no use for the, whole of the product. They manufacture only what suits themselves, and sell the rest. Here, however, we could manufacture all our wool into different classes of tops, and not only supply our manufacturers without any trouble with the very article that they want, but be in a position also to export large quantities to other parts of the world where our wool is in such great demand. I have, much pleasure in supporting the amendment. </para>

But this could not be done, as we ourselves have proved, owing to the large number of qualities and sizes required to meet the varied demands of the Commonwealth. As you will readily understand, the climatic differences of . Queensland and New South Wales require quite a different texture of goods to Victoria and Tasmania. We ourselves use from 40 to' 50 different varieties of yarn, which no one spinner could turn out. The capital invested by an English Combine to turn out these varieties of yarn is ^5,000,000. </para>

We certainly could do it to a limited extent for our own requirements, and in that I should 'be very glad to assist, but we can never expect to export, because pur conditions of labour, and even the very Bill that has been introduced to-day, would probably prevent the profitable manufacture of tops for export against the world. Bradford is producing enormous quantities of different kinds of tops. They are classified according to the number of fibres to the ounce, as I understand it. The degree of fineness of the wool spun out determines the different kinds of yarn. Therefore, we must not look forward to the establishment here of any very great industry of that kind. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> can introduce- another industry- here for  the manufacture of- what is useful for the Commonwealth, I shall be with him in supporting it, but I am sure that he will be disappointed if he has any idea that we can establish a large export trade in combed wool or tops. </para>

                        <para>- The limitation as to time applies to every bounty, and yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> voted " against some of them. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> there' is already in Australia a market offering an; increased price of from id. to 1½d.  over present cost to any man who likes to launch out on a large scale. As manufacturers have not taken, and do not seem disposed to take, up this profitable  busi-ness  for local consumption, I feet tolerably confident that they are not likely to do it for export purposes. If they are not prepared to manufacture in the most profitable, way - a large way - for a market at their own doors, they are hardly likely to launch into the enterprise for the purpose of exploiting the markets of the world,' where, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> points out, the conditions ' of manufacture are less costly than in Australia. For that reason there is less objection to the item going through, because, if there is one item which will prove to foe so much waste paper, it is this one. I am surprised if the Government wish to encourage the manufacture of tops, that they should have limited the bounty to exports.. Does any honorable senator think that - we are going to export tops in competition with the established manufactories of Bradford? Had the bounty  been for the manufacture of tops, irrespective of whether they were to be used in Australia or outside, there might have been some virtue in it, from the standpoint of those who believe in bounties, but to limit it to tops to be exported seems to be cumbering the Bill with an item which can only have entirely negative results. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has advanced, as a reason for the proposed alteration of the date, the statement that if the period covered by the bounty commences on 1st January, 1909, rather than on the 1st July, 1908, a reasonable opportunity will be afforded those disposed to go into the industry to import the necessary machinery. I do not think there is any valid ground for objecting to the postponement of the commencement of the period, and to that extent I see my way to meet the honorable senator. With regard to the re-adjustment of the rates of bounty, the honorable  senator  proposes that, instead of paying1½d.per lb. for the first two years, and1d. per lb. for the remaining three years, we should pay1½d. per lb. for the  first  three years,1d. per lb. for the fourth year, and½d. per lb. for the fifth year, making the amount to be paid in all 6d. per lb., spread over the five years, as proposed in the schedule. As the proposed alterations in the rates of bounty would not affect the total appropriation, which would still be £10,000 for each year, the constitutional objection which so often arises as to our competence in making amendments in Bills of this kind does not confront us in this case, and I see no objection to the amendment. </para>

                    (New South Wales) [7.48]. - I am glad that the Minister has agreed to the proposed alteration of the date. I intended to vote for that amendment. I do not know whether I should vote for the second amendment, but I am prepared to vote for the item.  There  is no question about the production of the raw material in Australia, and particularly in the State that sends me here. After all has been said and done, the man who puts his money into the necessary machinery for carrying on this industry will know that there is no question about his being able to obtain the raw material, or that there will be a market for tops if he manufactures the article in accordance with the requirements of those who use it. If any manufacturer obtains the wrong class of machinery, or manufactures the wrong class of tops, he will do so with his eyes open. In this respect, in connexion with this item, there is not the element of uncertainty which attaches to items to which we have already agreed. But I point out that a manufacturer may turn out tops quite suitable for certain classes of tweeds or woollens, but for which he may be unable to find a market, and consequently the Commonwealth may be called upon to pay bounty on an article which will really have no market value. That is a somewhat unfortunate risk, but at present I do not see by what amendment of the schedule a risk of the kind could be guarded against. I think we must chance it, hoping and believing that those who undertake to produce this article will produce something for which they can find a market. I shall vote for the item.

                        <para>- Honorable senators will observe that the total of the amount provided in the first schedule, obtained by taking the maximum amount payable in any one year and multiplying by the number of years during which' bounties are to be paid, exceeds the total set opposite the 30th June, 1922, in the second schedule. The latter amount is £412,500, and the grand total of the first schedule obtained in the way I have referred to is £533,000. It is not anticipated that in every year during which the bounties are to be paid the full amount provided for will be claimed and given. For that reason, the amount provided for in the second schedule is on a lower scale. In consequence of alterations made in the first schedule, it will be necessary to make some consequential alterations in the second schedule. I was prepared to- submit a revised form of the second schedule, but the amendments to which the Committee has just agreed have affected the possible expenditure during certain years. We have agreed to postpone the operation of the bounty in the case of the' last item for six months. Then we have agreed to give 1½d. per lb. for three years, instead of two years, as provided in the schedule as submitted, and for one year we propose to pay only Jd. per lb., whereas the proposal in the first schedule, as submitted, was for id. per lb. It is necessary that the altered condition should be taken into consideration, and, therefore, I do not propose at this juncture to go on with the second schedule.  Before the Committee resumes the discussion of the measure, I will have a schedule worked out on the principles which now govern the relations between the two schedules, and will submit to the Committee a revised second schedule. We have yet to deal with clause 2 of the Bill, but that clause is also related to the schedules. </para>

In addition to the minor alterations which will be consequent upon the amendment just adopted, the Committee has struck out of the first schedule three items, totalling £115.000. That reduces the amount being appropriated from £412,500 to £297,500. I take it that the re-adjustment will be upon the basis of £297,500. </para>

                        <para>- Clause 2 of the Bill provides for an amount of £412,500. The Committee has struck out items to the amount of £115,000. Therefore, it seems to me that the re-adjustment will have to be upon the basis of £297,500. If that be so, the .correct thing to do is to make the second schedule conform to that amount. I cannot see why we should be asked to pass a second schedule providing for an amount larger than that required bv the first schedule. The two ought to, conform. I think that the Minister is taking the right course in reporting progress at this stage. </para>

                    <para>. - What the Com.mittee has done has not been to approve the appropriation mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> £297,000. If there were no second schedule, and if clause 2 did not stand as at present, the actual amount approved qf by the Committee would be £418,000. When the Bill came up to the Senate the actual amount which honorable senators were asked to authorize was £533,000. But what the Government asked in the second schedule was that a certain "maximum should be set down to be spent between the years 1908 and 1922. Realizing that, although authorized to spend the full amount men.tioned in the first schedule, it was not likely that the full amount would be claimed, the Government only asked for a proportionate amount - that is for £412,500. instead of £533,000. The Committee, having reduced items to the extent of £115,000, brought the total amount down to £418,000. What I propose to do is to reduce the second schedule proportionately-, namely, bv £89,000, making the amount therein £322,000. </para>

This decision (see section 201 of the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Electoral Act</inline> 1902) is final and conclusive, without appeal, and it is not to be questioned in any way. Your Committee therefore find and report that, so far as regarded the petitioner, the said election - that is, the choice of the people, on the 12th December. 1906 - was void, and that no one was on that occasion chosen by the people to fill the place of senator to which the petitioner Joseph Vardon was supposed to have been elected. In the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton during certain mandamus proceedings before the High Court, quoted to your Committee, " Within the Acts there was no election at all." The High Court also in their unanimous judgment upon the mandamus application said, "The only relevant fact is that the attempted choice of one of the three senators who ought under section 7 to have been directly chosen by the people was ineffectual." </para>

It is clear, however, that Mr. Vardon took up the same position then as now. and maintained that the State Parliament was not empowered to choose a senator under the circumstances, and that the proper course was a new popular election so that the people might exercise the choice of which they had been deprived. We do not think the fact of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon's</inline> nomination can be said to waive the objections to the choice by the State Parliament, or to make that choice valid, or to prejudice the right of the people of the State to be allowed to directly choose a senator according to the Constitution. </para>

The antecedent condition to the right of either to appoint a senator is first an effectual choice by the people, entitling the person to hold for the full term of service, and the subsequent happening of a vacancy. </para>

If it were not there every vacancy, including casual vacancies, would have to be filled by popular election. For that reason your Committee think the public interest, as well as the principle of popular election, require that its scope or operation should rather be restricted than enlarged; that if it be doubtful whether any particular case is within section 15 it should be excluded in favour of popular election. It will probably not be disputed that in cases of doubt, the doubt should be solved in favour of maintaining the choice of senators by the people, every other method of choice being treated as subordinate, and not to be admitted at all, unless the prescribed conditions of the Constitution permitting such other method of choice have plainly and without any doubt arisen. The people are not to be deprived of their right of direct choice without the very clearest language in the Constitution. </para>

There was a vacancy, but it was not caused by " the place of a senator becoming vacant," as required by section 15, but because of the place of a senator which should have been filled by . valid popular election in December,1906, never having been so filled.

If, on the other hand, in section 15 they are to be taken to refer merely to the seat occupied by a person claiming to be a senator, but whose claim is disputed and petitioned against, then it was submitted they would mean the same in section 19, with the result that such a person might, by resigning, not only defeat the petition, but the claim of some one else to the seat, and throw the choice into the hands of the State Houses of Parliament, or it might be the Governor with the advice of his Executive Council. </para>

Your Committee, on the authority of the judgment of the High Court upon the application for mandamus, do not accede to those objections. The High Court judgment seems conclusive that the provisions of section 13 offer no impediment to giving the people of South Australia the opportunity of exercising their choice and electing a senator now. The words of the judgment are as follow :  - " Section 13 provides that the term of service of a senator chosen in ordinary rotation shall be taken to begin on the first day of January following his election (except in certain cases not now material).It was suggested that this provision is inconsistent with an election being held after the first of January to fill vacancies which ought to have been filled at an election held before that day ; but we do not think that there is anything in this point.

In the report reference is made to one or two documents, notably the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton, but we have not been informed whether those documents have been attached to the report. Probably, it would assist honorable senators if they had an opportunity to read them. </para>

                                <para>- At the present time we do not know what documents are appended to the report. I, and I believe other senators, would like to read the documents to which reference is made in the report. If they have not been appended to the report, perhaps the Minister may get over the difficulty by undertaking to have copies placed before the Senate. I would feel considerably handicapped if I had to consider the report without them. </para>

                            <para>. - I fully recognise the necessity for such a Bill as this to take over from the various States the control of quarantine administration, and therefore I welcome its introduction. I understand that objections have come from certain quarters, and I believe that before the Bill becomes law we shall have other objections from different States, crying out against our taking this step. In what we are doing we are simply exercising the powers vested in us by the Constitution. It is a forward move, which I hope will be ratified by both Houses. I care not what the subject may be, or what step we may take towards exercising the powers vested in us by the people, we shall always find a certain number in different States of the Union making strenuous objections to our action. We should, however, be false to the trust reposed in us if we stood still, and made no attempt to exercise the vast powers conferred upon us. We have not been in any way hasty in considering this question. We cannot be accused of having been in any undue hurry. On the contrary, we have made haste very slowly. In 1904 a Conference of experts was called to consider this question. The delegates were men of eminence in their profession in each of their States, and every State was represented. The Bill has been mainly drafted upon the recommendations contained in the report of that body. A remarkable feature of the report is that the delegates were in unanimous agreement on almost every item on which they were asked to deliberate. There was dissent only on one matter with which the Bill proposes to deal. That note of dissent came from the delegates of New South Wales and Western Australia, with reference to the internal administration of health affairs. The Conference was asked to submit to the Government of the day - which I believe was the Watson Administration - suggestions for a Commonwealth Quarantine Bill. We have been seven years in deciding whether or not we should take over the control of health matters from the States. We should always be very careful in exercising the powers that we possess, and in this respect we have been very careful. The following is the paragraph in the report of the Conference dealing with the objections lodged by the delegates from. New South Wales and Western Australia - </para>

                            <para>The delegates from New South Wales and Western Australia felt obliged to express their opinion on the question of policy involved in the subject of this resolution. They thought that the Director-General's control should extend only to persons connected with vessels recently admitted to pratique, the word " recently " to mean "within the incubation period of the disease, as fixed for the purposes of the Act, and reckoned from the date on which pratique was granted." They did not think that the Commonwealth Government should interfere in the internal sanitation of the States, except in as far as it is contemplated in Part X. of the Commonwealth Quarantine Bill, or under an agreement specially provided in, or arrived at, under the Constitution Act. They thought any suggestion to the contrary unnecessary, imprudent, and impolitic - unnecessary, because, although the laws of certain States as they stand at present do not permit the fully efficient exercise of Government control over some matters appertaining to internal sanitation, yet this is not the only way, and appears to them not the best way of remedying this defect ; imprudent, as probably tending to weaken the sense of State responsibility, and as certainly diminishing the status and public authority of the chief medical officers of the States, as opening a way to largely increased cost, and as throwing that cost on all the Statespro <inline font-style="italic">rata</inline> of population, instead of leaving it to fall on the affected State ; and (an opinion which they expressed with reserve), impolitic, as inviting the Commonwealth Government to interpose in what may be referred to as domestic management. But, having said so much, they did not abstain from joining in the contingent discussion, the outcome of which has been expressed above. </para>

                        <para class="block">Those delegates, having dissented from that particular portion of the Bill, might at least have advanced some solid reasons for their attitude, but they simply protested against any interference with the internal affairs of the States so far as health matters are concerned, and stopped at that. We have in their protest the same old stereotyped objection that the Commonwealth Parliament is attempting to interfere in the domestic concerns of the States. I cannot see that valid reasons can be advanced against the Commonwealth taking over the control of the quarantine administrations of the various States of the Union. So far as our experience has gone in connexion with the Departments that we have taken over, I think we have proved that we can work them just as successfully as - I will venture to say more successfully than - they were worked by the States. I will instance the Post and Telegraph Department,  which, as controlled by the Commonwealth to-day,- can compare with any similar Department in the world as regards efficiency of administration and charges to the public, and from every other aspect. I admit that there may be isolated complaints from employes or from some sections of the public, but they are few and far between, and if we resolve to take over the administration of quarantine, we shall make just as great a success of it as has been made of the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department. The principal portion of the Bill is that : relating to maritime quarantine. The series of systems now existing is, to say the least, irritating. We have six different systems, and that necessitates six different inspections for a vessel, no matter what part of the world it may come from. No doubt that series of inspections is justifiable under present conditions, but .if it were done away with we should save time, expense, and worry to those in charge of vessels. We cannot prevent the spread of disease from one State to another by any imaginary line of demarcation. I do not suggest for a moment that the States have not done well in their administration of quarantine in the past. In fact, they have done very well. When the State from which I come was threatened with" an invasion of the dread disease of bubonic plague, every credit was due to the officers in charge of the Central Health Administration for the manner in. which they grappled with the crisis. But it does not follow that because we now propose to centralize the administration we cannot carry it out even more effectively. This question was seriously discussed at the Convention in 1897, where, I think, only one of the eminent men who on that occasion represented Australia took any objection to the scope of the powers to be conferred upon the Commonwealth. That was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr., now</inline> Justice, O'Connor.  His  objection had reference to the application of the powers of the. Federation to internal matters of health, but I think he eventually withdrew it. We know that disease is not confined to human beings, and that it mav be transmitted by animals and plants as well as by human beings. In Canada, and in the United States, precautions have been taken to guard against the transmission of disease by means, of animals and plants, and an Act passed by the United States Congress deals with the transmission of disease by animals and plants of every description. We are, therefore, in this Bill following the lines of legislation adopted in other countries. In introducing the measure, the Minister referred to the cost of the administration of quarantine in the various States. He admitted that his figures were not up to date, and he quoted those for 1898. I have endeavoured to ascertain! the cost of the administration of quarantine in the various States, and have, with the assistance of the Commonwealth Statistician, been able to obtain the figures for 1906. I find that the cost in New South Wales for 1898 was £4,037, and in 1906, £3,051. Iri Victoria, the cost in 1898 was £3,240, and in 1906, £1,072. In South Australia the cost in 1898 was £722, and for last year £720. </para>

                                <para>- No.; it is my impression that the expenditure will be increased under the Bill. In Western Australia, the cost in. 1 898 was .£400, and in 1906 £3,400. For Tasmania no return is given for 1898, and the cost in 1906 was £92. . For Queensland no return is given for 1898, and the cost in 1906 was £130. According to these figures, the total cost of quarantine administration in all the States for 1906 was £8,465. There is another phase of the question to which I might direct attention. In at least one of the States there is divided control in the administration of health affairs. There are a central Board and a series of local Boards, each of whom is vested with different powers, and it has sometimes been found that these Boards have come into conflict with each other. That is not a desirable state of affairs. It might occur, at a very dangerous time, when a State  would be threatened with an epidemic of some dread disease. I may here refer to the report of the Conference held in 1904 on this subject of dual control. Under the heading of " General Recommendations,"' and referring to the best method of dealing with diseases arising locally in any State,  I find this paragraph - </para>

                            <para>This literally interpreted covers so large a field that the intention to refer only to such subjects as might arise in the course qf the pro,ceedings of the Conference must be assumed. In' this connexion the Conference would observe that it has learned that in one of the States "of the Commonwealth the central health authority cannot take action independently of local authorities in regard even to so important a matter as inland quarantine, except by tedious legal process. This necessarily means delay, and, consequently, serious danger to the community, and the Conference is of opinion that so serious a position of affairs should as early as practicable be rectified. </para>

                        <para>That, I think, is a very practical recommendation, and if we pass this Bill we shall have taken a Step towards remedying that very serious defect. It is not the intention, even though the Bill should be passed, that the Commonwealth authorities should in any way interfere with or harass the States authorities in connexion with the local administration of health affairs. In fact, I think we should welcome their assistance, but it is certainly right that the Commonwealth authority should be armed with power to say whether or not the States authorities are doing the right thing. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> interjection, so far as the expense' involved is concerned, I quite believe that it will cost a little more to carry out Federal quarantine. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think the increased expenditure will be appreciable. There are one or two provisions of the Bill covering administration which I may feel called upon to  oppose.  For instance, it is possible that the proposed appointment of a Director-General will meet with my opposition. I believe that we can control Federal quarantine without building up an expensive central office. A question has been raised as to who would be responsible for the expense involved in the loss of time, and so forth, in the case of a vessel being detained in quarantine. That, I think, must be determined by the circumstances in each case, and by the evidence as to the persons responsible for the detention. I do not wish to say anything further. It is my intention to support the second reading of the Bill, and should it become law, I believe the Commonwealth Parliament will have done something to safeguard the very best interests of Australia. </para>

                            <para>. - There is  only  one point which I desire to bring before the Senate. I do. not propose to detain honorable senators by any remarks as to the, I think, admittedly desirable character of the Bill so far as its general principle is concerned. It seems to me eminently desirable that the Federal authority should exercise the powers conferred by the Constitution, and, at any rate, take charge of oversea quarantine. But with regard to internal quarantine, if I understand the provisions of this Bill aright, power is taken to enable the Federal authority to superimpose a Federal quarantine upon a State quarantine, whilst there is no power by which we can lift a State quarantine. I will explain what I mean by that, and how I think it would work out. At present one of the most frequent causes of irritation between the States authorities is the feeling that the Government of one State frequently make use of the quarantine laws of the State for the purpose of checking imports from another State. </para>

                                <para>- Stock, fruit, and various articles of Inter-State trade. I need not particularize, but every honorable senator is aware that almost every State in the Union has at one time or another been charged with action of this kind, action which I have no hesitation in saying is a violation of the Inter-State free-trade which we assumed was established at the inauguration of Federation. If there be  any  substance in this objection, it means that a State Government could, under the ordinary quarantine laws of the State, issue regulations prohibiting the importation, we will say of fruit, from an adjoining State. The Federal authorities could if they thought fit issue a Federal quarantine prohibiting the importation of that fruit from one Slate to another. They might later on be satisfied that the fruit could be transferred from one State to another without objection, and might lift the Federal quarantine. Then, whilst so far as the Federal authorities were concerned, the fruit could be taken from one State to the other, the prohibition by the State authorities might be continued. </para>

I' have to admit that, so far as I can pretend to understand the Constitution, the power given us over quarantine is not an exclusive one. Consequently, nothing we can do here can take from the States authorities their right to administer local quarantine as they see fit. </para>

                                <para>- My honorable friend is anticipating what I was going to say. It does seem to me that we can only give full effect to the power given us under the Constitution to control Inter-State commerce when we have appointed an InterState Commission, and, therefore, until we have done that the trouble to which I have referred will continue. Seeing that we cannot lift a State quarantine, and can only superimpose a Federal one, the question arises whether we should seek to interfere in this matter within the boundaries of Australia at all. . If we can only put on top of a State quarantine a Federal one, and seeing that the States will always be ready, and I am afraid rather too ready, to exercise their quarantine powers, what need is there for the Federal authority to interfere internally in the matter of quarantine? Ought we not to confine our operations to oversea quarantine? 1 admit at once that if we could take the full power of quarantine, and relieve the States Governments of their responsibilities in this connexion the Federal authority would probably be the best to handle the whole subject, but seeing that the powers of the States in this matter will still remain, and that the States Governments can still exercise them in' the mischievous way I have indicated- </para>

                                <para>- That is not my point. 'The fact that the States Governments are opposed to the Bill should weigh with us in considering it, but it should not dominate the judgment of the Senate. The material fact is that the States have the power of internal quarantine, and nothing we can do short of an amendment of the Constitution can take that power from them. That being., so, the question, is : Is it better to have one or two authorities exercising this power? Seeing that the Federal authority can do nothing to lessen, the rigour of or to lift a State quarantine, would it not be better for the Federal1 Parliament, at this stage, not to attempt in any way to interfere with or control internal quarantine, but to limit the Federal authority to the control of oversea quarantine ? There are many other matters in the Bill, but that is the one which seems- <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> me to be the most important, and the ' most worthy of special consideration. ' I have addressed myself to it, not merely because it seems to me to be serious, but because it is undoubtedly exercising the minds of a large section of the community in every one of the States. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think there can be much doubt about that. If the honorable senator will turn to the Constitution, he will find that two classes of powers are handed over to the Federation. One class of powers handed over to us are exclusive. Such, for instance, are our powers regarding Customs and Excise, But there are other powers which are concurrent - that is to say, which the States can exercise concurrently with the Federation. Under the Constitution a State law in relation to a concurrent power would only be nullified if it came absolutely in conflict with the Federal law. In the case to which I am. referring there does not seem to  be any conflict. There may be a difference of opinion, but I do not see that there would! be a conflict as to law. Suppose, for instance, that the State of Victoria declared" that bananas from Queensland were the' cause of some disease being admitted into this State. If I remember rightly, there is some trouble of that kind just now in relation to the fruit fly. Victoria, in those circumstances, could, under its State quarantine law, publish a proclamation debarring bananas from Queensland from entering the State. The Federal authorities could, if they liked, prevent Queensland bananas from going anywhere in Australia. By-and-by the Federal authorities might be convinced that the trouble was removed, and might declare that bananas were free to go anywhere. But the State of Victoria might still hold that, in the interests of this State, it was desirable to continue, the State quarantine. There, is nothing, so far as I read the Constitution, which gives the Federal authority power to lift that State quarantine. If that be so, the trouble which exists to-day will still exist after this Bill is passed. </para>

But if the question is as clear as it appears to be in his mind, it is a thousand pities that it was not made quite clear to his colleagues in the other House, because it is obvious, from the discussion which took place elsewhere, that the danger which I have been pointing out was seen there. Of course, if my reading of the Constitution is wrong, my argument is wrong. I hope that the Minister's reading of the Constitution is true. I take it that he is with me as to the undesirableness of the position that I have pointed out being created. </para>

                                <para>- That last reply enables me to point out what I think is the only safeguard which we can adopt. I -know that there is a disinclination to multiply public appointments and create extra Departments.  But the trouble to which I have referred, which exists between State and State, and occurs in many ways - which undoubtedly occurs with regard to the tariff on our railways, for instance - I~s not going to be disposed of until the Inter-State ' Commission has been appointed, and is engaged in the discharge of those important duties which the Constitution assigns to it. Not till then can it be said that there is absolute freedom of intercourse between State and State. Whatever our fiscal views may be, I believe that every member of the Senate, and every citizen outside, is anxious to see the last barrier between State and State, whether created by railway freights, quarantine laws, or wharfage dues, broken down. These are matters which it is impossible for a legislative body to deal with, and which can only be properly handled by the tribunal provided for by the Constitution itself. I think I may conclude from the interjections that the Senate recognises the seriousness of the position which I have outlined, if it exists. The whole point de- pends upon whether the . reading of the Constitution which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has given has force or not. I trust that the position will be made abundantly clear, and that if there is any reason for doubt the Senate, in dealing with this measure, will see to it that the difficulties which I have pointed out are removed, or, at all events, minimized. </para>

                            <para>. - I am quite in agreement with the principle of this Bill so far as it deals with oversea quarantine. But I do not know of any legislation which has hitherto been based upon the idea that quarantine administered by a Federation should extend so far as the interior of a State, or a portion of a State. But that is what this measure does. The dictionary definition of the word "quarantine" does not refer merely to areas of land. The ordinary legislation of Victoria, New South Wales, and the other States in regard to quarantine confined it to vessels from oversea. I should very much prefer to see Part V. of this Bill left out altogether. It deals entirely with animals and plants, which, in my opinion, have nothing to do with quarantine so far as the Federation is concerned, and which will tend to bring about a conflict between the States and the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- It is true that the Bill provides that 'the Governor-General may enter into an arrangement with the Governor of any State in reference to such matters. But the Governor of a State may not see his way to enter into such an arrangement. What is to happen then? Probably most honorable senators have received letters from the Premiers of the different States, pointing out that, in their opinion, the provisions of the Bill to which I have referred should be left to the States themselves. I have received such a letter from the Premier of Tasmania, who says - 9th  August,  1907. </para>

                        <para>I beg to enclose herewith a copy of a report which has been prepared by our Chief Inspector of Stock with regard to the Quarantine Bill now under consideration. I would strongly urge that the legislation dealing with quarantine be limited to maritime matters, as owing to the insular position of Tasmania greater difficulties, with which the local authorities are familiar, have to be contended with to prevent the spread of animal diseases. You are no doubt aware that in many instances animal diseases have not broken out in this State until a considerable time after quarantine, and I am of the opinion that the State officials are in a better position than Federal officers to deal with stock in Tasmania Federal legislation with regard to human beings and shipping is, however, likely to prove effective, but </para>

As a proof of the want of knowledge shown in the preparation of this Bill, I direct attention to clause 44. That is a very injurious, and I think an un-English proceeding. In my opinion we ought to resort to the old English practice which I admit is not embodied in the Customs Act, and under which a man was always considered innocent until he was proved to be guilty. </para>

                                <para>- No doubt clause 13, as amended by the Minister of Trade and Customs, is an improvement upon the original clause, but still the blot remains that it empowers the Governor-General to quarantine a small portion of a State, irrespective of any local law. If that is constitutional, so much the better will it be for our measure ; otherwise it will provide more food for the lawyers. Shipping people complain that one clause requires a vessel to be fumigated, possibly between ports, when cargo is on board. They point out that that might injure cargo, and cause great damage and inconvenience to persons in the ship. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know why, but that is what the clause provides. The penalties prescribed in the Bill are very heavy, and I hope that in Committee they will be reduced. Clause 80, for instance, provides for a sentence pf two years' imprisonment on any officer who wilfully deserts from his duty. There are one or two other points which I will reserve until we get into Committee. </para>

                            <para>.- I think that some of the States were unnecessarily nervous, as to the provisions of the Bill. I confess that I was nervous when I first read the criticisms on its provisions, but it appears to me that the Parliament will do wrong if it does not legislate to the fullest extent of its powers on this subject. I cannot understand any one wanting an incomplete measure to be passed. The Minister was most careful to point out that it is intended to administer the Bill through the State officials. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> made an interjection about the State officials, I replied that we had no Federal officials to deal with quarantine. Therefore, a comparison cannot very well be made. The Minister proposes to make use of the trained and experienced officers who have been carrying on State quarantine for many years. </para>

                                <para>- The State officers will administer the State laws, and where a conflict of law arises, they will have to administer the Commonwealth law, I take it, under the authority of section 69 of the Constitution. The honorable senator raised a very nice point and he has, in conversation with myself, raised another very delicate point. From the interjection of the Minister, I gathered that the .power to legislate on quarantine is an exclusive power. It is granted in section 51 of the Constitution ; it appears indirectly in section 52 ; and it is named in section 69 as an exclusive power. With all those authorities to back us up, I think it will be found that we have power to legislate independently of the States on all matters relating to quarantine. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so. With that legal acumen of his - and if he was only a lawyer, I would take him into partnership to-morrow - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has suggested that if we commence to administer the State laws through Federal officers, and we have a Federal law, we may not be able to say whether, in administration, the latter conflicts with the former, until we get a correct definition of quarantine. I take it that no authority but the High Court can decide that question. My honorable friend went on to point out that it may include, and I think that in both Houses Ministers have declared that it includes, animals, plants, and fruit. He has since remarked to me that the States may take a different view, and say that when their Acts were passed quarantine referred to human beings, and not to animals or plants; in short, they may contend that theirs' was the true definition_ of quarantine when the Federal Constitution Act was passed </para>

With regard to the administration of this Bill, my honorable and learned friend is taking a course which is absolutely opposed <inline font-style="italic">to that</inline> which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne took with regard to our Department of Public Works. It will be recollected that the chief reason given for appointing an Inspector-General of Public Works was that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne would not administer the Department of Home Affairs, or be responsible for the expenditure of Commonwealth money on post-offices and Customs . Houses, through the medium of State officers. He contended that if he was to be responsible, he must carry out public works through Federal officers. Of course, I was in favour of saving the salary of the Inspector-General of Public Works and the small Department which I suppose has to be kept up for him, and working through the State officers. But now the Minister of Home Affairs has stated in the most positive manner that the intention is to administer this Bill practically entirely through State officials. I agree with him in that regard. I hope that that policy will be followed hereafter, and that we shall have no more excuses made - vain excuses, I think - for appointing Federal officers to do the work which for generations State officials have been doing, and which they are quite capable of continuing to do. </para>

                                <para>- One would almost imagine from the interjection that my honorable friend was intending to support the view of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne. I put that matter on one side, because the States form the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth comprises the States. Surely  we are not going to have State officers fighting about whether, because they are paid by the State, they should administer the State law rather than the Commonwealth law ? We expect loyalty and common-sense from our officers, and I suppose that we shall get a fair amount. of intelligence. I can quite understand that there may be a conflict of laws, but I can hardly understand that there will be friction and conflict in administration, because before the State officers can decide what law they are to administer, the Commonwealth, or somebody else, will have to ascertain from the High Court whether there is a conflict, and if there is such a conflict, then, under section 109 of the Constitution, the ' Federal law must prevail. </para>

                        <para class="block">When the Secretary wrote that letter, he had not heard of the declaration of Ministers in both Houses that these laws, which are practically identical, will be administered through State officers. But what he says is perfectly true. If the administration is to be interfered with, and controlled from head-quarters in Melbourne, it will not be nearly so prompt or effective as it would be if controlled on the spot. But I take it that the Federal Government will be guided by the experience and skill of the State officials, and that there will not be that delay or ineffectiveness which in the first instance the State officials thought might happen. I may be speaking slightly against the opinion of many skilled people in Tasmania, but I am doing so for this reason : Tasmania is essentially a fruit-growing country ; we have apples and pears by the million of bushels to export, and we sometimes feel a little annoyed at our fruit being excluded as we think improperly by rather stringent and strict regulations with regard to diseases, when the States which inflict upon us those regulations have their own orchards full of the diseases which we have partly cured, and, therefore, we think that our fruit is unjustly excluded. I had with me this morning a clipping from the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> in which complaint was made by one State that another State was improperly and through overcaution- - possibly for ulterior motives- keeping out its fruit. We shall never do away with this friction until we have uniformity of laws or regulations and of administration with regard to the admission of each other's fruit or vegetable products which are supposed to be subject to disease. While we have great friction which the States cannot remove, the very fact of our having this Federal Act and of the Federal Government standing supreme and possessing the exclusive right of administration may be the means of leading the Federal Government to confer with the States and possibly to call a conference of the skilled experts of the States in order to bring about that uniformity under which none of us will suffer injustice, but all, I presume, will have a large measure of prosperity. </para>

                            <para>. - I was very pleased to hear the Minister's answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> There is no doubt that trouble may arise through officers discharging two sets of duties and having two masters. If State officers have to administer the Federal quarantine law, they will still receive the larger part of their salaries from the States. During the last Federal elections there arose several cases exactly similar to what may arise under this Bill. One officer was in the State Education Department, and another was in the Commonwealth Post and Telegraph Department. The Federal electoral officer for the State was a purely Federal officer, and drew his salary from the Commonwealth alone. It may be said that the postal official also drew his salary from the Commonwealth for both kinds of work, but I had a discussion with some of the higher officials in the Department about electoral matters, and they told me that they did not believe in divided authority, because if the Federal electoral officer found fault, say with the postmaster in regard to electoral matters, the postmaster immediately excused himself on the ground that his postal duties caused the delay. On the other hand, if there was any delay in the postal or telegraphic work, he immediately replied that the work of the Federal Electoral Department took up his time, and that he was not able to attend to his other work. I' could give the names of officers concerned. I know that what I am saying is a fact, and have sworn documents which I will produce when the Electoral Bill is dealt with. Instances of that kind arose at . the last Federal elections, and were I believe known to nearly every honorable senator. If we appoint a State officer he will be under the control of the State from which he will derive most of his salary, and will be in a very peculiar position. If any trouble occurs, he will be able to say, " My duties as a State officer were so onerous that I was not able to carry  out the work properly." If the State Government found fault with him,, he would say exactly the reverse. Therefore, the dual control that we propose to establish in quarantine , matters will be impossible to work. In the last Federal elections the same thing applied when officers of the Education Department were appointed as returning, deputy returning, or presiding officers. If any complaint was made, they said that their scholastic duties took up all their' time. A man cannot be- under two heads. The Government would be wise if they simply took over oversea quarantine, at present. I know that the Queensland Parliament is opposed to the Commonwealth Government taking control of their inland health officers. </para>

                                <para>- It touches every place where health officers are stationed. Under this Bill the health officer in every town must be an official for Commonwealth purposes. I think the Minister will admit that I am right. Under this Bill the Commonwealth will take control of the health officer in .a town, even if it is 500 miles inland, say, from Brisbane.- If so, we are going to have a great deal of trouble. We will have to get a special staff, independent of the States, and that will' cost a large amount of money. I think it would be wiser to take control of quarantine in every port in the Commonwealth. I go with the Government so far, but I do not go with them in the rest of their proposals. The Bill gives the Commonwealth Government power, if they see fit, to quarantine the town of Rockhampton or Charters Towers. The Commonwealth Government could take charge of the health officers, .who would have to be officials under the Commonwealth Act. They would also take charge of the inspectors of nuisances, who would be Federal officials for this purpose, in every little town and hamlet in the Commonwealth. </para>

But I believe we should take out the portion dealing with inland towns. It will cause a great deal of ill-feeling in those towns. They have their own health officers, who are perfectly qualified. We may take the case of a town adjoining a shire. There is an officer in the shire and another in the town, which may cover only a square mile. There will also be an inspector of nuisances. The Commonwealth comes in and takes charge of all those officers. The Commonwealth will have to take them all over, because one man could not attend to the town and also to the whole of the shire, which might be forty or fifty miles square. I do not think that the proposal is practicable. If the Act is administered from Melbourne, as it will be, and it is proposed to deal with a town 2,000 miles away, it will take a long while to pull the wires to get anything done. If it is left to the local people, under the control of the State Government, anything necessary to preserve the health of the inhabitants of the district can be attended to in twenty-four hours. Honorable senators will all remember the tick scare. I suppose that the Queensland Government spent hundreds of thousands of pounds in erecting fences to keep cattle from crossing an imaginary line, and had tick inspectors all along the borders,, but they forgot that birds could carry the ticks. Magpies, turkeys, and, in fact, every bird in the bush carried the ticks, as well as animals, and that expenditure was simply a waste of money. Wallabies and kangaroos carried them, as well as horses and cattle. A vast amount of money was spent before the uselessness of the precautions was discovered. If a scare of that sort took place, and the Act was administered from Melbourne, which is the present Seat of Government, a great deal more money would be uselessly spent. The people in the districts know what is necessary, and should have control over the local administration. I hope that, before the Bill becomes law, it will be restricted to oversea quarantine, and quarantine in the various ports, and I shall do my best to get it amended in Committee. </para>

That leaves the question of what is meant by " quarantine," and what area is covered bv that term, to be settled. I am inclined to think that, whilst the Commonwealth ought to take over quarantine, as ordinarily understood, from the States, it would have been wiser if it had stopped short at taking over what we generally understand by " quarantine," namely, oversea quarantine. </para>

My view, and I think it was the general understanding in the Convention, is that the quarantine which it was intended should be taken over by the Commonwealth was that which is ordinarily understood by the term, and not quarantine in the secondary sense in which it is used when we say that we put persons or goods in quarantine. </para>

                                <para>- That was because the amendment was unnecessary. I think that at the Convention quarantine was understood to mean what we have always understood it to mean - the control, of vessels coming to our shores, and having disease amongst the human beings on board. Such vessels have been Subject to quarantine, and an expression always applicable to their release from that Quarantine is that they have been granted "pratique." </para>

                                <para>- Probably we cannot settle the matter, but' certainly I never understood that the term " quarantine " in its ordinary acceptation was applicable to anything except what we usually understand by the term - the condition of isolation that is relieved when " pratique " is granted, an expression which has been applied only to the release of oversea ships from quarantine. I think it is absolutely essential to0 take over that kind of quarantine at once. Only lately, in arriving in Australia after a little trip oversea, I had an experience of the inconveniences of the present system of State quarantine in the larger, and what I consider to be the proper, sense. of the term. We arrived at Brisbane in a vessel coming from Vancouver. After calling at a British Possession, Fiji, a clean bill o ' health was given there. At Brisbane everyone, on board was brought before a medical officer, and was supposed to be examined. Pratique was granted, and a clean bill of health given, at this, our first port of call within the Commonwealth. Then, when we arrived at Sydney, we were told that we should be subjected to the same process, and that the clean bill of health given at Brisbane had no force in Sydney. There is some regulation at Sydney that unless a ship gets inside the Heads' a moment before sunset the medical officer need not come on board, and a big ship, with hundreds of passengers, is kept at anchor in the harbor, and the passengers are not allowed to land, although they are within sight of the wharf. </para>

                                <para>- That is what happened to us at Sydney, and I certainly think the practice a very objectionable one. It seemed to me that it was specially objectionable that when a clean bill of health was given to a ship at Brisbane we should be put to all, that inconvenience at Sydney, and that hundreds of passengers, who had travelled thousands of miles, should be kept waiting in the harbor from after sunset until 7 o'clock the next morning. </para>

                        <para class="block">At all events, the experience has given me a good reason for supporting as strenuously as I ca'n the "taking over by the Commonwealth of the control of oversea quarantine. It is possible that in connexion with Inter-State trade and commerce we should exercise similar powers, but I think the Bill, goes a great deal too far when it seeks to interfere with the internal economy and health regulations of the States. Clause 12 gives the Governor-General power, by .proclamation, to declare that any place in Australia is 'infected with a quarantinable disease, or that a quarantinable disease may be brought or carried from or to that place, and thereupon so long as the proclamation remains in force that place is held to be a proclaimed place »within the meaning of the Bill. I am not prepared to dispute the construction which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> gives to. the Constitution in that respect, but if it be correct, we are taking up a very serious position under this Bill. We are practically attempting to take over the whole of" the control of health matters from the States authorities  as provided for by States Acts, and as honorable senators will see, without taking the management of their diseases, we assume the power to interfere by ordering isolation. </para>

                                    will be even more strongly of that opinion when he reads the provision in this Bill that the Governor-General may, by proclamation, declare any disease a quarantinable disease ; and may then, under clause 12, proclaim that any village, or town, in a State is infected with that quarantinable disease, and, under the following clause, declare that any persons, animals, plants, or goods in that place shall be subject to quarantine. If the quarantinable disease is one affecting plants or animals why should persons be brought into quarantine? The difficulty and mischief of it all is that we are interfering in a department in which we might allow the States to look after their own affairs. There is no necessity for the exercise of this power, and if it is doubtful whether it comes within the term " quarantine," it had better be left out. Personally, I should have no objection to the exercise of such powers where their exercise might be advantageous in connexion with Inter-State commerce, and to cover cases, such as that alluded to by
                                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline>
                                    of small-pox being carried from one State to another oversea. I think it would be a legitimate thing for the Commonwealth to exercise its power in the control of such cases in the interests of the body politic. But we might safely rely on the States authorities taking measures to protect their people- in connexion with matters which are dealt with by health laws rather than by- laws which may be appropriately termed quarantine laws." We might say that a person suffering from scarlet fever should be isolated. That would be quarantine in the secondary sense, but it is a matter with which the States authorities may be trusted to deal, as they may be trusted to deal with diseases of animals and plants. I have never heard of animals and plants being placed in quarantine. We have Stock Diseases Acts, and perhaps the term " quarantine " in connexion with the transfer of animals from one State to another.

                                <para>- What my honorable friend evidently means is that sometimes the States authorities maybe supposed to enforce laws of the kind for the purpose, not of protecting their plants from disease, but of protecting growers from the introduction of fruit from other places. If that be so, the remedy is to be found in the exercise of our powers with respect to Inter-State trade and commerce. </para>

In some States I" could mention . something analogous has occurred in connexion with the importation of goods, where heavier wharfage charges are made against goods coming from other States than are levied upon goods coming from other ports in the same State. But that is a direct violation of the Constitution. </para>

Under the Constitution, on the establishment of the Union, trade and commerce between all the States was declared to be free. What the honorable senator suggests is a violation of that constitutional provision, and we should put a stop to it by other means, and should not resort to the complicated methods of quarantine to stop it. </para>

                                <para>- Certainly. The financial policy of the State has nothing to do with it. No States Government has a right to impose differential wharfage or other rates upon the goods of another State. I will put the case I have in mind hypothetically.- If, for instance, higher wharfage charges were levied in Melbourne on. potatoes brought from Tasmania than are levied on potatoes brought to the same port from Warrnambool, that would be a violation , of the Constitution and illegal. </para>

                                <para>- It would be; but it is a violation of the Constitution, which says that trade shall be free and equal. However, I do not wish to go into that matter now. All I  say is that if what I have described is intended to be done by this Bill, a wrong method is being adopted of arriving at it. The scope of the Bill will undoubtedly bring it within the category of a Health Act rather than a Quarantine Act, and it will unduly interfere with the internal powers of the States. </para>

                            <para>. - I agree with a great deal that has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> as. to the Government in this Bill attempting too much. So far as I have been able to follow the debates in the Conventions, I do not think it was intended that the Federal Parliament should legislate in regard to all the powers with which this measure proposes to- deal. The references to quarantine in the debates of the Convention at Sydney are very brief. I have gone through the official reports of every Convention, and find that the matter was not referred to anywhere except at. Sydney. In the report of the Convention at Sydney the references to quarantine occupy less than two pages. </para>

                            <para>In the first place, we ought to be clear in our minds what we intend to cover by the word " quarantine." The word quarantine in its original meaning no doubt applied only to the quarantine of ships - the quarantine of forty days required under the old laws for the purification of a ship from disease. But I think the meaning of quarantine has gradually extended much beyond that, and the word is now applied to an enclosure to prevent diseases that have been contracted on board ship from spreading to the land. </para>

                            <para>I think that the meaning of the word "quarantine " is pretty well known. There is no doubt that leaving the sub-clause as it is preserves to every State the power that it now has to make laws in relation to all such subjects. It does not vest an exclusive power in the Commonwealth to pass such laws. The State can pass its own law and alter it as it pleases. </para>

                        <para class="block">That was the opinion of the only other speaker who took part in the debate at the Sydney Convention. Therefore, there is very little to guide us as to what the Convention meant by . " quarantine." There has been a Conference of quarantine officers in Melbourne. They seemed to be under the impression that the only power conferred by the Federal Constitution was with regard to oversea shipping, and that the general health powers how exercised by the States would have to be left to them. The exemptions which the Conference proposed are so great that I think there is very little room for any other opinion as to this view. The Conference would exempt all vessels trading within the Commonwealth. That is to say, Australian ships would be exempt from Federal quarantine laws unless there was some strong reason for believing that a ship had disease on board. Having regard to all these views as to ourpowers, </para>

                                <para>- I think we should be making a mistake if we interfered with what is generally considered to be a power of the States. I do not see how we could administer our quarantine law if we extended it beyond oversea shipping. I do not know what machinery we should have to administer such a measure. As I understand the position, the best course for us to pursue would be to have about three quarantine stations in the whole Commonwealth. They might be situated at Thursday Island, Fremantle, and at either Melbourne or Sydney. I doubt whether if would be wise to establish other quarantine stations. Those three would be sufficient to meet all our requirements. </para>
