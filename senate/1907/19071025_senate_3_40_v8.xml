The statement, which clearly sets out the position, reads as follows - </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The original regulation provided that an officer transferred from the general to the clerical division should continue to receive the salary paid him as a general division officer, and an officer so transferred was required to wait twelve months after transfer to clerical division before receiving an increase. Thus, a general division officer, say at <inline font-style="italic">£72,</inline> on transfer as a clerk had to wait twelve months before increase of salary to <inline font-style="italic">£80,</inline> whereas, had he remained a general division officer he would probably have received £84 in two or three months' time. Officers so transferred thus, in many instances, suffered a loss of pay. </para>
                        <para>The new regulation will permit of this and other anomalies being removed, and will enable an officer to receive an immediate advance in salary, where equitable, upon taking up clerical duties. In the case of the officer quoted above, instead of waiting a year for advance to <inline font-style="italic">£80,</inline> he may be given that salary immediately on transfer to the clerical division.. </para>
                        <para>The new regulation will prove a boon to. officers, and will be welcomed by them as an important concession affecting not only salary but seniority in the clerical division. The statements appearing in to-day's <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> are based upon a misapprehension. Instead of tending to sweating, the new. conditions of transfer from one division to another are more liberal than any hitherto provided, and while additional expenditure is undoubtedly involved in these concessions, it is considered to be justified in the interests of officers who have qualified for higher duties. . </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council, without notice, whether his attention has been drawn to certain statements which are reported in a letter forwarded by the  President  and Secretary of the Agricultural Implement Workers' Union, namely, that since they have been drawn into the case now being heard in the Arbitration Court, they have been involved in heavy expenditure, and have had to issue debentures in order to pay the legal costs, and that, in consequence of those circumstances, a large number of them have been dismissed. Will the Government seriously consider the position in which these men are placed, and, if possible, give immediate relief to them? The Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act, as honorable senators will know, was intended to give relief, but when the men' are seeking relief, they are thrown out of employment. </para>

I do not think it is a matter in which the Government can attempt to interfere. Honorable senators are aware that certain amendments' have been circulated affecting the measure now before the Senate, which will, as to the future, more or less deal with the contingencies to which my honorable friend has referred. But as to any retrospective action by the Government I do not feel myself justified in making any promise. </para>

The Workmen's Compensation Bill will be a complicated measure consisting of probably 60 or 70 clauses. Of course, our conditions are different from those of the Mother Country. I will remind my colleague of his promise, and have no doubt that we shall have the Bill before us in two or three weeks. I can almost certainly say that it will be introduced in the Senate. </para>

They will prey upon the public as far as they possibly can. And let me say that I do not blame them. I should not blame <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> for a moment if he were in that position. In all probability I should do exactly the same thing if I could. But it. would be for Parliament, in the interests of the people at large, to prevent me.

                    <para>The Secretary's report adversely criticised the Bill for the amendment of the Australian Industries Preservation Act, which, it was stated, if passed in its present form, could be used to oppress trade generally. The inquisitorial character of the Bill was condemned as entirely opposed to the British spirit of fair play. </para>
                </quote><para>That phrase has been thrown across the chamber hundreds of times in the debate on this legislation. </para><para>After discussion the following resolution was agreed to :  - That this Council, having carefully examined the clauses of the Australian Industries Preservation Act Amendment Bill, consider the powers proposed to be placed in the hands of the Minister and his officers, or any person named by him, as dangerous to the interests of the mercantile communitv, in that the Bill proposes to give power to a Government officer or other person to harass traders, even before legal proceedings are instituted against them, and to impound all documents, even the most secret papers, connected with his business, thus being endowed with extraordinary powers for harm not exercised under any other Government in the British Dominion. This Council, therefore, protests strongly against the passage of the amending Bill, as it did against the original Act, on the ground of its inquisitorial nature, and seeing that its. uses are at present purely theoretical, this Council cannot see any reason for extending its powers. </para><para>That, in a concrete form, represents exactly the mass of opinion and assertion which we have heard from honorable senators opposite during the debate on this Bill. The amendments submitted from the other side, which would have had the effect of practically destroying the utility of the measure, would have given legislative form to the opinions and desires of the Central Council of Employers. That is an extraordinary and undesigned coincidence. Although I have referred to honorable senators opposite, it would not be fair to overlook the fact that three or four members of the Opposition cannot be characterized as opponents of the Bill. I regret that they were not present during the whole of the consideration of the Bill in Committee. One of those is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who, when speaking on the second reading, said that honorable senators who were supporting the Government knew their minds in connexion with the Bill, and would support the Government  in any proposal which they made to control the trusts. The honorable senator, who was at the time temporary leader of the Opposition, also said that it was the duty, more particularly of honorable senators with whom he was associated, to give all the assistance in their power to any Government, whether they believed in that Government or not, to deal with trusts, because honorable senators opposite were supposed to represent the interests of the class which was the basis of the combines. Therefore, to show the public that they were not in any way biased, and that they did not represent that class more than any other, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said that it was the duty of those sitting on the other side with him to show that they were prepared to support legislation of this description. </para><interjection>

                    <para>. - I am sure we have all listened with interest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline> I have been consistent in the strong objection which I took, in the debate on the second reading of the Bill, to the principle which it involves that a man should be held guilty until he has proved his innocence. I think it is usually admitted, and that it is in accordance with British ideas of justice and fair play, that it is better that nine guilty men should escape than that one innocent man should be punished. The principle of British law is that a man shall be regarded as innocent until he is proved to be guilty. Unfortunately, in this Bill there is, in this respect, a new departure. </para>

As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> pointed out yesterday, an offender against the Customs Act may be assumed to be guilty, but he must have taken the initiatory step of making an incorrect, or omitting to make a correct, entry for the goods he imports. Then I have a very strong objection to the Bill as one which interferes with the liberty of the subject. I point out also that honorable senators opposite supported an amendment which will have the effect of offering a premium on the employment of solicitors who have been struck off the roll, as agents when applications are being heard, to the disadvantage of reputable members of the legal profession. </para>

                    <para>. - I find it difficult to understand why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> should have gone out of his way this morning to make an attack upon certain members of the Senate. The honorable senator has not put the position fairly. The amendments to the Bill presented from this side were only five in number. Two of these were readily accepted by the Government, one moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and another by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> providing for access to books and documents. Of the other three, one was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> amendment that the Comptroller-General should take action only "on reasonable grounds." Another proposed the insertion of the words " without just cause and excuse," and the third was intended to provide for proceedings before a Judge prior to action being taken by the Comptroller - General. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> spoke as if honorable senators on this side had made a deliberate onslaught upon the Bill. He further endeavoured to couple the slight opposition offered to the measure from this side with a circular from the Employers' Federation. Such conduct was quite unworthy of any honorable senator of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley's</inline> standing, and certainly did not justify the respect and esteem I held for him before as a straightforward man. I do not see why he should have gone out of his way to couple members of the Senate with an association with which they have nothing whatever to do, nor can I understand why he should have endeavoured to make it appear that amendments submitted from this side were designed to wreck the Bill. I considered <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> amendment a very reasonable one, and one which the Government might fairly have accepted. It would not have militated in any way against the successful administration, of the measure, because the only person who would have had to decide as to the reasonableness of the grounds on which he acted is the Comptroller-General himself. </para>

I voted also for the amendment introducing the words "without just cause and excuse," but it was really a trivial matter.

                    <para>. - As I have been very strongly opposed to this Bill, I should like to say a word on the remarks which have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline> As honorable senators on this side have been blamed for opposing the Bill, I might point out that the Government have been receiving support on this measure from a party who do not believe in the Bill, but who have admitted that they have supported it because they wish to pave the way for the nationalization of industries. Are the Government in favour of that principle, and if they are not, do they consider it fair to accept support for this Bill on such grounds? I, for one, repudiate the insinuation that I am prepared to uphold any vicious  trust whatever. I should not regard any measure as too drastic to check the operation of such trusts so long as the individual liberty of the subject was respected. </para>

I object to the suggestion that efforts were made by a majority pf honorable senators on this side to defeat- the Bill, and I object to the effort which has been made to throw upon honorable senators on this side the onus of trying to prevent the Bill becoming law. i understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> referred to a circular 'or resolutions forwarded to honorable senators by a certain organization. Innumerable circulars have been forwarded to members of the Federal Parliament .recently, and I should not be surprised to fmd that the particular circular referred to was sent to me. As I have not perused it, I am free, to say that I have been in no way influenced in my action with respect to this Bill by what it contains, and have been guided only by my own opinion as to what was the right thing to do. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to detain the Senate by going over the whole course of the previous debate upon this Bill. It has been admitted on all sides' that the Bill is a very important one, and I wish to take up only so much of the time of the Senate at this stage as will be necessary to enable me to place before honorable senators concisely my reasons for the attitude I have adopted towards it. In the first place, during all the course of the inquiries leading up to the prosecutions for alleged offences, there is no appeal provided against such an inquiry or procedure of the Comptroller-General to any Court of law, whether a Court of summary jurisdiction, a State Supreme Court, or a Judge of the High Court. In the second place, in the case of any indictable offence, the accused must be confronted with his accuser at the preliminary inquiry. He must be informed that he need not give evidence, and he cannot be compelled to make any disclosure of any kind. But a trader against whom inquiries may be instituted on matters relating to his trade is under this Bill placed at the mercy of any secret informer, with whom he may never at any time be confronted. In, the third place it is admitted by the Government that there is no precedent save one for such arbitrary modes of procedure by way. of preliminary inquiry in matters of internal trade between the people of any other self-governing portion of the Empire or of the United States. Then in the fourth place the alleged precedent put forth by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> refers only to powers given to a Bureau of Information to inquire into the_ working of the railway companies of the United States, which are said to be the main instruments working in restraint of InterState trade. As the railways- here are almost entirely in the hands of the State, the precedent cannot be held to be analogous. </para>

                        <para>- And that the communication so made must be divulged to the Comptroller-General under a penalty of <inline font-style="italic">£50.</inline> This places all confidential Inter-State trade communications on a level with communications between solicitor and client in furtherance of criminal conspiracy or fraud. I may be right or I may be wrong in my summary of what I think is the effect of the measure. It was to mitigate to some extent .the undue severity of its provisions that some senators on this side fought, and not in opposition to its enactment. If they are as drastic <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> I have described, it seems to me that that is exactly what the Government desire them to be. It is clear from the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> who very well reflects majority opinion on this measure, that he wishes trade combines to be treated on the principle of the alleged declaration of  President  Roosevelt. According to the honorable senator, and various speakers on the other side, no treatment of the combines can be too drastic. It is admitted by honorable senators on the other side that there is no strictly analogous precedent for this legislation, which violates the principles of British liberty, and interferes very largely with trade. Whatever construction may be put upon our actions, we have only been doing our duty to the people and the country in expressing our honest difference of opinion from honorable senators on the other side. It is well that the public should be educated as to the possible effects of this legislation. But I hope that our anticipations as to its effects will not be realized. </para>

                    <para>. - In my speech' on the second reading, I acquainted the Senate with the attitude that I intended to adopt, and that was to give the Bill my warm support, recognising that its introduction was necessary, and that the sooner it was enacted and brought into force the better. In order to carry out that object, I have abstained from speaking in the meantime. I intend to support this motion and the motion for the third reading, because I believe that I shall thereby be doing the right thing for the Commonwealth. I should not have risen on this occasion were it not for  the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane,</inline> who is now installed or acting as leader of. the Opposition, has fallen into an error. I feel sure that he, above all others, does not wish to injure those who dare to differ from him. He has repeated a statement which is frequently made, and to which I most strongly  object. He has referred to the supporters of the Government as "these dreadful Socialists who support Ministers."  </para>

He did not make a direct accusation, because the forms of the Senate did not permit him to do so; but he went out of his way to insinuate that certain senators in opposing provisions of the Bill were the tools of the Employers' Federation. I do not think that  any one will believe that that association has had any influence over my action. My political record is before the public, and I am quite prepared to stand or fall bv it. No one can advance any charge of that character against me with the slightest semblance of truth.

                        <para>- When, the honorable senator is not prepared to admit that other men mav be equally sincere -in the views they hold as he is, I really cannot describe or think what his mental constitution may be. I am quite prepared to admit that he believes it desirable to abandon the fundamental principles of law, as we know them, for the purpose of catching the trusts, but he ought, on the .other hand, to be prepared to admit that I do not think anything of the kind necessary. There is no need to insinuate corruption, even if one goes so far. But the honorable senator's speech was, from beginning to end, one whole insinuation of corruption and undue influence on the part of the Employers' Federation with regard to those senators who did not accept holus-bolus the proposals of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> knew that he would not be permitted to say so; but he went as near to  saying it as he possibly could. He went right down to the water's edge, but he knew that if he went in he would be drowned. Like a wise man, therefore, he kept out. I wish to direct attention to the fact that the second reading of this Bill was carried by a majority of sixteen. There were twenty ayes arid only four noes. The debate on the second reading was very favorable to the measure. With one or two exceptions every senator supported its principle. I supported it myself. But I thought, and still think, that some of its 'provisions are too drastic. For that reason, I attempted to make amendments. But because I did so I am to be accused of being under the influence of the Employers' Federation ; I am to be accused of being their pimp and their tool, I am to be accused of following their lead. What I wanted was to secure that before the law of this country every man should be equal, the rich man  with the poor and the poor with the rich. </para>

                        <para>-  His  political success was rooted in his being a member of a trade union. That was a combination of labour. From being a member of one trade union the honorable senator ultimately, I believe, became a member of the federation,, or combine, of trade -unions. Our friends the capitalists took up exactly the same attitude towards that combine as honorable senators opposite take up to-day with regard to combinations of capital. My honorable friend said that the Governments of that day were wrong, and that if it was right for tailors, shoemakers, masons, and carpenters to combine it was equally right that those unions should form a larger combination. Why? To prevent competition, to enable the men employed in the industries concerned to make a better living, to prevent their being victimised by their own employers, owing to their cut-throat competition with one another. That was quite right and proper from the honorable senator's point of view and from mine. But the capitalistic Governments of those days tried to put down that sort of thing, and honorable senators opposite opposed them to the utmost. That is the picture as it was a few years ago. Let us turn to the picture of to-day. We find a number of merchants engaged in business. They are competing keenly with each other - so keenly that their businesses have become unprofitable. They resort- to combinations. They form unions. Ultimately they resolve themselves into a combine; and what is now practically, or to a great extent, a Labour Government, applies exactly the same principle to that capitalistic combine as previous capitalistic Governments sought to apply to labour combines. </para>

                        <para>- It is a Government that is supported by the Labour Party. Now, I do not believe in that sort of thing. I believe that the laws of our country are strong enough to take hold of and punish any person for  committing  any offence without tearing up the fundamental principles of justice by the roots and scattering them to the four winds of heaven. I have no more to say. I hope that the Government will succeed in catching the trusts,, and if they are doing an injury to the country that it will punish them. I have done my best, not to defeat the objects of the Bill,, not to enable trusts to escape, not to manufacture loopholes for them to get through,, but to place  on  the statute-book an Act which shall at once succeed in its purpose and be a credit to a free country. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that honorable senators opposite have- somewhat misconstrued <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley's</inline> charge against them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> for instance, said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> had charged them with making an onslaught on the Bill. I did not understand him to do that. The word " onslaught " brings to. one's mind a frontal attack on the whole principle of the Bill. That was what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> said there was not. He complained of its absence.  His  point was that, instead of there being a bold frontal attack on the whole principle of the Bill, there had been that sniping from a kopje, of which we heard so much, and about which complaints were so bitter, during, the Boer war. He complained that the Boers in this case would not come out into the open and fight the Bill on its principles ; but that after allowing the second reading to pass they, by means of amendments, which would, in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley's</inline> opinion, and in mine, have utterly destroyed its value, sniped at its vital parts. It would have been small satisfaction to the Government if, after the Bill had emerged from Committee, they had found that it was a mere husk, because the kernel had been extracted from it by means of amendments devised, we think - perhaps wrongly - for that very purpose. One cannot shut one's eyes to the fact that there is in Australia a strong body of opinion that insists that action shall be taken to regulate trusts. I believe that there is no party in this Parliament that dare stand up against that body of opinion and say, " We will not deal with trusts one way or the other." No party could live that took up such an attitude. Therefore every party must find some means of dealing with trusts. Those who framed the amendments aimed at the vitals of the Bill, and sought to withhold from the Government a weapon which would enable them to deal with trusts in an effective fashion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> position in this matter seems to me to be utterly incomprehensible. During the debate in Committee he took up this position - that he would listen to what was said b- those who put forward amendments, but that he would shut up his mind absolutely to every argument that was urged against them. </para>

Let me draw his attention to one thing which I think ought to convince even him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> argued that in this Bill an unprecedented power was proposed" to be given. He said that no such power was contained in the Customs Act, or in any other British Statute. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> cheered him to the echo. But a little later on the Vice-President of the Executive Council rose in his place and quoted several sections of the Customs Act. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> did not and could not reply to those arguments. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is' taking up a position which one can imagine that the knights of mediaeval times took up on the introduction of gunpowder,. We can picture them when face to face with the insignificant musket refusing to doff their knightly armour or to resign the lance and sword of chivalry in favour of the new weapon with which the progressive soldier of that day was going to shoot from great distances and from behind protected positions, in a manner altogether opposed to the prevailing ideas of chivalry. We can imagine those old knights saying, " Shall we throw on one side these old weapons that have stood us in good stead in so many jousts ? Shall we disdain our knightly armour, throw aside the lance and sword, the weapons of every true knight, and take up this beastly stinking invention, success in the use of which depends merely on chance and not on a man's bravery, skill, martial ardour, or military training?" One can understand the knightly Stewarts of that day refusing, 'even when faced with an entirely new set of circumstances, to throw the old weapons away, because there was no precedent for it in the past. I fear it was a new <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that made use of those arguments, because if there is one senator who in the past has shown a supreme contempt for precedents it is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> Many a time <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> have listened with pleasure to his speeches urging the Senate to strike boldly out on new paths,, to throw aside all precedents, to sweep away the mists of antiquity, and to remember that we are facing new conditions. This Bill is novel for the simple reason, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> put it by interjection, that we are dealing with an entirely novel set of conditions. </para>

                        <para>- Is it not a fact? Does this honorable senator's consciousness not bring home to him the fact that trusts and combines are a novelty in our commercial life? If not, he must have been asleep. In this matter we must be guided by the experience of the United States - the country which has suffered most from this evil, and where it' has reached its highest development. I suppose that the people of the United States have just as much respect, for precedent, and just as much desire to give weight to the lessons of the past, as we have, but they have been compelled by the stern logic of circumstances to throw aside everything that the past has to teach them on this question. They applied to the problem at the outset' the well-known principles of law with which. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has favoured us this morning, and which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has begged us to adhere to, but the result was the utter and complete failure of every prosecution which they took in hand.- The trusts laughed at them, broke up their ancient swords and spears, arid pierced their armour. All the old principles of law, as applied to this new predatory foe, were put to scorn. The trusts played with the law and the lawmakers. The United States have been compelled, in their attempts to check the growth and avariciousness of those great concerns, to adopt, not only the principles that appear in this Bill, but other principles far more extreme. With those facts staring us in the face, how can any honorable senator say that while he desires to manacle the trusts he prefers to attack them only with the obsolete weapons of the past? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> desire and respect for precedent have carried him beyond the region of common-sense. </para>

The Bill is governed by sections 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 of the principal Act.

                        <para>- I am referring to that part of the honorable senator's remarks where he attempted to justify his attitude towards this Bill by saying that in forming a commercial trust the. capitalist was doing no more than the trade unionist did. The honorable senator said that the capitalist had just as much right in the face of competition to form his combine as the workman had to form his trade union. But nobody denies that, and this Bill does not make it an offence. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is open to the charge of using a false analogy to support his arguments in favour of. the amendments proposed to the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I argue that the raising of wages is for the benefit of the public. No honorable senator will argue that if a trade union acts in such a way as to restrain trade and commerce to the detriment of the public or to destroy or injure an Australian industry, it should not be prosecuted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> asserts that we have none of these trusts here and that therefore there is no occasion to take such drastic powers. We have here an American trust which to-day is before the Courts of America. The American Government are asking the Court for such drastic power as will take the business entirely out of the hands of the trust and place it in the hands of a receiver. I refer to the American Tobacco Trust, of which ours is only a branch. It is directly related, because the British-American Tobacco Company, the Trust now being prosecuted in the United States, is a direct shareholder in the Australian Trust. We have had that statement made in sworn evidence, given by one of the members of the Trust, before the Tobacco Commission. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl'</inline> s statement, therefore, is worth nothing. . The trusts are here, and we have one which commands 75 per cent. of the tobacco trade of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I am only showing that some of the generosity claimed for the Tobacco Trust was forced generosity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> said that we have no trusts here, and I say we have the germs of them here; they are growing fast, and as our conditions are very similar to those which prevail in the United States, we may expect like results. When I introduced a Bill in the Senate to' nationalize trusts, I was met with the objection that it was possible to regulate them. One honorable senator after another got up on the other side, and said that we could, and would, regulate them. -This Bill is the test. The Government are asking for power to regulate them. The people of Australia did not give us a majority in this Parliament to nationalize these trusts. So far as I can interpret their will, they have said, " We ask you to regulate them," and I am, therefore, prepared to give the Government all the power they deem necessary, even to the extent of the adoption of novel principles of law and legislative weapons, to deal with the new conditions which have arisen. I say that the obligation lies upon honorable senators to face the position, and to arm the Government with all the power necessary to deal with those new conditions. </para>

                        <para>- That may be the honorable senator's opinion, and I am quite willing that he should express it,  but  if we are, on every occasion, to accept the <inline font-style="italic">i-bse dixit</inline> of a Minister that the provisions of a Bill he submits are all right, and we must not dispute them, we have no business here a,t all. I shall criticise every Bill introduced into the Senate as well as I can, no matter from which side it is introduced. When the Bill, which is now the principal Act, was being passed, honorable senators were told, in just the same way, that it should not be altered, that it provided for all that was required, and that if it were passed into law the Government would be able to deal effectively with trusts and combines. We know that, as a matter of fact, they have  never  attempted to administer that law. They have not, by attempting a prosecution of any trust or combine, shown that there is any necessity for the very strong additional powers for which they have asked in this Bill. Honorable senators who are supporting the Government at the present time, were amongst those who condemned them most strongly for taking no steps to deal with the trusts under the existing law. But those honorable senators are dumb to-day. An honorable senator from Western Australia opposed the Government, and contended that combines did a great deal of good. But now assertions are made - and they are only assertions - that combines are everything that is evil. To my surprise, honorable senators who contended that combines are good, and, therefore, opposed the Government, are now supporting them. If they choose to shut their eyes, that is their own business, lt is absurd for the other side to contend that, because we considered that a certain provision in the Bill required amendment, we, therefore, desired to defeat the object of the Bill. I expressed my willingness to clothe the Government with ample powers, but I still considered one of the provisions unnecessarily severe, and desired to see it altered. Honorable senators on the other side attacked the Government for neglecting to collect the Excise on agricultural machinery from a certain date. The Government did not contend that they had not the power to do so, but they allowed the whole matter to remain in abeyance. In the same way they have allowed the provisions of the Australian Industries Preservation Act to remain inoperative, and, without making any attempt to enforce them, they come down here with an amending Bill, and expect honorable senators to swallow it without discussion. I objected very strongly to the proposed new section giving the Comptroller-General what I consider to be very extraordinary powers, but I never at any time desired to destroy the Bill. Honorable senators refused to accept the amendment which was moved, and I bowed to the will of the majority. I shall not oppose the motion for the adoption of the report, because we could not carry our views in the amendment of a particular provision. </para>

                        <para>- I am referring to the proposed new section  15B,  which the honorable senator has described as the keystone of the Bill." It was suggested that we would destroy the Bill if we carried the amendment moved on that section. I believe in the principle of the Bill, and no one has any right to condemn me or any other honorable senator for doing what we believed to be right. I thought that the Bill would have been improved by the amendment of the proposed new section to which I have referred, but as the majority thought otherwise, I have no wish now to obstruct the passage of the Bill, or to call for a division on this motion. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> has made some unfair references to Western Australian senators. He has stated that at first they contended that there was no harm in trusts, and that now they can say nothing good of them. The honorable senator could not have been closely attending to what was said. We recognise that there is some good to be effected by combination. I have been aware of the existence of combinations amongst coal-mine owners in northern New South Wales for a considerable time, which have resulted in great good to the community by preventing insane competition amongst themselves. </para>

                        <para>- They do not all make that excuse.- Some do not offer any explanation at all for their operations. The combinations of coal-mine proprietors in New South Wales, by preventing cut-throat  competition  in the trade, certainly did a  great deal of good for the men who were working in the mines, as well as for those who had invested their capital in them. It is therefore incorrect to say, in that very bald way, that honorable senators of the Labour Party condemn all combinations of capital. </para>

We recognise that certain combinations amongst capitalists in certain trades are absolutely necessary, and may result in a very great deal of good by preventing sweating conditions in an industry. For years there was sweating in the coal mines of New South Wales, until the coal-mine proprietors combined to prevent competition in prices, and thus put an end to those conditions. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the honorable senator knows very little about the state of affairs in his own State in connexion with the matter with which we are now dealing, and we can therefore excuse him for knowing nothing about the conditions prevailing in New South Wales. One argument trotted out by the opponents of the Bill is that, while trusts and combines may be rampant in the United States and in other parts of the world, they do not exist in Australia, and this legislation is consequently entirely unnecessary. There are trusts in existence in the State from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> comes. They have been proved beyond a shadow of doubt to exist in Queensland more than, perhaps, in any other part of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is innocent of what is going on in his own State. These facts were elicited by the Navigation Commission when it visited Brisbane two years ago. - They were not brought forward by Labour representatives, but by merchants who were carrying on business in several parts of Queensland. They stated that, owing to the coastal trade being controlled by a monopoly of ship-owners, there was in force a system of deferred rebate - which sometimes extended to a period of two or three years - which was an act of tyranny to them, and from which they could obtain no release. Although we obtained that evidence from several prominent merchants in his own State, yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> knows nothing about it. </para>

                        <para>- We are justified in going to almost any extreme in order to relieve those merchants from that rebate system, and to insure a fair deal to them. No later than last night I was informed by a Queensland gentleman that, notwithstanding the existence of the Australian Industries Preservation Act, the rebate system is to-day just as much in full swing in Queensland - and I suppose it is the same in other States - as it was when the Navigation Commission received that evidence. I see very little prospect of thi' legislation achieving the object which we all have in view. There is really but one remedy, and if that is not going to be applied, I feel satisfied that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> will come to his senses some day, and recognise the necessity of adopting the cure which the Labour Party have frequently advocated. He may shut his eyes, or shove his head into a sand-hill, and refuse to admit the truth, which is obvious to every other person, but sooner or later, I feel satisfied that when the failure of this kind of legislation is demonstrated, even he will recognise that the Labour Party are on the right track, and that their remedy is the only one which can be applied with any hope. of success in dealing with trusts. </para>

                        <para>- Although the honorable senator was not prepared to vote down the Bill at its inception, still he was ready to adopt what is an old custom in connexion with mining stocks - to so water down the Bill that it would be utterly useless when it was put into operation. I plead guilty to the partial accusation that I favour some combines. I do so because of personal knowledge of the benefit which those combinations have conferred upon out industrial life. Certain senators seem to regard the Coal Combine as one  which  is almost heinous in its operations. Probably they regard the Coal Combine from the same stand-point as that from which I regard certain combines in other industries. But that is owing to the fact that they are not acquainted with the condition, of the coal industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> may possess some knowledge as to the value of gold-mining stocks, how companies are floated, and so forth, and he may even be a bit of ah authority on gold-mining in general. But he is as innocent as a child in respect of the coal-mining combinations in New South Wales, or any other State in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I intend to offer, direct evidence, and prove conclusively that the statements regarding the Coal Combine are so absolutely wide of the mark that they ought not to have been uttered. The only way in which a person can arrive at the position of an industry is by ascertaining what it is doing. Although I have had a life's experience in coal-mining, still I am not sufficiently selfish to believe that the coal-miner ought to be the only person to derive an advantage from the industry. He ought to receive a fair living wage, and I want him to receive that fair living wage under what may be termed respectable conditions of labour. At the same time, I want the man whose capital is invested in the industry, and  who  is trying to make it a success, to get an equitable return for his services. The operations of the Coal Combine are much talked about. I hold in my hand a record showing the benefits which the coal-owners in the northern district of . New South Wales have received during the last five years. The dividends have been of a very small and insignificant  character,  whilst the provision for the exhaustion of capital has been <inline font-style="italic">nil.</inline> The figures show that the coal-owners have not without very solid reason arrived at the decision to present a united front to the consuming public of Australia and other parts of the world,  and demand for their product a price which is considered to be fair and legitimate. I believe that their recent decision to supply the public with coal at11s. per ton will not give satisfaction to the general body of operatives in the industry. It must be considered that that price is far short of the real value of the . commodity. The Dudley Coal Company, for instance, has for five years paid dividends of 5 per cent. That rate exceeds a good many of the dividends that have been paid in the district. It cannot, however, be considered to be an extraordinary one. " It cannot be said that the company is working to the injury of the public. I defend those combines whose operations tend to increase the number of employes and to make the conditions of labour more comfortable, whilst giving a fair and reasonable return to capital. To the trusts which are conducted with the intention of preying upon the public, I still offer my strongest opposition on every occasion. </para>

                    <para>. - I have been invited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> to make an explanation as to the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> last Friday. He expressed his anxiety to strengthen the Bill, but he expressed a fear that the Comptroller-General might yield to Ministerial influences, or otherwise fail to make the necessary inquiries with a view to the institution of a prosecution. He, therefore, suggested that some independent person should be at liberty to go to the High Court and make an application. I admit that an alternative procedure of that kind might strengthen the Bill. But there are some" practical objections. When a person goes to the Court he makes his application in accordance with recognised procedure. In the absence of elaborate machinery providing for such contingencies, it would be impossible to make an application to the Court, except where a cause had been instituted. Where a cause had been instituted and certain affidavits filed the High Court would be at liberty to make certain orders. The very essence of the procedure referred to in proposed new section  15B  is that preliminary inquiries, not in any cause, but before any cause is instituted, may be made by the' Comptroller-General. The first difficulty we are met with in carrying out <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons'</inline> suggestion is that no procedure is prescribed. Then comes the trouble as to the Comptroller-General already having refused to make these inquiries. That might make the matter contentious, and the Judge might, under those circumstances, require to know from the Comptroller-General why he had not taken action. We should be well advised, in my opinion, in leaving the machinery of the measure as it stands. If experience should disclose such an extraordinary condition as that the Comptroller-General was not doing his duty, and if we can imagine that in any such case of flagrant neglect of duty the hands of the Ministry were not forced by Parliament, it would be time for us to introduce a new provision. If we chose to provide elaborate machinery for contingencies of that kind, it is possible that the Bill would be strengthened ; but, under all the circumstances, I am satisfied with the Bill in its present form, and shall be ready to deal with any emergency of the kind suggested when it arises. </para>

                        <para>- At the same time it must be recognised that it is very difficult indeed to carry out such provisions. We can, to a certain extent, bind the employers, but it is very difficult indeed to bind the employes. In the first place, an employer can dismiss a workman for any cause, and it is very difficult to prove that he has been dismissed for the cause mentioned in this clause. An employer can  stop his work and tell his men to take a. holiday and can afterwards re-engage those whom he pleases. I think it would be wrong of any man to dismiss a workman simply because he. had given true evidence in a Court. I am ready to pass any clause to punish such conduct, though I recognise how difficult it is to make such provisions operative. With regard to the employe the difficulty is still greater. It is impossible to compel employes to remain at work if they do not feel inclined to do so. "All the King's horses and all the King's men " could not force a large body of workmen who desired to turn out to accept the award of the Court. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid that, while the clause is theoretically just, it will be practically useless in operation. But I do not intend to oppose it. I think that it might be strengthened both ways, so that not only would the employer be compelled to observe it, but that the employe should also do so. In the United States the conditions of industry are, to a large extent, settled by trade agreements made between the leaders of the employers and the employes. I believe from what I learnt when I was in America, and from what I have read that those agreements are hardly ever broken. Any workman who refused to accept such an agreement would be turned out of his' association. I should like to see that sort of thing done here so as to insure that the law shall be kept on both sides. </para>

When under our Tariff we make arrangements which enable persons to create monopolies, it is about time that proceedings were taken to compel the persons who benefit from those monopolies to disgorge something for the benefit of their employes, who must be protected when they give truthful evidence. As the set of proposed new clauses of which this is one may be called disgorgement of monopolists' clauses, I shall not vote against them. </para>

                <para>SenatorCHATAWAY (Queensland) [2.6]. - It was quite time that the Government introduced this Bill, which the people generally expected to be one of the first measures brought forward after the accomplishment of Federation. Now that it has been introduced, I hope that it will become law as soon as possible; but there are one or two points to which I wish to refer. The Minister, in moving the second reading, quoted the opinions of a Conference of medical men, and at the same time, with perfect fairness, drew attention to the fact that the Government proposed to go outside the recommendations of that Conference, and take certain powers to deal with matters of internal quarantine, relating to plants and animals inside the States. If the Government intended to include any such provisions in the Bill, they should have called a Conference of the pathologists and entomologists of Australia, many of whom are very able men, and obtained their opinions as to how the internal quarantining of animals and plants should be dealt with. Instead of that, the Government seem to have . deliberately gone beyond the recommendations of the Conference of medical experts, and also beyond the request of the Premier' Conference recently held in Brisbane. They have introduced into this Bill, not a full and complete scheme by which they can undertake all quarantining of animals and plants, but a. sort of hermaphrodite system, which means neither one thing nor the other. The Minister says that in that regard the Bill gives them a power in reserve, but I believe that those provisions are simply included because friction already exists between certain States, and the Government wish at the first opportunity to be able to step in and remove it by taking control. We have read recently in the press the report of an interview between the Minister of Agriculture of Victoria and a deputation of fruit-growers representing practically the whole of Australia, where the relations between Victoria and the other States in the matter of fruit diseases and fruit pests were dealt with. It is also known that friction has arisen between South Australia and Western Australia over the importation of camels. As any one who has read the report of the Premiers' Conference at Brisbane will know, the South Australians accused the Western Australians' of introducing with camels from abroad the germs of very serious diseases, without proper safeguards. The Western Australians, on the other hand, contend that the safeguards are ample; and attribute the action of South Australia in prohibiting the importation of their camels to the influence of certain camel-owners in that State, who want to corner the camel market. I do not- know whether that is correct or not. I merely give it as an illustration of a serious dispute between two States, which, so far as I know, is not yet settled. </para>

There are also disputes between New South Wales and Victoria about fruit pests, and others might arise at a moment's notice. If, as the Minister of Home Affairs said,' these are to be powers in reserve, which " will only be put into effect in a time of great national emergency," then we want fuller and clearer provisions than are in the Bill. If these powers are to be used simply to stop friction between the States, then we already have instances where the Government can put them into force straight away. Consequently, they can hardly be called "reserve powers," and there is very good reason why the States Governments should look with a certain amount of suspicion upon the introduction of clauses of that sort, without adequate machinery to give them effect, in a Bill of which the main object is to codify the States quarantine laws relating to importations of human beings, animals, and plants. When the Minister was speaking on this point in his second-reading speech he said - </para>

The Commonwealth will not wait until a disease comes right up to the very border and say, " Now the time has arrived to exercise our Inter-State powers, and we intend to exercise them, and to slop the disease on the State borderline." But if there is reasonable ground for believing that a disease may spread from one portion of a State into another State or other States, then it will be the duty of the Commonwealth to protect the whole of its territory. </para>

                    <para class="block">In using that expression, the Minister very palpably- I will not say deliberately - diverted the attention of the Senate from the point raised about the quarantining of animals and plants inside the Commonwealth, to the question of whether the health authorities of the States would continue to look after ordinary matters of sanitation. Of course they will. I do not suppose that the States health authorities will in any way relax their efforts in that direction, but that does not affect the question of whether it is advisable in the general interests of the Commonwealth for the Government to introduce- half-hearted provisions which are liable only to interfere and irritate without doing any real good. In view of the resolution passed by the Premiers' Conference at Brisbane, the Government would be wise to omit that part, of the Bill, and then later on, if they so desire, introduce a separate measure dealing with the entire question of quarantine, inside as well as outside the States. That matter should not be imported into a Bill, nearly the whole machinery of which is intended to enforce quarantine at the various seaports of the Commonwealth. It is open to serious question whether it is wise that the Government should at the present time assume the power to interfere in the matter of quarantine with the internal arrangements of the States. The extract I have made from the Minister's speech shows that it is not proposed that the Federal authorities should interfere in this matter  only  when a disease has reached the border of a State, but that they should, if necessary, ' take action in western Queensland, for instance, or in any part of any State, and attempt to regulate local diseases or pests. If the Government expect to be able to make use of the scientific staffs at present employed by the States for this work, it would be better that they should leave them to carry it on as they are doing at the present time. If the intention is to establish a Commonwealth scientific staff for the purpose, it will be admitted that that is hardly consistent with the statement made that the Government propose to administer this Bill with a comparatively small staff. Judging by the comparatively small number of people in the Commonwealth, I should say that we are not at present in a position to establish a complete scientific staff in the service of the Commonwealth, and at the same time maintain similar staffs in the various States. </para>
                    <para class="block">In this respect, either the Bill will entail very considerable expense or the Government must avail themselves of the services of the very men whose work they propose to supersede. I feel that until they are in a position to deal with the matter comprehensively, the Government would be wise not to proceed with that portion of the Bill. It is now recognised, practically by scientists all over the world, that diseases of plants and animals can be best dealt with by people having local knowledge, guided by scientific investigation. We have in the treatment of the tick pest in Queensland a very good illustration of the successful results attending the application of this system. I am not prepared to say that equally good work is not being done in the other States. We have, from time to time, heard a great deal about the tick pest in Queensland, and it has been frequently suggested that the Queensland authorities have very much neglected their duty in the matter. During the year prior to the passing of the Queensland Diseases in Stock Act, I think, in 1895, the tick pest advanced south and east in that State for between 400 and 500 miles, and it has not advanced a similar, distance south during the eleven years since that Act came into operation. I know of one district in Queensland, containing about 500,000 cattle, where the people have themselves erected some 500 dips, at a cost of no less than ^50,000. Every effort has been made, and a large amount of fencing has been erected, by private people to prevent the spread of ticks. Our critics outside, who have no knowledge of what is being done in the State, complain that the ticks are still advancing, that their stock are in danger, and that some .one must interfere to make the Queensland authorities carry out their work properly. The New South Wales authorities at one time had before them an extraordinary suggestion to prevent the introduction of the pest into that State. It was, first of all, to quarantine cattle at the Queensland border, and prevent them crossing into New South Wales, and then to prevent the importation of frozen meat from Queensland to New South Wales. Fortunately, they did not carry out that idea, because it was found possible to convince the authorities that ticks do not live on slaughtered meat, and were not likely to continue to live in frozen chambers. </para>

In connexion with the quarantine at the ports, I have no doubt that the Federal Government will be able to command the necessary machinery, and to carry out the work better than it can be carried out by a State authority. But in interfering with internal quarantine to control diseases and pests of animals and plants, the Federal Government would not have the necessary machinery, and must fall back upon that provided by the States. I think that the Federal authority would find it very much more expensive, as well as unsatisfactory, to attempt to control internal quarantine. At the present time, the various States Governments have staffs accustomed to deal with these matters. The police in the various States, for instance, are employed in checking the movements of stock to prevent the spread of anthrax, the tick pest, and diseases of stock generally. No doubt the Federal Government could provide the necessary machinery for the purpose, but, for the present, <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> believe it would be wise to leave such matters1 to the States authorities. </para>

                            <para>- I am willing, when I think the time is ripe, to agree to the Federal Government taking over the whole of the scientific staffs, and managing the business of quarantine completely. But, nt present, it is proposed merely to assume the power to interfere, and I think that is likely to create friction with the States and, what is of more importance, it is very likely to discourage private efforts, and to interfere with, and hamper the efforts of the States authorities to deal with these matters. In north Queensland, for instance, considerable trouble has been experienced in connexion with various pests, and diseases of plants, such as the grub pest in the cane-fields. But the local people have formed their own funds, have offered rewards, which the Government have subsidized, and have to a very large extent been successful in eradicating the pest. There has recently been some recrudescence of the evil, which is now being grappled with. I fear that such praiseworthy local efforts and Government encouragement are likely to be discouraged if they are hampered in any way by action taken by the Federal Government. It is possible that on the advice of a scientist in South' Australia or in New South Wales, or of both, the Federal authority may be induced to insist that a policy which the people in northern Queensland believe to be successful for dealing with a particular disease is all wrong, and that they should do something else. That would be likely to have a very bad effect. I shall support the .second reading of- the Bill, and am glad that it has been introduced; but I hope that in Committee an opportunity will be afforded to discuss at length clauses which I think may lead to friction between the Commonwealth and States authorities. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall not occupy more than ten minutes in what I have .to say on the second reading of .this Bill. I wish to refer to only one point in connexion with it, and that is as to whether the States or the Federal authority can better deal with internal quarantine. I can give a simple illustration which I think will show that whilst we may make use of State machinery, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has pointed out, it will be of advantage to the State in which quarantine is necessary that the control should be in the hands of the Federal authority. Recently some camels supposed to be infected with the disease known as "surra" were landed in the northwest of Western Australia. What happened under State control- of internal quarantine? The South Australian Government decided to shut out the whole of the stock of Western Australia, and not merely stock from the district that was supposed to be infected. Between the district of Onslow and the southern portions of Western Australia the distance is as great as that between Queensland and Victoria, and yet South Australia and all the eastern States are in a position at the present time, because of a disease in the district of Onslow, to prevent the importation of stock from any part of Western Australia. If the Federal authority had control a local quarantine might be proclaimed, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has pointed out, that is all that would be necessary. The Federal authority, making use of State machinery, would be able to declare the Onslow district quarantined, and so leave the southern districts of Western Australia and  the great balance of  the  north-west of that State free, because it has been conclusively proved that the disease exists in only one mob of camels, confined practically only to one spot, and separated by miles of un-stocked country from the other portions of the State. </para>

                            <para>- The fact remains that the camels that are said to be infected with ' 1 surra ' ' were landed after the holding of the Brisbane Conference, and the action of the South Australian Government to which I have referred was taken subsequently to it. There are in South Australia some districts where the apples grown are infected with the codlin moth, and there- are other districts where the codlin moth does not exist. The whole of Western Australia was free from the codlin moth, and the Government of that State, acting under their quarantine laws, proclaimed a quarantine in this matter against the whole of the eastern States, because the codlin moth was found in some portions of those States. Under this Bill the Federal authority might have effectually done what was aimed at  by  proclaiming the quarantine of the infected district, and permitting the free exportation of apples from clean districts. </para>

                        <para>. - I recognise that the Bill, although it is receiving generous support here as well as elsewhere, is meeting with very serious opposition from some States. I have been requested by the Government of Western Australia to try to get its application to oversea traffic, and as I doubt the wisdom of so doing, it -is very necessary that I should state my reasons for the views .1 hold. In the first place, the States are necessarily jealous of their authority. They do not like any undue interference with them by the Federal Authority. If they consider that internal quarantine can be more effectively administered by the States than by- the Commonwealth their objection to that part of the Bil] is a sound one. But if it is based upon sheer jealousy of the Federal Authority, as I fear is sometimes the case", their opposition is not warranted. The local authorities have shown great proficiency in dealing with local health matters. The most striking example of inability on their part in that regard was supplied when the bubonic plague ' reached Australia. Although Sydney was provided with an excellent staff for keeping in check all forms of infectious diseases, yet when that disease reached the principal port in the Commonwealth the City Council proved quite unequal to the task of coping with it ; in fact, so much was their inability revealed that the State Parliament had to intervene and grapple with the problem. The Lyne Government superseded the City Council and exposed a <inline font-style="italic">condition</inline> of things which was a positive disgrace to the local authority. I recognise that in the future there may be similar experiences as between the Federation and the States. </para>

                    <para class="block">Sydney was found by the Lyne Government to be in a terrible condition notwithstanding the scrutiny of the Health Department. If this Bill is confined to oversea intercourse with 'and between the States it will be entirely inoperative, and will not achieve the purpose which the framers of the Constitution had in view when they empowered this Parliament to legislate on the subject of quarantine. In the States different opinions are held as to what constitutes a proper term of quarantine after which persons or animals may safely be liberated. Tasmania holds a different opinion from South Australia, while Western Australia holds a different opinion from both Tasmania and South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I am quoting from the remarks of Tasmania's representative at the Brisbane Conference. South Australia considers that a period of ninety days is sufficient, whereas Western Australia regards forty days as ample time to cleanse persons or animals from any infectious disease. It will be seen that the quarantine laws of the States are at " sixes and sevens." It is very necessary that there should be a uniform law of quarantine as regards oversea shipping. I have been asked by the Government of Western Australia to oppose the Bill so far as it interferes with traffic or intercourse! between the States. While I am inclined to pay every respect to their views on the subject, still I feel that it would pot be in the interests of the whole of Australia to limit its operations in that way, and still less would it be in the interests of Western Australia so far as later developments are concerned. Since I received that request Western Australia has suffered .severely by the mistaken view which its Government expressed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has referred to the importation of some infected camels from India, and complained of the unfairness of South Australia in proclaiming the whole of Western Australia an infected area in respect of stock because of the introduction of those animals. On the face of it and with all respect to the Government of South Australia, it was a ridiculous proceeding on their part to practically quarantine such a large area as is comprised in Western Australia. It was as ridiculous as it would be to prohibit the importation of certain products from the South of Europe because there happened to be an outbreak of disease affecting those products in the North. </para>

                            <para>- What the State Parliament could have done was to draw a quarantine line, so to speak, round a portion of Western Australia, and even then it is hard to say what developments might have resulted. The infected camels from India were landed in a part of Western Australia which is distant four hundred or five hundred miles, from the chief cattle, producing centres, and the same remark applies to the southern areas where cattle are produced. Port Hedland is a kind of half-way place which is separated by a great distance from the cattle, producing districts, and consequently there was no possibility of any form of- infection spreading to other portions of the State where stock exist. So that the action of South Australia can only be viewed by Western Australia as positively dangerous and injurious to future intercourse between the two States. Now in what position would Western Australia be if in the future it became necessary to send cattle from that State to the eastern States? Already stock have been sent from Western Australia to Queensland, great as we are led to believe the  stock-raising  capabilities of the latter State are. Even last year or at the end of the previous year a mob of cattle were sent overland from Western Australia and arrived in Charleville, one of Queensland's great cattle-raising centres. If South Australia should persist in its present action it would be a positive bar to intercourse between Western Australia, where no tick or infectious disease exists, and Queensland, where . no tick exists, or it would interfere with the introduction of tick-infested cattle from the Kimberley area to parts of Queensland, where cattle are infested with that disease. So far as sheep are concerned, it would seem that the best experts in the eastern States complain that intense friction has existed between the several States. At the Premiers' Conference in Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ashton,</inline> Minister of Lands in New South Wales, bore 'strong testimony to that fact. He gave the Conference the advantage of his Ministerial experience with regard to the attitude of Victoria towards the introduction of stock from New South Wales.

                        as a Minister of the Crown, acknowledges that the States are getting into a position which renders it very necessary that the Federal Authority should be invoked.  Let us consider the matter of Federal interference in regard to fruits and plants. South Australia, wisely or unwisely, has prohibited the importation of citrus fruits from, I believe, any part of the world. It was quite indiscriminate in its action, for it did not single out a particular State for special treatment. The question arises, Is any State justified in imposing such a restriction when there is no warrant for it? It is well enough to adopt a reasonable degree of caution in keeping out, from an adjacent State, infected fruit, which may have the effect of injuring vineyards and' orchards; but when a State goes- to the length of prohibiting the importation of clean fruit, it adopts a parochial attitude, which the Federal Government should step in to prevent. As the States have adopted this attitude in the past, it is reasonable to assume that they will continue to do so, and if that should be the case free intercourse and exchange of commodities between States will be prevented. Therefore, there is every ' warrant for removing the restrictive regulations which the States show a tendency to enact. There is a provision in this Bill setting forth that when a veterinary surgeon's certificate accompanies any imported animals, it, in conjunction with an examination by a Federal officer, shall be sufficient to allow those animals to be llanded. But I direct attention to the folly of relying upon certificates given by foreign officers. A case in point has been referred to. It relates to camels introduced into Western Australia. They were brought from Kurrachee,iin India, and were accompanied by the certificate of a Government veterinary surgeon. Yet, when they landed in Western Australia, they were undoubtedly diseased. Already two of them have been destroyed, and the Western Australian Bacteriologist is making inquiries as to the balance of the shipment. In my opinion, we should totally ignore certificates accompanying animals brought from abroad.. I notice that one disease is omitted from the infectious diseases mentioned in the Bill, although it is, perhaps, causing more serious injury to  the  human race than any other of which we have knowledge. I allude to consumption. When we are passing a Bill to regulate the entry of persons, or to inquire into their physical condition on landing, I feel satisfied that we should make provision to exclude those suffering from consumption, so as to prevent that disease being spread in our midst. I fail to see why Australia, should be open to the consumptives of the wide world. I intend to move, when we get into Committee, that consumption be regarded as one of the diseases coming under the operation of this measure. The United States specially prohibits consumptives- from landing.

                    <para class="block">So that the great Republic of the West, which can afford to be more lax in regard to its restrictions than we can, because ours is a land with a sparse population, shuts down severely upon the introduction of unfortunate persons suffering from this dread disease. There is a perfect gulf stream of immigration into the United States, and that country has much less- cause to be careful about the type of immigrants it receives than we have. Yet the American Government are most particular to exclude persons suffering from consumption. They  make no exception, and leave no discretionary power in the hands of the officials. The mere fact of a person suffering from the disease absolutely precludes his admission. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly I would, and, as this measure provides, I would keep under surveillance the movements of those who lived in the plague-infested area. I would also keep under surveillance those who were in the advanced stages of consumption. As to the ravages wrought by consumption, I may quote the opinion of Professor Koch, the eminent German scientist, who shows that it is" more to be dreaded than any other disease that afflicts humanity. I quote from <inline font-style="italic">The War against Consumption,</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline> Vinrace.  who says that Professor Koch -  after referring to the introduction of tubercle bacilli into the lungs by inhalation, went on to say : - " As to the question where the inhaled tubercle bacilli have come from there is no doubt. On the contrary, we know with certainty that they get into the air with the sputum of consumptive patients. This sputum, especially in advanced cases of the disease, almost always contains tubercle bacilli, sometimes in incredible quantities. Bv coughing, and even Speaking, it is flung into the air in little .drops, that is, in a moist condition, and can at once infect persons who happen to be near the cougher. But then it may also be pulverized when dried, in the linen or on the floor, for instance, and get into the air in the form of dust. In this manner a complete circle, a so-called <inline font-style="italic">circulus vitiosus,</inline> has been formed for the process of infection, from the diseased lung, which produces phlegm and pus containing tubercle bacilli, to the formation of moist and dry particles (which, in virtue of their smallness, can keep floating a good while in the air) and, finally, to new infection, if particles penetrate, with the air, into a healthy lung, and originate the disease anew. But the tubercle bacilli may get to other organs in the body in the same way, and thus originate other forms of tuberculosis, but this is a considerable rarer case. The sputum of consumptive people, then, is to be regarded as the main source of the infection of tuberculosis. </para>

                    <para class="block">On this point, I suppose, all are agreed. As to the deadly effects of 'the disease, the writer of this book refers to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Van</inline> Ryn,  of the Belgium National League against Tuberculosis. This doctor -  estimated, in a paper contributed to the State Section, that throughout the world  3,000,000  persons die yearly from the different forms of this disease, and that the total number of individuals suffering from it reaches the enormous figure of 15,000,000. Yet, terrible as this estimate is, it is a good deal lower than that formed by many other competent authorities. Thus <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Bezly</inline> Thorne, in a contribution to the -same Section, computed that one-seventh of the human race falls victims to tuberculosis. Professor Brouardel, in a paper to' which I have already made allusions, credited the different varieties of the disease with a proportion of the total mortality of not less than one-sixth, and rising in the case of some countries to a fourth. .. </para>

                        <para>In France over 150,000 persons die annually of tuberculosis, and this figure, he tells us, is constantly increasing. In the town of Lille alone, with a population of 220,000, the sufferers from the disease, among the poorer classes only, average 6,000 a year, of whom, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. A.</inline> Calmette from whose paper these figures are taken, 1,000 to I,200 die yearly. In Germany, from statistics given by Professor- Koch, it appears that there are 226,000 persons over fifteen years of age who are so far gone in consumption that hospital treatment is necessary. I have not at hand figures relating to the other European countries, but it may be taken that, in the majority of them, the prevalence of the disease is at least not less than in France and Germany., </para>

We ought at least to prevent advanced cases being admitted and spreading the disease. There is no provision in the Bill for requiring shipping companies to take back to the port of embarkation those who are found after landing here to be suffering from contagious diseases. If a leper embarks at Colombo, or at any port in the Red Sea,andlands in Australia, I fail to see why the taxpayers of Australia should be saddled with the expense of maintaining him in a retreat. In a case of that sort the duty should be cast upon the shipping master or the shipping company to. take back the passenger, to the port of embarkation. Otherwise the Bill has my indorsement as a measure which is intended to deal with over-sea intercourse between Australia and other countries, and to. apply effectively to intercourse between, the States by sea and. overland. Without. Federal intervention and control we shall not have that easy and satisfactory movement of commerce between the States which is so desirable. That can be only achieved by an. Act framed on the lines of this measure.. </para>

                            <para>- And between street and street if necessary. It is equally right that we should try to preserve property in the various States in the shape of sheep and cattle, fruit, or any other product which is likely to be attacked by diseases imported from other places. Although there has been a little local agitation raised in Tasmania, I believe in giving the fullest powers to the Commonwealth Government and Parliament in dealing with quarantine. Whenever we begin to legislate, we shall naturally create some little friction in localities where things have been managed remarkably well up to the present, and where the people may think that they will continue to do equally well in the future. People do not wish to be disturbed, especially in a place like Tasmania - and one can plead guilty to the feeling of rest which comes over one when entering that little State- but our relations to one another are too serious to allow any sleepiness to interfere with them. I am quite at one with the Commonwealth in taking control over all diseases - animal, vegetable, or human - and instituting such measures as will tend to prevent their spread. Up to- the present we have frequently, as between State and State, put ourselves to needless inconvenience. As soon as disease broke out in a certain locality, our past practice was to proclaim the. whole State a prohibited area. Fancy proclaiming the whole of Queensland or Western Australia, with their enormous territories, to be infected because a disease has broken out in a comparatively restricted area ! We have had experience of that in Tasmania, where, unfortunately, we recently had. an epidemic of small-pox. The outbreak was very severe, as it nearly always is in new districts, but it was strictly confined to one town. Yet people going to the other States from any part of Tasmania were subjected to quarantine examinations and restrictions, which were exceedingly inconvenient. That is one of those matters which can certainly be much better dealt with by a general than by a local authority or law. I hope, however, that the Government when the Bill is in Committee will facilitate the passage of any amendment which has for its purpose the paying of due respect to local authorities who have local experience, who have done good work in the past, arid who, by their local knowledge, may be able to give .advice which should be treated with respect. </para>

I have been greatly surprised that various Governments have not introduced it earlier, and I congratulate the present Government on having tackled a very difficult question. I' believe that the second reading will be carried without opposition. With <inline font-weight="bold">'Senator Mulcahy,</inline> I regard it much more as a Committee Bill. I do not propose to discuss it at great length now. Doubtless other honorable senators have read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran's</inline> interesting report upon the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ashburton</inline> Thompson, the  President  of the Board of Health of New  South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran's</inline> report was read in the other House by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, and may be found  in <inline font-style="italic">Mansard.</inline> There is a great deal in it with which one cannot but coincide. The Government, in administering this measure, should avoid needlessly hurting the susceptibilities of State authorities, and endeavour as far as possible to work with them. Australia is such an enormous country that what may be applicable to a comparatively small area like that of Great Britain is not altogether applicable here. A number of clauses, particularly clauses 1.2, 13, and 20, appear to require some discussion in Committee. I propose to end my short speech by reading to the Senate a" report upon this* Bill by the Under-Secretary of .the Department of Agriculture and ' Stock, Queensland, dated 9th August last. It was sent to me with the endorsement of the late Premier of New South Wales, and reads as follows - </para>

                    <para>In accordance with the noting of the Honorable the Premier, I -have the honour, by direction, to submit that, from a Departmental .point of view, any power taken by -the Commonwealth towards administration of matters relating to animals and plants within a .State, would be entirely against proper control of such diseases, excepting, perhaps, in the State in which is .the seat of the Federal Government. Diseases, whether in animals or plants, are often influenced by local conditions,  requiring  prompt treatment, and so there might be a great danger in having to obtain authority from a source which might not appreciate the conditions, and it -would seem that it is essential for the State to retain administrative power over diseases.; oth.erw.ise il is feared that the results will show that a ;great mistake has been made. Assuming that the Commonwealth takes the power sought, it will have to use the State officers for administrative purposes, and a position will be set up similar to that of the inspection sections of the Commerce Act, which in reality is worked by the States, or, in other words, another instance of double-banking will have been established. A central authority in the matter rf diseases for a continent like Australia, with its diversity, of climates, cannot deal satisfactorily with the needs of the different States on a uniform basis, because What may apply to one place may not apply to another ; for instance, a disease virulent in the Tropics mav not be of any .account, though present in the colder parts, but the Commonwealth law of uniformity would apply to both places -with similar intensity. The Queensland laws governing diseases in stock and in plants are quite equal to the necessities in connexion with diseases, and are not improved upon by the Federal Bill. Indeed, the latter does not contain  any  powers not covered bv the Queensland laws. The objections raised bv New South Wales apply to this State, so that there is jio necessity to deal <inline font-style="italic">seriatim</inline> with the different clauses of the Bill, but attention is drawn to the last four paragraphs of the minute of the Minister of Agriculture of New South Wales, which contain important points in connexion -with th'is matter, whether relating to plants -or animals. </para>

Probably the only difference of opinion that is likely tq arise in connexion with the Bill will be as to the possibility of interference with the powers of the States Governments and as to the constitutional aspect of that interference. I  propose to direct attention to some 'of the constitutional questions which suggest themselves. The legislation now proposed depends mainly on paragraph1. of section 51, paragraph ix. of the same section, and section 69 of the Constitution. These sections bear directly on the matter, and I propose to read them. Under paragraph 1. of section 51 it is provided that - </para>

                    <para>That is taken from the American Constitution, where the Federal authority under a similar power has assumed to control quarantine. In paragraph ix. of section <inline font-style="italic">51</inline> we have the bare word " Quarantine." In the Convention a good deal of discussion centred round what would be the effect of the use of this term in paragraph ix. The next reference to the matter is to be found in section 69, which has a rather important bearing upon it, as I think I shall be able to show. The section provides that - </para>

                    <para class="block">It cannot be denied that the States have power to deal with internal quarantine, and at any time a conflict may arise between the Federal and States authorities in this matter. We must therefore do our best to frame this legislation in such a way as to avoid such conflict between the States and Federal powers. I think it is conceded that, with regard to the general purpose of the Bill, which is to prevent the introduction of disease from oversea, there is not likely to be any difference of opinion in the Senate. A sound measure to enable the Federal Authority to deal with oversea quarantine will, I think, be welcomed by the whole of the States. . Any difficulty that is likely to arise will, I suppose, depend on the way in which we, as representatives of the States, regard the provisions of the Bill, as in any respect involving an improper intrusion upon the powers of the States. We shall have to consider what power must be assumed by the Commonwealth to regulate the States administration of quarantine in such a way that the interests of one may not be endangered by the action of another. We must recognise also that should the Government of a State be wilfully negligent in their administration of the internal affairs of the State with respect to the prevention of the spread of disease, we must have power to call upon that Government to so administer the laws affecting public health and quarantine that their actions shall no longer continue to be a menace to the health of their own people or of those of a neighbouring State. Keeping these ideas carefully before our minds, I think we shall be able to frame a measure acceptable to the whole of the people of Australia. With all respect for the opinion of the Minister of Home Affairs, I am inclined to believe that he was disposed to claim for this Parliament greater powers  than we are given under the Constitution. In substance, the honorable and learned senator has said that under paragraph ix. of section 51 - and he referred to the Convention debates on the subject - the Commonwealth Government has greater powers in the matter of quarantine than are possessed by the United States Congress. The honorable senator's remarks on the subject will be found at page 2946 of No. 20 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the present session. I do not quite agree with the opinion he has expressed. It is said that lawyers never do agree until. they are paid to do so, and then their agreement is the result of what they call a consultation. I hope that the Minister will take any criticism I offer kindly, and as no disparagement .of his opinion. I propose to quote authorities to show that under the Trade and Commerce section of the United States Constitution, the Congress of the United States has ample powers to deal with quarantine. I quote from <inline font-style="italic">Story on the Constitution,</inline> 5th edition. I may preface by saying that Justice Story, of the Supreme Court of the United States, is one of the most celebrated of American jurists, and is regarded as one of the greatest lawyers in the world.

J., in his judgment in <inline font-style="italic">Gibbons</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Ogden,</inline> enumerates " quarantine laws " and "'health laws of every description" as "component parts of that immense mass of legislation, which embraces everything within the territory of a State, not surrendered to the general Government; all which can be most advantageously  exercised  by the States themselves," and he adds " the Acts of Congress, passed in 1796 and 1799, empowering and directing the officers of the general Government to conform to and assist in the execution of the quarantine and health laws of- a State, proceed, it is said, upon the idea that these laws are constitutional. It is, undoubtedly, true that they do proceed upon that idea; and the constitutionality of such laws has never, so far as we are informed, been denied. But they do not  imply  an acknowledgment that a State may rightfully regulate commerce with foreign nations, or among the States; for they do not imply that such laws are an exercise of that power, or enacted with a view to it. On the contrary, they are treated as quarantine and health laws, are so denominated in the Acts of Congress, and are considered as flowing from the acknowledged power of a State to provide for the health of its citizens. But, as it was apparent that some of the provisions made for this purpose, and in virtue. of this power, might interfere with, and be affected by, the laws of the United States, made for the regulation of commerce, Congress, in that spirit of harmony and conciliation which ought always to. characterise the conduct of Governments standing in the relation which that of the Union and those of the States bear to each other, has directed its officers to aid in the execution of these laws";, and has, in some measure, adapted its own legislation to this object by making provisions in aid of those States." </para>

                    <para class="block">I invite the attention of honorable senators to those very weighty words of Chief Justice Marshall in that celebrated case,  and  commend the spirit of them to the conside-ration of the Government when any amendments  aTe  suggested or proposed from this side of the chamber, even assuming that we have exclusive jurisdiction in this matter, as the Minister contends. Outside the Senate there are some persons who talk about secession, and we hear the echo of their talk here. I remind those persons, both publicly and privately, that they cannot drive the mill with the water that has passed, and that it is futile on their part to disparage the existence and the authority of the Federal Government. At the same time, we are bound to respect the rights of the States, and I hope that our legislation or* the subject of quarantine will be framed in that spirit of loyalty to the States which we rightfully expect to be shown by them to us. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> in proof of the contention <inline font-style="italic">&gt;oi</inline> the Government, referred to the fact that in 1904 the Congress of the United States, under the authority of the trade and commerce power, passed am Act. to enable the Government to establish a quarantine station in a State. He argued from that fact that we could exercise the same power as the Congress had done, and that the American Government did interfere, by the proclamation of quarantine areas ir» the States. I do not think that a careful reading of its provisions will bear out the contention which the honorable senator, has placed on Act No. 1496. When it is looked into carefully, it will be found that every section dealing with the establishment of a quarantine station in a State directly relates to controlling transportation companies. It would be very interesting to peruse the debates which took place on the measure in the 58th Congress. My impression is that, from the repetition in every section of a reference to transportation companies, the Congress was exercising its trade and commerce power not to interfere with internal quarantine in the States, but to acquire certain control over the transportation companies, and in that way to prevent the spread of infection from State to State. If the Government rests entirely on the jurisdiction that it assumes that it possesses, it may be found that we are legislating beyond our powers. </para>

                            <para>- Section 69 gives the Government power to take over posts, Telegraphs and telephones, naval and military defence j lighthouses, lightships, "beacons and buoys ; and lastly quarantine. Does the Government think that under that -section they can deal with quarantine in the same way as they have dealt with posts and telegraphs or defence? It is undoubtedly the case that when we took over post and telegraphs or defence we took over ail the machinery of administration. The Departments are absolutely and exclusively ours. There is no such thing as divided authority  there. But is it contended that when the Federation says that it will take over quarantine, it can take over the whole of the buildings and administration in the same way? I submit that the Government has not such powers. My reason is this : We must take the word " Quarantine " as used in section, 69 in relation to the context. The section says - </para>

                            <para>- The word Quarantine " follows after the other lines in the section. The sequence seems to throw light on what, was in the minds of the framers of the Constitution. Just as it deals with lighthouses, lightships, beacons and buoys in one. breath, so it deals with quarantine in the next breath. It appears to me that the word " Quarantine," following immediately after the line. " Lighthouses, Lightships, Beacons, and Buoys," must refer almost entirely to oversea quarantine, I can quite understand why the States feel rather anxious in regard to this matter. Hitherto their Health Departments have been exceedingly well managed. It cannot he said that their duties have been neglected, so as to be a source of menace to the health of Australia generally. The States are jealous, and I think lightly so, of any Federal intrusion in this direction. But according to the contention of the Government the whole of the quarantine administration passes into the hands of the Federation as soon as a proclamation is issued. I do not intend now to go any further into the constitutional aspects of the case. I shall support the second reading of the Bill. But it is right that I should indicate the directions in which I think it ought to be amended. Although some of us may feel strongly as to States rights, no imputation ought to be cast upon our sincerity with reference to such a measure as this. I have been requested on behalf of the Government of Queensland to point out . that they are jealous of their administration, ' and hope that it will be interfered with as little as possible. They contend that their . jurisdiction ought not to be unduly limited. . Queensland has a coast-line of about 2,000 miles; and when honorable senators consider the amount of trade that comes down from the east by way of Queensland, and realize that the East is the breeding ground of the most infectious and dangerous diseases ' that affect mankind, it will be realized that the health authorities of that State have in their administration effectively safeguarded the-welfare of the people of this country. If we had been, neglectful in the administration of our health laws, Australia would have- been visited more than once. By infectious diseases. _ <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> know a case in which a ship left a British port with papers showing a clean bill of health. She came along the coast of Queensland, and as soon as she entered a port there a case of small-pox was detected. That one act of vigilance probably had the effect of saving Australia from serious disease. The fact that our health laws have been fairly successful constitutes a reason why the States should be left with a large measure of freedom. I shall refer only to one other provision in the Bill. I intend to move amendments upon paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">g, h,</inline> andi of clause  13.  While the measure was passing through another place useful amendments were made which showed that the Government intend to respect the rights and susceptibilities of the State authorities. I wish to indicate that I shall suggest an amendment with a view to carrying out the very wise advice given by Chief Justice Marshall, and of indicating that while we are not foregoing any powers that we possess with regard to quarantine, we certainly have no wish to interfere with the legislation of the States. If the Government will accept the amendment which I intend to propose, I may be pardoned for saying that we shall secure a Bill which will be as nearly perfect as possible. </para>
