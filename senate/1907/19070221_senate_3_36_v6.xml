The Commonwealth took them over in 1906, and on present Estimates, made provision for 20,000 junior and 3,000 senior cadets. It is now proposed, as a tentative measure, to provide, next year, for 31,000 junior and 6,000 seniors.

                    <para>The Vice-President of the Executive Council has very truly remarked that this order has been in force for a number of years. It has all the merits, and, of course, all the demerits, of antiquity. Some honorable members may think that it has worked very well ; and it has no doubt worked in a very large measure so as to waste the time of the Senate without any result. Every member of this Senate must know that private members' business under the existing rule has never had a fair show. Questions, notices of motion, and other preliminary business of a sitting have all to be dealt with before private members' business can be touched on a Thursday, and, consequently, very often it is nearly 3 o'clock before the latter is reached. It will be seen that three and a half hours each week is the only time within which private members have an opportunity to discuss questions they bring before the Senate. That method of doing business very often gives " stone-wallers " an opportunity. </para>

                            <para>- I have known the honorable senator who interjects take up the whole of Thursday afternoon, and then sit down with permission to resume his remarks on next private members' day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has jus,t given notice of a motion which, if carried into effect, will place the Government of the day in quite a different relation from that which they now occupy to private members. If carried, that motion will elevate private members and depreciate the Government ; and in this connexion is the one central fact with regard to parliamentary government which every member of Parliament ought to keep continually before his eye. Under our existing rules almost the whole burden and responsibility of government is thrown on a Committee of Parliament. If that Committee does not approve of business being brought before Parliament the business may be introduced by a private member, but it is then never sure of anything like fair treatment. The amendment I propose would give honorable senators an opportunity to exhaustively discuss, an.d, what is even more important, an opportunity to decide questions introduced as private business.' Every one, I think, must recognise that private members have just as much responsibility in regard to the affairs of the country as have the members of the Government. </para>

                            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie very properly remarks, there is no such thing as a private member. In any case, business brought in by ordinary members has hitherto been treated in a contemptuous kind of way. However earnest an honorable senator might be in any matter he has very often been accused of deliberately attempting to waste the time of the Senate. I wish to effect, if I can, some little improvement in regard to this matter; and I think that if the whole of Thursday be given up to private members, it will be a step in the right direction. Of course, if there is no private members business, Government business will go on, and if private business be finished at an hour earlier than that of the adjournment, then, again, Government business may be proceeded with. I submit this amendment in the hope that honorable senators will give it their careful consideration, and, if they think some change in the present method of conducting affairs is necessary - and I believe a great majority of honorable senators do think so - they will give it their support. </para>

                            <para>. - I have an amendment to move which, I think, will achieve the desirable object that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has in view, which is to secure further opportunities for the discussion of private business free from intentional obstruction. In the past our sessional order has permitted the discussion of private business between half-past 2 and half-past 6 on Thursdays. If at any time there should be elected an honorable senator desirous of intentionally obstructing, he would, under that order, know exactly the time to which he would have to obstruct to prevent the private business under discussion from being brought to a conclusion. But if we were to strike out the words " up to " with a view to substitute the word " after," then, if honorable senators felt interested in the question under discussion in private members' time, they could, if they chose, go on with it all night. It sometimes happens that a particular private senator is, perfectly honestly and earnestly, interested in matters that the Senate generally may think of no consequence whatever. In such a case under such a standing order as I suggest the private senator would be unable to keep senators present to enable him to continue the discussion. But there are times when a senator introduces a proposal in connexion with which a considerable majority of the Senate may desire that there should be further discussion. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, but Government business is on a different footing. To carry this amendment would be to take the whole of the business of the Senate out of the hands of the Government. Humble as the members of the Government in the Senate may be, there is a limit beyond which they cannot be trodden upon, surely. Looking at the matter from the stand-point of Government business, I think that it would be exceedingly undesirable - if we are to preserve that control over the sittings of the Senate which ought to be preserved by any Government - to accept the amendment. I trust, therefore, that the members of the Government will not assent to this very remarkable deviation from our past practice. </para>

                            <para>. - I hope that the Government will accept the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> Past experience, not only in the Senate, but in other legislative bodies in Australia, has made it fairly evident that something ought to be done to give private members of Parliament an opportunity of being a little more effective in their attempts to carry either motions or measures, especially when a considerable body of other representatives of the people is prepared to support them. I need not refer to our past experience, and have no inclination to do so. If the amendment is carried, a private senator will commence his business with the knowledge that, at any rate, if other senators are not interested in it, they will stay away, and that, when  10  or  11  o'clock comes, it must be a very important or urgent matter that will detain a quorum. So that the Senate will be adequately protected in that way. If the matter before the Senate is of sufficient importance to induce . senators to remain, I think that the senator who has introduced it ought to have a chance to push it to a conclusion if a sufficient number of senators support him. </para>

I point out that what is proposed will not effect an improvement. Indeed, it will probably operate in the opposite direction. It certainly will not operate advantageously so far as the individual private senator is concerned. No matter how strongly he may feel on a subject which he has introduced, he will have no opportunity of keeping a quorum. </para>

                                <para>- Undoubtedly. Every senator has a right to bring before the Senate measures which, in his opinion, are in the best interests of the country whose representative he is. It must be obvious to honorable senators that, if any particular section of the Senate - I do not care what it is - feels, a special interest in a subject, it can undoubtedly tire down the Senate in order to achieve what it desires. I wish to impress upon my honorable friends who feel inclined to support the amendment - and I speak from experience in a State Parliament - that, so far as private business is concerned, there is always the utmost difficulty in securing a House to deal with it. </para>

                                <para>- What I am urging is that our experience in past years has been such that the time allotted for private business has proved adequate. It has been suggested that "stone-walling" takes place. My experience is that no "stone-walling" has  taken place. In the very incident mentioned by my honorable friend, the honorable senator to whom he was no doubt alluding addressed himself to the very important question under discussion very earnestly, and with very great ability in my judgment. There was no "stone-walling" so far as I could discover in the arguments which he addressed to the Senate. Indeed, there was time to terminate the debate and have a division upon the motion. </para>

                                <para>- Within my experience it has been frequently the case that Government time has been given for the purpose of private business. But so long as we have in vogue the system of responsible government which we now enjoy, private business must give way to the exigencies of Government business. In view of what I have urged - that the amendment is not an improvement, that it will not give the extended time that honorable senators have sought - I submit that the experience of the past justifies us in adhering to our past practice. Of course if we discover that any " stone- wal ling " is indulged in it will be time enough to take some means of altering the sessional order in view of the exigencies that may then arise. But, frankly, I do not know that it is of much moment one way or the other whether that sessional order is carried or not, so far as this session is concerned, and it is possible that the debate might be more useful on a future occasion. </para>

                            <para>. - I sincerely hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> will withdraw his proposal. Instead of facilitating private business, it will give it a very great knock down. At present, on Thursdays, we have from half -past 2 till half-past 6 for private business. That is four hours. We have already passed a sessional order that we suspend the sitting each evening until a quarter to 8, so that if the amendment is carried, private business could not commence earlier than a quarter to 8. From then till 10 o'clock only gives two and a-quarter hours, or till 11 o'clock only three and a-quarter hours, and we could only get the usual afternoon four hours by going on till quarter to 12. That is entirely undesirable unless for proposals of very great importance. I am certain that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> reviewing the matter afresh in the light of what has been said, will now see that instead of facilitating private business, he would aim a  heavy blow at it, and therefore I trust he wilt withdraw the amendment. </para>

                            <para>. - Realizing that the Governor-General's speech, in consequence of the time and circumstances of this meeting, has rather a prospective than an immediate interest, I had intended to conclude my remarks last evening, but, led on by a number of relevant and interesting interjections, I was drawn over the limit that I set out to observe. I may therefore be excused for a few extra remarks this afternoon. When the Senate adjourned last evening I was referring to the paragraph in the GovernorGeneral's speech which touches the question of placing the finances of the Commonwealth upon a more equitable and satisfactory basis. As I said then, that is an extremely important, though difficult, question. There is probably no question in connexion with which there is more loose and ignorant thinking than that of the public indebtedness. Originating, as these States have, from citizens of Great Britain, our ideas on public finance and public borrowing are largely based upon the conditions of and the thoughts developed in the old country. The circumstances of public debt in the Commonwealth and in Great Britain are extremely different. There has grown up in Great Britain a superstition that the national debt is in itself an advantage. This has arisen probably from the fact that the national debt of Great Britain has been created by a process of internal borrowing, unlike what obtains with most other borrowing nations of the world. </para>

                            <para>- I will not split straws over the question. The fact remains that the very large interest bill of the United Kingdom is paid within the kingdom itself, and therefore the burden of it is not felt nearly so much as the burden of interest is felt in other countries that borrow externally. There is another important difference between the national debts of Great Britain and the Commonwealth. That of Great Britain was incurred mainly in defence of Great Britain and of the British Empire generally, and therefore, after it was expended, nothing of a material character was left. Of course, we all acknowledge the immense advantage to Great Britain and to ourselves that still accrues from the defence of the British Empire by our forefathers, but as a material asset nothing remains as a set-off for the British indebtedness. </para>

                            <para>- But it is not a material asset in the sense that it is paying interest, as some of our assets are. The fact that our indebtedness was largely incurred for the purpose of performing public works of a useful and reproductive character has had a tendency to mislead some thinkers upon the question. It is urged that most of the objects upon which our borrowed money was expended are paying the interest entailed by the borrowing. In a considerable measure that is true, although to some extent it is untrue. It is urged also that, as the objects upon which the money was expended are paying the interest that the loans entail, we are suffering no burden. There cannot be a greater mistake. There is going out of Australia between £8,000,000 and ,£9,000,000 annually in interest upon loans. If it was a fact that the whole of that interest was earned by the objects on which the money was expended, it would still be a burden, and an undesirable one - a burden which should not be endured if there was any possibility of preventing it. </para>

                            <para>- That is a wry much bigger question than the circumstances of this session would warrant me in entering into, although I venture to say that a great deal of our national expenditure would have been very much better incurred out of current 'revenue. Certainly the Commonwealth is setting a wise example that must bear immediate fruit of an extremely beneficial character in defraying the cost of the Public Service, either new or old, entirely out of current revenue. I do not pretend that that could have been done in the past. </para>

                            <para>- No; if the honorable and learned senator suggests for a moment that I hold in the least degree the idea of repudiation he is misconceiving me. What I am pointing out is that there is an expenditure which, if it did not exist, would be an advantage to us. We have draining out from this small population of  4,000,000  £2 per head per annum. Assuming that it were earned by the objects upon which the borrowed money was expended, still that would be a disadvantage if it could be averted. I venture to say that it could be done. I have no hesitation in saying it is not a fact that the interest is wholly or nearly earned by the works. A great deal of the borrowed money was expended upon works which have long since rotted away. Some of it was expended upon works which have had to be reconstructed out of additional loans. </para>

                            <para>- All business relations have some circumstances which it would be well to amend. The fact that this thing has happened before is no palliation. The fact that a man had one arm broken last year is no argument that' it would be a good thing for him to have the other arm broken this year. This money is going out of the Commonwealth every year. It seems to me that we ought by some means to discontinue or minimize public borrowing, because whenever we incur an additional debt it is always a debt1 far in excess of the sum received. Invariably our loans are floated at a discount, sometimes at a very alarming discount. </para>

                            <para>- I am not aware of a loan which has been floated recently at a premium. I have known loans to be floated at £92,  £94, <inline font-style="italic">£96,</inline> and £98, but almost invariably at a discount. What happens then? The loans are terminable, and we are unable to redeem them without increasing our indebtedness. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend may be all right, but if we borrow 000,000 at a discount or 10 per cent, we receive only ^900,000, but we must pay 000,000. If we have to borrow to redeem that loan, and we borrow again at a discount we have to borrow more than ^1,000,000; and if we cannot borrow at more than ,£90 we have to borrow £1,100,000. That process continually increases our indebtedness without in any way increasing the comfort that we derive therefrom - the products  in goods  or works or otherwise. Therefore it is extremely desirable that we should adopt some means of reducing our present indebtedness, and legitimately restricting future borrowings. Without knowing what proposal the Government may have in its mind for consolidating the State debts, I hold that no system will be completely satisfactory which does not provide first of all for the creation of a substantial sinking fund in order to relieve posterity of the load of indebtedness under which the Commonwealth is labouring, I believe that if we consolidate the State debts we shall make a very considerable saving. I quoted yesterday a distinguished representative of Canada, who assured us some years ago that when the Dominion was established it was  immediately  able to borrow at 1 per cent, less than the separate Canadian provinces had been able to borrow. That is not a theory, but a fact. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, the conditions must differ. We cannot hope to make as great a saving as they did in  Canada,  but the same combination of circumstances, in one direction at any rate, is sure to create in some degree the same advantages,; though it may not be 1 per cent., it may be £ or i per cent. At any rate, it ought to be obvious to every thinker that any stock which is of immense volume, and can be easily operated upon, is of more value than a limited stock which it is difficult to discover. The Federal stock, whenever the loans are consolidated, will be much more advantageous in financial markets, and therefore it will be of more value to the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- While I think that we must have created in the very near future some scheme for a sinking fund that will gradually but surely pay off our indebtedness, still we must have in connexion with future borrowings Federal control and definite restrictions. I apologise to honorable senators in some measure for having gone at such length into this intricate but extremely important question. It brings one naturally to another question of equal importance, though not of the same intricacy, and that is the question of old-age pensions. The Government has coupled the two questions together. I am not bv  any  means clear that there is any necessity for one to be contingent upon the other. </para>

                            <para>- I am not clear that there is any necessity for the Government to couple the two questions together, but still I feel that a wise consolidation and manipulation of the debts would lead to a saving, which would go a very considerable way to meet the expense of a Federal old-age pensions scheme. We all know that the principle of old-age pensions - the feeling that men and women who have done the country's work through a long life and have not succeeded in making some provision for their declining years, are a proper charge upon the whole community - is spreading. </para>

                            <para>- The i'dea has not spread everywhere yet, but it has I think so completely impregnated the Australian mind that we are justified in assuming that there is a general demand for the accomplishment of a scheme of old-age pensions in some efficient form. Clearly then, there is nobody competent to effectively deal with the matter but the Federal Parliament. In the early 'days there came to these States, then separate Colonies, some of the most strenuous, and physically and mentally fit men and women from the old world. The fact of their coming here was an indication of an adventurous, roaming spirit ; and under the conditions which then prevailed, and the great opportunities for personal advancement, or, at any rate, for the change that is so dear to adventurous spirits, they flitted from Colony to Colony, but leaving everywhere marks of their energy and enterprise which was of so much advantage to the whole Commonwealth. There are a number of those old men and women to-day stranded in the evening of their lives - men and women who, owing to the restless energy with which they were filled, never stayed long enough in any State or Colony to qualify under any conditions that must prevail in connexion with a State system of old-age pensions. If a State adopts on its own account on old-age pensions scheme, it must take some precaution that it is not imposed on by those who are not properly citizens of that State. Therefore, there are quite a number of highly deserving, poor, helpless people, who are not eligible for an old-age pension under the  conditions  that any State has' created. The Commonwealth ought, therefore, as early as possible, to provide some comprehensive scheme that will embrace those who have been citizens of the Commonwealth, some of them for thirty, or forty, or even fifty years, but who have not been citizens of a single State consecutively long enough to qualify for a pension. I am glad to see in the Governor-General's speech a reference to this question. I now desire to refer to the question of the Northern Territory, which I spoke of last night as of kindred importance with the question of Federation. Australia can never complete an effective scheme of defence until it has acquired control over that territory. </para>

                            <para>- That is another question. We cannot defend Australia until we have control of the Northern Territory ; and therefore it is extremely urgent that the Commonwealth should acquire that control. At the same time I feel that the control ought to be acquired under conditions that are equitable to South Australia and to the Commonwealth. It would be a great misfortune if the Commonwealth Parliament permitted any State of the Commonwealth to, so to speak, put the rest of the Commonwealth in its pocket. In dealing with the financial arrangements there ought to be given fair consideration to the expenditure that South Australia has already had to incur in connexion with this very 'difficult administration. But there ought to be only fair consideration; there ought to be a determination that South Australia, like the rest of the States, should bear its share of the loss in connexion with what I hope will soon be a common burden so far as the past is concerned, and a common asset so far as the future is concerned. The last paragraph of  His  Excellency's speech refers to an arrangement for commercial interchange between various sections of the Empire. This question probably transcends all others in importance, intimately connected as it is with the question of defence. We know that throughout the civilized worl'd to a greater extent probably than ever before, the nations are standing up against each other armed to the teeth, and are continuing and extending their armaments ; and therefore, the danger to any nation is greater than it was in times past. Munitions of war are being increased in their destructiveness - are being rendered more deadly and more terrible in action. In order that our Empire mav be capable of defending itself against the possibilities by which it is surrounded, nothing can be more important than that it should be made completely self-contained and self-supporting in all its wide ramifications. We know that the dear old Mother Country is not by any means in that condition at the present time. Great Britain draws from the rest of the world to an enormous extent for its daily require.ments ; it draws from nations which might, any day, be at war with the Empire, and depends for its three meals each day largely on those nations. I have not the figures, up to date, but I remember that, on looking them up a little while ago, I discovered that England imports in breadstuffs  alone between 5,000,000 and 6,000,000 tons per annum, while the other parts of the Empire contributes to that less than 1,000,000 tons. The United States, of America contributes something approaching 4,000,000 tons of the whole; and, supposing the possibility - which I hope and expect will never arise - that England were at war with those whom we affectionately term our American cousins, she would be deprived of four-fifths of her bread supply. </para>

                            <para>- We know that 1892 was a drought year in Australia, and that the exports in that year were comparatively trifling. But Canada sent to Great Britain only 600,000 tons of breadstuffs, while the whole of the British Dominions supplied something less than 1,000,000 tons out of the 5,363,000 tons imported by England. However, that is only an illustration of what is going on in connexion with almost every product imported into Great Britain. In order that Great Britain may be secure, and that the Empire, which depends for its security on England's security, may be assured of the possibility of defending itself - existing as it does in the midst of an aggressive belligerent world - it is. very desirable, if practicable, that all the products which are used by the various parts of the British Empire should be obtained within the borders of the Empire. Such an object, it seems to me, would be facilitated if some effective satisfactory means of trade preference could be arrived at. </para>

                            <para>- I do not desire to discuss the whole question ; all I say is that it is to be hoped that by means of this Conference of Prime Ministers some satisfactory solution, or even the nucleus of a solution, will be evolved. If that be so. we shall lie well repaid for the inconvenience that arises from our not being able to go on at once with public business. For those reasons, I congratulate Parliament upon the speech that has been submitted, and, with the greatest possible pleasure, second the motion for the adoption of the Address in Reply. </para>

                            <para>.- Owing to the absence of the leader of the Opposition, I find myself called upon to speak much; earlier than I intended. It appears to me that this debate opens up every political question which is now before the electors, and, therefore, I make no apology if I allude to various matters which, possibly, may not be mentioned in the short speech which His Excellency has graciously delivered to us. We have had a very heated contest at the general election. We have had very grave issues put before the electors, and we have a Prime Minister continuing, in office in violation of the principles which he most strongly and eloquently enunciated to the people. I, therefore, think that, whether </para>

                        <para class="block">I say it or not, a great deal remains to be said, and a great deal ought to be said, so that we may have the atmosphere cleared, and know whether or not the present Prime Minister and his colleagues and supporters are in the future to govern the Commonwealth by constitutional principles or otherwise. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has exceedingly cleverly, from the Government point of view, placed before us certain issues, which, he says, were submitted to the electors. I agree with the honorable senator, to some extent, that one of the issues was the old fiscal issue of more protection. It is true also that the leaders of the Opposition in both Houses put before the electors the question of anti-Socialism against Socialism - a sound and sane method of dealing with our industrial life, ,as against the extraordinary Germanic and continental idea of nationalizing all means of production and exchange, and practically depriving the community of those incentives which are planted in human nature, and which alone can give us the progress we desire. But my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> omitted altogether the third issue put before the electors by the Prime Minister himself ; and that was the impossibility  of carrying on constitutional government with three parties in the field; that you cannot do that any more than you can have a decent game of cricket with three elevens. </para>

                                <para>- My honorable friend has maintained a very discreet silence about this very important issue. We have the Prime Minister's own words for saying that constitutional government in the proper sense of the term - meaning a high p'hase of it - cannot be carried on as parties now exist. The Prime Minister spoke most eloquently and most plausibly about this matter. Indeed, he gave up his political life in defence of his principles, but we found him a short time afterwards going back to the Treasury bench under exactly the same circumstances, putting his principles in his pocket, forgetting all about them and living by principles the very opposite of those which he had politically died to uphold. This is, to my mind, a very important matter indeed, because I should like to ask my honorable friends opposite - especially the new leader of the Senate - where it is going to end ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tren</inline> with in his speech recollected nothing about the dirt eating of which we have heard something. Surely he cannot have forgotten the remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, who said that he had eaten dirt long enough, and the eloquent words of the Prime Minister, in stating the reasons why he gave up the reins of Government and forsook office with all its emoluments, its honours, and its dignities. Every word that the Prime Minister then said is more than applicable at the present time. I desire to know whether the Prime Minister was right or wrong in what he then maintained? If he was wrong, let us know it, and let us know what his future principles are to be. If we are to have logrolling by parties and alliances, we ought te know it. For my own part, I believe that the Prime Minister was right, and that is the view which every sound constitutional authority must uphold. But if the Prime Minister was right then, he is now living in defiance of every sentence that he uttered then. That is my point. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so; and after he had given up the reins of Government, and when I suppose he felt very bitter at having been squeezed out of office. But let us go back to the issues that were before the country at the last election. I have no hesitation in saying that the issue of protection - from what I have seen and read and from studying the statistics - was merely a side issue. I do not deny that it was put forward as a Government issue, and was adopted by some of those politicians who were fighting for their lives and battling for "their seats. But I have no hesitation in saying that from the point of view of tens of thousands of electors, that issue was an absolute sham and a bogy. We all recollect, indeed, that not long before the cry was for fiscal peace. At that time the very newspapers which at the last election were clamouring for more protection., were eloquently expounding the idea of fiscal peace. But a very clever gentleman, who now occupies a seat on the High Court bench, bethought himself of a stick with which to break the Reid 'Government; and he started up again this bogy of " more protection," although it had been agreed by every party in the Parliament, and by the whole press, that we  ought not again to raise fiscal strife. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> succeeded admirably in attaining his purpose. He succeeded in bringing about the downfall of the Reid Government ; and because this bogy issue made such a splendid means of upsetting that Government and of doing what the Labour Party and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> wanted, they have had to go on with the farce of pretending to themselves and to the electors that this issue of free-trade and protection is once more a live one. It has become a live issue. I admit it. But it is a bogus issue. We all know, of course, that the game of politics has to be carried' on, and that a few issues of this kind are necessary for the playing of the game. But surely you expect something better from a statesman than the mere playing of a party game with all its tricks, .n man who is capable of nothing better than that is no true statesman; he lives on sentiment and, though expressing very grand ideas, absolutely acts in defiance of them all. My belief is - and I have heard the same view expressed by hundreds of electors - not in Victoria, of course - that the protectionists of Victoria have once more gone mad. They can think of nothing else but " more protection." Protectionists, free-traders, and moderate tariffists all joined together as earnestly as they could in framing our present Tariff. The cry then was ' ' Revenue without destruction." I do not believe in this ultra-protection that is now asked for, but without which it appears that some of our Victorian factories cannot live. The issue of anti-Socialism against Socialism raised at the last elections was a far more pressing one. It is an issue which was far more effective, and which is of far more concern to our industrial life and to the principles on which our government ought to be carried on. </para>

I do not desire to saddle my friends of the Labour Party with a belief in the establishment of State nurseries or in the abolition of the marriage tie. I simply desire to deal with them according to their own platform. They advocate a phase of continental Socialism, namely, the nationalization of the means of production and exchange and transportation. But for purposes of electioneering - as one of the tricks of the game - they have lowered their demands, and now say that they desire simply to nationalize industries as they become monopolies. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> has said, they desire to go one step at a time - a very good thing to do if you are going ahead in the right direction. </para>

                                <para>- I am happy ro say that in the Senate I do not see any evidence of the approval of the country. The Senate has been strengthened in the opposite direction. It has been made stronger in support of sound and proper principles - those principles without which there can be no real progress. I have no doubt that at the next elections the Senate will be made even stronger in this direction, and that it will be able to take its proper place in the affairs of the country, and to act very usefully as a saucer in which to cool the Labour Party's proposals. When we come to deal with the Tariff, as we shall have to do later on, I believe that we shall find that that issue was very much of a bogy. I should like to know how it is to be dealt with. The last Tariff took exactly nine months to frame. On that occasion we were deluged with placards and manifestoes from both sides as to what the duties ought to be. </para>

                                <para>- We were almost worried to death by them, each side putting its version of the facts and figures before members of Parliament. If anomalies in the Tariff have been discovered; if there are things in it which need rectification, those matters should be attended to. But if the whole Tariff is to be opened up, no one can suppose that there will not be a conflict between the free-traders, the moderates, and the Victorian protectionists, just as there was before. Compromises will be arrived at, and it is bound to take a very long time. I deny that there is any necessity for increased duties. In Tasmania we have several important industries. We have two woollen mills in Hobart which are being carried on most admirably, and have more orders than they can fulfil. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnstone,</inline> of Johnstone Brothers, told me that in November last he sent away 5,000 pairs of blankets, and that he is turning out over 100 pairs per day. I asked him if 15 per cent, on woollens was sufficient. He said that it was more than ample, and that he could manage with 10 per cent. Indeed, he said he believed that the industry need not fear if it had to compete with England or foreign nations without any duty at all. But, following up the ideas of the Victorian protectionists, he said that, though they might be able to do with 15 per cent., they would rather have 20 per cent. This factory ih Hobart is equipped with all the latest machinery, it has become strong, and fears no competition. So far from wanting a higher duty than 15 per cent., <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnstone</inline> is certain that it can do with less. Turning to the question of the boot industry, what do we find ? For five years, under the Reid Government, in New South Wales, that industry was carried on without any protection whatever. If that could be done for five years in New South Wales, it seems evident that an increase of duty is not required. It cannot be urged that the Victorian factories were better off at that time than the New South Wales factories, or that the Victorian factories were more solvent. Indeed, I had it pointed out to me that they were less solvent than were the free-trade factories in New South Wales. If that be so - and I am assured that it is a fact that no one can deny - what are we to think of a number of gentlemen who say that 30 per cent, on boots is not sufficient, and that the duty must be raised? Such an argument is a mockery of the people of this country. </para>

                                <para>- My question still remains, and I want an answer to it. I am going to attempt to give an answer myself. I may not be right, but I will make a guess at it. My question is, " Where is this state of things going to end ? " In the way in which we have been going, in the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has been holding on to office, this is what may happen : <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> will come back from England - whether he tackles the Tariff before this takes place or not I do not know - and at the right moment <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> will probably say to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> and there is nothing to stop him, "You have had office, for one, two, or three years. You have had it solely owing to the alliance, written or unwritten, direct or indirect, with, and the support! of, the Labour Party. Our party is larger than yours. We have not had a portfolio. We have not had any of the sweets of office. All the portfolios have been given to your party. You have had all the sweets of office, and now do not you think it is time for a change? I therefore suggest - rather I do not suggest, but I demand - that you send in your resignation to the Governor-General, and advise  His Excellency  to send for me, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson."</inline> Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> will go on to say, " I expect from you no more and no less than the support which I and my labour colleagues have given to you." That is the nice state of affairs that  Ave  are coming to. Where is it going to stop? It is a pretty end to all <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> told us. That is what will come of this three elevens system, and it will come in spite of all <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> warnings, because, although he warns us, he does nothing but live upon the system he condemns. I am rather strong about this point, because mv friend the Prime Minister, whom as a man we all respect and almost love, cannot as a politician ask us to have confidence in him any longer. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> had the chance of his life, and he has never stretched out a little finger to take it. He has never stretched out anything but his tongue to put an end to this system that he has condemned <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> such scathing terms. He has never done a single thing to end what he said was absolutely subversive of all responsible government. What might he have done when he was forming his Government? Instead of going back to exactly the same position as was not fit for him to live under twelve months before, why did he not ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> to join him, and give the Labour Party some of the portfolios, having a Labour-Liberal Government, as he ought to have done? I suppose he would say it was impossible, that the portfolios would not have been accepted, but does not every man of common-sense see that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> had taken up that position he would have been now in a strong position which nobody could assail? He would have tried then by his acts to carry out the principles he had avowed. He would have made some effort to stamp out the system which he said was pushing the Commonwealth over a precipice. He would have made some effort to lick the Labour Party into something like decent shape, instead of having to condemn them as a party without either judgment or conscience, or something of that sort. He could have done all that, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> of course, would have declined the offer. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> could not accept it. He has to reckon not only with the caucus - not only with the pledged members who are here, and who would have forbidden it - but also wilh the organization outside. I refer to the Political Labour Council, over which I see our friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is now going to preside. He would have had to consult outside organizations which nobody but the Labour Party knows, composed of non-entities, of men who are politically unknown. They would have had to consider the matter, and they would have said to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> "Tell <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> to keep his portfolios to himself." But what a strong position <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> would have been in if he had taken that step. If the Labour Party had refused his offer then, could they have gone on refusing it? If a common-sense proposition is made to the Labour Party, under which responsible government can be carried out, are they going to refuse it always ? They dare not, because they know they would lose greatly in the opinion of the electors, who, after all, would be their masters then as they are now. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has missed his chance, and here is a gentleman by the name of </para>

There would have been then two parties in Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> by missing his chance, has left it to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson,</inline> of Perth, to suggest that the Labour Party's platform wants broadening. Would not any man of common-sense agree with him, notwithstanding the repudiation of my honorable friend sitting opposite? This gentleman has pointed out that there is too much of the pledge in the Labour Party's programme. Ts there a man of common-sense in the Commonwealth who will not indorse that view? Has any man the right to come here as a mere delegate - as a mere talking machine - the ropes being pulled by somebody outside? Has anybody the right to come here as a kind of slave? We have heard a great deal about slavery applied by the Labour Party to the question of Chinese labour, but what are some honorable members sitting here but slaves? They cannot vote for fear they should violate a pledge. They do nothing but what they are told, not only by the caucus, but by the labour councils outside. This gentleman in Perth has a soul above the present Labour Party. He is going up towards something high - something like good and proper government. Here is one man, at all events, who would have shaken our Prime Minister by the hand and told him he was on the right track. </para>

Here is a pledged Labour PartY. here is a caucus, here is an outside machine having control over them all, and anybody who professes to raise a voice against them is a traitor and a blackleg, and everything that is bad. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline> has not the strength to do this, if he cannot convert the Labour Party, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth might have made a very great step towards converting them. I understood from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> trenchant criticism, from his. eloquent words, that he was speaking from the bottom of his heart, and voicing his inmost convictions about what responsible government ought to be, and I am bitterly disappointed that so far from taking a single step to carry out his principles he has been living every day and every, hour since by violating them. Therefore, however much I have regarded and esteemed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> I cannot understand his. actions, and politically I think he has forfeited the esteem and regard of all men in the Commonwealth who desire what he apparently desires - constitutional government. I think the very gravest consequences are ahead of us. I see nothing whatever to prevent the scheme I have enunciated being carried out, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> changing places, and the same old logrolling system going on which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has so strenuously condemned. It therefore appears to me a very great pity that the Prime Minister is to attend the Imperial Conference at Home. We ought to, and I hope we 'do, take a great interest in the subjects of vast importance which are to be brought before that Conference, and we do not want to move any motions which would in any way detract from the position which the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth ought to take up, and the dignity which he ought to command when he gets there. At the same time, I am sure there are thousands of electors who do not believe that the Prime Minister will worthily represent them on many points. One point upon which I think they will be misrepresented is that of protection, applying it as we must to the question of preferential trade. I regard preferential trade as about the most important question which can or will ever come before the Empire, except the question of defence. There are various opinions in the old country about it, but every day men whose integrity, ability, education and culture can- not be doubted are coming' round to the idea- that some change is wanted in the fiscal policy of the Empire. I would recommend my honorable friends opposite to read two speeches recently delivered by Lord Milner. He is the coming man. I believe he will take <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain's</inline> place. He describes himself as an Imperialist of the deepest dye, and personally I hope to live and die an Imperialist of the deepest dye also. I have a much better cry than "Australia for the Australians." I have the cry of "Australia for the Empire." </para>

                                <para>- We are not talking about Chinese. People who talk about the Chinese generally endeavour to hunt them out of the country when they want to get the sweets of office, and when they have got the sweets of office they want to keep them in. That is the only thing I have learnt recently about those who talk of the Chinese. If my honorable friends read Lord Milner's speech they will' see what a true Imperialist is. In spite of all the surroundings of England, in spite of the press and the free-trade victories, he announces himself as a preferential trader, and if preferential trade does mean a moderate amount of protection he will have it for the sake of binding the Empire together. But what is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> idea of preferential trade? Have we not had a sample of it in this Senate, and did not four of us walk out of the Chamber for the express purpose of killing the Bill, believing, as we did then, and do now, that the Bill was a disgrace to Australia? The factory owner of Australia was riot called upon to sacrifice a single farthing. I suggested that the Bill would have our support if on even half-a-dozen items there was a paltry 5 per cent, given to Great Britain ; but not a bit of it. No Minister who" is supported by the Victorian factory owners could dare to reduce duties. Whoever heard of knocking off a paltry 5 per cent, from a duty of 40 or 50 per cent. ? The Victorian factory owner woul'd think you had all gone mad - that you were all fit for Yarra Bend. I contend that that Bill was a mockery, and therefore I helped to kill it. I hope Ave shall never see such a Bill again. How can it benefit Great Britain if we raise the duty on boots from 30 to 40 or 50 per cent., or raise the duty on hats, or raise the duty on most manufactured articles by  10 or 15 per cent, in our Tariff, and then put on more 'duty as against the outside world, if we still leave those high duties against Great Britain ? If we do that, what is the use of talking about preferential trade ? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> whenever he talks on this subject, says he believes in preferential trade. But what is the use of believing in a principle and then bringing in a scheme which is an absolute impossibility? Is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> going to live by doing these things? Is he going always to govern the Commonwealth by announcing most wonderful ideas and then acting contrary to them ? I desire to see the Empire consolidated, and when I am told that it can be bound together by no ties other than those of sentiment, I do not believe the statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> - who, I admit, is a most clever young gentleman - says that the defence of the Empire is not a business proposition, but I should like to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> anr] Lord Milner on the other side. What did Lord Salisbury say about the defence of the country? He said that it was not the business of the War Office, but that of the people. To consolidate the Empire, to defend its parts, to increase the trade between the different parts, is a business proposition in every sense. How <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill,</inline> with his free-trade notions, or whatever notions he holds, can say that the defence of the Empire is not a business proposition, I cannot understand. It. is one of those catch phrases which caught on, and which I suppose made (his party think that he was a very fine young gentleman in answering the preferential traders for the time being. Now, are we here to do business? Is not everything in connexion with defence and trade essentially a business proposition? I hope that when the Prime Minister goes Home he will not misrepresent us, but will come back and give us a scheme of preferential trade which will not flout Great Britain, which, to use <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain's</inline> words, will not be a mockery, but which will help to bind the Empire together, and have some tendency towards free-trade within the Empire. My protectionist friends on the other side may point to the United States and Germany, and say that they furnish absolute evidence of the benefits of protection. But it is equally open to me to say, and it is said in every modern book that one takes up. that Germany and America furnish splendid evidence of the benefits of freetrade.

                                <para>- All I know is that Victorians are now shouting for a bogus issue. My honorable friend may say that Germany affords a wonderful instance of the benefits of protection, but I submit that she also furnishes a. wonderful instance of the benefits of inter-Imperial free-trade. If the Prime Minister is to worthily represent the Commonwealth, he ought to have some scheme to submit which would make for more free-trade within the Empire. But my honorable friends want a little more protection against the outside world, and I have come to the conclusion that here it is of no use to be a free-trader. </para>

                                <para>- My honorable friend knows well that to some of the industries of Great Britain 21 per cent, may mean a very great deal. It may mean all the difference between losing and gaining a market. There again my honorable friend bears out my argument. In Victoria the people are not used to reductions of duties. The very idea of it makes their hair stand on end. It is a kind of medicine to which they are not accustomed. They are asking for more and more protection. A man  might  as well save his breath as talk to a Victorian about taking off duties. </para>

                                <para>- I understand that, to a great extent, the manhood of Victoria has been leaving, and this exodus has all taken place in spite of most strenuous efforts to keep up high protective duties. I was very pleased indeed to hear the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> with regard to defence. This afternoon I learned from the reply of the Minister of Home Affairs to my question that the cadet system is to be enlarged. But I ask Ministers if they are not absolutely ashamed of the cadet system as it stands. According to the statistics we' have in Australia 310,000 youths between 12 and 19 years of age. Under the first scheme which was enunciated, it was proposed, out of that number, to drill about 23,000 youths, at a cost of £23,000 a year, but it is now proposed in the near future to drill 37,000. Is that the way in which to train the manhood of Australia? to put our defences in order, to carry out a single idea that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> has enunciated with regard to the absolute necessity of being able to defend our shores? Here we have a dozen schemes before us. There is universal training, which some persons want, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> thinks we ought to have, but which I do not think either the manhood or the pockets of Australia would stand. There is no reason why we should go in for a system of universal training. But there is the Swiss system, under which a young man is taken at the age of 17 or 18 years in the infantry for forty days in the year, and in the cavalry for fifty days. In every subsequent year he has to submit to so many days' training, perhaps twenty or thirty, and gradually his annual term of drill is reduced. In that way they have built up a very large army of trained men. I believe that these trained men have been complimented upon their efficiency by military experts. Because we cannot get evert the Swiss system here, the Victorian Defence League, to which I belong, has suggested to Ministers that they should call upon the manhood of Victoria to enrol themselves as either cadets or rifle-club men or volunteers, and then, if that call is not readily met, as I am quite sure it will not be, the League is going to ask the Government to introduce a scheme of universal training. But the Defence League of New South Wales is now asking the Government to adopt a scheme of universal training. If it is thought that any form of universal, training would be evaded, the only course to adopt is to have an absolutely up-to-date and perfect system of cadet training applicable to all youths between 12 and 19 years of age. Then we should have some material to work upon, and if ever universal training were introduced probably a week spent in camp once a year for three years, with so many nights' drill and so many afternoons' rifle practice, would serve to make these trained cadets efficient soldiers. But the way in which we are fiddling with the matter can lead to no good result. Let me point out once again two or three fatal flaws in the cadet system. In the first place, there is nothing compulsory about it. We compel boys and girls to go to school in order to learn how to read, write, and figure, but we will not even take the trouble to enact that they shall go to school for the express purpose of being drilled, made square-shouldered, taught how to deport themselves, and to develop their muscles. </para>

                                <para>- I should think that we ought to be able to get 37,000 cadets out of the 310,000 youths in the Commonwealth; but I feel certain that unless we have some sort of compulsion, more than one-half of the youths of the Commonwealth will never attend drill. Why is the matter to be left to the whim of the cadet or to the fad of the parent? Why cannot we have a compulsory system of drill ? We have a compulsory system of education. Is not drill part of a boy's education? Certainly it is. The answer I got from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> to-day was a little hazy on the question of the uniform. I happen to know that some of the military experts think it a perfect farce to put boys of 12 to 13 years of age into a uniform which costs 15s. There is no occasion for the junior cadets pf 12, 13, and 14 years of age to be provided with more than perhaps a cap. Let the uniform be withheld until they begin to get into senior rank. Let it be given as a kind of reward to them for having become efficient in their drill. Is there any sense ir. requiring boys of that age to wear a uniform at a cost of 15s., when we can drill only a tenth part of the youth of the Commonwealth? Is that the way in which to get a citizens' army or to build up a Defence Force? Certainly it is not.  Colonel McCay's  scheme was to apply to all boys attending school. What is the good of that system when in some of the States boys leave the State school when they are 13 years of age? What is the use of applying a compulsory system to a school boy when we want to get hold of the youths of from 14 to 17 years of age? Is it not far more important to drill the youths when they are becoming hobble- de-hoys and larrikins than to bother about putting in uniform boys of 12 and 13 years of age? The proposal will not bear examination for a moment. I understand that the Government, with the exception of one Minister, believe in universal training, but they have not the courage to apply a system of that kind to the boys in our schools. How can we ever expect to have a proper military system while we have a weak-kneed Government of that description? I do not quite agree with all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> said about the command of the seas and the use of a Navy in comparison with our Military Forces. I think that if we enter upon the construction of an Australian Navy it will land us into an enormous expenditure, which I feel quite sure the electors are not prepared to allow their representatives to vote. In my opinion, this idea of an Australian Navy is a mistake. I understand that a great number of our Admirals and Naval men hold that view. Possibly they may be prejudiced in favour of the Imperial Navy, but still their advice is worth listening to. It appears to me to be the height of folly to say that we cannot afford to expend £100,000 or £150,000 upon the training of our boys, but can afford to go in for a Navy which is estimated to cost £3,000,000. We ought to trust to the Imperial Navy, though not to Imperial seamen. Let us train our naval cadets and our young men for defence on the sea as well as for defence on land. Let us not only have ships as training vessels for Australians., but let us have some of the squadron manned by Australian men and commanded by Australian officers. But why break away 'from the old country and declare that we desire a navy of our own? Are we to enter upon the construction of armed cruisers and of battleships like the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought?</inline> With schemes for old-a,ge pensions, an interState railway, and the taking over of the Northern Territory, shall we ever have money with which to build an Australian navy ? If we follow our experts., who, of course, believe that there is " nothing like leather," I am afraid we shall be committed to an expenditure which will mean disaster. The Prime Minister, if he is not  careful, will, I fear, misrepresent Australia. I do not believe that Australia is. prepared to break away from the Imperial Navy, or to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> in departing from the example of New Zealand. We ought to continue to subscribe to the Imperial Navy, but we should subscribe more in men and material than in money. The idea of our trying to build a few torpedo boats and destroyers, and then imagining that such a policy will help in the defence of our ports ! The ports are not the point ; the battle which will decide the fate of the Empire will be fought upon the high seas. Australia must stand or fall with the Empire; let us, therefore, have one Empire, one trade, one navy, taking care that in the Navy there are Australian men and boys and Australian officers. I am very much interested in the question of the proposed Imperial Council, the establishment of which, I think, would do an enormous amount of good in the way of consolidating the Empire, and helping the people in Great Britain to understand Australia, and helping Australians to understand our friends at Home. An Imperial Council of the kind might meet every two years, if once a year were too often, and representatives, from Australia could be sent. It is, therefore, a bitter disappointment to me that the Premiers of the various States which formed this Commonwealth are not summoned to attend the forthcoming Imperial Conference. This omission I regard as a great blunder on the part of the Liberal Party. It may be said that we have federated for the 'sole reason that in regard to defence matters we may speak with one voice ; and that the Prime </para>

                        <para>Minister does voice the opinions of the whole of the Federation. But defence is not the only question that has to be considered; we have to consider the administration of the lands of the various. States, and also the question of immigration. The Commonwealth has nothing to do with the administration of the lands in the States. Under the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> there is much talk of schemes of immigration, though it is well known that no scheme can be carried out unless the States supply the land. Then, further, the very life of the States, financially and otherwise, depends on right decisions in regard to all those matters in which the Federal Parliament is paramount ; and it is a great mistake to imagine that any one man can speak for a vast continent like Australia. New South Wales has a population of 1,500,000, and a revenue of over  £12,000,000, with an enormous trade ; and yet it is not proposed that the Premier of that State, or one of the State's Ministers, shall be summoned to the Imperial Conference. </para>

                                <para>- It might lead to complications, if either view were pressed to a bitter determination, and the States and the Commonwealth voted against each other. But the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> seems to me to favour the summoning of the States Premiers to the Conference. If it should turn out that after argument the Premiers were to prove the Prime Minister to be wrong, and the Prime Minister should go in a direction opposed to that desired by the Premiers, what then about the representation of Australia? Would it not be .disastrous to send Home a Prime Minister who, on an important point, went in an exactly opposite direction to that desired by the Premiers? All this goes to show, I think, that the Imperial Council ought to consist of a larger number. There is no desire to have over representation, or to have two or three Ministers from each little State galloping to England every now and then ; but there ought to be adequate representation, and I submit that one man is not sufficient. I am very hopeful that a scheme to give constitutional power to the proposed Imperial Council may be evolved, and that out of this Conference we may get what I shall not call a governing body, but some body  in which every part of the Empire will be heard on all matters in which they are concerned, such as defence, trade, post and telegraph administration, and immigration. As to the question of the Final Court of Appeal, I should like to say that in the Federal Convention I fought as hard as I could against in any way cutting down or removing the privilege of the humblest elector to appeal to  His  Majesty in Council. I can very well recollect being " hauled over the coals " by the leader of the Opposition in this Chamber, who was also a member of the Convention. I was opposed to the honorable and learned gentleman on this point, though I offered my opposition with great deference  in view *&lt;Sf the fact that I regarded him as knowing more of such matters than I did myself. I pointed out, however, that the Federation was intended to enlarge the privileges of the people of Australia, and I never believed for a moment in preventing the Privy Council from dealing with any question regarding the interpretation of the Constitution. It appeared to me then, as it appears to me now, that the men who framed the Constitution, and who listened to the speeches of the framers and the comments of the press, were the worst to undertake the work of interpretation j and, as I say, I never  believed  in interfering in any degree with the right of every subject to appeal to the King in Council. I hope that the judgment of the Privy Council will stand in regard to the payment of income tax by Federal officers, and that the High Court and every Court throughout the Empire will acknowledge the  Privy  Council to be the highest tribunal for all parts of the Empire. </para>

                        <para class="block">Government could foreshadow any scheme which would settle the financial problem justly between the States and the Commonwealth. It is an old dodge, of course, to mix up a popular issue like old-age pensions with some other great scheme. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> tried the dodge, and, in spite of it, he came in for scathing criticism. The best way would be to let the question of old-age pensions "paddle its own canoe," and be judged on its merits. I am far more in favour of giving old-age pensions - but in a proper manner - than I am of building an Australian Navy. Last session I gave notice of motion, which, however, never reached discussion, dealing with this matter, and I shall probably reintroduce the motion, or submit an amendment on the Bill, when the old-age pensions proposals are before us. By all means give pensions to old men and women who cannot help to earn a living for themselves ; but it is the height of folly to scatter old-age pensions broadcast for everybody for all time to come, without asking those who are to participate to practice thrift or contribute in any way - without asking men to give up one pot of beer or two figs of tobacco per week, a denial which would be sufficient to provide a pension. If no other honorable senator will support me in this view, I shall stand alone. In years to come the legislation we are now passing must react on the character of our people, and if we desire to make them strenuous, self-reliant, and thrifty, we shall not do so by pitching 10s. a week at the head of every one who, it may be, hides his money or exaggerates his poverty. The systems adopted in Germany, Denmark, and other places are working most admirably; but the representatives of the people in Australia have got old-age pensions into their heads as a kind of battle-cry, and they do not seem to think that the matter even needs discussion. Under the schemes in the countries I have mentioned, people are assisted to be industrious and thrifty ; and yet honorable senators opposite do not seem to be willing to take a warning from history, or any lesson from the examples afforded in other parts of the world. In a humble way I endeavour to do so, and I say that there are men and women now suffering in our midst who ought to be relieved at once, without any humbug or nonsense. We have been dangling old-age pensions before them long enough, and now old-age pensions ought to be provided for those I have mentioned ; but the youth of the community ought to be taught that they owe a duty to Australia. Let us teach our youth their duties, and not always be haranguing them about their rights. There is no right due to any man without a corresponding duty, and on every man there is the duty cast to maintain himself and be thrifty. Under the scheme of my friends opposite I am afraid we shall teach the youth of the country nothing about their duties, but simply talk to them about their rights. </para>

                                <para>- Is that a relevant interjection? What I say is that people ought to prove their right to a pension by contributing towards the cost, though, of course, a man who could not contribute would get a pension. Can it be said that men earning wages from £2 10s. to £4 a week cannot afford 6d. a week towards a pension fund ? I find that if a man commences at twenty-one years of age he need only contribute something under 9d. per week in order to provide sufficient to give him a pension. </para>

                                <para>- I am inclined to think that the last paragraph in  His  Excellency's speech is the most important, where we are told of an agreement to take over the Northern Territory being laid before us when next we meet. This is a very important matter, and there are one or two points on which I desire to say a word, it appears to me that the agreement is rather one-sided, and that the Premier of South Australia has made by far the best of the bargain. I notice that the railway is to be taken over at the cost of its construction, though I see nothing about the present state of the repair of the railway. If the Commonwealth is going to take over the whole of the debt of the Northern Territory, that surely ought to be done on terms which are fair to the Commonwealth. If we are to assume the whole of the liability, and take over the railway at cost price, I should like to know the state of the rails and the sleepers. Rails and sleepers have so many years of life, and are we to be asked to take over this railway at the cost of construction when that life has practically come to an end ? </para>

                                <para>- The railway may be in good order ; and all I say is that we ought not to adopt an agreement which provides that we are to take over the line at cost price, regardless of its state of repair. If it is in good order, so much the better; but I do not think that any railway is worth cost price unless it is in good order. Another point in the agreement, which is a very small one, makes it clear that the South Australian people have taken verv great care of themselves. We all know that the transcontinental railway will be of benefit to the whole Commonwealth, but it will be of enormous benefit to the State through which it passes. It will promote settlement in that State, and will benefit it in other ways. Yet we find that South Australia proposes to give us permission to take her timber, ballast, and stone if we pay for it as set forth in her Act. That appears to me to be most ungenerous. It is a very small thing, but still it is ungenerous. South Australia should bear in mind the enormous debt we are to incur, and the enormous advantages which will be secured to her by this expenditure by the Federal Parliament. Surely, therefore, on this point she could afford to be generous ; and unless she is generous the agreement will not be a fair one. The reason why I have spoken on this matter now is that it appears to me that the agreement is really t&gt; cover up the vexed question as to whether we are to have a transcontinental railway to the West or not. Now, I do not think that it is a proper and a fair thing that that matter should be slipped in and mixed up with another contract. That is not mv idea of statesmanship : and I hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will be able to make a clear statement on that point. I can quite understand that South Australia will give way. and allow the railway to be built. But I still contend most strenuously that it is not properly the task of the Commonwealth to build that railway. It is the business of the State concerned to build it, and the business of the Commonwealth to give a fair and generous subsidy in return for the advantages which the Commonwealth generally will derive from it. </para>

                                <para>- Well, I contend that my State has no right to be asked to contribute towards surveying other people's te:ritory. Let Western Australia survey her territory at her own expense, and then come to us and ask us to contribute a subsidy in proportion to the benefits received. I have never yet departed from my principles on that point, and consider that justice demands that the railway should be built by the States concerned. South Australia will undoubtedly derive an enormous amount of benefit from our taking over of the Northern Territory. </para>

In a large Federal matter of this kind, it cannot be helped that one State should particularly benefit. We all come out on top sometimes. But I say again - do not let us mix up this question of the Northern Territory with the question of the railway to Western Australia. The people of the West, will some day have the railway. Some day they ought to have it. But let them pay for it just as we have paid for our own trunk lines in other States. I think that I have now exhausted the subjects upon which I wished to speak ; but before sitting down, I should like to say that in my opinion it would be a saving of time if my honorable friend, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, would consider the advisableness of adjourning when Parliament has done its business, instead of proroguing. I do not see the object of bringing the Governor-General here again when we reassemble to do the business of the session. What is the use of wasting time in that way? It appears to me that the better course would be for Parliament to adjourn to a date to be fixed. Then we need not have a second formal opening of Parliament. Of course, if the Government has made another arrangement, it is not for me to dictate to them. The party to which I belong cannot control the Government. We are not their masters. I merely suggest a. course that would prevent a great loss of time.

                            <para>- . - I do not intend to address the Senate upon the matters referred to in the Governor-General's address, but rather to draw attention to what I consider to be some defects in the Electoral Act and in its administration during the recent election. It occurred to me, as one who took an interest in the elections in a rather remote part of Western Australia - the Swan District - that while the Electoral Department had made every provision for placing people upon the rolls by sending police constables to canvass amongst the workers in the camps and elsewhere, it had made no provision by which those people might be able to vote. That <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> to say, while the Department put the people on the rolls, it d'd not send policemen round to witness applications for the postal votes. I myself, as a justice of the peace, witnessed many postal votes. Now, that is a thing that I personally deprecate. I do not think that any man who is actively engaged in politics should witness such votes. It would be better if the Department supervised the whole of such work. We have to-day heard the usual stereotyped remarks from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> We have had his customary attack' upon the Labour Party. We have heard it many times before. I have listened to it over and over again during the last three years. I am getting quite used to it. The honorable senator's eulogy of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson,</inline> M.L.A., of Western Australia, is one of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline> will hardly be proud. Any man who has been a member of the Labour Party, or who has claimed to be a Socialist, or even a reasonably strong democrat, does not think much of a eulogy coming from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> of Tasmania; and I do not think that even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline> - a gentleman with whom I do not agree, and whose views on some matters I entirely repudiate - will care to receive his praise. Now, I have been wondering since my return to Melbourne, what is going to happen in regard to the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the present Ministry, and what attitude the Prime Minister and his colleagues intend to adopt to wards the right honorable member for Swan, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest? </para>

In the Senate we find that no less than eleven of the members elected at the last election are sitting in Opposition. Only two are sitting in support of the Government, and there are five labour men who, I assume, are, like myself, prepared to support a Government which will give them the <inline font-style="italic">best</inline> measures. Now, if <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest had been successful the figures would have been reversed. There would have been fourteen sitting in Opposition, and the Government would have been put out. I shall always feel, in ray support of the Government while <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest is a member of it, that I shall have to get something for my support all the time; because my presence here is always discounted by the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest is a member of the Ministry.

If the caucus rules us - and I say that it does not - and we rule him, then he is being ruled by the labour caucus also. But nothing of the kind happens. As every honorable senator knows - of course I know it pays them to preach the other way on the hustings - outside the planks of our platform we have absolutely a free hand. As every honorable senator who has sat in this Chamber knows, we as frequently vote against one another as not; but I notice that honorable senators opposite do not vote against one another whenever they want to defeat the Labour Party. We had a case to-day, although it was on an unimportant matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> knows very well that last year, when important questions came along that affected the policy of the Labour Party, the Ministry would go over and vote solidly with the Opposition against the Labour Party. </para>

But I should like to take this opportunity of saying a few words regarding the administration by the Government of the Electoral Department in the elections that have just taken pl ace. I wish the Minister of Home Affairs was here, because there are one or two questions to which I should like his attention. We could not say for the Government in the election that has just passed as we could previously that they had not had sufficient experience. Two previous elections had been held, at which the electoral officers had had the opportunity of finding out the weak portions o'f the Electoral Act. </para>

                                <para>- They presumably found them out, because they came before us with an amending Electoral Bill, which was drawn up by the officers in the Electoral Office, adopted by the Government, brought before the Houses, and passed into law. We were told that it was absolutely necessary to pass the Bill in order to have an effective working of the Electoral Act. The Government have had practically five years to organize their staff. They have had the experience of two elections, and they have had every opportunity and generous treatment by both Houses in amending the Electoral law. Yet I venture to say that the election which has just passed, so far as administration is concerned, was the most wretchedly conducted of all. It caused a larger proportion of voters to abstain from voting because of want of facilities, and it caused a larger number of informal votes than ever before. I see the Government have compiled a return, and I suppose they will parade the fact that they have been very economical over this election - that they have saved £10,000 as compared with the first election. The first election cost <inline font-style="italic">£56,331.</inline> That was in 1901. In 1903 the election cost £51,414. In 1906, with a larger number of voters, and with a referendum also to be taken, the total cost of the election throughout Australia was only £46,649. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. I say advisedly, as one keenly interested in the election from a personal point of view, that that result has been achieved at the cost of efficiency, by a cheese-paring and parsimonious policy which resulted in hundreds of electors throughout the Commonwealth, in every State from what I can hear, and in my own State from my own personal knowledge, being absolutely prevented from recording their votes. </para>

                                <para>- I will explain how they were unable to vote. Take the polling places in Perth as an example, and not a solitary example, because you can find  dozens of other examples in the State of Western Australia alone. First of all they did not put sufficient officers in the polling places to cope with the number oF electors who came to the poll. They had only one officer in the main booths to deal with the form " Q " vote - the absent voters. The result was that when after 5 o'clock large numbers of people came from business places an'd from factories and workshops to record their votes there was a glut. There were more voters there than could be dealt with, and at 7 o'clock, when the time for closing the polling places came, there were crowded booths. Hundreds of people came to the door, saw the state of things inside, and knew they would have to wait some hours to record their votes. Consequently they would not stop, and went away in disgust. That was true of the large polling-places in Western Australia, and personal conversation with honorable members from other States points to the fact that the same thing obtained there. </para>

                                <para>- In Bunbury, which is not a large town - it has a population of some 4,000 or 5,000 people, and is well known as the birthplace of the honorable gentleman about whom we heard so much from the last  speaker  - from 7 o'clock, when the polling place was closed, it was some two hours before the final votes were recorded, because there was such a crowd waiting in the polling place. I was informed that it was absolutely impossible to wedge any more persons into that polling place, and they had practically to elbow people out to close the door. That was due not to the local administration at all, but to the foolish parsimony of the then Minister of Home Affairs - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Littleton</inline> Groom. I know that repeated requests were made to that honorable gentleman from Western Australia for more generous treatment, and for more officers to be supplied. Representations were made to him to give better facilities, and in face of those representations he refused absolutely to give those facilities. I know that was the case in my own. State. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> pointed out that we go to great expense to give people the right to be upon the rolls, and yet after we have given them that right the policy of the Government, so far as the last election was concerned, was to put every obstacle in the way of their recording their votes when they were upon the rolls. During the last few months of last session, I received a number of requests from Western Australia for polling places in country districts, particularly in the Swan division. I am going to mention here a feature which is characteristic in America, but which I hope is not going to become characteristic of Australian politics. The Swan division is represented by the Federal Treasurer, and most of the requests that were made to me were for polling places in that division. I sent them on to the then Minister of Home Affairs in ample time for him to make the necessary inquiries and to grant the facilities if they were justified. In only one case was my request granted1 - in the division of Swan, which is represented by the Minister who presides over the Treasury. In the case of what is known as the timber concession some few miles from Collie, there are over 300 voters on the roll, and! yet a polling place was refused. These people were working on polling day, and to get to a polling place they would have to go bv rail some 7 miles over a bush railway - a timber line, where there is no regular service. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. When I reached Western Australia and found that these requests had been refused, I was simply deluged with letters from different parts of the State - I dare say other honorable members for Western Australia had made similar requests and met with a similar fate - from people in country districts asking that certain people in those districts should be appointed to test the applications for postal votes and to witness the signatures. I know that the suspicion would occur to some persons' minds thai  the people who were requested to act would be the people associated with  my  party, and that I was asked to do this in the interests of my party. That is a natural suspicion to any man who takes a leading part in party politics, but I can assure honorable senators that many of the requests which I sent to the Electoral Department were not at all of that character. I will take the case of a timber mill as an instance in point. I asked that the manager of the mill, who is also part owner, should be appointed as an officer to test the signatures and the requests for postal votes. That gentleman is by no means a sympathizer with the Labour Party. If he is a partizan at all, and I do not know that he is, his sympathies would naturally be on the other side, for the simple reason that recently there has been a severe industrial </para>

                        <para class="block">Conflict  between the mill-owners and millemployes, <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> as a part mill-owner and mill manager, his sympathies would naturally be rather with the other side than with us. I have no knowledge whatever of that man's political principles or ideas, but I know that he would have had the opportunity of testing and registering a large number of postal votes. The request for his appointment was refused, as were dozens of others. I know as a matter of fact that applications were made that police officers should be allowed to perform this duty in certain farming districts where it was absolutely impossible for the voters to come in to the poll. It was asked that a police officer should be allowed to ,go round each district to give out the forms, attest the guarantees, and collect the papers. In some cases that permission was granted, but in many cases it was only granted after a long correspondence between the Department of Home Affairs and the local authorities. In fact, every obstacle was placed in the way of electors exercising any form of voting at the recent elections in that State, especially in the Swan division. If it is proposed to carry out this policy, why should we waste money in getting people enrolled? Let us say to the people at once, "It is useless for you to get enrolled, because if you do we shall not give you an opportunity to vote." If it is only proposed to give facilities for voting in populous centres, then let us say, " In any place where you cannot muster over so  many  hundred votes, we shall  not  give  you  postal facilities." </para>

                                <para>-  I have pointed out that in populous centres polling places we're provided, but that they were inadequate. Then take the management of the form "Q." In a large polling place like the Boulder, in Kalgoorlie - it was. the same in Perth and Fremantle - only one officer was authorized to witness the signatures to the forms. When I went into one of these polling places to vote under the form " Q " I saw round an unfortunate officer a surging crowd, and it was getting well on towards evening. How he managed to perform his work at all in the circumstances I cannot understand, but I can imagine how it was that there was such a large number of informal votes. I can also believe that many hundreds of persons, whose time was limited, would not wait in order to record their votes. I understand that there has been a conference of the electoral officers for the States. I trust that the Minister of Home Affairs will endeavour to so arrange his office that at future elections we shall have not only economy but also efficiency. Economy at the price paid at the late election is false economy. We want, not to discourage, but to encourage, persons to go to vote. There is. a tendency amongst persons not to take that interest in these matters which they should, and nothing is more calculated to cause persons to lose interest in Federal politics, and not to trouble to record their votes, than the way in  which  they were treated at the last election. Furthermore, I can say confidently that as regards the management of elections the Commonwealth suffered very much by, comparison with Western Australia. Throughout that State - where I am sorry to say there has been an anti-Federal feeling crowing - that unfortunate comparison was made. The people said, " Under the State we are given facilities for voting, but under the Commonwealth we are denied facilities." In the suburb in. which I live - Subiaco - under the State management we 'have three polling places, but under Federal management only one, although the suburb extends for a distance of seven miles. Honorable senators can easily imagine the distance which some persons had to go in order to vote. I hope that the Minister of Home Affairs will take to heart the lesson of the general elections, and try to lay down such plans as will insure  in the future that not only shall we get people enrolled, but that when enrolled they will be enabled to vote. </para>

                            <para>- - I desire to congratulate the new Ministers upon holding their present- positions. I believe that the Senate is very pleased to see them where they are, provided that no honorable senators on this side can occupy the Treasury Bench. I think I express the regret of a great many in the Chamber when I say that we miss our old friend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Playford.</inline> He was a man whom we all personally liked, and I for one desire to express my regret that he is not here now. I hope, however, that he will be long spared in good health and enjoy much happiness. I was very much struck with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith's</inline> opening remarks. He said that the most important part of the Governor-General's speech is contained in the eighth paragraph, which begins with the words, - </para>

                        <para class="block">No doubt there is a certain amount of truth in that observation, but I take it that in a debate of this kind we are at liberty to discuss matters which mav have occurred during the recess., as well as the subjects mentioned in the speech. The last session was opened with a very long speech from the Governor-General, and this session is opened with a short speech. Perhaps it is all the better for being short, but still it deals with a good many subjects which call for comment from those who are not supporters of the Government. No one, it seems to me, can object to the Prime Minister going to the Imperial Conference; but as regards our representatives at the Navigation Conference, I cannot help thinking that the Government have paid a very left-hand compliment to this co-ordinate branch of the Legislature in not including amongst them at least one senator. I never doubted that at all events <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> would have been asked to join the deputation. I think it is singular that in a Parliament consisting of two co-ordinate branches, the Senate is not represented, and the other House is, or rather was before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> retired, represented by no fewer than four members. I hope that in future, whatever Government may be in power, the rights of the Senate will never be overlooked. The Prime Minister is, I presume, supposed to represent the views of Australia generally and of its </para>
                        <para class="block">Parliament. I hope it will be distinctly made known to the public of Great Britain that he really represents the views of the Government party, which consists of seventeen in one House, and either three or four in the other. Giving them credit for four in the Senate, the Government party comprises only twenty-one members out of in. Therefore I trust that the Prime Minister will be very careful not to commit Australia in a manner which the Parliament will not confirm. I for one should be very glad to inspect the report of the Royal Commission on Papua. 1 shall have very strong sympathy with whomsoever may be its Administrator. He will have a most difficult task to perform in dealing with a population comprising 300,000 or 400,000 black natives and 400 or 500 white persons. Whoever he may be I think that he will be handicapped by the small amount of money at his disposal to promote settlement. I understand from travellers that men cannot ride in the Territory, but have to walk in most places. That means clearing away the scrub or forests in order to open up communication with the interior. I think that the time is not far distant when we shall have to recognise Papua as a Territory of Australia and establish a system of thorough free-trade between the two places. The local revenue from Customs duties is approximately £20,000, and the grant from the Commonwealth is £20,000. How can an enormous, undeveloped Territory be prospected and opened up effectually with a revenue of only £40,000? We must recognise that we ought to treat Papua as an integral part of the Commonwealth. I learn from a telegram in the newspapers of this morning that an ex-senator is reported to have a chance of being appointed its Administrator. Whether he be appointed or not I believe that he will do his level best when he goes in any capacity to the Territory. He is a conscientious man, but whether he has all the qualifications for the position of Administrator I take tine liberty to doubt. I consider that the Administrator should be a man who has gained experience in a tropical country, such as the west coast of Africa, where he had to come in contact with a large number of black natives, and at the same time to control Europeans. That is not a knowledge which can be picked up in a day. It can only be acquired, I imagine, by years of residence in somewhat similar climate and under like circumstances. </para>
                        <para class="block">I credit the Government with every intention to promote immigration, and in this respect I cannot understand the delay which has taken place in appointing a High Commissioner. I do not think that we, as a Federation, will be properly represented in Great Britain until we have our own High Commissioner who can take a stand somewhat similar to that which Lord Strathcona takes in regard to Canada. </para>

                                <para>- I have not anything to say against Captain Collins, but I do not think that a mere Government official is exactly an equivalent for a High Commissioner. The latter should be a man who can act in a public capacity like Lord Strathcona has done for Canada. We cannot expect to have many nien like Lord Strathcona, because he is enormously wealthy, nor do I think that it is altogether desirable that our High Commissioners should be very wealthy. In the Governor-General's speech there is no allusion to the question of the Federal Capital. The State I have the honour, to represent looks upon the establishment of the Federal Capital as an integral part of the Constitution, and until it is established probably we shall be found sitting in opposition to any Government. My own impression is that the Labour Party, who hitherto have been very strongly in favour of Dalgety, would not object to Canberra as a compromise. It is more accessible than Dalgety. It is practically the same distance from, the sea-coast, and a port can be got either at Jervis Bay or Bateman's Bay. I am assured that those who visited Canberra were very favorably impressed. The leader of the Labour Party in the other House, I understand, strongly favours Canberra now as a compromise between Dalgety and Lyndhurst. </para>

                                <para>- He was a sensible man in that regard. I am verv surprised that the Government have not brought in a Bill to take over the quarantine department. Surely that is a matter of Federal importance, considering the enormous extent of our sea-board, about  8,000  miles. With regard to the representation of the Government it is true that we have two Ministers of the Crown here, but there is no compliance with our resolution. Last session, and I believe previously, we resolved that the Senate would not receive fair play until the Government was represented by two Ministers with portfolios so that a fair number of measures could be initiated here, and we should not then have Bill after Bill brought in during the last week, as we had last session, and senators put to the unpleasant necessity of kicking them out ignominiously. For that act we have been blamed by some good persons. The Australian correspondent of the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> seems to think that we behaved like a lot of children, because during the last week or two of that session we did not pass measures which for months previously had been lying upon the table. Bill after Bill, introduced at a comparatively early part of the session, was left unnoticed until the last few weeks. I have great hopes that, at all events, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who is cognisant of the facts, will show a different state of affairs even during this short session, and also in the next and longer session. As to the Tariff Commission, I, of course, admit that there is a good deal to be said from the point of view of the Government, for postponing the consideration by Parliament of its reports. I may say, however, that when I came to Melbourne I was in hopes that the Government would deal with at least a portion of the reports of the Tariff Commission, and not ask honorable senators, some of them, to travel 2,000 or  3,000  miles, kick their heels for a few days in Melbourne, and then return to their homes. I can well imagine that some of my friends from the North of Queensland will feel that they have been brought almost on a fool's errand at the present time, when they are asked to return to their parliamentary duties a few months hence, so as to allow three or four gentlemen in the meantime to take what is something like a pleasure trip to the old country. In regard to the representatives sent home, I am in hopes that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, as I said to him yesterday, will derive a good deal of information. That gentleman seemed to think when I saw him that there was very little to be learned by going to Great Britain - in fact his opinion seemed to be that Australia could teach Great Britain not a few things. I suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne is going to be a sort of travelling encyclopedia and give information to all and sundry. Prior to his departure, I took the liberty, in a chaffing way, of expressing the hope that  he would return to Australia a confirmed free-trader, after observing the advantages of the great free-trade policy in the mother country. In regard to the Northern Territory, the Government deserve great credit for the steps which have been taken. I have for years advocated in this Chamber that there should, if possible, be Federal control of this enormous territory. South Australia, in my opinion, deserves very great credit for having for so many years carried on the administration of that part of Australia at an annual loss; and I shall be one to endeavour to see that that State gets full justice when the terms of settlement are under consideration. It is scarcely fair to refer to Norfolk Island matters in this short session, but I may assure the Government that the Senate will be with them if it can be arranged to bring the Island under Federal administration. At present, the affairs of the island are controlled bv New South Wales; and, therefore, in my opinion, we ought to lose no time in adding the Possession to Federal  territory.  I am rather surprised that, with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest in the Government, the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill  has not been re-introduced. I cannot understand how it is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> representing as he does Western Australia, made no allusion to this railway project in his speech, or why he passed without adverse comment the omission of any  reference to it in the GovernorGeneral's speech. I have a distinct recollection of an eloquent address from that honorable senator in the small hours of the morning a few years ago; and I cannot understand how it is that he has not on the present occasion drawn attention to the fact that this - shall I call it a national work? - is not in the programme of the Government. There is no doubt that had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> been present last session, that Bill would have been carried ; and, therefore, it is not fair only to accuse the representatives of other States of un-Federal feeling in not supporting the Bill. </para>

I hope we are not going to have any more Royal Commissions for some time to come, because the expenditure in this direction during the last few, years has been outrageous.

We have heard it stated to-day that the great question at the recent election was fiscalism. That may have been so in the comparatively small State of Victoria, but it certainly was not in the giant States of New South Wales and Queensland. In these latter States the question, was Socialism <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> anti-Socialism; and I believe that in the present Senate of thirty-six members, not excepting the Vice-President of the Executive Council, there are nineteen anti- Socialists. But when the fiscal question is out of the way we shall, I trust, see a change. At one time we used to hear a great deal from our labour friends about a graduated land tax, though we do not hear anything about that question now. Such a proposal would never pass in this Chamber; we are not going to rob people. Land taxation at the present time is purely a State matter, and we have no right to unnecessarily infringe on States rights. </para>

                                <para>- There is such a thing as the spirit of the Constitution, as well as the letter - the .letter killeth, but the spirit maketh alive. The repatriation of the kanakas is going on somewhat better than I thought it would. It is a melancholy fact, however, judging from' the newspapers which I read, that kanaka women who do not go back to their own island, or who were born in Australia, are looked upon as pariahs in the New Hebrides, and are treated as the offscourings of their own society. I hope, therefore, that the Act will continue to be administered in a broad, liberal spirit, so that  no native of Queensland, because he or she happens to be the child of kanakas, may be sent to the islands. I leave it to mv Queensland friends, who are much better acquainted with the subject than I am, to enlarge on this aspect of the question. I have been waiting patiently to hear some representatives of the northern State, amongst whom, I believe, there are two, if not three, eloquent nien ; and I may say that we shall be delighted to hear some of the new members give us a specimen of their quality. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> who is a most eloquent man himself, is, I am sure, glad to think that though some of those new senators may not be able to see eye to eye with him, they are men for whom he has a high regard as fellow senators. As to old-age pensions, I say now, as I said before, that to bring the question within practical politics, the States themselves ought to appoint a joint commission to administer old-age pensions on a proper <inline font-style="italic">-per capita</inline> basis. In my opinion, it is unfair that a man, who may not have dwelt twenty-five years continuously in any one State, and yet may have been forty years in Australia, is not able under present circumstances to obtain a pension. Under such a joint commission as I have suggested, any person who had reached the required age, and who had resided for so many years in Australia would be entitled to participate. I am with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> and others in regretting that we did not pass the Bill for the amendment of the Constitution last year to allow the Commonwealth to take over all the debts of the States after approval by referendum. I voted for that measure, and it has been insinuated that I am not a good party man because I do not always vote against the Government. When I! first came to this Chamber, I said that I would vote for all measures on their merits by whomsoever introduced ; and I have acted on that principle from start to finish. If I think a Bill to be a good Bill, I never allow mere party considerations to prevent my supporting it. As I have said before, I say again, that when we come to have a consolidation of the debts, I believe we shall save £700,000 or £800,000 a year, which would give something towards providing Federal old-age pensions. But without some such consolidation, I see no chance of a saving excepting by a large increase of population. If we could make the population 6,000,000 instead of 4,000,000, we -should, have a much larger income, and the proportion of expenses of government would not be so great as in a smaller population. As to the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, I have all through been an advocate of the necessity for some years of maintaining the bookkeeping system. When we first entered into Federation, the revenue of Western Australia was £7 per head, while that of Queensland was £4 or £5, though in New South Wales it was not quite so much. Had we had the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> division of income that some of our Tasmanian friends were so anxious to have, it would have meant that a State with a return of 25s. or 30s. per head would go shares with a State contributing £7 per head. That seems to me improper and unfair; and, whether I be regarded as enlightened or unenlightened, I maintain that when we come to divide the income of the whole country there ought to be some proportion between the receipts and expenditure of the States. Let us do what is fair between man and man.  His  Excellency's speech refers to the development of the latent resources of the Commonwealth, and, in my opinion, the best means of development is a fine stream of European immigrants who, if they can bring a little capital, will be so much the more welcome. There is also a reference to promoting the trade relations of the Empire; and this reminds me of the absurd so-called preference measure of last session, which showed that we were not prepared to give anything out of our own pockets. I am quite aware that the fiscal issue is being sunk, and, therefore, I shall not trouble) honorable senators with my views in that connexion. I may say, however, that I have not ceased to be a freetrader, and I shall probably be a freetrader when I go underground. We have heard a great deal about defence, and in this connexion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> spoke eloquently. I am one of those benighted individuals who would like to see cadets efficiently drilled; but whatever we do we must not in any way show that we distrust the dear old mother country. The Royal Navy is our first line of defence, and will be so for many a long day. It does not follow, however, that we should not encourage the building of a few local vessels, such as torpedo boats, &amp;c. ; but it is very expensive to construct men-of-war, which in five or six years, not infrequently, become obsolete. If we begin to make a navy we must count the cost, and, with a population so small as ours, it must be many years before we can afford to provide battleships. </para>

                            <para>. - I rise with a great deal of diffidence to speak on the questions placed before us for consideration in the Governor-General's speech. I feel - and I think the feeling is more or less common throughout the Chamber - pretty much like a patient when he knows that chloroform is about to be administered. The Chamber and the Ministry seem to be acquiescent in this process of chloroforming; and it is not for me to dictate as to what course ought to be pursued. All I can do at this juncture is to say that I Leg to protest; and I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> expressions of disappointment. Some information might have been sent to us concerning the probable course of events so that we might have been able to attend to other business, rather than come down to be present at what is merely a chloroforming of Parliament. I do not intend to criticise in detail various portions of the speeches which have been made. It would perhaps be bacl policy to anticipate the substance of some speeches which, when we are called together again, will probably have to be made. But from the opening remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> I was very much struck with the necessity of a contribution to the debate from the point of view of other States than his. It also occurred to me in following his remarks closely that sometimes the speeches of Victorian senators, and members of the House of Representatives also, rather indicate that they think that their whole vision should be fixed upon the Yarra, and that it ought not to extend beyond the bounds of the River Murray. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> said that Australia had pronounced a distinct verdict on a particular issue ; and if I understood him aright, he indicated that that issue was protection, in the sense that it was entirely the duty of this Parliament to proceed at once to carry out the verdict of Australia in the direction of increasing protective duties. I wondered at the time, and beg to express my wonder now, whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> had heard of the contest which took place in the State of Queensland. As far as I know anything with regard to that contest - and I was an active participator in it and helped to fight out the issues fairly and clearly - I can say that if there was any place in Australia where the fiscal issue was sunk it was Queensland. </para>

                                <para>- I may be misstating - perhaps through misunderstanding - the tendency of the honorable senator's remarks. If so, I hope that he will excuse me. I wish to state what I took to be the general effect of what he said regarding the issues at the last election in Australia. May I be permitted to say also that I regard the Constitution of Australia as establishing in a sense a body like a jury composed of six persons; and one of those is the State of Queensland. I hope the Senate will pardon me if I say with respect to Queensland that, in view of its possibilities, it is likely to be in some respects one of the greatest States of Australia. When that State spoke pretty distinctly on a clear and distinct issue, I think that it was the duty of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> when referring to the verdict of Australia, to be accurate either in his memory or his knowledge of what the particular issues settled in one important State were. If the verdict of Australia is that this Parliament shall apply itself to support, to develop, and to give full assistance to the industries of Australia, why is it that the present  Government  has hung up the Tariff question? Why does the Government keep it back? Whether we cannot debate that question until we have all the reports of the Tariff Commission before us is one matter; whether we cannot debate it when we have some of the reports before us is another. But if it is an all-important question, and if the verdict of Australia at the last election was that this Parliament should immediately proceed to take whatever measures it thought advisable for the further protection of industries which, if my memory serves me correctly, the Prime Minister described some time ago as being in imminent danger of strangulation, why is it that at this juncture we have not received any information with reference to what is to be proposed in regard to the Tariff. It also occurred to me, while the remarks to which I have referred were being made from the other side of the chamber, that I have seen the strong expression used that the Prime Minister and the present Government depend upon, live, move, and have their being in submission to, the will of what is called the " Labour Party." I wish to use the terra that the members of that party themselves are fond of using; and that reminds me that in Queensland we did not use the term "Labour Party" at all. We used from the platform another term - a term which, when it is used, it is very hard to tell whether the persons to whom it applies like it or not. We did not call them the Labour Party; we called them the Socialist Party. </para>

                                <para>- I am glad to get a " hear, hear," from the other side, because it helps definitely to clear the issue. When sometimes we were taunted during our campaign with what we meant by Socialism, I, at an,v rate, made the position very clear by quoting the declaration of the leader of the Labour Party as to what was his general and particular objective. There can be no mistake about it now, and I shall continue to use the term, if I may be permitted to do so in this Chamber, by calling the gentlemen to whom I refer members of the Socialist Party. I said in Queensland, during the campaign, that the Labour Party had gone - that it had disappeared, that it had either been nobbled by the Socialists, or that it had taken the Socialists to its bosom. This leads to what I should like to accentuate, and it is this: When the leader of the Socialist Party - he called himself a Socialist - came to Queensland during the campaign - and he did so twice - he said that he was a Socialist ; whereupon many of his followers proclaimed themselves straight-out Socialists, and declared that they were delighted to be found upon the platform doing what they could to propound socialistic doctrines. </para>

                                <para>- I dare say, but I am not concerned now with how they toned their doctrines down. We took particular care in Queensland to narrow the campaign to a particular issue. When the leader of the Socialist Party began his campaign - again, if mv memory serves me correctly ; I have not the manifesto here - it was distinctly laid down, I think, that the fiscal issue could never be regarded as settled until it was submitted by a. referendum to the verdict of the electors of Australia. More than that, I think that he also, in his manifesto, said that he would extend the question of the Tariff in the referendum to the consideration also of hours of labour and conditions regarding the protection of labour. He made it quite clear that, as far as he could, he would first take the Tariff question and deal with it by a referendum of the electors of Australia, and that, in that referendum, he would call upon the electors of Australia to decide whether they would not also limit the hours and conditions of labour, and deal with the question of pay. In the clearest manner possible, as far as I can understand it, he laid it down that the fiscal issue had not been considered by the people of Australia - that it had not been properly put before them. I could not help thinking of that while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> was speaking about the duty of extending protective duties, and I could not understand why it was that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> forgot that point. </para>

                                <para>- Then, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> all that I can say is that I am sorry that I misunderstood the position that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> took up with regard to the verdict of Australia. It seems to me that the remarks that I have made have a direct or an indirect bearing upon the verdict of the people, and, for what they are worth, I beg to present them to the Senate, and especially to the consideration of our Socialist friends opposite. A very important question has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and the conditions in Western Australia being very similar to those in Queensland, I was delighted to hear his criticisms with regard to the conduct of the last election and the administration of the electoral machinery. I am sorry that the Attorney-General, who is a brilliant Queenslander, and a man who ought to know what is required in Queensland, should have been the responsible Minister in this case. I agree with every word that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said. He has not in the slightest degree exaggerated. So far from his having, overdrawn the picture with regard to the difficulty of electors getting on the rolls and recording their votes, I can indorse everything he said. I hope that, during the recess, measures will be taken by the Government to consider a remedy for that kind of thing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> spoke strongly, but no one has suggested a remedy. I believe that a conference of electoral officers, who are intrusted with the administration of affairs, has been called. I think it would be well if, during the recess, the Government would appoint a Committee - not a Royal Commission  in  the ordinary sense - composed of members of both Houses of the Legislature, to go thoroughly into the question, and to discover how the mistakes arose, with the view of bringing down information to Parliament, in the light of which the difficulties referred to might be avoided in the future. I hope that, in the course of the criticisms which may be offered regarding the conduct of the election, the party represented by honorable senators opposite will cease from continued imputations - at least outside this chamber - that we, whether we are candidates outside, or speaking from our seats here, do not desire to get the voice of every adult - male and female - in our respective States, in order to decide who shall be their representatives. I was very pleased to hear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> remarks that he was doing his best to assist the electors  in  Western Austraia, and that he was calling for assistance from a gentleman whom he might reasonably expect to be his opponent. The honorable senator mentioned a fiasco that took place at some place in the Swan electorate, and from his arguments one might be tempted to the conclusion that he insinuated that a prominent member of the Ministry, who is receiving the heartiest abuse of those who support him, had designedly arranged what took place. That may or may not be true, but to me, as a new member - I hope I am not hypersensitive - it does not seem quite in accordance with the fitness of things that persons who support a Minister should abuse him. It mav be that closer contact with parliamentary tactics and strategy will dull one's sense of the fitness of things. I do not know that I have ever enjoyed a political attack more than I did that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> on a Minister whom his party help to keep in office. It was quite a pleasant break in the somewhat dull monotony of this debate. </para>

                                <para>- I dare say there are. I leave honorable senators to determine whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> means that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> or the Minister  is  the spot on the sun. Even if one searched through one's vocabulary for terms of abuse - perhaps that is rather a harsh word, and I will say terms of objection or invective - to surpass those directed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> towards <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, it would be very hard to find them. I am delighted to learn that even the Socialist Party on the other side of this Chamber have a profound distrust of and dislike for that Minister, who could not hold office one hour if they chose to give effect to their feelings towards him. I hope I may be pardoned for saying so, but I am inclined to think that the same feeling exists in that quarter towards other Ministers, only possibly it may not be wise or prudent to extend the attack any further. It is somewhat difficult, especially for a new member, to find out the real reasons of some parliamentary movements, but it seems to me that part of the objective behind this dose of chloroform which we are now to take, is this : Just as in certain chemical operations you must take great care to prevent two or more molecules from coming together for fear of an explosion, so it has been deemed advisable to arrange for this adjournment and the retirement of one or more Ministers to a distance of over IO,000 miles, where they may engage in the deliberations of some very important conferences, because their presence here in politics might otherwise have an effect similar to that which would take place in the instance I have mentioned in chemistry. I wish to revert to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith'</inline> s remarks regarding a paragraph in the Governor-General's speech which, whether intentionally or otherwise, although it must have been absolutely unintentional, is a sort of belittlement of the position of the States. With all respect, I beg to draw the attention of the Prime Minister, or whatever Ministers were responsible for drawing up the document, to the following paragraph in  His  Excellency's speech: - </para>

I believe it is thoroughly understood by the Ministry, as well as it is by the State Premiers, that under the terms of the Constitution the States are sovereign powers within the ambit of their jurisdiction. Within that ambit they are  as sovereign and independent powers as the <inline font-style="italic">Government</inline> represented by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth is within the ambit of the Federal Constitution. It is therefore not strictly correct to state that a Conference of Prime Ministers of the self-governing portions of the Empire has been called together, because the Prime Ministers of the respective States have not been called to the Conference. There may be  ample  reasons why they were not called. </para>

                                <para>- Perhaps the honorable senator's retort is to some extent well called for, because I may be uttering hyper-criticism of what I think is a flaw in the text. I draw attention to the matter, however, because it is notorious throughout the whole of Australia that considerable irritation, or even a worse feeling, exists between the Premiers of the States and the Commonwealth Government. As a senator, I am bound within the terms of the Constitution to represent to a large extent the feeling which exists as to the jurisdiction of the States. I am tempted to do so now because on one occasion a clear usurpation of the powers of the States was made by the Commonwealth, and the High Court had to put its hand down on the Commonwealth Government. I may be pardoned for pointing this out as an individual case for what it may be worth. It is quite probable that much of the legislation which has been passed, and some which is contemplated, will be found to be as distinct a violation of the Constitution as that case. If the Federal Government is to achieve all the good which we hoped it would achieve, which it was intended to achieve, and which with wise and cautious legislation it can achieve, that end can only be attained by soliciting in every fair, reasonable, and constitutional manner, the heartiest co-operation of the State Administrations - of the State Premiers themselves - and by seeking to secure to the fullest extent the confidence, respect, and esteem of the State electors. I am somewhat at a loss to understand why the Imperial Government did not recognise the fact that over a very wide area and in a very useful sphere of legislation the States are sovereign. If the Imperial Government did not choose to recognise that fact, I wonder how it was that they did not see that under the terms of the Federal Constitution the States have full power and jurisdiction over their own lands, and that that is the central point of what I consider, with all respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> the important issue for Australia - the bringing in to this vast continent of numbers of European and other white people, in order to carry out fully and practically that policy which we on this side of the Chamber have deeply at heart. That is a policy which in the strongest and most unmistakable terms I expressed to the electors throughout the whole State of Queensland - a policy to make this continent white from end to end, and to make a White Australia not merely a text upon the lips but a conviction deep down in the heart. I find when I come to criticise the deliverances of the socialistic members on the other side of this Chamber, that for six years during which the Federation has lasted they ' have been howling out for a White Australia. From the time I put my foot forward to seek a responsible position in public life, I asserted as strongly as ever I could that the supreme need of Australia is a vigorous system of copious white immigration, preferably from our own lands, or from judiciously selected European countries. I ask that party which' has carried the banner of a White Australia for the last six or seven years, " What have they done to make Australia white? " We speak about the security and the defence of this outlying portion of the Empire, but one has to look but a short while at the map, one's knowledge of geography need be but very limited, and one's sense of historical imagination has to be comparatively elementary for one to realize the great danger looming on the horizon - a danger which Australia will have to face sooner or later and fight out for itself. I ask those Socialists who have been living on the gospel of a White Australia, who have been carrying that banner for the last seven years, to consider what they are going to do, and to tell this Chamber what they have done in order to make Australia white. </para>

                                <para>- The question of a White Australia, and the question of immigration are, I think, pf sufficient importance to the Imperial authorities to make them see the necessity for the attendance of the State Premiers or some responsible representatives of the States at the Imperial Conference, for the purpose, at any rate. of consultation or deliberation. I think it will be impossible for even the Prime Minister of Australia or his associates or for the two of them together, to give sufficiently accurate and definite information, with a view to the action which we on this side of the Chamber would like to see taken on the future policy towards making a White Australia. The question of establishing a white population here is of equal importance to the Imperial' Government as it is to us. The burden of Empire on the Old Country is very great. It is our duty, as well as perhaps our advantage, to relieve that pressure as far as our resources will permit us. To my mind, the best and most effective way in which it can be done is for the Imperial Government, the States Governments, and the Commonwealth Government to unite, and devote their energy to promoting a stream of British immigration to this land. </para>

There is, I believe, correspondence tabled which indicates to some extent the initial attitude of the Prime Minister on this important question. In my addresses from the platform, I pointed out to the electors generally the vital necessity of bringing into that vast State the people of our own kith and kin, and if those are not sufficient for the purpose we might judiciously select hardy, industrious, and sober citizens of some European nationalities. I believe the correspondence reveals the fact that the Prime Minister to some extent is in accord with us. I hope that in the Imperial Conference he will to the utmost of his ability give effect to that policy or support its continuation. It is quite true, I think, that the Socialists in the Chamber are particularly uneasy with regard to the question. I am speaking entirely on  my  own responsibility as a senator for Queensland. I believe it is my duty to reproduce the substance of the speeches which I addressed to the electors, and try to give practical effect here to the policy which I put forth on the platform in, I think, clear and unmistakable terms. I desire to know what attitude the Socialists are going to take. Not only are we expected to take our chloroform as soon as it is administered to us, but it would seem that there is. almost a  conspiracy  of silence - or, at any rate, a great reluctance on the part of some honorable senators to touch these important questions. </para>

                                <para>-I feel quite confident that after the political doctors are done with us we shall return to the Chamber with renewed vigour and strength. What attitude, I repeat, are the Socialist members of the Senate going to take up with regard to the introduction of white immigrants? Do they intend to refuse to support the Prime Minister,  Or  to block him in any efforts which he may make to bring in European population, until the Ministry can establish a negative? Are they going to say that no white immigrants are to come to Australia until the Ministry are able to establish here with mathematical accuracy the fact that there is not one white man unemployed? It is very important to know what direct interpretation the Socialists intend to give to that provision in the Immigration Restriction Act. I hope that before the chloroform is administered to the rest of us, they will give a clear indication of their attitude on that point. </para>

                                <para>- I am not one of those who always keep their eyes and their minds on the past. " Let the dead past bury its dead " is a useful maxim in politics as well as in other things. Notwithstanding the interjection made from the other* side, I feel quite confident that I shall be able to justify all my actions. I dare say that an attack will be made upon me, and I think that it will not find me unprepared. I would remind my opponents that it will be absolutely necessary for them to be scrupulously careful in the presentation of their facts. In his speech, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> dwelt upon a very important question. There is no doubt that the defence of Australia is a vital question, especially in a certain possible and imminent conjunction of affairs in the East, and perhaps in European centres. I do not quite agree with him that the sources of danger are where he indicated; but I cordially indorse most of his remarks. I think it is time that the people of Australia gave an indication of practical sympathy with this great movement. But the crux of the question is where is the money to come from? I hope that the Minister of Defence will submit a scheme for the improvement of our defences which will so commend itself that the people will willingly bear the sacrifice which may be required of them. I ask Ministers to carefully consider the importance of beginning at a comparatively early age a system of military instruction and discipline' with the boys in the primary and secondary schools. Compulsory service on the part of male adults is a very important and might become a very vexed question. But I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> as to the importance of beginning the instruction of cadets at a very early age. I believe that it would be wise on the part of Parliament to make liberal provision for the extension and perfection of the system. I do not speak from the stand-point of militarism. It is not militarism to teach the citizens that they ought to be in a position to defend their State against aggression. Ours should be a policy of defence, not defiance. I do not suppose that there is any party in this Parliament which would ever adopt an aggressive attitude. It is not militarism, I repeat, to ask the citizens to begin to prepare for their own defence. A certain amount of military training is of incalculable advantage to the young, physically and mentally, from the disciplinarian point of view. It can do no harm, and certainly it will do a great deal of good, to train the lads in the primary and secondary schools. There is a historical story told of the system of education in vogue with the Medes and Persians. One of their lawgivers said, " Our whole system of education is directed towards teaching the youth to ride well, to shoot well, and to tell the truth well and all the time." That is not a bad system of education. I hope that the Education Departments of the States will cordially co-operate with the Commonwealth  in  that regard. The question of preferential trade, I take it, is bound to come up at the Imperial Conference. I do not intend to deal with that very vexed question, but, using my privilege as  an  Hibernian, I beg to ask the high tariffists what they have to offer to the mother country. I hope I am not exceeding the indulgence of the Chamber when I say I feel that  on  this important question of preference the Prime Minister is not going Home as the representative of the Commonwealth, but as a delegation from the State of  Victoria.  In any case, it ought to be the duty of the Ministry and of honorable senators on the other side to tell us what it is they have to offer to the mother country in a preferential policy, and to make clear how that policy is going to apply to the mother country and to Australia. Ever since this question has been spoken of in the Commonwealth we have had nothing but mystification and confusion. I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> when he points  out that it is almost a hypocritical grace we are presenting, to talk of building a prohibitory Tariff against the world as well as against the mother country, then to speak of leaving a <inline font-style="italic">little</inline> gap here and there, and call it preferential trade. That is not what I believe Australia desires, nor what the authorities in the mother country would entertain for a moment. I omit any reference to the States debts or the taking over of the Northern Territory. The latter question will present some grave constitutional questions; which will require the closest and keenest scrutiny on the part of both Chambers. We have been talking about the States debts for a number of years, and I hope that we shall go on talking about them for some years to come. I confess, though it may Le my defective intelligence, that I have yet seen no scheme, nor read of any scheme, which I think offers a satisfactory solution of the difficulties of the States themselves, and of the difficulties of the Commonwealth Parliament, in taking over the debts. It may be that we shall find a solution, but this is a question which, whether it is attacked either in the old country from the point of view of the bondholders, or here from our point of view as a Commonwealth taking over the liabilities of the States, will require the highest financial intelligence, not only of the Chambers themselves, but of Australia, to settle it satisfactorily. I now congratulate you, sir, on your elevation to your present position. Though, of course, it is my duty - because that is what I take it the electors sent me here for - to oppose the Prime Minister politically with all the force and effect I can, I now, notwithstanding those differences of political opinion, in view of the fact that he is determined to take the voyage to England, and do the best he can for Australia, from every point of view that may be presented, wish him, <inline font-style="italic">bon voyage,</inline> and hope that he will return to us with perhaps a wider vision and with something, if I may be permitted to  say  so, more of steel, in his political fibre, which will be required when he comes to consider the questions which will be presented to him at the Imperial Conference. I thank honorable senators for the courtesy and kindness with which they have listened to me, and I hope I have not detained them too long. </para>

                            <para>.- I- had not intended to address the Chamber tonight,, imagining that the debate would not close until next week. I thought that, at any rate, we were entitled to some reply from the Government to the various inquiries that have been made, if not to the various criticisms that have been bestowed on the Government and on the Address. But, of course, it is sometimes well and prudent for a Government, when they know that they can carry their point, to say as little as possible. There is really not much to be said about this attenuated production that is given to us in the shape of a speech. It gives us no policy ; it gives us no light or leading on any of the great questions of the day. I suppose, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> told us yesterday, it would never have seen the light had it not been', that the Constitution required that Parliament should meet ; and, therefore, a speech of some kind or other had to be presented. Of course, we could not expect very much of a speech from the Government in its present position, which is certainly a very peculiar one in politics. There is no doubt, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> said, that the position of the Government is a tenable and constitutional one. There is no getting away from the fact that the Government are constitutionally in office ; they have set a programme before the country, and I mav say that, so far as I can see, a majority has been returned to support that programme, although the Government have not got ai great many supporters. Therefore I say that the position of the Government is tenable, and also constitutional ; but I do not know that it is a position that a high-minded politician would care to occupy. </para>

                                <para>- Not even if it is constitutional. The Government are there until they are put out : but, at the same time, my recollection cf the politics of some years ago - of Service, Gillies and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes - leads me to the opinion that those I have mentioned would not have retained office under such circumstances. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think so. It seems to rae somewhat  unkind  and ungracious of the members of the Labour Party, who are supporting the Government, to cavil and gird at the Government as they are doing. I think the members of that party might be content to serve the Government quietly and faithfully, and when they quarrel, to quarrel outright. I was somewhat disappointed by the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft,</inline> when he referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. That right honorable gentleman has done a great deal for Australia, and I do not think that the epithets bestowed upon him this afternoon are at all deserved or worthy of the Chamber, or of the honorable senator who uttered them. We have had an indication from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft,</inline> and I think one other honorable senator, of the attitude) of the? Labour Party, namely, that it is " out for all it can make." </para>

                                <para>- It will be time enough for honorable senators to say that the Labour Party represents the biggest section of the Commonwealth when such is the fact. We have yet to see that day, and perhaps some of the prophets may not be here to see it, if present auguries can be relied on. I have no particular ill-will against the Labour Party, because with many of their ideals I find myself in accord; though with their methods and practice I entirely disagree. When I can help the Labour Party I intend to do so; but, when necessary, I shall oppose them straightforwardly as I did at the election. If it be said that the Labour Party represents the majority of the voters, I may, perhaps, with humility, point to the enormous number of votes I myself received as a strong anti-Socialist candidate,, in order to show that that party does not represent the majority of voters in Victoria. </para>

                                <para>- Certainly not. This Chamber ought to register the will of the country, and carry it out as far as possible. I may be permitted to call the attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to what was, I think, a little slip he made yesterday. When proposing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> as  President,  the Vice-President of the Executive Council said that a meeting had been held, at which the determination to elect the present  President  had been come to. </para>

What the Vice-President of the Executive Council said was that there had been a meeting, and it was for honorable senators to bow to the will of the .Senate. Not only myself, but other honorable senators, felt that the public would understand that a meeting had been held outside the Chamber, and a determination arrived at. There was no meeting of senators outside the Chamber beyond that of the Labour Party, and I do not wish the public to understand that that being the only meeting, this Chamber was bound to come into accord with its decision. </para>

In the speech there is an omission of something which is usually put in at the beginning, though sometimes at the end, and sometimes at both, acknowledging that Divine Providence has something to do with the prosperity. I do not know whether there was any reason for the omission. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr. Bent</inline>halved the credit with Providence. We are told that we are called together to comply with the provision of the Constitution, and to enable the Government to meet Parliament ; and that is a mere stereotyped announcement which calls for no comment. The third paragraph, however, which refers to the Imperial Conference to be held in London in April, is of great importance. This is the third Imperial Conference of Prime Ministers and other representatives of the dependencies of the Empire that has been held, and it is an occasion of supreme importance both in the history of Australia and of the Empire itself. The previous Conference was held under the glamour of the King's Coronation, and also to some extent under the glamour of the South African war. Consequently our representatives, were received with very great cordiality in the old land. They also had the advantage of having in office at that time a Government that was extremely sympathetic towards the dependencies of the Empire. They had at the head of the Colonial Office a gentleman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> who had elevated the position of Colonial Secretary much higher than it had ever been before, and who received them with marked cordiality. I suppose that the bonds of friendship and kinship were on that occasion drawn closer than they had ever been before. I fear - I may perhaps be pessimistic - that very, few good results will follow from the Conference to be held in London at an early date. The Ministry in office at the present time, as is well known, is not in such close sympathy - and touch with the dependencies of the Empire as the previous Ministry was. </para>

                                <para>- Some of the members of the present Ministry; and the fact that in the speech from the Throne all reference to the coming Conference was entirely omitted, shows that the Government is not in sympathy with it. Pointed attention was called to the omission in the House of Commons by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balfour,</inline> who took the Government to task for not recognising the importance of the occasion and of the dependencies that will be represented at the Conference. Then, I do not know that the delegation that is going to England is as strong as it might be. Certainly I take no exception to the Prime Minister going. If there were a vote throughout the country he would receive the almost unanimous support of the people. But I think that he ought to have been backed up by a strong man in whom the people have full confidence. I wish to say no word against the present Minister of Customs, but no one will say that he can be looked upon as a true representative of Australia. There are other men who might have gone, and I have one in my mind who I think would have filled the bill. That is the present  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder. He would have gone with the full approval of Australia, and would have commanded the confidence of all classes,. I fear that we shall suffer in the present delegation from the fact that the Prime Minister will not be supported as he ought to have been. He is undertaking a herculean task. He is going there to meet the very bes,t men in the Empire. He has grave problems to deal with - the problem of preferential trade, the problem of immigration, the problem of defence, and the problem of the future of the Empire, in which the dependencies are concerned. In connexion with all those grave problems he will receive no such efficient help as he ought to have had under present circumstances. We know from the public remarks, made by members of the present Government in the old country - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith, Sir Edward</inline> Grey, the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> CampbellBannerman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, and others - that they are not in sympathy with any reciprocity between the dependencies and the old land, and I do not think that they will do very much to forward the motion of the Prime Ministers in that respect. The matters that will be discussed at the Conference will, of course, be very important. During the last few years the position of the great dependencies of the Empire has changed very much. There has been a growth of Imperial unity. The development of Canada and her grant of Imperial preference, the sending of troops to South Africa, the Imperial Conferences of 1897 and 1903, the establishment of this great Commonwealth, and the subsequent development of affairs in South Africa, have all tended to force the question of the relations of the great dependencies to the Empire more prominently before the public than it has ever been before. We are now approaching a crucial point when great organic changes appear to be about to take place in the relations between the Empire and the dependencies. Those dependencies are expanding and developing into nationhood. They are rapidly ceasing to be merely colonies, and are becoming nations. Their relationship with the motherland will have to be reconsidered. The question of a united Empire will require to be solved upon lines which will make the Empire homogeneous, self-contained, and strong. We want to make the unity as close as possible, and as strong as possible at all points, and to that end the dependencies will, I think, come to be recognised more and more as sister States. During the past few years there has been a growth of national consciousness which I found when travelling through Canada  a  year or two ago was more developed there than is the case in this country. But it is growing very rapidly here also, as any one who takes note of matters of Imperial concern can see very easily. We must develop in one of two ways; either by Imperial unity or Imperial separation. I do not think that any country can be more loyal than Australia is. We may have here and there an expression of opinion to the contrary, but you have only at a public meeting - whether it be a political gathering or a social meeting - to strike a true Imperial note to bring from the audience a cheer of agreement. What we have to consider, and what I take it the representatives of the Conference will consider, is - how are we to secure the development and Strengthening of the British Empire and the States which compose it, bringing about closer unity and harmony, and at the same time securing with greater accuracy the representation of the views of the dependencies in all Imperial councils? That end must be secured not by our becoming too closely entangled with the outside affairs of the Empire, and not by a Federation, but by treating each other as sister States in an alliance. The more we are left to ourselves to follow our own bent and to develop our part of the Empire in our. own way, the stronger we shall grow and the better able we shall be to support the Empire when support is needed. I think that that is the way in which we ought to travel - not by making hard-and-fast bonds or agreements, but by allowing each dependency to develop in the best way it can. We need in regard to the old land a closer fiscal union. I do not share the pessimistic views of my honorable friend who last spoke. I believe that we can find willing minds who will be able to come to an agreement with regard to this matter. Australia uses an enormous number of articles that we are not producing, and cannot produce for a great many years. We produce an enormous quantity of raw material which we wish to send abroad. We should endeavour to send as much of it as we can to the old land. We should endeavour in every way to promote unity, with the old country, and if we keep that object in view, and have willing minds at the head of affairs, we shall, I am satisfied, be able to develop our own industries under a protective system, whilst at the same time giving the old country as great a preference in everything as we possibly can do. </para>

                                <para>- There should be. We want an honest preference, not a bogus one. We want one that will lead to the advantage of both countries, not merely to the advantage of Australia) though such a preference would be greatly to the advantage of this country. It is good for us, I think, when we have borrowed money from Great Britain, and have to pay interest upon it, that the greater part of our trade should also go there. I believe that the great majority of the people of Australia, whether in Victoria" or elsewhere, wish to see the Tariff question settled. The protectionists desire to see it settled, because at present things are in too uncertain a state to give any security to those who put their money into industries, or to the workmen who desire employment. If we are going to have protection let us have proper protection. Let us have a protection that will really carry out what protection is intended for. Let us have duties that will be sufficient to 'do it, and let those things which we cannot produce ourselves come in as free as possible. Under the old Victorian Tariff, which was a well-constructed scientific protectionist Tariff we imported into this State £18,000,000 of goods per annum. Under this protectionist Tariff £12,000,000 worth of goods out of the -^"18,000,000 came in absolutely free of duty, and from the articles on which duties were levied Victoria raised a revenue from Customs and Excise of about  ,£3,000,000.  I think those figures are correct; the Vice-President of the Executive Council knows, them better than I do. Victoria was able to have a very large free list and a true protective system as well.

                        <para class="block">I may remark that though the Commonwealth Tariff is exceedingly low as compared with the Victorian Tariff, one of the leading softgoods merchants in Flinders-lane told me a little while ago that they are paying in Customs duties double the amount that they paid under the Victorian Tariff. We want this question settled, and  1  believe that the great majority of the people of the country would like to see it settled. There are some, I know, who do not want it settled, and one body that is of that opinion is the Labour Party. They do not want it settled because they have managed to live on Tariff strife for a considerable time, and hope to live on it for a long time to come. I do not anticipate that we shall get, during this or the next session, very much assistance from that party as a body towards settling the question, because they know that the sooner it is settled the sooner they will be settled also. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think New South Wales is in the same street <inline font-style="italic">:ls</inline> Canada, and if I were to discuss the fiscal position in New South Wales, I should have to discuss a good many matters connected with New South Wales in conjunction with it, such as the assistance New South Wales has had from loans to enable her to carry on, and many other matters. I am pointing to one of the greatest dependencies of the Empire in somewhat similar circumstances to our own. Canada has attained her present position by her protective policy. When the reciprocal agreement between Canada and the United States terminated suddenly in 1866, she had for twelve years been endeavouring to build up a United States trade, and she had got it. She was at her wit's end to know where to look for customers, and many in Canada said, " We must have annexation or incorporation with the United States, otherwise we shall not be able to deal with them." There was, however, the spirit of the old Empire loyalists there. They would not listen to that proposition for a moment; and instead of their adopting it, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Macdonald introduced his protective Tariff and brought about the Federation of Canada in the following year. Since then Canada has never looked back. We must have this protective policy if we are to progress in Australia. We have had here latelv <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> Macdonald, a gentleman whose name was mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> He passed through Australia with the speed of the carrier pigeon, and I see he has been giving his ideas about us in the House of Commons. I trust that English people will not take that gentleman as a very good authority on Australian matters. </para>

I happened, when in England, to attend a gathering in Trafalgar Square, to which he led up some hundreds of unemployed bootmakers from Leicester. He was inveighing against the conditions in England, and all the while he was upholding then, as he is upholding now, that freetrade policy which was keeping those men out of work and their families in starvation. The question of preferential trade will be one of our first considerations. Next, I think, our great need is that of immigration. It is our most crying need, and I trust that the Prime </para>

They are finding out the danger in America, they are complaining very bitterly now in Canada, and, while we are comparatively free of those troubles which are afflicting the United States, and to a much less extent Canada, let us continue to keep as free as we possibly can of them. Canada has gone ahead, first by her protective policy, next by her encouragement of immigration, and she has got there the right sort of people. </para>

Of course, much of the immigration to Canada is due to the exertions of the great railway bodies there - the Canadian-Pacific and the Grand Trunk - but immigrants are assisted in some ways by the Government. I do not think they are assisted much in money. They are assisted more by immigration lecturers, advertising, and immigration agencies throughout the Continent of Europe and the old land. </para>

                                <para>- From 1899 to 1904 the Canadian Government spent £500,000 sterling, or 3,000,000 dollars, in immigration. She has done more. She has not asked high prices for her land. This is what she has done to promote settlement there: From 1891 to 1898 she gave away 4,803,200 acres. During that time she only sold 461,583 acres. In the five years from 1899 to 1904 she gave away 16,808,800 acres to settlers, and she only sold 594,433 acres. This seems to be an example of kingly generosity, but it was a wise policy, and she is now reaping her reward. </para>

                                <para>- Of course, we do not control the land. That is unfortunate. I trust the Government will be able to make arrangements with the States to get control of land. I have advocated in another place that the Commonwealth Government, in order to get land, should even buy it in order to settle the people under good conditions. I am not prepared to say whether the Northern Territory will be suitable for the settlement of white people, but the bargain that has been made to take it over will, I hope, be ratified if it is on anything like fair lines, and possibly the Commonwealth may have large areas of country there at its disposal. The question of defence is not one I understand very deeply, but every one who looks at the matter is becoming more and more impressed with the necessity for doing a great deal more than we are doing at the present time. I was. glad to hear a gentleman who can speak with authority such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> deal with the matter at such length and with so much earnestness. A year or two ago I voted for the subsidy to the British Navy. Had I known as much then as I do now I would not have voted for it. I think we shall have to take up this question as a national one. Perhaps at that time I had not given the matter due consideration, but it seems to me now that we must take up the question both of Army and Navy, and spend money upon them. </para>

                                <para>- I am not a Socialist. I hope that in this matter I am a patriot. We are getting beyond the mere hiring of defence from any one, even from the old land, and, while it might not be wise during the term of this agreement to abrogate it, although we could do so by giving two years' notice, still we should deal here in no cheeseparing fashion with the question of defence and the beginnings of a navy of our own. I hope the Tariff question will be settled this year, but I am afraid that with this long adjournment, and with a very long Governor-General's speech to consider - which will probably take up the month of July - and with all the complicated issues that spring from the consideration of a Tariff, we shall not get that question settled promptly. I may be wrong, but I really do think it would have been very much better if the Minister of Trade and Customs had remained behind, and if the Houses had sat on and dealt with the Tariff Commission's reports. While I do not desire to speak harshly, it savours to me of inconsistency that men who for the last two years have been talking about workers out of work, about starving women and children, about unemployment being rife throughout the country, and who were so clamorous for something to be done, and done at once, a year or two ago, should now quietly sit back and say, " There is no hurry. Proper time must be given for the consideration of these things." I do not understand how honorable members anywhere can take up that position. However, it is a matter for themselves, and for their constituents. I think it is very well understood that there is not general satisfaction with, the Australian delegation to the Navigation Conference. We were asked to send men who understood the business - men representing those who put their money into the pursuit, and men representing also those who put something far more important than their money into it - their lives and their happiness. We have not sent a worthy representative of either party. I am afraid our delegation will not be looked upon with great satisfaction at Home, and that we shall not rise in the estimation of those connected with the matter at Home through the men whom we have sent there. A matter I should like to urge the Prime Minister to see to in his absence is the question of appointing a High Commissioner as soon as possible. It is only those who go to the old land, and spend a few weeks in London making inquiries, who know how little we are thought of, and how little we are known. Of the newspapers in London which are legion, not more than three or four give a reference to Australia, and only one or two give a kindly reference. That can be largely cured by having proper representation in the shape of a High Commissioner in the old land, and I trust the Prime Minister will take such steps there as will lead at a very early date to our being properly represented. I have nothing more to add to these somewhat desultory, remarks, except that I will sit here as an independent member, as a protectionist desiring to see a thoroughly good protective Tariff, and prepared to support any Government, no matter who they are, that will bring in legislation in accordance with my policy, and for the best interests of this country. </para>

                            <para>.- I did not intend to rise this evening, but as the question is likely to be put at any moment, I desire to bring some matters under the notice of the Government. I observe that there has been a conference of returning officers for the States in Melbourne. At the first Federal election in 1901, I was one of the returning officers for the Kennedy division, and I have also been returning officer for State electorates. I have never seen a more pitiable exhibition than was presented at the recent Federal election. In Brisbane the polling place was located in the most outlandish spot which could be selected. The candidates spoke to the various returning officers, and although we were spending our time and money in addressing the electors, our advice, even though it might not have been the best, was ignored. I do not think that Parliament ever intended that such treatment should be meted out to us. It is stated in to-night/s newspaper that Victoria has lost one or two members according to the rolls, and that is the proper test to take. I can say, from personal experience, that it is not the proper test to take. If the rolls of the other States are in the same condition as are the rolls of Queensland, then they are perfectly rotten. Take Brisbane, for instance. I know a well-known man whose name appears on five rolls. I know other men whose names appear two or three times on die rolls for the district. I also know men who had left the State, and who could have voted if they had wished to do that which was not right or just, because their names still appeared on the roll. Therefore I do not see how any one can take the rolls as a test of the population in a district or a State. </para>

                                <para>- I intend to bring this question before the notice of the Government in accordance with my promise, no matter what interruptions may be made. Hundreds of persons did not take the trouble to look at the roll, but walked away from the polling places. Under a blazing sun sixty-seven persons went down to a place about half-a-mile away, and there found that their names were on the roll. Sixty-four of them returned to the polling place, claimed the right to vote, and voted. I like fair play, both for myself and for my opponents. I hold that those who have to pay the piper should have a chance to record their votes if possible. During the electoral campaign, we asked not only supporters, but also opponents to turn up and record their votes, as we desired to ascertain the true opinion of the people of the State. Nothing, I think, could be fairer than that. I do not know who is to blame, but certainly somebody has blundered, and hundreds of persons in Queensland have been disfranchised by the action of either the Government or their officials. It results from a cheap and nasty way of doing their business. To-day I picked up a return, from which I learn that in 1901 the cost of the elections was £5^,331- In 1903 it was reduced to £51.000, and in 1906 to £46,000. </para>

                                <para>- Those who support the Government are responsible for the events which distinguished the recent election. The men who were appointed to act as officers were underpaid. In fact, they were sweated. Yet my honorable friends on the other side still support the Government which perpetrated those acts. Take the figures for Queensland. In 1901 the cost of the Federal election was £12,000. No one in that State has cavilled at the expense of that election, because it is generally recognised that if we wish to do a thing well, we must secure the services of good men and pay them good wages. The rate of pay has been cut down. Men. as I know from experience, had to remain at their posts from .half-past 7 a.m. to between n and 12 p.m. for an ordinary day's pay. That, I suppose, is a little bit of Socialism in our time, and the people who do the work are to be ground down. In 1903 the cost of the Federal elections was reduced by £3,000 in that State, and last year it was reduced by very nearly £2,000. It is a disgrace to the Commonwealth, as well as to Queensland, that men should be asked to go to the booths and work during long hours for a pittance. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly. In the Electoral Act there is no system for purifying the rolls. That is generally left to a lad in the office. I have no fault to find with the lads, because I suppose they only <inline font-style="italic">do</inline> what a great many grown-up persons would do. But there should be a system whereby the rolls could be purified. At the present time, I repeat, that is left to a lad. If he has a bias one way he will strike off the names of persons, and when they go to vote they will find that they are not enrolled. Or, if he has a bias the other way, he may leave on the names of persons, although he knows that they hare gone away, with the hope that they may come back. </para>

I do not remember any instance when we were asked to say whether we were in favour of or against protection. The honorable senator who said that the question was put before Australia, must now admit that he was wrong. I am quite aware that in Victoria it was the chief question, but that, I think, was the only State where it was brought forward prominently. I do not suppose that many honorable senators on this side can find fault with the eighth paragraph of the GovernorGeneral's speech - </para>

                                <para>- I see on the other side honorable senators who are prepared to support the Government, although they have no faith in that part of their programme. I am very pleased to say that so far as most of the promised measures are concerned, the Government shall have my hearty support. But I am a very free member of the Chamber, bound to no caucus or party. I made that declaration from every platform on which I spoke. In every speech I told the people that I was opposed to Socialism. From the north to the south, and from the east to the west, that was the key-note at the general election. In Queensland the great issue was whether the Government of the Commonwealth should have the right to tax the lands of the States. We fought that issue for all it was worth. We contend that although the Constitution may authorize the Federal Parliament to take that step in a time cf great national emergency, in time of peace it has no right to intervene, because once it begins to exercise the power of taxation the Commonwealth will soon own the land. I tell any one who owns  50,000  acres of land that if he will give me the power of taxation in regard to that land, I will soon become its owner. If the Federal Government were empowered to tax the lands of the States, men would soon part with their lands. I hope that that power will never be granted to any Federal Government. I believe that the States Governments, if properly approached, are prepared to open up the lands to a stream of immigrants, and to assist immigration in every form. In Queensland, where I have lived for forty-five years, we have never had so prosperous a season as we now have. I am very pleased to see that all other parts of the Commonwealth are prosperous. In Queensland we have alienated  4  per cent, of our lands, and any observant man who travels through the State will  find millions of acres " of Crown land, which are quite suitable for farming and dairying. In the other House there is a gentleman who once owned a large tract of country not far from Rockhampton, which! to-day is carrying hundreds of prosperous dairy farmers. We are told that there are enough people in the Commonwealth. That statement is absurd. </para>

                                <para>- During the late elections, we heard that statement from gentlemen who hold the same views as does the honorable senator. We have been told that there is no work, and, therefore, no occasion to bring men to this country, but I say that there is plenty of work for the right class of men who will go on the land. In the district of Mackay there are hundreds of farmers who ten years ago were immigrants, and who are now prosperous. I can assure honorable senators that it would gladden their hearts to see the happy and contented position of those men. There are millions of acres in the Commonwealth on which people may be placed. There may not be land available in Victoria, but in Queensland a man may plough for a thousand miles without a stoppage through one of the finest territories under the sun. There is, I admit, the one drawback of the droughts, but these affect the whole of Australia more or less ; and I have no doubt that in time science will find a remedy. We are told we ought to have an army and  a  navy. I have been president of a rifle club, and have assisted it to the best of my power for many years ; and my idea is that, with our present population, we cannot afford both an army and  a  navy. It is for us to decide which arm of defence we can bring to the proper state of efficiency with the means at our disposal. I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> say that he did not believe in what is called the " naval tribute." Well,  I  do believe in that subsidy, but I also believe in Australia trying to form the nucleus of a navy without too much expense. I have no doubt that ships could be obtained from the old country to be used as training vessels ; but beyond what I have indicated it is of no use attempting to go, because I am sure the public would never foot the bill for both an army and  a  navy. We must have one or the other ; and  I  am pleased to see that the Government are taking steps in regard to the cadet force, my only complaint being that they do not go fast enough. We hear people talking in one breath about providing an army and a navy, and in the next breath complaining about the expense of the cadet force. One battle-ship would cost more than would equip and educate  100,000  cadets. Let us take the material which is at hand ; and we all know that there is no time in a boy's life when he will take to soldiering so readily as between the ages of sixteen and eighteen. There is no question that unless people are brought to Australia, and settled here, so as to attach them to the soil, we shall never be able to raise an efficient defence force. We do not desire to have people who merely come to a gold rush, and then ,go away again ; we desire to have people who will make their homes here. Such, however, has not been the aim of the Commonwealth so far ; but I hope that when we meet again, a Bill will be introduced empowering the Government to spend twice as much, or, if needs be, three times as much, as is now spent on the Cadet Forces. I do not intend to make a long speech, because the hour is getting late, and, as  a  matter of fact, there is very little in the GovernorGeneral's speech that, from my point of view, can be cavilled at. Of course, it has been stated that the honorable gentleman who is going as the representative of Australia to the Imperial Conference has not the confidence of the country. That is a matter of opinion, and my opinion is that the honorable gentleman has not that confidence. Fifteen years ago nobody admired the present Prime Minister more than I did, but the way in which he has hung on to office, and the way in which he has "eaten dirt," and returned to it, has lost him the good opinion of not only the people of Victoria, but of the people of the whole of Australia. I only wish that the representative to the Conference was one who had the good-will of Australia, as a whole, and not merely of one section. In one sense I am glad that the Prime Minister is going Home, because, as my colleague has said, the visit may open his eves to wider views. In that however, I have little faith, because none are so blind as those who will not see. I have to thank honorable senators for the patience with which they have listened to me, and for the few interruptions I have experienced ; and I conclude by expressing the hope that, although all the senators who represent Queensland may not be able to see eye to eye on every question, they will, in any matters affecting the rights of their State, be found fighting on the same side. </para>

                            <para>- - Before venturing to trespass on the time of the Senate in referring to one or two of the matters which have cropped up during the discussion, I take this, the first opportunity, to tender my congratulations to you, sir, on the high and important position to which you have just been elected. I have not had for any appreciable time the pleasure of your personal acquaintance, but if I am to judge from the unanimous vote of the Chamber, I am led to believe that you are possessed of all those qualities and abilities which are necessary to fill so important and proud a position ; and I trust you will long be spared to preside over the destinies and deliberations of this Chamber. I listened with great interest to the eloquent address delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> ; and I was particularly struck with his very patriotic references to the all-important question of defence. I approach this question with a certain amount of diffidence, in view of the fact that the honorable senator I have mentioned is a man of greater physical dimensions &gt;than myself, and is also a soldier. But notwithstanding the_honorable senator's patriotic utterances, and his contention that it is necessary for us to take every step possible to defend Australia, I think that he and other honorable senators who followed him have forgotten one very important factor. If we are ever to have a proper system of defence, then, before we start to talk about a cadet system, or about training the youth of the country to shoot straight, we must commence by dealing with the land question. If those honorable senators are in earnest, then I ask them to assist the party which has been dubbed the Socialist Party, to impose a tax on unimproved land values, and thus compel those men who to-day are holding the land in large tracts and preventing the natural development of the national wealth, to disgorge, and afford room for those whom we should have to train. . </para>

                                <para>- There are more places in the Australian Commonwealth than Queensland. Then when one is contesting a Federal election, and a reference is made to the all-important question, the answer of this same party is, " Oh, that Is a question for the States." That is how our opponents wriggle. Therefore, I hope that when during the life of this Parliament this question comes before us, honorable senators who have preceded me in this debate, will remember their utterances, and, if they are sincere, will vote to a man for this tax as being a matter which is indissolubly connected with the question of Australian defence. </para>

                                <para>- The north and the south, if the honorable senator likes. If there were no other argument to support the necessity and desirableness of connecting the eastern and western portions of the Continent, there is the argument of defence, and when we are discussing the question of this much-needed railway on a future occasion I shall appeal to the honorable senators to whom I have referred to support the representatives of the western State. I was very glad to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> say that he is opposed to the Naval subsidy. So am I ; and I hope the day will soon arrive when we shall make an effort to prove to the mother country that we intend to try to be self-reliant. So long as we continue to pay that subsidy, so long do we prove that we are neither able nor willing to make an attempt to build up our own nation. Much has been said during the debate as to the impossibility of our building or maintaining an Australian Navy. But we do not require to go to the expense of constructing <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts,</inline><inline font-style="italic">Terribles.</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">Powerfuls;</inline> we might make a humble start by defending our coast-line with submarines and a small torpedo fleet. Even if we are paying £200,000 a year to the British Exchequer, the fleet for which that money is paid would be of no use to us if we were subject to an invasion to-morrow. If Great Britain found herself in the position which her Field Marshal fears may occur at any time, that fleet might be called away, and we would be left to the tender mercies of our neighbours, the Mongolian hordes. I regret that the Imperialistic spirit has been so pronounced during the course of this debate. I have regretted for some considerable time that the public men of Australia are too Imperialistic, and forget that their duty is first to the Australian Continent and the Australian people, and to the mother country afterwards. Let it not be understood that, in making such a statement, I am more disloyal or more loyal than any other man. I have every respect and every consideration for the motherland from which I have sprung, but I know that it is our duty first, as a young nation, to look to ourselves. If the motherland is ever in difficulties, and wants our help, I am sure that help will be given. </para>

Let me say, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> that if the only issue put forward by the Government of the day prior to the dissolution of Parliament was that of Tariff, it is a remarkable thing that in Western Australia a prominent member of the Ministry, who occupies a seat in another Chamber, ran two different men who had two different fiscal faiths, for two different constituencies. For the Fremantle electoral division he espoused and supported an avowedly protectionist candidate, who on his arrival in the Federal Parliament took up a position in direct opposition to the party which poses as the protectionist party. In the Perth electoral division the same gentleman espoused and supported a candidate who was avowedly a free-trader. </para>

                        <para class="block">Ministry to put an issue before them. We have been reminded in the speech read by the Governor-General yesterday that an Imperial Conference is about to take place in London. We are told that the reason for this short session is that the Prime Minister has to attend that Conference. I am not going to enter into the pros and cons of that question. Personally I fail to see why the Federal Parliament should adjourn simply because two or three of its members have to go to London. Whatever may be the subjects that come before the Imperial Conference, I sincerely hope that the. representatives of Australia will adopt no cringing attitude, but that they will show to the people of Great Britain and to the representatives of the other self-governing portions of the Empire that we in Australia, at least, are imbued with a truly national, self-reliant spirit. On the question of immigration I wish to make myself clearly and distinctly understood. I recognise that it is necessary that Ave should encourage a judicious system of immigration. But I will be, as I have hitherto been, a most determined opponent of any system of. immigration until such time as we have initiated another system to provide for those who are at our own doors. It is useless for honorable senators to stand up in the Senate and tell us that in various parts of Australia land and work are available. To wuch statements I give an emphatic contradiction. There are many places in this Commonwealth to-day where the unemployed problem is acute and where misery and starvation stalk throughout the place. If we are going to face this question, let us do it in the manner I have indicated. Let us endeavour first of all to supply the wants of those who are here. If we are determined to develop our great agricultural resources, let us give every facility and every opportunity to those who are at present within our shores and who are idle but willing to work on the land if they can find favorable opportunity. Do not let us continue the pernicious system that has obtained in some States of recent years, of bringing men here who do not immediately settle upon the land, but who enter into competition with the various artisans in the already congested labour market. Such are my views on one or two of the matters that have been brought before us in the speech from  His Excellency.  So far as the Tariff is concerned, we shall have ample opportunities for discussion at a later stage in the life of this Parliament. I have a fiscal faith and a very pronounced one, and I will put that fiscal faith into practical operation when the Tariff question comes before us. </para>

                            <para>. - I do not intend to occupy the attention of honorable senators at great length, but seeing that two or three of those who have addressed themselves to the motion have thought it necessary to make reference to the administration of the Electoral Act at the recent elections, I think it is only due to them and to the Senate that something should be said on the part of the Government with regard to that matter. It has been stated that my predecessor in the Home Office - the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, who had' control of the Department in December last - by paltry parsimony brought about in connexion with the administration of the elections very many of the disadvantages and hardships to the electors and the community generally, to which reference has been made. T would say at the outset that it has to be remembered that the elections were carried out under what may be called an entirely new law. Certainly we had a Commonwealth electoral law for the election of 1903, but since then there have been introduced a considerable number of modifications constituting the Act of 1905. I do not put this forward as a reason why mistakes should occur or hardships or injustices arise in the administration. </para>

                                <para>- Undoubted}', many were introduced as the result of the experience of the 1903 election. Approximately 13,000 officers were employer! throughout the Commonwealth for the conduct of the election last December. A general election, as honorable senators are aware, occurs once only in every three years. It is not a case in which a man has an opportunity of rectifying a blunder which he may find in the ordinary course of his daily experience. I do not propose to deal at great length with this subject, but incidentally to touch upon one or two matters referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce, Senator Sayers</inline> and others. I may say at the beginning that the whole of the rolls for the Commonwealth were readjusted on the basis of the redistribution of electorates proclaimed on the 17th July last. The rolls themselves were printed and exposed at all the post offices throughout the Commonwealth - the appropriate roll at the appropriate post office. Notifications were put up at the post offices, and at all public buildings throughout Australia, setting out the methods of obtaining enrolment, transfer, change of polling place. Everything was done to bring under the notice of the people how they could enrol, and enrol for the proper polling place. After that the postal officials throughout the Commonwealth were instructed to render every assistance to persons making inquiries with regard to electorates and enrolment. Maps for different divisions were put up at the post offices, and every advantage was taken of the information contained in the existing State electoral rolls, and any action that had recently been taken in connexion with them. Not long before the issue of the writs, the rolls, in consequence of the applications made for enrolment and transfer, were reprinted, and the reprinted form of the rolls was exposed as were the original rolls at the different post offices throughout the Commonwealth. Moreover, a particularly stressful notice - if I may so style it - a notice which was calculated to attract the attention of electors - was issued reminding them of the opportunity of getting upon the electoral roll. Certainly a good deal of supineness was shown by many who did not take advantage of the opportunities to get upon the rolls. Later on many of those persons, in the excitement of the contest, took a little more interest in the matter than they had previously done. The fullest advantage was taken of the liberality or generosity - or interest it may be - of the press, which throughout the whole Commonwealth drew the attention of the readers of the newspapers to the obligation that fell upon them with regard to enrolment, or transfer, or desire to change polling places. As to the matter to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has made reference, when we amended our Electoral Act in 1905 we made provision for working in co-operation with the States wherever there should be appropriate electoral machinery. At a Conference of Premiers held a few years ago in Hobart it was decided that it would be to the interests of the States and the Commonwealth if joint action should be taken in connexion with electoral administration, and honorable senators who were present in the last Senate will remember that in our Electoral Act of 1905 we made legislative provision to enable the Electoral Department of the Commonwealth to work in conjunction with the Electoral Departments of the States. I regret, however, that so far the States have not joined in with us in that matter, although, possibly, at some very early date in the future we may find several, if not all, of them taking action of that kind. It is in anticipation of the States joining in with us in that regard that the whole electoral system throughout the Commonwealth has been organized. Reference was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> to the fact that many of the officials engaged in the elections were ill-paid. </para>

We must, in organizing the whole electoral system, keep that well in mind. Otherwise, hereafter it might be that, instead of the working together being productive of benefits in the way of reduction of expenditure, it would have just the contrary effect. </para>

                                <para>- The congestion that took place is an admitted fact. It must be remembered that the principle of absent voting has been recognised and legislated for only in recent years. One of the features unforeseen by the administrators of the electoral law has been the remarkable increase in the use by electors of this system of voting. It has been very noticeable in all the metropolitan centres. Electors who live out in the suburbs chose not to vote at the polling place for which they were registered, but crowded in in inordinately large numbers to certain polling places in the metropolitan division itself. </para>

                                <para>- Naturally so. They came into town about 9 and left about 5, or perhaps came in at '8 and left about 6, and they preferred to vote in town rather than vote at their own polling places. In some instances electors who were living only a couple of hundred yards from their, own polling places voted in the city. This led to an enormous congestion of votes - votes registered under the form Q provision - and the absent voters crowded in in those instances in very much larger numbers than were anticipated. </para>

                                <para>- Yes ; but I understand that a very much larger number of persons voted in this way at the last election than on previous occasions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> also said he had been informed by a reliable authority that there was no provision in the law for purifying the rolls. In our original Commonwealth Electoral Act we had a provision for the purification of "the rolls by revision courts, but we abolished the revision court system in our Act of 1905, and in Part VII. of the Act as it stands now as amended we have provisions ranging from sections 67 to 72 for the removal of names from the roll. The procedure is that any name on the roll may be objected to by any person, a deposit of 5s. being necessary, to be forfeited to the King if the returning officer holds the objection to be frivolous. Section 68 provides for the form of objection, and in section 69 the obligation is cast upon every registrar to lodge or make an objection in writing, setting forth the ground of such objection in respect of any name which he has reason to believe ought not to be retained upon the roll. When he does that the returning officer must forthwith give notice of the objection to the person objected to. The notice must be in the prescribed form, and mav be served or sent by letter. Then the obligation is not thrown upon the person objected to of attending the Court, but he may orally or in writing in the prescribed manner answer the objection. </para>

                                <para>- It would only be in the hands of the returning officers or the registrars. The persons appointed as registrars in many instances, especially out side the very populous centres, are officers attached to the Post and Telegraph Department, and they are not under-strappers in any sense of the word. They are persons charged in many instances with the responsibility of conducting a post and telegraph office. Naturally in the whole scheme of organization it has been sought so far as possible to use Commonwealth officers as registrars wherever available, because you have in them persons accustomed  to responsibility and to discipline. In all those instances they are bound by the law, wherever they have reason to believe that a person is no longer entitled to be on the roll, to strike the name off and send a notification to the last-known address of that person. If they did not do it, then they; were guilty of a neglect of duty, because the law casts an imperative duty on them. </para>

It is only in those cases in which by accident or otherwise the officer has reason to think the elector has gone. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, but it is open to any one else to lodge an objection. As a matter of fact the law is there, and if it has not been put into play in any particular instance it is either through the omission of a private individual, who may or may not have taken the course which the law allows him to take, or through the neglect of an official. As those responsible for carrying out this duty are in most instances permanent officers of some department of the Commonwealth, their particular neglect in the matter can be easily brought under the notice of the Government, who can give attention to it. </para>

                                <para>- That is a matter for the Legislature. So far as the general administration is concerned, I think honorable senators will recognise that the conduct of such an important matter, so extensive in all its ramifications, as a Commonwealth election can be hardly expected to be carried out without some illustrations in some place or other of mistakes or even bungling. When you are controlling an army of something like  13,000  officers who are performing a duty which they only perform - fortunately or unfortunately - once in three years, you cannot expect that they will work with the clock-like precision and regularity of those who are carrying out the same duties day by day and week by week and year bv year. I think it will be found by all dispassionate observers and inquirers, if the whole matter is gone into, and the particular concrete instances are examined in all their bearings, that the election was conducted, generally speaking, in a very satisfactory way, and that the reduction in the expenditure was not due to any parsimonious desires on the part of my predecessor, but was brought about by a system of greater perfection of organization than could possibly have been achieved on the occasion of the first Federal election. I shall be very glad if any of the particular instances that honorable senators are peculiarly interested in are brought under my notice. I shall endeavour to get the fullest amount of information about them, and I hope that in most instances, if not in all, the fuller information will satisfy honorable senators that the alleged blunders were not as serious as they originally thought. </para>

                            <para>. - I do not think that such an important document as the Governor-General's speech should be allowed to pass without a little remark. But before going into the subject-matter of it, perhaps I mav be permitted to observe that it is a pity that, having been called together, we should be compelled to separate so early. There seems to have been a very large amount of enthusiasm and energy infused into the Chamber since the accession of a number of new senators, and it is very probable that, if we do not meet again until June or July, a very large portion of that enthusiasm will have evaporated, very much to the loss and disadvantage of the members of the Senate. The Government might have set out in detail some of the many subjects of far-reaching importance which are to be submitted for discussion at the Conference of Prime Ministers of' the self-governing portions of the Empire, to be held in London in April next. We are dismissed with the curt information that there is to be a Conference, and that many subjects of far-reaching importance will be discussed thereat, but we are not told what the subjects are to be, or of the attitude of our representatives upon them. That is an omission on the part of the Government which Parliament ought to resent if it is in a position to do so. We are merely asked to send our representatives to the old country, and to let them do what they please, return and give their report, when I suppose we shall be invited to indorse what has been done, no matter what it may be. I for one object to that method of carrying on business. It is asking far too much of Parliament to request its assent to that proposal. Unfortunately, I am in a rather difficult position. If any number of honorable senators refused to permit the Prime Minister to go Home, I suppose he would take that refusal as a vote of no confidence, and resign, and in all probability we should have another Government. However bad or unsatisfactory the present Government may be, the alternative would be a thousand times worse. I arn therefore placed in this unfortunate position, that I am between  His  Satanic Majesty and the blue sea. I choose the blue sea in preference. The only paragraph of the GovernorGeneral's speech that I desire to refer to is the last one, which contains a very comprehensive programme, no doubt, and which reads as follows: - </para>

                        <para>That is, I think, a most excellent portion of the Government's policy, and I trust that no time will be lost in calling Parliament together and carrying out their promise in that connexion. The paragraph continues -  to develop the latent resources of the continent ; </para>
                        <para class="block">That is a phrase that finds its way into every Governor-General's speech. It sounds well, and means very little.  promote trade relations within the Empire ; </para>
                        <para class="block">That probably means preferential trade, of which I am an advocate. I shall support any fair system which may be brought before Parliament.  make adequate provision for our defences ; and augment the population of Australia by a judicious encouragement of immigration. </para>
                        <para class="block">The misfortune about this portion of the speech is that it is very vague and indefinite. What is meant by the phrase " adequate provision for our defences " ? It appears to me that the very first essential, so far as defence is concerned, is population. So long as we have only 4,000,000 of people inhabiting this Continent, we can never hope to maintain it against invasion. We ought to strain every nerve to increase our population to ten millions, aye, even to twenty millions. I do not believe that Australia will ever be absolutely safe against invasion until the population has been increased to at least twenty millions. I do not know what the policy of the Government is. They talk of " a judicious encouragement of immigration." I do not know what the phrase means. I do not believe the Government is aware of what it means. But I think it must be evident to every citizen that if we are to be secured against foreign aggression, no matter how prosperous or politically free we may be, unless we are sure that we are able to defend our territory against a possible invader, then the whole thing goes for nothing. For that reason, as well as for the maintenance of a White Australia, a very large increase of population is absolutely necessary. So far, I think the Socialists, or the " Soshes " as they were called during the general election, and the " Anti-Soshes " are agreed. But when we come to the method of bringing about that additional population then we differ. The Anti-Soshes have one method to propose; the Soshes have another. What is the method of the former? Let us try to clear our mind of prejudice, and examine the propositions of each party on their merits. The anti- Socialists are to a man either free-traders or revenue tariffists. </para>

                                <para>- I withdraw my remark, and say that a very large majority of the anti- Socialists are either free-traders or revenue tariffists, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl"</inline> is a revenue tariffist. If we had a free-trade policy in Australia tomorrow it would mean the throwing out of employment of hundreds of thousands of men and women. A system of revenue tariffism, while it drags the last farthing of taxation out of the pockets of the poor, does not assist to establish a single industry. The only thing it does effectively is to save the skin of the rich man from taxation, and that is what our friends on the right are so much in favour of. So much for the anti-Socialists. They subscribe to a man to the infamous creed given out some time ago by their leader, the Honorable George Reid, when, in discussing the question of establishing industries in Australia, he asked, '.' Why should we not wait, before trying to establish these industries, until we have developed pauper labour of our own?" </para>

                                <para>- No; while the people were being driven out of the country districts the population in Melbourne was increasing. While the farming areas were being aggregated into big estates the factories in Melbourne were being multiplied. If it had not been for Victoria's protectionist policy, land monopoly would have driven away not 150,000, but 500,000 of her people. It was her protectionist policy that saved her. </para>

                                <para>- The fact remains that during the last fifteen years Victoria has lost 160,000 of her most effective citizens. These men and women have been driven from the State by the evil of land monopoly. That evil is not confined to Victoria. Go across to Tasmania, and you find that that tight little island, although capable of maintaining a population of j, 000,000, has a population of only about a 70,000, and people are going away continually. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. Land monopoly is the stone that lies in the way of our advancement, but our anti-Socialist friends absolutely refuse to interfere with the land monopolist. From whatever point of view we regard them, they are the enemies of the country. Their intentions may be perfectly honorable. They may honestly labour under the delusion that they are patriots, consumed by love  of their country, whose policy is the best under the sun. But surely if they applied the touchstone of commonsense to it, they would see that, while we have land monopoly and a revenue Tariff, it will be impossible to create new industries, and to add ito our population by making Australia the country that we all desire that it should be. What is the  policy which anti-Socialists offer to us? </para>

                        <para class="block">While not assisting in the creation of new industries, nor affording opportunities for the people to settle on the land, they clamour for the introduction of more population. How do they propose to get more people here? These anti-Socialists, these men who scout the idea of receiving assistance from the State, desire that working people should be brought here at the expense of the State. If I were an anti-Socialist, I should scorn to take one farthing from the State, and if I desired that working people should be, brought here, I would take the necessary money from my own pocket. O.ur friends the anti-Socialists take nothing out of their own pockets, but as much as they can get out of the public Treasury, and they use that money, not for the benefit of the people at large, but for the benefit of the class to which they belong. Let us contrast that policy with that of the Socialist. He believes in encouraging people to come here. We say, let us make Australia the best country under the sun. </para>

                                <para>- We have fair fields, fertile pastures, rich mines, and the finest resources that any country could possess. Let us use them so that Australia may support a very much larger population than she has now. Let us make the fertile areas of Victoria, which now support only a few sheep and cattle, available to men. women and children. Although, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> Victorians have to go to Canada for land, I believe that within about thirty miles of Melbourne there are  3,000.000  acres of land held by 150 owners. That statement touches only the fringe of land monopoly in this State. Those owners ought not to be permitted to stand in the way of the country's progress. </para>

I would penalize those who obstruct its progress. Will he assert that the allotments in Collins-street, which, fifty or sixty years ago, were bought for a few pounds, and are now worth thousands of pounds, have been raised to their present value by the exertions of their owners? </para>

                                <para>- No one wishes to take it from them. But Australia has borrowed a large amount of money, most of which has been spent in the making of railways, roads, and bridges, and on other developmental work tending to increase settlement. This expenditure has largely increased land values. To whom does the increase belong? To the private owners of land, or to the community whose money has created the increase? Let the private owner have what belongs to him. I want none of it. But I insist on taking what belongs to the community. </para>

If so, why have previous State Governments spent over £1,000,000 in re-purchas king estates on which to place settlers, and why has the present Government of Queensland obtained authority from Parliament to spend £500,000 a year in that way? If there is such a plenitude of land available for settlement, how does it arise that in almost every portion of the State people are clamouring for the Government to buy land from private owners for the purposes . of settlement? </para>

                                <para>- If there is so much land available on which an ordinary man might make a living, and which can be obtained from the State at a very low price, how does it come about that there are hundreds and thousands of people in Queensland clamouring for the Government to buy estates at prices varying from  £3  to £10 an acre? It is simply because the land which has not been taken 'up is, for the present, beyond the pale of cultivation. There are millions of acres of the best land of the State along our railway lines held by monopolists, and while this is the case we ought not to compel people to go to the back blocks,, far from the railways, where roads are bad, 'heavy clearing has to be done, and the land probably of an indifferent character, with an insufficient rainfall. Our own people will not go to such land, and yet we are asked to invite immi-grants from Great Britain who have no experience of the climate or conditions. As I say, our own agriculturists refuse to settle on such land, and if people come to Australia and settle there, they are doomed to failure. </para>

                                <para>- I think the wisest thing to do would be to promote settlement in the natural fashion by bringing under occupation and cultivation the lands along  the railway lines already built. Here we have the policy of the Socialists and the anti-Socialists contrasted. The anti-Socialists will assist neither in providing employ- . ment in factories nor in breaking up the big estates, and yet. they propose to bring here.- a number of immigrants and dump them on me labour market. That is the. happy-go-lucky policy which those gentlemen advocate. Our policy is exactly the opposite. We say there must be more population, but that to induce people to come here we must provide outlets for their energies by providing land and works ; and the only way in which that can be done is by a system of high protection, and the breaking up of land monopoly. I do rot propose to say anything further on the subject, because doubtless we shall later on have an opportunity to thresh out the whole question and arrive at a conclusion of some sort </para>
