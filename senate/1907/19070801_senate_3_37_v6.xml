                    <para>- Yesterday my attention was called to an observation made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> in which he used the word "nefarious," and I was asked whether it was in order or not. At the time I was under the impression that he was referring either to the Bill or to an honorable senator, and I therefore asked him to withdraw the word. I have since ascertained from the honorable senator, and this is confirmed by the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report, that the word was not applied to the Bill or any honorable senator. Had I been aware of that fact I should not have called upon him to withdraw the word. </para>

                        <para>. - May I explain to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> that it will hardly be of any use for the Senate to pass the motion standing in his name with reference to the income tax imposed in Victoria on Federal officers, and the amounts paid and unpaid, which he has asked shall be treated as formal. I can give him an assurance that we shall try to get the information for him. The motion deals with a State matter, and can hardly be taken as formal. I would suggest that it might be put in the form of a question. </para>

                    <para class="block">Vice-President of the Executive Council for having furnished us so expeditiously with copies of his speech. I had not an opportunity of listening to the speech, but I have perused the report. I notice that the honorable senator preceded to give a brief and instructive history of the progress of this proposal, but there is an important omission, which I think, in order to complete the details, might be given, even at this late stage. I find that the honorable senator makes no mention of that perfect epidemic of sudden conversions which has been associated with the proposal. I, of course, am prepared to fully accept his assurance that his translation from this side of the Chamber to the other may have been a coincidence, but that it was not a case of cause and effect. I am sure that there is no honorable . senator who would not willingly risk his seat rather than entertain the bare suggestion that a change of that kind could bring about such a result. I wish to' emphasize this fact, that the Bill, if it is to be carried, is to be carried by the votes of those who were previously its opponents, but who became its supporters when they obtained Cabinet rank. That is a simple fact, and I make the statement without any exception. The Minister gave us no solid reason for his change of attitude. I have no objection to offer to any one who, on a reconsideration of a question and after further information has been forthcoming, publicly says, " I .made an error in the first instance, and I desire now to announce it." I can respect such a man, but what did my honorable friend do in bringing forward this proposal? He read copious extracts from the reports of experts. He referred to Western Australian offers ; he dwelt eloquently on the resources of that great State, its enormous area, the glitter of its gold, and- its great population, and then he finished up with these words - </para>

                            <para>- Am I to understand from the interjection that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> is one who will watch how the political wind goes and is prepared to turn round, if he thinks that the electors are doing so ? Is that the view which he takes ? If. so, it renders it comparatively easy to understand why these remarkably sudden conversions have taken place. The interjection shows that they are not dependent upon the merits of the proposal merely, but because it is thought that it is politically expedient to change. One reasonwhich <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> gave, not for his change of front, but his sort of explanation of it, was that some time ago he had confided to a political friend that it would be the last occasion on which he would .vote against the proposal. It is unfortunate for the honorable gentleman that he did not make that announcement at that date. And with regard to the friend to whom he confided' his intention, let me say that if I read his remarks aright the announcement he made was an absolutely conditional one. The condition was that certain lands were to be reserved. If they were reserved he said! he would not further oppose the railway.. That was his statement, and the condition not having been fulfilled, I wait to see which way he will vote. May I impress upon }'ou, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> ' that the duty is thrown upon you, or upon those whose function it is to consider the health and comfort of honorable senators,, to have regard to one little fact. We live in an age when the germ theory has ft great hold upon the minds of men. It appears to me that the bench occupied by Ministers must be infected with a microbe which is absolutely deadly to life-long convictions and deeply-cherished principles.. I earnestly hope, sir, that you will give instructions that the Treasury bench shall therefore be frequently and thoroughly disinfected. Honorable senators who have occupied that bench have apparently all become victims to that microbe. </para>

                            <para>- I make no exception in the case of any one. If there is any honorable senator whose case is fitted by the remarks which I have made, he must apply them to himself. I am led to make that statement by a remark made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> that every Cabinet that has been formed in the Commonwealth has supported this railway. I admit it; but I reply that no more serious criticism was ever levelled against the  unsatisfactory condition of parliamentary life than was contained in that remark. What is the fact? No single Ministry could have lived since, this Federation was launched if it had not included this proposal in its programme. I am not finding fault with my honorable friends from Western Australia, who are utilizing their position to give  effect to a policy which they hold dear, and to which they are pledged. I have no quarrel with them. But what does it mean when we say that no single Ministry could have lived for five minutes in the Commonwealth if it had announced that it was opposed to this railway ? </para>

                            <para>- I shall concede to my honorable friends all the  comfort  which they can draw from the difference between a Survey Bill and a Railway Bill, when I come to deal with that point. But let me . say that no section of the Senate, or the Senate itself, is to blame for the position which exists. The Senate is not to blame for the relationship between parties in this Parliament. It is the electors of the Commonwealth themselves who are to blame, because they have failed to send to this Parliament any party possessed of sufficient strength to carry out its own programme without the aid of allies; and it is because of that fact that particular sections have been able to exercise a power over Ministries far greater than their numbers entitled them to. I believe that honorable senators will support what I am saying when I remark that it is to be regretted that such a position does exist as enables sections in a House of Legislature to determine the programmes of Governments, and to act remorselessly as to the methods to be pursued in accomplishing something which, if the ordinary relationships existing between parties obtained, would never be conceded to them. </para>

It has been obtained owing to the fact that two of the former opponents of the measure now occupy seats on the Treasury bench. I am not questioning whether there is a majority ; the division will determine that. I am merely asking how the majority has been arrived at. I pass from that point to refer to a remarkable prophesy which was uttered in the Federal Convention in reference to the section of the Constitution dealing with railway construction.

                            <para>- It is quite right for honorable senators opposite, if they view the matter in that way, to laugh and jeer when remarks are made about the present position of public life. But I am not prepared to take so light a view of the matter. It has been' proved beyond contradiction that if this Bill is to be carried at all, it will fie  carried by  those previous  opponents  of it who have become supporters since their accession to Ministerial office. There is only one interpretation to be placed upon such actions by the man in the street, and, I may say, by the members of this Chamber. I prove my statement in this way - that the moment it was known that two senators had joined the Ministry, which was pledged to this measure, those who were interested in checking off the lists of probable opponents and supporters of the Bill, instantly placed those two senators amongst its supporters. </para>

I do not desire to throw any warmth of feeling into the discussion. I wish honorable senators to accept my assurance that during the recess I honestly sought as far as I could to reconsider the whole position in reference to the railway and the survey. I recognised the extreme difficulty a man has in disjasspciating' . himself from any view which he has strongly advocated, and in freeing himself from the opinions of those with whom he has been closely connected. But, nevertheless, I did honestly and sincerely make the effort. I tried to get all the evidence in reference to the case. I imagined that I was in the position of a judge, as, of course, every one of us in fact is. Therefore, I went through the evidence again in order to see whether there were, perhaps, some little matters to which I had attached too much importance, and others upon which I had not laid sufficient stress. I came to the conclusion that there are two questions concerned in the proposal before us, which grade themselves in this way : First, was there any Federal obligation, and, second, if there was a Federal obligation, were we entering upon it in a businesslike manner? Now, I shall ask the Senate to bear with me while I give my reasons for my answers to both of those questions. We are told first of all that the proposal before us is merely for a survey. I should like to show honorable senators why, in my opinion, if we vote for a survey, it must be recognised at once that we acknowledge that the construction of the line itself is a' Federal obligation, a Federal duty. It will be utterly absurd for honorable senators to vote for the survey if some other authority is to carry out the construction of the railway. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly. I do not say for a moment that if we vote for a survey we shall be pledged to carry out the line. But does any one suppose that this Survey Bill would have been brought forward if it were ultimately intended that South Australia and Western Australia should construct the railway ? The division upon this Bill will, I say, have to be registered, whether we like it or not, as "an intimation that in the opinion of the Senate the construction of the railway is a Federal obligation. I want to show why, in my opinion, there is no Federal obligation to construct it. I shall do so because of one or two interjections which have fallen from honorable senators who seem to be under the impression that the Federation is an authority which has power to build railways for defence purposes. I do not ' propose to quote the section, as honorable senators are fairly familiar with it. But the terms of that section show that we have absolutely no power to construct .railways even for defence purposes unless we get the sanction of the States affected. In other words, all that the Constitution does is to bar the Federation absolutely and expressly from entering upon railway  construction  unless it first obtains the sanction of the States concerned. Before the Constitution empowers the Federation to construct, it gives the States an opportunity, to frustrate our intention. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. If the Constitution throws no obligation upon us the onus is upon those who support this Bill to show cause why we should take a wide  departure, both from the Constitution, and from that path which has been clearly marked out by those who framed the Constitution, by entering upon this big undertaking. " I was surprised yesterday to hear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> that he thought that it was an obligation on the opponents of this measure to show why it should not be passed. Surely it is an extraordinary position that we who oppose this Bill should be called upon to show cause why it should not be carried. Imagine a Minister of the Crown throwing a Bill upon the table, and saying, " There is a Bill ; I call upon you to show why it should not be passed." The argument means - if it means anything - that the onus is upon the opponents of any proposition to dispute it : not upon those who propose  it to support it. May I also allude - and I do so with a measure of regret - to references which have been made frequently, by way of interjection, to the sugar bounties ? I deplore those interjections, because it almost seems as if there is in the minds of those honorable senators who make them the suggestion of an idea that the members of the Senate should reciprocate in regard, to matters which are of benefit to their States. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. It is almost an admission that those who voted for the sugar bounties did so, not because they were, part of a national policy - that of a White Australia - but were using that great national cry as a means of giving a bribe to the large State of Queensland. I say with regard to the sugar bounties, and the duties connected with them, that those who supported them did so as part of a great national policy, and that it was a mere geographical accident that Queensland was the State most immediately affected. I should have liked to hear some of those honorable senators who have made the interjections to which 1 have referred tell their electors that they voted for the sugar bounties, not because they were necessary to the policy - of a White Australia, in which they professed so earnestly, to believe. In my opinion, nothing could tend more strongly to degrade Parliamen't. and lower the reputation of honorable senators than to create the conviction that great matters of policy have been supported, not for national purposes, but for the furthering of sectional ends. I come now to the only two reasons which I have been able to discover for the introduction of this Bill. First, that there was an- implied promise to Western Australia, and, second, the advantage of the railway to the Commonwealth from the point of view of defence. I say that if any promise has been given, it must- be redeemed, regardless of the cost. I make no qualification at all, as some honorable senators have done, but I say that if the representatives of Western Australia can show that they have a genuine <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> claim for the construction of this railway by the Commonwealth, then, regardless of whether it would go through desert country or the most fertile land, and whatever the consequences, the Commonwealth Parliament must carry out the bargain. But I naturally ask for proofs of the undertaking. It is not. sufficient in ordinary commercial life that a man should come along and say to me, " You owe me something." I naturally would ask him for proof of the debt. In the same  way.  I wish to know how this alleged debt to Western Australia was created. So far as I can see, the proof rests upon the very intangible basis of a few individual statements of persons who were certainly prominent public men. </para>

                            <para>- Then we are told that a gentleman who repudiates the whole matter when it suits him can bind the Federation to a promise he made to Western Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder, however, is the gentleman to whose statements in this connexion I think we are all agreed the most importance should be attached. He was Premier of the State which, next to Western Australia, was most immediately concerned, the State which held, as it were, the key to the problem in its hands, seeing that it could give or refuse its consent to the construction of the line. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder certainly gave an unqualified promise, without reference to route or gauge or condition of any kind, that he would take steps to secure the legislative sanction of his State to the construction of the line. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is quite right. I was thinking at the moment of conditions with respect to route and gauge. What I am saying is not to be understood in any way as a reflection upon <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder, whose position in the matter is, I think, perfectly defensible. My desire now is simply to draw attention to the flimsy nature of the ground on which this claim that a promise has been given is erected. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder certainly did, so far as a Premier could do so, pledge his State <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the matter, and it is not his fault that the pledge has not been redeemed. </para>

The honorable senator has shown how absolutely intangible is a Ministerial promise. He has shown by his interjection that he would not attach the slightest importance to the statement of a Minister of the Crown until it had received parliamentary sanction. Let me remind the Senate that it has been said' that in consequence of the letters to which I have referred, the people of Western Australia practically unanimously accepted it as a fact that the Commonwealth would construct the railway. I ask honorable senators to say what was the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vosper</inline> in that State. He was for a time a prominent leader of the Federal movement. He then deserted the Federal party, and joined the anti-Bill party. Why? Because he said it was not clear to him that Western Australia was to get the railway. That was the reason he gave for severing his connexion with the party that was fighting for the Commonwealth Bill, and taking the lead of the party opposing it. It must be quite evident, therefore, that the people of Western Australia were not unanimously of opinion that any moral obligation to build the railway would be cast upon the Commonwealth. I take it that a majority of those who voted for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vosper</inline> accepted the views to which he gave expression, and declined to believe that any obligation to construct the railway was being entered into. I venture to say that the people of Western Australia from end to end of that State, were informed of the view of this matter which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vosper</inline> took. </para>

                    <para>What then becomes of the claim that there was a moral understanding when you, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> admit that certain representatives of the States, although they have been parliamentarians, and more or less closely associated with the Federal movement, come new to this question, and had to come to the Federal Parliament to learn about the alleged understanding. This is absolutely giving away the. whole case that any promise was made. I can sincerely say that, until I came into this chamber, I never heard the slightest hint that the Commonwealth was in any way called upon even to consider the question of the trans continental railway. So far as statements of th;s kind are concerned, I wonder what would be the attitude of my honorable friends from Western Australia, and of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> also, if I came here and said that in New South Wales there was an understanding, based upon statements made by public men, that, although the Federal Parliament was to meet in Melbourne, the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth was to be Sydney ? They would laugh at me. But, as a matter of fact, the people of New South Wales were informed, on the strength of counsel's opinion obtained by the State Government, that, under the Constitution, there was no provision for a Seat of Government of the Commonwealth being in Melbourne, and only for the meeting of Parliament here, and that, as- the Seat of Government had to be in New South Wales, the Seat of Government could only be in Sydney  until the Seat of Government was finally determined. I venture to say that quite a number of the people of Sydney, in their guileless innocence, believed that statement, and, in consequence, voted at the referendum for the Commonwealth Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I did not vote for the Bill. If I were to make such a suggestion to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> he might very rightly say, " You Sydney people may have befooled yourselves with that idea, but we in Victoria never heard of it, and were no parties to any such bargain;" and he would dismiss the suggestion at once. In the same  way, in this case a number of public men, desiring to bring Federation about, certainly wrote these letters1 and held out these alluring promises to the people of Western Australia, and they had the desired result. If any of my honorable friends indulge in fishing, they will know what "burley " is, and I say that in this case a considerable amount of political burley was thrown about. That this was so is evident upon an inspection of the dates of the letters on which the advocates of the railway rely. They will be found to be so closely together as to suggest a common initiative. I say that they had a common origin, inasmuch as they were replies to letters received from Western Australia, practically inviting those expressions of opinion for purely electioneering purposes, and they succeeded. I have said that I cannot ' conceive of any promise having been made  that is at all binding upon the States, however much it may bind individuals. But if we assume that such a promise was made, where do we stand then? If such a promise was made, it must be admitted that it was on the understanding that South Australia was an unconditionally consenting party, because, at that time, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder had unconditionally agreed, so far as he was concerned, and on behalf of South Australia. Surely it cannot be contended that the Commonwealth was pledged to the construction of this line without knowing what terms South Australia might subsequently seek to impose? It is absurd to suggest that any person would give such a pledge without knowing the conditions which would be exacted by South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- They were written on the eve of the vote on the Commonwealth Bill in Western Australia, and written with an obvious purpose. But, assuming, for the sake of argument, that the promise was made, I say that it was given on the understanding that South Australia was consenting unconditionally, because that was <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder'g attitude. Now that South Australia seeks to impose conditions, surely if on behalf of the Commonwealth an understanding was arrived at with Western Australia, we have also the right to reconsider our position. I wish to say a word or two more about the, to me; incomprehensible attitude of South Australia. We had first of all <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder unconditionally pledging himself to ask his State to do a certain thing. A little later we had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins</inline> agreeing to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder's proposal, but insisting upon stipulations as to the route of the line. On the11th June, 1901, he stipulated that the line should go from 40 to 60 miles north of Eucla. That was the first hint we had of any future trouble arising from the attitude of that State. A little later, we had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins</inline> writing to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth to say that it was useless to go on. Why? We had the further information supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> who was then leading the Government in the Senate, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins</inline> had counted heads, and found it useless to go on. I think that, in the same correspondence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins</inline> made a woeful admission. He had been reminded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> of the fact that South Australia had failed to redeem her pledge, and he sought to get out of his difficulty in an absolutely discreditable way. He said - </para>

                            <para>- It makes no difference to me whether he was a Conservative, a Radical, or a member of the Socialist Party; the sentiment contained in that answer is not a credit to any one occupying the position of Premier. I shall draw attention later on to the effect which that statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins</inline> ought to have upon our present procedure. As we go along we find the attitude of South Australia still further stiffening. First of all she gave an unconditional assent. Then she made a stipulation as to route, and then as to both route and gauge, and finally we were absolutely told upon the authority of ex-Senator Playford that she would demand a certain route. </para>

How am I to judge the attitude of South Australia except by those few South Australians who have ventured to unbosom themselves ? I have been waiting for some insight to the working of the South Australian mind, but so far the one thing I have noticed, not only on this occasion, but previously, has been the masterly silence which has marked my South Australian friends, who are not usually troubled with that complaint. </para>

                            <para>- Once more, the honorable senator is giving his case away. There is, then, something in reserve. He is holding something back. I am very much obliged to him for that statement. It means that these South Australians are not to be drawn. They throw down in the most frank and open fashion the ace and the two bowers, but I ask them where they have got the joker. It is quite possible that my honorable friends are masterly enough even to have two jokers. Passing from these promises, I come to the statement that this is only a Survey Bill. Whilst there  might be a great deal in that contention if it came from those who support it only as a Survey Bill, it certainly comes in an extraordinary fashion from those who rest upon the implied promise. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> yesterday became quite eloquent, almost impassioned, in his oratory about the consummation of Federation, the creation of nationhood, the completion of this great Commonwealth of ours, and the solemnity of the compact entered into. What was the compact? Was it a survey? If he were present now, I should ask him whether he accepts this Bill as a satisfaction of the promise upon which he relies. </para>

I am dealing with those who say, "We support this Bill because a promise was given," and yet immediately turn round and say, " It is only a survey." Every man who' votes for this Bill casts a vote in support of the theory that the ultimate construction of the line is a Federal obligation. I will take, simply as an illustration of the attitude of other honorable senators, the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray.</inline> He said he was going to vote for this Bill because he thought the Federation was under a moral obligation to Western Australia. What was that moral obligation? If there was any at all, it was an obligation to construct the railway. Therefore, there was no moral obligation to make a survey. The survey was never mentioned.

                            <para>- It affects a considerable number of members in this Parliament, who are going to vote for this Bill, and are trying to quieten their consciences by saying that it is only a Bill for a survey. That attitude is absolutely irreconcilable with the position taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John.</inline> Forrest, ex- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Staniforth</inline> Smith, and other representatives of Western Australia, that a vote for this Bill is a recognition by Parliament of an obligation to go on with the work when the survey is completed. The other argument that has been advanced is the necessity of the line for defence. Before dealing with that aspect, I call the attention of honorable senators to the fact that I am not dealing with the merits of the proposal. I have discarded that, because I think it is generally recognised that it has no merits worthy of occupying <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> attention of this or any other deliberative assembly. </para>

                            <para>- No supporter of the Bill has ventured to do more than offer arc apology for the country through which the line will go. The best that has been said for it is that it is not as bad as its opponents make out. The only sources from which. I can get my information are the reports which have been, tabled here, and they disclose the most absolutely flatly contradictory statements. In one case, the engineers have formed an estimate of revenue on the assumption that all the cattle required for the gold-fields in Western Australia will be trucked at Port Augusta. Vet in another report we are told that the line will go through 20,000,000 acres of first-class grazing land. Is it intended to travel the cattle from that immense area back to Port Augusta merely to give them the pleasure of a longer ride on the railway ? The same thing applies to other references by . honorable senators who have spoken of the probable traffic in eggs, poultry, and hay from South Australia to  the West. One of two things is clear. Either this railway will go through fairly good country, in which case the freights from Port Augusta will fall, because there will be less produce carried from there, or, if the estimate of probable revenue is to be maintained, it can only be on the assumption that the railway will go through unproductive country. In view of contradictions of that kind, no one is in a position to affirm that the line has any attractiveness. I dismiss it by saying that it is absolutely wanting in merits, and, therefore, I have not approached it in that way. The engineers, in framing their estimates of freights and charges, have gone on the assumption that the present rates for water carriage will be maintained, but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> pointed out, it must be obvious that the moment a competitor enters the field freights on sea-borne produce will fall. I have it on the very best authority - that of a gentleman whose knowledge in shipping matters will pass unchallenged in this Chamber - that at all times, and in all circumstances, goods can be carried by water for one-eighth of the cost of carriage by land. My authority is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> who- made that statement during the last debate on this Bill. To show the folly of expecting railway carriage to compete with water carriage, the engineers, in their estimate, actually provided that the coal required for the railway should go to Eucla by sea. Very probably it will have to. It means that the railway will find it cheaper to employ its competitor to carry its own goods. If the railway cannot carry its own goods economically, how can it carry those of other people? We are asked to believe that, although the railway will employ the sea for the carriage of its own commodities, other people will pay the higher freights demanded by it. I return now to the question of defence. This represents the only sound reason why the proposal might occupy Federal attention. The following statement, by ex-Senator Playford, puts the matter in a nut-shell -  </para>

                    <para>I need hardly draw the attention of honorable senators to the commentary that remark offers upon the alleged promise from South Australia. The defence aspect seems to me the one ground on which we may reasonably be asked to consider this proposal. But is a survey necessary to determine whether a line is required for defence purposes ? Surely that question should be determined without reference to surveying or engineering difficulties. If the line is . put forward as a defence proposition, the Commonwealth military authorities ought to come forward and say that it is wanted, and the Government should state - " Acting, on the advice of experts, we have determined, for strategical purposes, that this line shall be constructed. We intend to construct it, and we ask you for authority to carry out the survey." They do not do anything of the kind. They are going to make a survey whether the line is required for defence purposes or not. The thing is utterly ridiculous. The military authorities do not need a survey to know whether the line is required for defence purposes. If it is required we should be told so, but we are not told so. No one ventures to say that it is necessary. </para>

                            <para>- He said that we could not consider the defence of Australia complete until there was a line from Port Darwin and Fremantle to the southern and eastern State's respectively. Yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> O'Loghlin  interjected, " You ignore defence." Surely that was a strange interjection from the honorable senator when we recall the attitude of his State. The one State which has ignored defence in this matter is South Australia. Practically she says to the Commonwealth, " You can have Australia defended on a 3 ft. 6 in. gauge, but we shall not allow it to be defended on a 4 ft. 8 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> in. gauge. We shall allow Australia to be defended by one route, but we will see Australia raided from end to end rather than allow it to be protected by the route which we do not want." I do not know of a finer' opening for the missionaries from Western Australia to spread the Federal spirit than that which exists in South Australia. If we are to deal with this question at all from the stand-point of defence, I submit, for the serious consideration of honorable senators, whether it would not be far better to spend an equivalent sum in the development of a navy for Australia. That navy would be available for the defence of every port in Australia, whilst the most that can be said for the railway is that it might help in the defence of one portion only. Assuming that it is decided to go on with the project, I want to know whether we are asked to proceed in the best possible way. We- have absolutely no legal authority for the work which we are undertaking. Even the passage of the Bill- will not give us legal authority to enter South Australia. Not even the permission of the State Premier can give us a legal standing. The first time that a Commonwealth surveyor or employe ventured to put a foot on private property in the State he would be liable to be prosecuted for trespass. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator may be speaking for Victoria, but he is not speaking for New South Wales. While that may be done here under a general power by the State Government, he must remember that the Constitution distinctly makes any trespass by the Federation illegal, unless it is made with the sanction of the State concerned. We have no sanction from South Australia. I am not suggesting that it is likely that trouble will occur, but only pointing out unbusinesslike methods. Having regard to the warning of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins,</inline> that no promise would, be binding unless embodied in a Bill or resolution- of the Parliament of South Australia, we ought to have reminded the Government of the State of that declaration, and called upon them to give us a legal status in carrying out the survey. There is another unbusiness-like  procedure which we are asked to sanction. We are invited to vote ,£20.000 for the inspection of two railway routes, while South Australia has emphatically said that she will sanction only one route. One 'of two things should be done. Either we should limit our inspection to the route which South Australia will sanction, or we should come to terms with that State regarding the route which at present they do not favour. That, I think, is the course we would pursue in our personal affairs. If I wanted to carry out a certain undertaking, and had to deal with somebody else, I certainly should not spend money until I had arrived at an understanding with that party. But here we are asked to spend money to carry out a survey, or an inspection, or an exploration, knowing full well, so far as we can judge at present, that South Australia will not sanction that one route. </para>

                    <para class="block">Pearce to be an impartial judge of the railway to Western Australia any more than he would probably expect me to be absolutely impartial on the matter of the Federal Capital. We all recognise that our personal opinions do warp our judgment. It is quite to be expected that Western Australians, acting conscientiously, would consider one clause in the agreement of so great value that they would be inclined to ignore objectionable features in it elsewhere. I think that remark can be made without casting a reflection upon those honorable senators. In conclusion, I desire to warn my honorable friends of the financial position into which the Federation is likely to be hurried if we are not very careful. I have heard some references to the Federal spirit. Surely it is not unreasonable to ask those who appeal to the Federal spirit to remember the financial necessities of the weaker States. It is all very well to invoke the Federal spirit when we want something to be done, but ' surely it must also be invoked when we are asked to give something? Whatever may be the natural ambitions of Western Australia. I feel that I am bound to consider the financial position of Tasmania. I do not think that the financial question troubles New South Wales, and, so far as public opinion is concerned, I have not the remotest idea what view it takes on the subject. Sena?torially its representatives are equally divided. So far as I know the press of my State is about equally divided, and therefore I. feel that in this matter I can enter up judgment free from any State sympathies. We have, however, to consider the financially weak State of Tasmania. I should feel much more inclined to look upon this proposal with kindly eyes, to believe in the sincerity of the appeal to the Federal spirit, if Western Australia had shown any willingness to agree to a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system with regard to old-age pensions. </para>

                            <para>- I was never in favour of the land tax of my honorable friend. I think I am correct in saying that no one has been more strenuous than the interjector iri the advocacy of the principle that, where a public work is carried out, private landlords ought not to secure the incremental value that follows. What is the proposition here? Is there any proposition to secure to the Commonwealth any incremental value? No. The whole of it is to go to the individual State. </para>

                            <para>- I am surprised that my honorable friends, who, I believe, are  firmly  and conscientiously in favour of taking all that value for public purposes, have, not taken any precaution to insure if the Commonwealth is to build the railway that it shall receive the benefits of the expenditure. I believe that the railway ought to be constructed. I expect that it will come in time. I also consider that there ought to be a railway to Port Darwin, but I hold that, before the Federation is asked to consider either one or the other, it should know fully how it stands with regard to the Northern Territory. It ought to be able to enter untrammelled into possession of the Northern Territory if it is to take it over. And, having done that, it could reasonably consider what railway policy it is in a position to carry out. But at the present time we are asked, before we know what our relationship to the Northern Territory is to be to tie our hands, to commit ourselves to the proposition to run a railway to the West before we know what our obligation will be in regard to the North. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ST.</inline>LEDGER (Queensland) {4.13]. - As a new member of the Senate, and as the question under consideration is a very important one, I think it is only a proper courtesy, both to the question, and also to the great State of Western Australia, that I should give my reasons for voting against this proposal. I had intended to give a silent vote, in accordance with- the opinion I had expressed during the elections in Queensland, but I have thought better of my resolution. What has changed the current of my thought is entire respect for the great State of Western Australia, and a certain amount of respect for the aspiration to obtain such a railway. I confess that whilst I have been waiting earnestly to hear a reason why I could support them, if possible, in that aspiration, I have gone through a succession of .mists, each one darker than the other. I regret exceedingly that the darkest mist in the whole matter hangs about the attitude of South Australia. I have been waiting patiently to hear its honorable senators speak with a certain amount of authority as to what is to be the relation between their State and the Commonwealth on this very important question. I hope that they will be able to throw greater light on the subject. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is not present, because, while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was speaking, he made an interjection to the effect that he was not to be drawn. The inference is that South Australia is concealing something. If the inference is unfair or improper, its representatives are largely to blame, because they are remaining silent on this most important question. </para>

                        <para>- I was not here to hear the honorable senator, but I am willing to get light. It is remarkable that every representative of the State which has the key to the position so far as construction is concerned has remained silent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> from Queensland, showed clearly the indecision and the haze which South Australia' is throwing over the question. By a reference to history, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has just pointed out the indecision and confusion in the position of that State. Honorable senators on both sides of the Chamber who are opponents of the Bill have dealt with the same aspect of the matter, and in their state of haze and indecision the senators for South Australia persist in remaining silent. It may be that, because these matters have been discussed before, there is no necessity to refer to them again. But a considerable number of new senators have since been elected, and their opinions and votes are worth something. I will refer to the constitutional question which has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and incidentally by myself when supporting the point of order taken on the introduction of this Bill last Friday. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointed out that the position of the surveyors who may be instructed to enter the State of South Australia on behalf of the Federal Government will be that of trespassers. I indorse that opinion for what it is worth. Undoubtedly, they can be treated as trespassers, because the Executive authority under which they will act is not sufficient to warrant Commonwealth officers in entering upon privately-owned land. We cannot shelter ourselves by pleading Executive authority, because the private owner may say, " I do not care two straws ; you can only enter my property under die authority of an Act of Parliament." He can either tell, our officers to clear off dr treat them as trespassers. I hope ' that the South Australian senators will not consider the remark too harsh when I say chat, after reading the history of this great question from both sides, it appears to me that their State is playing a game very much like that of Br'er  Rabbit. . If I were a supporter of the Bill, I should consider that I had reason to ask for the greatest frankness and confidence on the part of the representatives of South Australia. The South Australian Government is in duty bound to make its position absolutely clear before we take one step in the matter of the survey. We have been reminded from time to time by supporters of the Bil] that the question ought not to be treated in a parochial spirit. An appeal to that effect has been repeatedly made to us by the Western Australian senators. I should not have alluded to the point had not the question of the sugar bounty been dragged in also. Personally, I deprecate the introduction of parochialism in Commonwealth affairs, but I cannot help entertaining a feeling of resentment against the  spirit  of parochialism shown by the. Western Australian representatives, and especially by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, who, until lately, was the Western Australian member of the Cabinet, when, in the matter of the mail contract, Queensland was utterly ignored, and no provision was made for the mail steamers calling at her principal port. I do not remember that the Western Australian members of the House of Representatives, the Western Australian senators, or the Western Australian member of the Cabinet were induced by the Federal spirit to demand that any of the benefits accruing under the mail contract should be extended to Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- Whatever benefit the service was to Queensland, we bore the whole cost of it, with some aid, perhaps, from New South Wales. I do not intend to allow the honorable senator, however, to side-track me in reference to the Vancouver mail service. The Western. Australian senators have appealed to us, as Queenslanders, to vote for this Bill, on the ground that Queensland derives benefit from the sugar bounty. I resent the throwing of the bounty in our teeth. I throw it back, and ask them why, when Queensland was the orphan of the Federation, and was left out of consideration in connexion with the mail service, the1 Western Australians gave us none of their assistance, notwithstanding their strong belief in the Federal spirit? I should not have made this remark except for the taunts of the Western Australians, because I do not wish to import into the discussion of this question the slightest element of bitterness. The argument is frequently advanced; that we should support the survey, because an implied promise was made to Western Australia, either before she entered the Federation or afterwards. So far as Queensland is concerned, I am bound to say that she, at any rate, had nothing whatever to do with any bargain at the Convention. Queensland was not represented there, and had nothing to do with the framing of the Constitution. Perhaps that was our misfortune. We entered Federation after the Constitution had been adopted. We entered it unconditionally. The. argument of implication therefore cannot apply to us, and I am bound to dismiss it from my. mind in weighing the question whether I shall support this Bill. The argument is frequently advanced by the Western Australian senators, backed to some extent by the South Australians, that in voting for the survey, we shall not pledge -ourselves to vote for the construction of the line. But I agree entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> that if we vote for the survey, we shall be absolutely pledged to its construction. There will be no possibility for honorable men to get out of that position if the reports of the surveyors are favorable. I heartily desire that if the survey is made, it may be shown that the interior of Western Australia contains country that gives hope of future development. Supposing that to be the case, and that the reports of the surveyors are favorable, how could any honorable man,, having said that he would vote for the survey, refuse to vote for the construction of the line? That being so, what is the liability to which the Commonwealth will be committed? It amounts to at least £5,000,000. How are Tasmania, and Queensland to bear their share of that expenditure? Queensland, at any rate/ requires for her own development all the money that she can reasonably exact from her citizens. I shall show by a few figures how much Queensland has done, and, with great respect to Western Australia,, how little that State is trying to do, in order to develop her territory. Further, this question was discussed very intelligently and repeatedly in the State of Queensland at the elections, and each one of us was asked, "What position will you take up if the proposal for a survey or for the construction of the transcontinental railway, either from South Australia to. Port Darwin or from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, is proposed?" We were asked to define our attitude. Personally, I invariably answered, " I shall not vote for it, first of all on the financial ground  that it would be wrong for South" Australia and Western Australia, separately or together, to ask the rest of the States to bear a proportionate share in the cost of a railway when every other State, in Australia has borne the burden of its own public works." On that ground I said that I would resist the appeal. I referred also to a constitutional ground, to which I direct the attention of honorable senators. I said that it was the most dangerous thing that could happen as between the State and the Commonwealth that the State should allow the Commonwealth to put its hand upon a single yard of railway construction in the State, or should allow the Federal Government to tax or interfere in any way with one foot of the soil of Queensland. I said that such a course would lead to confusion, conflict, and friction between the Federal Government and the Governments of the respective States. I took up that attitude in connexion both with suggested Federal taxation and the projected interference with State railways. I pointed out that when we agreed to the Constitution, we did so after careful consideration, and on the understanding, so far as the Constitution could- make such a thing clear, that our lands, our mines, and our railways were ours and ours alone. I pointed out that we should be setting a bad example to the rest of the States if we gave any assent to a condition which would interfere with that principle. I may further say that when the proposition Was (put  from  that point of view, it was unanimously . applauded throughout the State of Queensland, and was, I believe, one of the most potent factors in achieving a victory which was one of the most notable and marked political victories ever won in Australia. We are told 'that the proposed survey is to cost " only " £20,000. Any one who has had even a little experience of life may well have been made aware, more or less painfully, that a certain class of dealer goes round with a certain class of goods, for the most part " brummagem  " jewellery. He invites the servants, male or female, of the household, to believe that by purchasing from him. they will get something in the form of jewellery which would be the envy of a duchess, and which will cost " only " 3d. or 4d. per week. He dwells very strongly upon the " only " aspect of his transaction. I am inclined to think that there is something of a " brummagem  " appeal to us to vote this money, when it is prefaced with a remark that it is " only " £20,000. The whole question is in a nut-shell. If the proposed survey is to be made through a rich territory, then certainly Western Australia should make the survey' and build the railway herself, just as the other States have had to carry out their own railway construction. If this is not a rich territory, and a line through it is not likely to be remunerative, then we might just as well vote to throw the £20,000 into the Yarra. The fact that it is only £20,000, which is alleged to be comparatively a small sum, ought not to weigh with us. I' press that dilemma upon the Senate. To me there seems to be no escape for it. Assuming that the country is all that we hope it will prove to be, will some honorable senator from Western Australia or from South Australia say why those States are not prepared to build the proposed railway for themselves? If they have strong grounds to believe, from the reports which have been presented on the subject, that this territory is, as it is alleged to be, a howling and waterless desert, those who advocate the proposal are inviting the Commonwealth Parliament to follow a course of action which would be .as profitable to the Commonwealth, and to the two States specially concerned as it would be to take £20,000 and throw it into the Yarra. I wish to know exactly where honorable senators from Western Australia and South Australia desire that we should go. I invite honorable senators from Western Australia to deal with that aspect of the question. So far as Western </para>

                            <para>- It appears to me that Western Australia and, to some extent, South Australia, also, are coming to the Commonwealth asking for £20,000 to enable them to take a first step in railway construction when the other States of the Commonwealth have constructed their railways for themselves. For what reason does South Australia, and more especially Western Australia, come here again and again delaying the business of the Commonwealth with a request for a paltry grant of £20,000? What is behind this proposal ? It carries with it on the face of it a suggestion that the country through which the railway would subsequently go is known to the people' of Western Australia and South Australia to be such a worthless country that they are not prepared, either jointly or separately, to risk the expenditure of £20,000 on the survey of a route. If that be a hard inference to draw, it is one which naturally arises from the position which the representatives of those States take up when they ask for this money, in view of the fact that States having less financial strength have always done similar work for themselves- </para>

I will say with regard to it that, so far as any promise, direct or implied, is concerned, Queensland knows nothing of it, and is absolutely out of it. She was no party by herself, or with any one else, to suggesting any condition upon which Western Australia should enter the Federation. Queensland representatives have an absolutely free hand in this matter. That State accepted Federation unconditionally, and was no party to any promise to Western Australia, direct or implied, and is under no obligation whatever to Western Australia, or to any other State in the Union. </para>

                            <para>- Queensland is wholly free from any implication in the promise alleged to have been made. Western Australia may have some reason in appealing to the letters written by the present Prime Minister, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> and the other Premiers mentioned, but no such appeal can be addressed to the representatives of Queensland. I have tried to find out why this appeal should come so repeatedly from Western Australia, and it occurred to me that perhaps the people of that State are unable to do for themselves what the people of Queensland have done. I instituted as nearly as I could a comparison between the two States when each had about the same population. We had in Queensland, in 1880, about the same population that Western Australia has to-day. In speaking of the financial position of a State I take into consideration the factors of population, debts, revenue, and trade. These are the essential elements, establishing the financial strength or weakness of any country. Western Australia today has a population of about 250,000.  Her  debt is about £17,000,000.  Her  revenue for 1905-6 was £1,800,000. </para>

                            <para>- It does not matter whether the trade was in wool, gold, or copper ; it is part of the wealth, and hence part of the financial strength of the country. I must confess that when I found the figures for exports and imports going up to between £17,000,000 and <inline font-style="italic">j£.iS,</inline> 000, 000 for a population of 250,000, it .struck me that there could scarcely be on earth a more wealthy people. There is not in Australia, and I do not think we could find in the whole world another population of 250,000 doing an annual trade of nearly £18,000,000. I have no wish to pay a compliment to Western Australia which I do not feel is deserved. I have spoken strongly of the attitude which representatives of that State in the Senate have taken up, and I wish honorable senators to understand that I speak just as sincerely when I say that I think that one of the greatest States in the Commonwealth is the State of Western Australia. Taking into view all the possibilities of its . future, I regard it as one of the strongest States in the whole Empire. If there is one that can approach, and possibly rival it, it is my own State of Queensland. There is every indication in the progress and development of Western Australia and Queensland that, with sound government and the blessing of Providence, it will not be long before those States stand in the front rank of the States of the Commonwealth, and States which are now regarded as comparatively strong will have become insignificant as compared with those two States in the history of the Federation. That being so, it seems to me that Western Australian senators, as well as the State Government of Western Australia, do not take up a very dignified position, and pay but a very poor compliment to their State, when they come here and ask the Federation, which has control of only one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue, to vote them £20,000. </para>

                            <para>- I am relying on the accuracy of my figures. I took some trouble to compile them, and I am happy to compliment Western Australia on its sound financial position. Now, what was the position of Queensland when that State had a population about equal to the .present population of Western Australia? In 1880 the population of Queensland was not  quite 230,000. Her debt was ^"16, 000,000 ; her revenue only about £1,612,000, and the total annual value of her export and import trade only £6,000,000. She was financially not nearly so strong at that time as Western Australia is to-day, and yet, with comparatively few miles of railway constructed, and doubtful as to how the State could be developed, the people of Queensland set to work and incurred expenditure, running the debt up to £30,000,000 odd in order to build railways for the development of the country. </para>

                            <para>- One of the soundest tests is to measure the wealth of a country by its exports and imports, and to ascertain, if you can, what it is manufacturing. On that standard, which is fairly reliable, although <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> do not say it is infallible, Western Australia to-day is in an infinitely better position than was Queensland in 1880. We, in Queensland, did not fear to plunge into expenditure to develop our country. We incurred a considerable debt for that purpose, and we made such sacrifices that Ministry after Ministry was brought" down with accumulating deficits. But, fortunately, our best and most farseeing men said, " We have plunged very deeply into expenditure, but we have confidence in the resources of our country, and we ask you, the people of Queensland, to make these sacrifices." The result to-day is that we. have one of the finest railway systems of the world, considering our wealth and population, and that almost every penny of expenditure which brought down Government after Government is now being justified.- It was thought madness at the time to construct those railways in what was considered desert country out in the west, but, through them to-day, especially in good seasons, we are able to show the people of our own State and of the Commonwealth that we have one of the finest territories on God's earth. </para>

It may be through defective power in the presentment of the proposition, or it may be through an inability to comprehend it on the part of those to whom it is addressed. I shall not try to apportion the defect. I simply stated what appeared to my mind to be very strong facts and' figures. There is an old Scotch saying, that " Facts are chiefs that winna ding." I do not think Western Australian and South Australian senators who address themselves to this question will get very much " ding " out of the facts that I am giving. </para>

                            <para>- LEDGER.- The honorable senator can easily find it out for himself. I have not gone into . the question of the cost of construction of the railway, or whether it would pay or not, because that is practically beside the question, and we have been repeatedly asked by Western Australian and South Australian senators not to deal with that aspect of the matter, but to regard the Bill as a mere proposal for a survey. I have also carefully refrained, in order that I might express myself from the point of view of the present position, apart from the consideration of the past, from " Hansardizing " speeches, or from delving into the reports, in deference to the strongly declared wish of Western Australia that we should not go into the merits of the railway. After the way <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has touched upon the point, it is necessary that two or three things should be done before this vote is taken. One is that we should know absolutely from the State of South Australia where we are. Any honorable senator who is in doubt has excellent reasons for his hesitation until the attitude of that State is declared. Then, again, those who have gone over to the other side, for reasons which- may be satisfactory to them, but which, after the way <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> dealt with them, must be very unsatisfactory to other honorable senators, should give absolutely and clearly the reasons for their change of opinion. I have not heard an\, reason given for it in this Chamber, except a sort of pious wish- for the well-being of Western Australia, and an apology that the amount involved is only £20,000. I do not wish to traverse the history of this matter, but I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mil</inline> len' s view. When we find politicians representing great State interests wobbling from side to side on important constitutional and financial questions, we have a right to expect the reasons for that change of opinion and conduct to be clearly stated. I blame no man for changing either his political attitude or  his opinions. There is a saying that there are only two classes who never change their opinions - idiots and the dead. I hope, as a progressive politician, that there will never be representatives of a dead-house policy in the Commonwealth Parliament. There is another suspicious feature about it, to which I, as responsible to some extent for the interests of the State of Queensland, am bound to draw attention. I am sorry the Vice-President of the Executive Council is not here. But when I find a change of opinion taking place simultaneously with accession to office, it reminds me very much of an expression in <inline font-style="italic">A Winter's Tale -</inline></para>

                    <para>Certainly the robe of office mav give colour to a man's opinions. The exigencies of the position of a Ministry may cause it to call upon its supporters at times to limit their assistance or resistance, but if, on important questions, there is change or hesitation on the part of Ministers or their supporters, we' are entitled to a frank expression of the reasons for their attitude. We have not had that in this case. It is the mark of a strong and courageous man to say, " Once I believed and voted one way. To-day  I  have changed my opinion, and, because  I have changed it, I am now voting the other way." I regret that we have had no straightforward . and manly explanation of the change of opinion that has evidently come about, both in high and low quarters - if I may use the term - inside this Senate. I have tried to give my reasons for voting against this survey in such a manner as to show the faith that is within me. I hope I have said nothing derogatory to the high respect and regard that I have for the representatives of Western Australia, or to the interests of that great State. If, apart from voting money which no other State has asked for, I can assist that great State in any way, I shall be glad to do so. There will be nobody in the Commonwealth, and certainly nobody in this Parliament, who will welcome the day more gladly than I when Western Australia can proudly say, " We are going to build that railway ; it shall be ours, and ours alone, and the Commonwealth shall have nothing to do with it." </para>

I am here to represent Western Australia, but not to represent that young State as a beggar, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger wants this Chamber to believe. That State is seeking to have certain pledges redeemed at the hands of this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I propose to enlighten the honorable senator before I finish as to what was said by representative Australians. I am here, not representing Western Australia as a beggar, but rather representing it as a State that has contributed, and still purposes to contribute, very substantially to the material interests and prosperity of the eastern States, although we have little hope of -receiving any <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> for a long time. I resent the term which was so unworthily and unjustifiably used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger. I hope to prove before I have finished that Western Australia has taken a most disinterested stand in bringing about the' consummation of Federation, knowing as it did at the same time that it would result in the achievement of a policy of which the State which the honorable senator represents would share to the full the biggest advantage. I do not believe that even the honorable senator's own colleagues agree with him when he applies to our young State the reproachful epithet of. "beggar." I wish to refer to the extraordinary tactics to which the opponents of this measure are sometimes driven. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> made special reference to the necessity for keeping this question free from party politics, and yet he went very close to stating, if he did not , actually do so, that those who are supporting the Bill invariably took advantage of the state of political parties in order to accomplish their object. </para>

                            <para>- That is certainly the impression which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> sought to leave in the minds of other honorable senators. However, he is silent on the subject, and that is significant. I do not wish to go into many preliminaries, because I recognise that our opponents do not desire the history of this project to be too closely examined or ventilated. They are well aware of the tactics which have been resorted to in order to secure its defeat, and the most merciful thing I can do is to draw a veil of forgetfulness over them. I shall now proceed to analyze the action of the Senate. For the fourth time, the other House has passed this Bill. On the last occasion, it was passed by thirty-two ayes to nine noes. It comes up to the Senate, and, of course, the usual inveterate hostility is offered to it. The Senate purports to be as representative of public feeling as is the other House. It is often called the States House in the sense that it is capable of looking at questions in a broader and more patriotic light than is the other House. A proposal of a national character has been placed before the other House, and agreed to four times. If we compare the vote to be cast here with the vote which was recorded in the other Chamber, I submit that, instead of receiving, as I have every . confidence it will receive, a substantial majority, the measure should receive a still more substantial majority, equivalent to at least ten votes. In the other House, .the voting on the last occasion was thirty-two ayes to nine noes. If we assume - and it is not an extravagant assumption - that the remaining thirty-four members would vote in ratio of the forty-one members who did vote, we should , havé in that House  58.5  ayes to  16.5  noes. And in the Senate, which has coequal powers, and which is supposed to be an equally faithful exponent of public feeling, we should have a vote equivalent to twenty-eight ayes to eight noes. On the present occasion, I believe we shall have a majority, but not the majority which we should have, if the Senate lived up to the expectations which were indulged in at the outset- </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not. I am not using this as a conclusive argument, but merely to show that on a proposal of this character, which even its opponents will recognise has national qualities, the other House, which is considered to represent smaller component parts of the Commonwealth, has recorded an overwhelming majority in its favour. That leads me to ask seriously whether the Senate is living up to the expectations of the people in displaying a steady hostility to the measure? I venture to say, in all truthfulness, that the opponents of the Bill are less concerned about the effect it will have on the national prosperity of the Continent than about the immediate effect it will have upon the finances of their States, as is indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> when he refers to Tasmania's share of the cost -  £900.  I believe, however, that the division will show that we have not yet arrived at that pass that when- a question of national import is about to be discussed and settled, each representative of a State wants to know whether or not it will be wronged out of twopence halfpenny or threepence before he will proceed to deal with a proposal of a Federal character and of far-reach- ' king importance. In Western Australia, we have not considered our own financial position before considering the effect which the enactment of certain proposals would have on the progress and prosperity of the Commonwealth. By paragraph xxxiv., of section  51,  of the Constitution, the Commonwealth is invested with the right to construct railways. I suppose that the opponents of this measure will not contend that that provision" was put in for no purpose ; even my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> in his wildest moments, will not assume that position. Evidently, it was inserted after it had passed through the fire of a lengthy discussion at the hands of the representatives of every State. We are entitled to say that it was intended that the Commonwealth, somehow or other, should put the provision into operation. </para>

                            <para>- A great deal of discussion has centred round the question of the national character of this project. I believe that if we . can prove that it is of a national character we shall succeed in getting even my honorable friend's vote. How are we to judge whether it is a national projector not? If we want to acquaint ourselves with the quality of a proposal, we naturally refer to an adept skilled in a particular trade or calling, closely allied to the matter under discussion. Prior to Federation, some responsible public men ' recorded their opinion in favour of this being a national project, and, therefore, if is not rash to assume that it must be national, or, if it is not admitted that it is national, that that aspect of the matter is arguable. Amongst the foremost public men of the time was Charles Cameron Kingston, who, I think, is as great an authority on national matters as is any member -of this Parliament. Writing to the Premier of Western Australia in 1899, he said - </para>

                    <para class="block">Having regard to the views of these statesmen, it is the safest thing in the world to say that this project is of a national character. As far as we in the West are concerned, it cannot be denied that we look upon the construction of this railway as being a part of the Federal scheme. We regarded it as being even as essential a part of the Federal scheme as the bi-cameral system, or the judicature. We considered that there could be no true Federation until the West was connected by railway with the East. We were led to support Federation on the promise of prominent politicians that one of the public works that would be carried out after the 'Commonwealth was got under way would be the building of this line. 1 well remember that in the year 1899, when the question of Federation was  very keenly canvassed throughout Western Australia, the feeling in the minds of the people- was that we should accept the Commonwealth Bill, and trust the Federal Parliament in respect of the railway. I distinctly remember a meeting held at Boulder, one of the most important centres in the gold-fields area. The Federal question was then being ventilated, and, naturally, foremost mention was made of the early construction of this line if we placed our trust in the Federal Parliament. Some of the speakers, including myself, expressed that opinion. We were largely prompted to that belief by reason of the letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> from which I have quoted. I have referred to sacrifices. We recognised thai at that time, we had an overflowing Treasury in the West, and we saw that Federation meant a change in our fiscal system which would involve the sacrifice of those large surpluses which we had been enjoying. We saw also, that Federation would mean a loss to Western Australia in respect of her growing industries by diverting trade to the capitals of the eastern States. We were cognizant of all these probabilities, but nevertheless, we voted for Federation. One other issue was present to our minds. Up to that time, Queensland had never been able to remove what was a long-standing menace to herself and to the other States of this continent. We recognised that the White Australia policy could not be attained until Queensland received the assistance of the other States. Western Australia, therefore, entered the Federation, notwithstanding the sacrifices that it involved, largely in order to enable Queensland, for the first time, to rid herself of the black labour evil, and to establish a White Australia within our borders. We were prepared to make sacrifices in order that Australia might become white, and in order tha,t our own State might be a component part of the Union, relying upon the promises distinctly given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> and others to secure for us-, that work which would be of benefit to us and to them. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that any other State was compelled to adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston's</inline> advice or opinion, but I &lt;3o say that at that time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> was the most important figure in the public life of this country, and therefore that he was looked upon as a fairly reliable authority on this subject. If I am asked what Western Australia is prepared to sacrifice in order to secure the construction of this railway, I reply that she has already undertaken to bear a portion of the loss that would accrue upon the South Australian side, and also upon her own side; and that she has likewise agreed, in order to fall in with the wishes of the Commonwealth Parliament, to reserve an area of 25 miles on each side of the line for the use of the Commonwealth in carrying out the work. Further, it is proposed to standardize the line from Kalgoorlie to Perth, and by that means to have a gauge fitting in with existing States lines on what will, I hope, later on be the standard gauge throughout the continent - 4 ft. in. So that both in regard to land "reservation and to gauge, Western Australia has shown herself prepared to do all she can. It is not necessary to quote at great length  from the reports of the engineers, but I cannot pass over the very able report of the late Western Australian engineer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor. His</inline> reputation is not confined to his own State. He is known as a capable and painstaking officer throughout Australia. I wish to refer especially to the tables, in which he calculates the fares that will be likely to be charged upon the line, and compares them with the present steamer fares. The fare on the intercolonial steamers first class from Fremantle to Adelaide was at that time £4 ros. Now it is £6. The steerage fare was then £3. Now it is £3 10s. I wish to draw special attention to the importance of the traffic which will come to the railway from the gold-fields area, and to point out that there will be a distinct saving of time as well as of money to travellers who use the railway. On the gold-fields area, of which Kalgoorlie forms the centre, there must be about 80,000 people - that is, taking in the Leonora, Coolgardie, Mount Morgan, and Laverton districts. These people have mostly come from the eastern States, and all of them have relatives in Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, or New South Wales. It would be of great importance to them to make a saving in time as well as in cash in travelling to and fro between the gold-fields and the eastern States. At present, on the trip first class from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle, they pay £3 4s., - travelling from </para>

So that a first class passenger from Kalgoorlie to Adelaide will have a choice of routes. It will cost him  £9 4s.  to take the train to Fremantle, and then travel by boat to. Adelaide, or  £7 17s.  to travel direct from Kalgoorlie to Adelaide by train. He will therefore save in cash  £1 7s.,  and in time he will save two and a half days by taking the train. It is also to be assumed that there will be a great increase in traffic in consequence of the line being constructed. The second' class passenger at present pays  £2  for the journey from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle, and  £3 10s.  for the journey by boat from Fremantle to Adelaide - total,  £5 10s.  The journey by rail would cost him  £4 15s.  - making a saving of  15s.  in money, as well as of two and a half days in time. This prompts me to mention that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor</inline> did not put' as rosy a view of the question as after events prove that he might. Had he had before him. the in- . creased fares now being charged he might have shown that it would pay people to go from Fremantle through Kalgoorlie, and that they would save money when the time saved was considered.

                        <para>On the assumption that the present population of Western Australia will be doubled in ten years from the opening of the line, we think that it would be right to anticipate a doubling of the revenue. An investigation of the statistics of Western Australia indicates how rapid has been the progress in every direction. There is a very large movement of population between eastern and western States, which is still increasing. In the year 190a it was as follows :  - Immigrants from the eastern States,. 33,000; emigrants to the eastern States, 17,000; showing a total movement of 50,000 persons. That this movement will be encouraged by the additional facilities of railway communication cannot be doubted, and the bringing of the eastern goldfields of. Western Australia and Adelaide into nearer connexion must result in an increasing passenger traffic. Reference to the <inline font-style="italic">Monthly Statistical Abstract</inline> of January, 1903, published in Western Australia, will show that during the period from 1894 to 1902 the population increased approximately two and a half times. </para>

                    <para class="block">The report of the Engineers-in-Chief was made in  1903,  and I have referred to it in order to supplement it with a statement  of  the progress which has been made to date. I will give the population in the several States to show that, within a certain period, the increase in Western Australia has been greater than in any of the other States. In the six years from  1900  to  1906  the population in New South Wales increased by  166,000,  an increase of  12  per cent. Irb Victoria, the increase was  35,000,  or  3  per cent. ; in Queensland  41,000,  or  8  per cent.; in South Australia  21,000,  or  5  per cent. ; in Tasmania  7,000,  or  4  per cent. ;. and in Western Australia  82,000,or 46  per cent. The percentage of increase in Western Australia was the highest in the Commonwealth, and  3½  times greater than the highest percentage in New South Wales, where the increase was greater than in any of the other eastern States. In the matter of imports and exports, Western Australia also holds a high position. The increase in value for the ten years  from 1896  to  1906  being from  £8,143.783  in.  1896  to  £16,597,000  in  1906. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger gave the total as  £18,000,000,  but I could not find such a figure in any record.

                            <para>- Yes. I am giving the figures up to date. The total area of land under crops, including wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, and hay in Western Australia in  1896  was  111,000  acres, and in  1906  it was  364,000  acres, a three-fold increase in ten years. I have obtained special figures with regard to the cultivation of wheat in order that I might show that in Western Australia we have wheat lands that equal, if they do not surpass, any lands to be found in the eastern States. I give the figures for 1896-7 and 1906-7. In Western Australia, in the former year, the area under wheat was 31,489 acres, and in 1906-7 the area was 250,2.33 acres, or over eight times the area under cultivation for wheat ten years before. It is interesting to note that in New South Wales the area under wheat in 1896-7 was 866,112 acres, and in 1906-7 it was 1,866,253 acres, or over twice the area under cultivation ten years previously. In Victoria, in 1896-7, the area under wheat was 1,580,613 acres, and ten years later it was 2,031,893 acres, or a shade over one and a half times the area under wheat in the first year .mentioned. In Queensland, in 1896-7, the area under wheat was 34,670 acres, and in 1906-7 it was 114,575 acres, or over three times the area mentioned for the first year. In South Australia, in 1896-7, the area under wheat was 1,693,045 acres, and ten years later it was 1,681,982 acres. According to these returns, it would appear that South Australia did not experience a very prosperous time in wheat cultivation during the ten years referred to. In Tasmania, in 1896-7, the area under wheat was 74,516 acres, and ten years later it was only 32,808 acres, or about half the area cultivated for wheat in the former years. In this matter Western Australia again stands at the top of the list, and ic is shown that she possesses areas that can compare more than favorably with the eastern States. She had in the years mentioned increased the area under cultivation for wheat by over eight times, and the State showing the next highest increase was Queensland, with an increase of three times the area under cultivation ten years previously, but with a much smaller total area devoted to the crop. The figures taper down to twice the area in New South Wales, until we come to the unfortunate position qf Tasmania. I wish to show the productivity of Western Australia, and to disprove some of the lying statements that appear in a paper which is circulated so freely in Melbourne. Taking the average yield per acre, the true test of the fertility of the arable area of any country, we find that in Western Australia last year it was 11 bushels, in New South Wales 11. 7 bushels, in Victoria 11.1 bushels, in </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is a very poor judge. He might find himself in the position of the oriental Judge who, when the decision in a case was come to, was hanged instead of the culprit. In horned stock, the increase in Western Australia has been threefold in ten years. In horses the increase was from 57,000 to 97,000, or nearly- double; pigs, 31,000 to 77,000, more than double j and in sheep there was a substantial increase of 150 per cent. I could not get the exact figures for sheep. I come now to deal with one of the staple industries of the State, namely, the mining industry, and in connexion with it we have something satisfactory to show. The total output of the industry up to May, 1907, was 17,367,000 ounces, or over 530 tons of gold, of the value of £7 3j 774,434- The dividends amounted to £16,461,915, or almost £1 for every ounce of gold obtained. The number of gold-mining leases has practically remained stationary for the last seven years. It is significant that we have on the gold-fields a large population still clinging tenaciously to their leases, and there are no signs of a " slump." The number of gold-mining leases issued in the State for the last ten years was 2,500, covering a total area of 32,000 acres. I come now to deal with another subject which may thrown a little light on the question as to where the money required to construct the railway has gone in the past. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said that we should be able to get enough out of our own gold mines to build the railway. I shall show that the eastern States have had as much from Western Australia as would have built it easily. During the ten years from 1896 to 1905- </para>

                            <para>- I propose to show the amount of money sent in remittances from Western Australia to the eastern States, as an illustration of the position' of the West as a field for employment, and of the necessity for connecting it more closely with the eastern States. The money sent by means of post office orders from Western Australia to the eastern States during those ten years amounted to - £8.1:2,893 to South Australia; £2,486,431 to Victoria; £989,212 to New South Wales; £137,048 to Queensland; and £181,584 to Tasmania. Postal notes during the same period amounted to £195,276, so that the total sum remitted from the West during those ten years was £4,802,444. As a contra, Western Australia cashed orders from the eastern States, as follows : - South Australia, £124,041 ; Victoria, £278,499 ; New South Wales, £.167,136; Queensland, <inline font-style="italic">j&amp;32&gt;779'&gt;</inline> and Tasmania, £32,076, or a total received by Western' Australia of ;£°34j53i- Deducting that from the money sent to the East, there is a balance of £4,167,913 in actual cash sent from Western Australia to the other States during that period by post office orders and postal notes. </para>

                            <para>- I thank the honorable senator for reminding me of that fact. . We had a very stupid arrangement in the West for some time, by which the charges for transmitting money through- the post office were kept very high, and a lot of business was thrown into the hands of the banks.  Consequently, the figures I have given do not show all the money that came to the eastern States from Western Australia. The great bulk of the people on the gold-fields area of Western Australia came from the eastern States. The sum of £4,167,913, which they sent away to the East, would be sufficient, within a few thousand pounds, to build this railway.' During all that time the inhabitants of Western Australia did not even succeed in drawing a. prize in Tattersall's sweeps, although I regret to say that the orders sent to Tasmania included a large sum of money for that institution. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is still curious to know where the money should come from for building .this . railway, my answer is that it has already come from Western Australia to the eastern States, and has remained here for the special benefit of those States ever since. Any one would think, to listen to some honorable senators, that there- never was <inline font-style="italic">&lt;i</inline> community situated like Western Australia is to-day. They seem to regard her position as unique - a. position created by herself, and one which she has not much cause  to murmur about. But the case of Western. Australia since the establishment of the Australian Commonwealth is precisely the same as that, of British Columbia under the Dominion Government in Canada. All the Canadian States did not join the Federation when it was established in 1867. British Columbia only came in in 187 1, upon the condition that within two years the construction of a railway to connect it with the eastern Provinces should be begun. That road is now the Canadian Pacific Railway, which was completed in 1885, giving Canada and the Empire a great highway from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It is interesting to compare the financial position of British Columbia with that of Western Australia.  I have here the <inline font-style="italic">Hanoi-Book of British Columbia,</inline> which shows that, the revenue for' the year 1905- 1906 was $3,044,000, and the expenditure $2,677,000. Consequently, its revenue is not. so many dollars as. that of Western Australia is pounds, and therefore it cannot be compared in importance .with our' State. The request which it put. forward, and which it succeeded in getting carried by the Dominion Parliament, is identical with the request that has been so publicly acknowledged in the case of Western Australia. Even in the case of British Columbia, after it was expressly agreed that it should be connected by rail with the eastern Provinces, there were some repudiators of the obligation cast upon the Dominion Parliament to carry out the agreement, just as there are repudiators of this understanding with Western Australia to be found in this Chamber. Lord Dufferin, than whom no Colonial official of the Empire will be longer remembered or held in higher esteem, was Governor-General of Canada from 1872 to 1878, and he visited British Columbia at the time when those attempts at repudiation on the part of the Dominion Government were agitating that State. He found it necessary to use" all his diplomatic art to allay the intense friction prevailing. He arrived there in 1874, and the first indication he had of the anti-Federal feeling, the unrest, irritation, and dissatisfaction with the Union there - the same feeling as is making itself felt in Western Australia to-day - was in the shape of an inscription over a triumphal arch beneath which he was asked to pass - "The Carnarvon terms or Separation." The Carnarvon terms included the building of the railway. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is departing altogether too far from the question now before the Senate. The question is whether we shall adopt a Bill to provide for the survey of a line of railway between Western Australia and the eastern States. The honorable senator may be in order in alluding incidentally to what has taken place under similar conditions in other parts of the world, but I cannot allow him to dilate at length on that subject. Incidents may be referred to briefly so long as they are made applicable to the question before the Senate, but the honorable senator will not be in order in going into them at any greater length'. I ask the honorable senator to kindly accede to my request. </para>

                            <para>- I was proceeding to refer to the unrest that was shown in British Columbia over a question precisely similar to the one now before the Senate, and I referred to Lord Dufferin's first experience in that State. The incident is an historical one. When he was asked to pass under that arch, he suggested to the committees who represented public opinion there that they should take out the letter " S " from the word Separation, and substitute the letter " R," thus making the inscription read - " The Carnarvon terms or Reparation." That shows what a diplomat he was. Speaking before he left, he referred to British Columbia as a glorious Province, which Canada should be proud to possess. </para>

I put it to him whether it is not a desirable, thing for him to accept the ruling of the Chair, and to deal with his argument in a different way. I do not want to take any stringent steps, but I wish honorable senators to realize the fact that the Chair has a duty to perform, and if the Chair determines that a certain line of action is to be taken it is the duty of the Chair to insist on compliance with that determination unless the  Senate sees fit to differ from that decision. I want to put this matter as kindly as I possibly can, and in the nicest possible terms, but at the same time I wish honorable senators to understand that if a ruling is given from the Chair, it is not only the duty, but the intention of the Chair, to see that .that ruling is obeyed. </para>

Let me now show how the line became payable. The shares of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company were subscribed at 100  dols.,  and according to the latest quotation I can get they now range from. 159 dols. to 168 dols British Columbia had a small population of less than 36,000 when it insisted upon the  construction  of a railway by the Dominion Government, and received a recognition of . its claim. And the value of the shares of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company have advanced a little over 50  per  cent, since they were subscribed. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; and the Dominion Government gave a subsidy of £5,000,000 to the company for pushing that great work through the Dominion. My object in making those references has been to show how natural it is for the  inhabitants  of Western Australia to feel aggrieved owing to the non-recognition of the justice of a proposal which has been before the public so long, and which in the past has received the ready assent of public men in Australia. I desire now to make a brief reference to the defence question. I acknowledge the good work which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> has done as a soldier and a citizen, but I beg to differ from him when he attempts to speak partly as an exponent of defence and partly as a representative of Tasmania. I am rather inclined to think that, although he took the floor to speak as an authority -on defence, he suddenly swerved to the other position when he started to speak . of saving £900 to that State. He stated that by running the railway within 50 miles of the coast we should be jeopardizing the safety of the people of this country. If that be the case, let me ask him whether he would ever put a detachment under his control in such a position that it could be opposed from both Slides ? I venture to say that he would not. The first object in military tactics is to get out of a position of that kind. Yet the honorable senator stated that by constructing the railway within 50 miles of the coast it would first enable the enemy to land their forces, ' travel for that distance, and tear up the line. It would be connected with two very strong bases of supply, and when an invading army was engaged in the work of pulling up the rails what would our forces in Perth, Adelaide, and Sydney be doing? Could they not prevent that attack, and get the invading army between two fires? Suppose that an enemy formed the idea that it would be safe to invade the island Continent at Eucla. What would it avail them if we abandoned the railway and left them to march for a distance of over 500 miles on either side ? If the position as outlined by my honorable friend were created, we should still be able to bring our forces from the west on one side and from the east on the other to repel any attack which might be made. So that the argument that the placing of the railway near the coast is a direct inducement to an invading army to make an onslaught does not hold water, for the simple reason that if it attempted to interfere with the line it would place itself in such a position that it could be- "attacked from two sides. The construction of the railway is opposed by all the military senators. I desire to ask the gallant colonel who graces the front Opposition bench whether he views this proposal to maintain the present- state of isolation is on ai par with the opinion which was expressed by Major-General J. Bevan Edwards, Commander of the troops on the China Station. I wish specially to ask the gallant colonel of 100 sham fights what position he would take up if he came from Western Australia ? I venture to say that on the question of defence alone he. would want to be carried out of the Chamber after the first division. It is most regrettable to observe how little some honorable senators, although they represent States which are fairly secure against attack, take into consideration the necessity for guarding the outposts of an army as well- as the main body. That is how we are situated in Western Australia. The railway, if constructed, would provide the speediest means of communication to and from the old country and India, as well as the eastern States. Supposing that Sydney were bombarded by a Japanese Navy, should we not readily agree that the safest and quickest means of sending land troops would be by an overland railway from Fremantle to Sydney ? </para>

                            <para>- I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> to consider this question : If the eastern portion of the Continent were attacked, and we had to depend upon India for relief, what line of communication would lend itself more easily to resisting an attack than would a railway from Fremantle, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Adelaide to Sydney? I hope that the honorable senator will address the Chamber because I am anxious to hear his expert views. It is contended that this is not a national project. There are some opponents of the Bill who never lose an opportunity of decrying the tactics of trusts and monopolies. Here is an opportunity when they can assist to very effectively circumvent the tactics of our enemies by giving their sanction to the construction of a railway by the Commonwealth, and one which I maintain would, in a very short time, pay working expenses as well as interest. We should have an alternative to the present arrangement, under which the inhabitants of Western Australia are fleeced in the shape of freights and fares. Yet honorable senators who are so zealous in their opposition to trusts will not move their little finger in order to destroy the octopus which has made its appearance amongst us. I feel that the whole of the Continent would derive a benefit from the construction of the railway. We in Western Australia have made sacrifices, and we rely upon a majority here to do the fair thing. We consider that we are entitled to a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> for the sacrifices we have made on behalf of Federation. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel NEILD</inline>(New South Wales) [6.12]. - This project has been so often threshed out here that it hardly seems necessary to speak upon it at great length. While I have heard from time to time a number of efficient speeches against the proposal to carry out this initial railway work, I do not know that I have ever heard a speech so thoroughly designed to condemn the matter on its merits as that of the honorable, gallant, and learned senator who last spoke. A sentence which he used towards the end of his speech makes a very efficient text. He claimed that the construction of the railway would provide " cheaper freights " and fares, and yet a large portion of his address was devoted to showing what tremendous strides Western Australia was making in the matter of soil products, with the corollary that an abundant supply of local products would necessarily stop the importation of such articles from the other States. If Western Australia is making such giant strides as the honorable senator has stated, I am pleased.. A month or two ago I witnessed the rapid developments which are proceeding there - developments which all men having any regard for the well-being of any portion of this earth's surface must witness with a great deal of satisfaction and admiration. But if all the commodities which are now imported from the eastern and southern States are to be produced locally, it necessarily follows that a railway will not be required to take them' to Western Australia. I know perfectly well that it is producing so much that it has reduced very materially the importations from the other States. As to cheaper freights and fares, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> must have allowed his eloquence to run away with his intellect, or else he must be so haplessly unacquainted with the difference in cost between rail and water carriage that he is no. wise guide for us. It is one of the most notorious facts in commerce that carriage by rail can never compete with water carriage. A man cannot travel by rail from Sydney to Melbourne for less than <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> return first class, in addition to which he has to pay 12s. 6d. each way for sleeping accommodation, and provide his own meals. But he can be carried by water with all meals supplied, and with free sleeping accommodation, for about £3 10s. return. It is not necessary to continue that line of argument, which could be applied to the cost of rail and water communication between every capital in Australia, and indeed between places in any other part of the world: The greater cheapness of water carriage is so notorious that it is not worth discussing. Take the question of freight. I am not quite sure of the railway freight between Melbourne and Sydney, but I think that the freight by sea is 12s. <inline font-style="italic">66.</inline> per ton. But I will undertake to say that an honorable senator could not get a ton of goods carried from Sydney to Melbourne by rail for less than £2. Indeed, I should be prepared to make a bet about it, except that I remember that I am in the land of Judkins and Bent, and that it would not be safe to do so. I quite admit, of course, that it is impossible to reach the gold-fields by  sea, and that therefore between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie the gold-fields would gain an advantage in the matter of fares from the construction of the railway as compared with present rates. But my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> was careful not to mention that the true route from the coast to the gold-fields is not by way of Port Augusta, but by way of Port Esperance. Any one who has any idea of engineering, geography, or common sense must admit that to be so. What is more, my' statement is proved to be true by the fact that Western Australia is at present building a line to Norseman. If that line were built, what would be the effect? There would be a little over forty-eight hours' steam from Adelaide to Esperance, and then 300 miles rail to Coolgardie. I am not quite sure whether the distance from Coolgardie to Esperance is 250 or 300 miles. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- If, for the sake of argument, I say that the distance is 300 miles, it is the best possible evidence that I am not trying to overstate the case. When we are talking about the cost of travelling, how is it that the traffic between, say, Adelaide and Fremantle today is chiefly conducted in local boats? I suppose that for every passenger who travels by one of the mail boats at <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> there are twenty who travel by one of the local steamers at £4 10s. to save 10s. This shows clearly that the question of cost must materially affect the traffic between Adelaide and Fremantle. I have travelled by both classes of steamers. Some of the local boats are very fine. They are worthy of any country in the world, and Australia has reason to' be proud of them. I mention this difference as showing that it is not likely that people will pay £20 to travel to Perth by rail when they can travel by a first-class mail steamer for £5, with all meals given in. I cannot suppose that, the single fare between. Melbourne and Sydney being £4 for 600 miles, it will be less than four times as much between Adelaide and Kalgoorlie. At any rate, it cannot be less than <inline font-style="italic">£15.</inline> Is it likely then that people would prefer to pay £15 to travel by train, providing their own meals, when they can travel by steamer with meals given in for £5? I am assuming that the £15 would cover sleeping accommodation, though I do not think that it would. If sleeping accommodation were charged for at 12s. 6d. per night, as is the case between Melbourne and Sydney, the total fare would be £18 10s. It may seem rather paltry to mention such matters, but when one is discussing a railroad proposition one has to look at these things in order to determine whether the proposal is justified. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has spoken about the resources and the productions of Western Australia. Of course, the progress that Western Australia has made is. of the greatest advantage to her and the rest of Australia. But when allusion is made to the immensity of her gold dividends, the largeness of her revenue, and her great resources, surely it must appeal to honorable senators that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> was making out a very poor case for Western Australia to play the mendicant to the poor States that she is supposed to be supplying with remittances every week. As the usual hour for adjournment is approaching, I ask leave to continue my speech to-morrow. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable senators will remember that when I brought this question under the notice of the Senate before, I endeavoured to secure an amendment of the electoral law to provide for the use of these voting, machines at such places as might be approved by regulation. In that I was unsuccessful, as a number of honorable senators contended that they had not given sufficient consideration to the question, and had not had an opportunity to inspect any,' of the machines. It was also contended that, as the Electoral Department had no report as to the feasibility of the proposal to use voting machines, I was asking the Senate merely to record a permissive resolution. I recognise that the vote given on  that occasion was a vote against the expediency of passing a Bill' before a report had been obtained on the working of voting machines, and possibly one had been recommended for use. Towards the close of the last session of the last Parliament I endeavoured to get the Minister of Home  Affairs to agree to have a trial made under actual working conditions of some of these machines at the recent elections. I thought that I had obtained a promise that something would be done in the matter, but I have since learned that no attempt was made to utilize any voting machine at the elections. </para>

                            <para>- I took it to be a promise that the Minister would favorably consider the request I made. However, nothing was done in that direction, and we are in exactly the same position as we were before. Honorable senators, will see that I am not, by my motion, asking the Senate to say that a voting machine should be adopted, but to pass a motion requiring the Minister to institute a departmental inquiry. I have not asked for the appointment of a Select Committee, because I recognise that the matter is one on which we desire not so much the evidence of persons generally as of experts. With a departmental inquiry we could, at very little cost, secure the necessary tests of machines, and put Parliament in possession of the facts as to whether such a machine could be obtained for practical use. I do not know whether honorable senators have taken the trouble to look into the statistics of the last elections, or have noted the weaknesses of the present system as exhibited by what happened at those elections. </para>

                            <para>- The most striking weakness disclosed in the operation of the present system was the large number of informal votes recorded under it. It was expected that at the first election under our system there would be a large number of informal votes, because in many of the States the electors had been in the habit of striking out the names of candidates for whom they did not desire to vote, whilst under the Federal system they were called upon to put crosses opposite the names of those for whom they desired to vote. I do not propose to refer to the first Federal elections under our system, except by way of comparison with the results shown at the last general elections. The fact is that, although the method of voting at the last election was in this respect similar to that in force at the previous election, the number of informal votes throughout the Commonwealth was greater at the last elections than at the first. I will quote the figures from the <inline font-style="italic">Victorian Year-Book</inline> for 1907 in connexion with the elections held in 1903 and in 1906. They show that the percentage of informal votes recorded for all Australia in elections for the Senate in 1903 was 3.61 per cent. For the 1906. elections, the percentage was 6.36 per cent., or an increase of nearly 100 per cent, in the number of informal votes. </para>

But I do not think it would make any appreciable difference, because the Senate elections were challenged in only one State, South Australia, and the percentage of informal votes recorded in that State was lower than in any other State of the Commonwealth at both elections. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it is. With respect to the elections for the House of Representatives, the percentage of informal .votes in 1903 was 2.52 per cent., and in 1906 it was 3.73 per cent. These figures disclose a loss of votes which I venture to say we cannot afford. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and others question the advisability of inaugurating a system of compulsory voting, but here it is shown that without compulsory voting nearly 7 per cent, of the voters who do go to the poll are disfranchised under our clumsy system of voting. </para>

                            <para>- The informal votes are due to a variety of reasons; but whatever, the cause may be, I believe that ant effective voting machine would remedy the evil. It would remove the element of weakness in deciding what are informal votes, and that element must remain If we continue our present system. So long as we have a system of marking ballot-papers, the question will continue to be raised as to whether particular papers have been marked in accordance with the law. </para>

                            <para>- That may be, but I am disposed to think that in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> opinion electors are given quite sufficient opportunities to vote for him. If the- results as regards the last election were bad, the results as regards  the referendum were worse. In connexion with the referendum there were 1,058,277 voters to whom ballot-papers were issued. Of these 936,481 votes were recorded, and of the balance of 121,796 ballot-papers 9,641 were informal and 112,155 were unaccounted for. No words of mine are needed to paint the picture there disclosed of the increasing wastage due to informal votes. At the last elections, we were particularly unfortunate in the matter of errors in counting. In this connexion the election in South Australia for the Senate will at once occur to the minds of honorable senators. I do not propose to discuss the merits of that election, but to say that on the first count <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosbie,</inline> since dead, was declared elected. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> demanded a recount, and on the recount <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was declared elected.  His  election was challenged, and a Judge of the High Court has declared that the election, so far as it related to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon,</inline> was void. Another election result that was challenged was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Palmer's</inline> return for Echuca. That was challenged by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kennedy,</inline> and on the recount that election also was declared void. It is singular that in every case, so far as I can learn, where a recount has been demanded, not in connexion with the last election only, but in connexion with all previous elections, errors in the count have been discovered. </para>

                            <para>- I am inclined to agree with the honorable senator. It should not be forgotten that it is only when the numbers are close that a recount is demanded, and if whenever a recount is demanded, mistakes are found to occur, it is evident that if there were a general recount in the case of all the elections, it would be found that in almost all, if not in every one of them, errors of greater or lesser magnitude were made. As to the delay in the count under the present system, I can refer honorable senators to what happened in connexion with my own election. The elections for the Senate were held throughout the Commonwealth on 1 2th December, yet the Senate returns were not declared in Western Australia until 20th January. I am aware that much of the delay in that case was due to the fact that returns had to be received from many very distant polling places, but delay was experienced also in connexion with the returns for city constituencies, and a delay in some instances of several days occurred in making up the count from polling places that were almost alongside the place where the poll was declared. Honorable senators will remember that many country returns. were declared before the city returns. -There are, therefore, three indictments against the present system. The great waste of votes, the errors in counting, and the delay in making known the returns. I do not lay stress on the last point, because I suppose the delay inconveniences the candidate more than any one else, and involves no great loss to the country. But I do emphasize the other difficulties. It is of little use for us to pass liberal legislation, to provide a costly staff, and go to the trouble of compiling rolls, if we are then to discover that nearly 7 per cent. of voters who go to the poll might as well stay away, since they record votes that do not count. Errors in counting involve loss and anxiety to the candidates, whose elections are challenged, and create a general want of confidence in the operation of our electoral machinery, which has a most disturbing effect on political life. I think a remedy is to be found in the use of voting machines. It would be strange if, in these days of invention, when mechanics have been applied to industry to such an extent as almost totally to eliminate the human element, and to make the human being a mere tender of machines, the ingenuity of man could not devise some method by which a voter could indicate by the use of a machine the candidate whom he preferred to act for him as his representative in Parliament. I will take the totalizator on the race-course as a very simple illustration. That contrivance has to accomplish a far more difficult task than would a voting machine. There are machines of other kinds in existence to-day accomplishing far more difficult work than a voting machine will ever be called upon to accomplish. Instances of that are to be found in the cash registers and mechanical calculators now in use in the commercial world, working out the most difficult problems. Yet, in this matter, which goes to the heart of our political life, we have never attempted to get beyond a system of recording votes that was known in Australia over fifty years ago. I have seen one of these machines working, and read of a number of others. The returning officer is the governor of the machine, just as much as he is the controller of the polling booth. The machine does not interfere with his control over the voters. He has complete command of it so far as concerns the allowing of a voter to use it, but he cannot manipulate the counting apparatus. It can be sealed just as effectively, and made just as secret, as the ballot-box. While it counts mechanically as the voters record their votes, that counting apparatus is enclosed, and can be sealed by the returning officer, nor can it be opened unless the seal is broken. It offers, therefore, quite as great security as does a wooden ballot-box, which is sealed by pasting a paper over it. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, and a man cannot record an informal vote. The returning officer (knows, before the voter leaves the machine, whether he has recorded an informal vote. The machine I saw had a number of handles, and before the election began the returning officer, by adjusting a certain apparatus, fixed those handles according to the number of members to be returned. If it was a Senate election for the return of three members, he would so adjust it that if the voter only pulled two of the handles he could not leave the booth, because the door would not unlock until he had pulled three. In the same way, he could not pull four, nor could he pull two at the one time. If he did pull two, and the returning officer allowed him out of the polling booth, the vote would not be recorded. The machine, so far as I can see, gets rid of informal votes' It is rapid and easily used, and voting can take place at a much quicker rate than under the present system. As the voter records his vote, the machine registers it, so that immediately the polling booth is closed the officer who is authorized to open the machine can announce the result. That record can be kept, and the machine can be at once sealed up again, and, if necessary, kept for a certain time, although there would be no necessity for that, because it could not be- challenged. I suppose the machine would be read in the presence of scrutineers or other officers appointed for the purpose. There would be no human element in the counting, such as enters into the present system. </para>

Whilst these machines have never been put into practical use in Australia in municipal, State, or Federal elections, they have been applied in America, not to Federal, but to some State and city elections. It is- singular that they have been used to overcome the defects of the Australian ballot system in the particular centres where it has been adopted.

                        <para>A secret ballot is very essential to honest and independent voting. It prevents the bribery from knowing whether or no the purchased voter does as he was bidden. The employer cannot tell how his workmen vole, and so their positions are safe. It was thought that the Australian ballot would meet this want, and to a considerable extent it does. It is, however, by no means fraud-proof. Scheming men have found a way to make it their ally, instead of their foe. They obtain <inline font-style="italic">a blank ballet</inline> from a corruptible officer, or one of the ring, when he goes in to vote, puts the ballot in his pocket, and votes something else. Then they mark the ballot, and give it to No. 1 purchased voter; he conceals it, goes into the booth, puts the blank that is given him into his pocket, votes the marked ballot, and returns with, the blank, as the condition of getting his vote money. This blank is marked for the next purchased vote, and so on all day. . - </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators will probably have noticed in the accounts of the Echuca election, according to one of the Melbourne morning newspapers, that it was believed that that election was conducted without any error, except that some ballot-papers were not accounted for. It. was thought that, owing- to the ballot-papers being very thin, the returning officer might have torn off two when he thought he was only tearing off one. I do not for a moment suggest that those missing ballot-papers were wrongly used, but the incident shows that there is a possibility of a corrupt officer giving two instead of one, or even of a virtuous officer allowing a voter to get hold of a blank paper, which would. allow outside persons to corrupt a whole: election. </para>

                            <para>- When the corrupt voter comes in with a blank ballot-papa lie takes from the returning officer a ballot-paper properly initialed. He goes into the polling booth, but instead of voting; upon the one which is initialed, he votes upon the other, which he puts into the ballot-box. He takes the initialed paper outside and gives it to the man who is paying him. Then the next bought voter goes: in with that paper, with the vote already recorded on it by those who have purchased" him, and so the whole process can go on all day. </para>

                            <para>- On the contrary,, the man who wants to bribe the elector under our Australian system has' no guarantee that the elector will do what he is told" to do when he goes into the polling booth, but when that man brings back an initialed" ballot-paper, the other knows that the next man he sends in will do what he is wanted to do, because he also has to bring back a blank ballot-paper properly initialed before he gets his money. The States which have adopted voting machines in Americaare Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Michigan, Indiana, and Minnesota. In Nebraska, there is a permissive power, but  it is not stated whether that has been used. In Ohio, there was a referendum on the subject, and the result was to authorize the use of the machines. The}' are employed also in some of the cities, particularly in Rochester and Buffalo. A number of letters are given in Professor Parsons' work from various State politicians, and particularly from the mayor of Rochester and the town clerks and other officials of that city and of Buffalo, all speaking of them in terms of the highest praise. Several trade unions have used them. An extract is quoted from a letter giving the experience of the Typographical Society, which conducts the election' of its officers by means of the machines, and there is a 'note here on the subject. The. city of Buffalo has found that it has effected a tremendous saving in the carrying out of their elections as compared with the old system, and that also applies to the city of Rochester. I have not read any long quotations, but the effect of the statements in the book is that they are satisfied with both their safety, effectiveness, and economy. We shall not be pursuing an unknown track if we decide to adopt voting machines. I regret that the Minister of Home Affairs does not seem to care to depart from the beaten track. He seems content to go along under the present system, and to endeavour to perfect it on existing lines. I regret that he has not seen his way to make any inquiries about voting machines, and give an opportunity for the testing of them. I should like the Senate <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> pass -the motion, so that we may secure to inventors an opportunity of getting their machines tested. It does not favour any particular machine; it will be left entirely open to the Minister to invite all or any of the .inventors to submit their machines for inspection. But I would urge upon the Minister that if this opportunity is to be given, the Commonwealth should bear the cost of - the testing and the inquiries. I have been informed that prior to the last election an inventor applied to the Minister to have a test made of his machine on that occasion. He proposed to the Minister that the ordinary voting system should be adopted, but that his machine should be placed in the polling booth in charge of officers of the Department, so that a test might be made and a report submitted to 'both Houses. The reply was that the Department was willing to make the test if the inventor would agree to pay the expenses of the officers. I do not know whether that statement is correct or not, but, if it is correct, it is a miserable pettifogging way of dealing with this matter. </para>

                            <para>- If it had not been for inventive fanatics, we should be very backward in mechanical science. It is to the " cranks " that we owe the improvements in mechanical science. The Commonwealth should make the necessary arrangements, for testing all the machines which are worthy of 'the name, and it should not haggle with the inventors as to the expense. I do not say that it should allow an inventor to spend the money as he pleased, but I contend that the Commonwealth, through the Department, should defray all the expenses and see that a thoroughly effective test is made under working conditions. It can be made iri any of our cities with the greatest ease, and a report of the test presented to both Houses. </para>

There is no part which can be manipulated. Nothing can be taken away from or put in the machine. There are no ballot-papers, but a number of figures, just as we have on a typewriter. It counts the votes as the election proceeds, and as the last vote is recorded, the result of the election is- shown. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. In a polling place in Western Australia I saw a thing done which is forbidden by law. I saw a woman get a voting-paper and another woman walk into the compartment with her, no doubt to show her how to vote. A case of that kind at Geelong has been reported to the Minister. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that that would be likely to happen, because spare machines could be kept ready. The record would be right up to that stage, and if a machine got out of order a duplicate machine would be put in, and the vote taken from that time. Colours can be used by those who are not able to read their names. There is one difficulty, however, which I have recognised all along. I admit that in sparsely populated districts, where, perhaps, there are only half-a-dozen voters, a voting machine is not required. But it is very seldom that corrupt practices are carried on there. </para>

                            <para>- The book in my hand does not state what the cost of the machines in the States and cities I quoted has been, but it points out that, taking into account the capital costs in a number of years the machines in Buffalo have more than paid for themselves by the saving which has been effected in printing and other directions. I see no reason why, in sparsely populated districts, we should not continue the present system, and gradually extend voting machines to them. If a suitable machine can be found, there is no reason why, in the populous centres - and there is the weak link in the chain of our electoral system - the machines should not be adopted. I trust that the Senate will adopt the motion, and that, if it is carried, the Minister will view it sympathetically, and endeavour to carry it into effect. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel NEILD</inline>(New South Wales) [8.27]. - I seconded the motion because I think it is desirable that; if possible, we should have an improvement on the methods which were adopted at the last election. I was not a candidate, and therefore I am not speaking from a personal stand-point. I did hear of many occurrences which were seriously unsatisfactory, and worse than that. One matter I mentioned in the debate on the Address-in-Reply, and that was that elections were conducted in many places, at any rate in New South Wales, by only one man. That is a condition of affairs which, I think, is very much more than seriously objectionable, because, when we let loose an individual with a bundle of papers and a ballot-box to use as he pleases, heaven only knows what the consequences may be. If a machine could be produced that would give the excellent results indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> it would be very, much better than the present system. There is one point which, of course, will be considered by any board of experts which may be appointed under the motion if carried, and that is whether it is possible to design a piece of machinery which would never go wrong. I have never heard of such a machine. </para>

                            <para>- I have not seen a voting machine, and therefore I cannot express an expert opinion as to what would happen if it went wrong. If it is a question of putting in a new machine where one breaks down, it would mean having a duplicate or triplicate supply. I merely point this out as a difficulty, not as an objection ; because if we can have voting machines that will do the work more satisfactorily than the present system does, let us have them by all means. I hope that there will be an inquiry which will prove the usefulness or the reverse of such a voting machine as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has suggested. </para>

                        <para>. - I am particularly glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has again brought' forward this matter. Honorable senators appear, by their interjections, to have felt some little surprise when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was referring to the attributes of these machines. </para>

                    <para class="block">There is nothing in them, however, which, is likely to lead to difficulty. Let me say at once that I claim no mechanical skill whatever, but circumstances have made me familiar with a portion of the mechanism employed in some voting machines. There is nothing in, them with which honorable senators are not absolutely familiar when the devices are employed in other ways. The principle is a combination of three well-known appliances. One of them is the ordinary cash register, which is employed in many shops. Honorable senators will know that when the operator wishes to record a purchase he merely presses a little lever, and the machine registers not only the amount of the individual purchase, but adds it on to the sum total already registered. There will be no more clanger of a voting machine breaking down than there is of a cash register going wrong. The difference is that the voting machine instead of marking one shilling will mark a vote against the name of a candidate, and at the same time instead of adding one shilling to the total will add a number to the votes already recorded. That is the first mechanical principle of the machine. The second is that of a numbering machine. Probably honorable senators generally are not so familiar with it, though <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> knows perfectly well it is. It is a piece of mechanism used in nearly every printing office, by means of which numbers are accurately recorded upon pages. The principle of the numbering machine is applied to the voting machine. The third principle, which supplies the great safeguard of the voting machine, is practically the mechanical device which operates in the lock-and-block system on our railways. Under that system it is not possible for a signalman to pull over one lever when there is another one open, and the moment he opens one he closes all the others. Now, nobody has any hesitancy about going upon any railway which is guarded by the lock-and-block system. Nobody fears that it is going to break down and no one desires to go back to the old staff system for fear the lock-and-block system should get out of order. The mechanism is, as I understand it, so simply constructed, that as Jong as it is looked after with reasonable care, there is no serious probability of it breaking down in actual operation. There mav be a possibility of it going wrong, but, so far as I can judge, that possibility is remarkably slight. It is because I believe that we can obtain  a' suitable machine - and I am not speaking of any particular machine; the main principles are similar in most of them - and because I believe that an effective voting machine would more effectively do our work than mere manual labour can do it, that I . shall support the motion. There is one great advantage to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> so far as I can recollect did not refer, and that is that the adoption of voting machines will operate greatly to the convenience of the individual elector. At the last" elections in Sydney - and I now speak of a matter which is well known to yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> - there was at several polling booths a long tail of electors waiting outside, some of whom became absolutely disgusted because they were not able to vote within a reasonable time. We had instances of men rushing from one part of the city to another after making the necessary applications to vote at other polling booths than their own, seeking to record their votes. I venture to say that by means of voting machines the electors could be disposed of almost as rapidly as they could walk through the polling booth. There would be none of that interminable delay and confusion which arises in handing put the papers, in the electors taking them to the compartment, and then putting them into' the ballot-box. In a large city booth at a time of day when every one is more or less busy the most irritating delays are caused under the present system. </para>

                            <para>- That is: so. The elector would go straight away, record his vote, and leave the booth without any delay whatever. The returning officer would know when he went in to register his vote on the machine; so long as the elector was there no other elector could enter; and the elector could not leave until he had voted. When he had voted he could not vote a second time. </para>

                            <para>- They could reach him over the turnstile. Looking at the second paragraph of the motion, I observe that it declares that a departmental inquiry Should be instituted into such machines as may be submitted. I am not quite certain about that. It seems to leave something to be desired. I presume that the officers of the Electoral Department are not possessed of mechanical knowledge, and have no special equipment for examining machines. The motion may mean that the inquiry should be made by the officers of the Department, and. that the Minister should ask outside expert advice. In the latter case I presume that he would call in the assistance of mechanicians and others with special knowledge to enable them to form an opinion. </para>

                            <para>- The main thing is to get competent mechanicians to express their opinion. I do not know that there is any officer of the Electoral' Department in my own State who is qualified to speak of the mechanical excellence or convenience of any voting machine that has been invented. Personally, if any machine were approved, I should not think it desirable to send it to outlying places, because in the first place the cost would be prohibitive, and, secondly, it is only required in the centres of population where it is desirable to expedite the method of voting. If the Minister intends to receive the motion sympathetically, I would suggest that the best plan would be to have a practical test of the machine. Perhaps the best and simplest form of inquiry would be for a room to be taken in the central portion of one of our big cities, and for a notification to be made some days before the test that, on such and such a day between such and such hours, the room would be open for people who liked to walk in and vote for certain imaginary candidates. The machines could be used, and there could be proper officers to check the number of people who availed themselves of the opportunity. I venture to say that a large number of people would out of curiosity make use of the machine, and so enable the Department to test its value. I trust that the motion will be carried, and will receive -early and sympathetic treatment at the hands of the Minister of the day. </para>

                            <para>. - I shall support the motion, although I can see the possibility of danger arising from the adoption of voting machines. The danger is not that the machines would fail to record some votes, but that ingenious persons would apply their brains to invent some way to manipulate them. Some years ago, in New South Wales, there was a system of recording the number of passengers who paid fares on the trams. A register was supplied to the guards, and a bell rang for every penny that was paid. But somebody in New South Wales discovered that by a little manipulation the bell could be made to ring although the fare was not registered. The person who discovered this made a considerable amount of money out of his invention - and after a while he was sent to gaol. That is the sort of thing that I am afraid of in connexion with voting machines. But I am prepared to support the motion, because I believe that it is possible to save a considerable amount of time, and to prevent informal votes being registered through the remissness of partial or impartial returning officers. I point out, however, that even turnstiles can be manipulated. They are used in connexion with football and cricket matches. Some time ago I happened to be on a sports committee. We had turnstiles, which had to be passed by the public who entered the sports ground. The numbers were recorded on the dials as the people went through to the ground, and in the evening we found that the man in charge of one of the turnstiles was just 5,000 shillings short. We knew perfectly well that he had not taken the money. He could not have stowed 5,000 shillings on his person, and the number of people present at the. sports made it impossible for that record to be correct. The machine was sent on the following day to the mechanic who constructed it, and he sent back word that the register was in perfectly good working order. </para>

                            <para>- It had been working too hard. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> told 'us only a little time ago that his gas meter did not work too well, and I understood the honorable senator to infer that it registered too great a consumption of gas. I am prepared to support the motion in order to encourage the inventors of these machines. If they can produce a machine that will perform its work perfectly we can adopt it, but we shall have to be very careful that we do not adopt a machine which may subsequently be manipulated for the benefit of some individual. </para>

                            <para>.- I have listened with considerable interest to the speech of the honorable senator who is in charge of the motion, and to the speeches of those who have followed him. I have also read with interest the printed matter supplied to honorable senators during the course of the debate. I wish to say at the outset that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is under some little misapprehension with regard to my position in connexion with the matter. It is true that during the last session of the last Parliament I, as representing the Minister of Home Affairs iri the Senate, stated that consideration would be given to the representations which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made as to the desirableness of testing machines of this kind at the general elections. So far as the conduct of those elections is concerned, my responsibility was only that which I shared in common with every other member of the Cabinet, and it cannot be inferred that I was recreant to any personal' obligation I had incurred by any statement I had made to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> during the last session of the last Parliament, when he brought this matter up. The honorable senator referred further to the fact that he was informed that during the last elections an offer had been made to the Department of Home Affairs to supply a machine or machines in order that they might be tested in connexion with those elections. What the exact nature of the test was to be, I do not know, but it may be that it occurred to the Department, as it occurred to me when the matter was suggested here, that the proper test to apply  to 'such a machine .was to ask that electors voting under the existing system  at a particular election should also use the machine, that the results might then be compared. </para>

                                <para>- If so, it would not matter what proportion of those who took part in the actual election voted by the machines at the fictitious election. I assumed that the test was to be made at a Commonwealth election in such a way that the results might be compared of the same election conducted under the existing system, and by use of the voting machine. It is pointed out now that we might ask any number of electors or any number of persons in the community, for that matter, to take part in a fictitious .election, in order to test the efficacy of the machine. I assume that that would not be the only test that would have to be applied. There would have to be, as the motion says, "exhaustive tests." in order that the fallibility of the machine might be tested under varying circumstances. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in moving his motion, contended that the use of voting machines would do away with informal votes. In this connexion, the honorable senator stated that the percentage of informal votes had increased from something like 3 per cent, at the elections in 1903, to about 6 per cent, at the elections in 1906. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, but there was a considerable increase in the number of ballot-papers issued. However, there was obviously an increase in the percentage of informal voting at the last general election for the Senate, and what the causes of that were I am not in a position to say. Against that, I should like to inform honorable senators that at the recently contested by-election for Echuca, the percentage of informal votes given by persons, other than those who were absent and postal voters, was less than 1 per cent., namely, 0.8 per cent. </para>

                                <para>- I am coming to that directly. I wish honorable senators to understand that what I am saying is not to be interpreted as in any way hostile to the introduction of any innovation of this kind. I am pointing out some of the considerations which have occurred to my mind that seem to show that after all the machine system might be open to very many of the objections which may be urged against the present system. We should still require to use ballot-papers for absent voters and those who desire) to vote by post, even if we adopted machines in every polling booth throughout the country. I was pleased to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> say that one machine of which he had some knowledge might be used for elections, both for the Senate and the House of Representatives, for the election of one or of a number of persons, and that it was applicable, not only to the present system of voting, but to a preferential system. I assume that such a machine could also be used in the case of a referendum. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> in the course of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce'</inline> s remarks, interjected - and I think very wisely on this occasion - that possibly it would be a good thing if these machines were tested in connexion with a municipal election, or within some compact area of that kind. It might be that in that way a voting machine could be put to the best possible test, provided we could make arrangements with all voters recording their votes in the ordinary way, to record them also through the machine. If any errors occurred, they could be very much more easily rectified in the case of such an election than they could be if we were prematurely to adopt a machine for parliamentary elections throughout the Commonwealth, and then find to our sorrow that, owing to some unfortunate circumstances, the machine had been at fault, and errors had crept in. There is another aspect of the question to which I would direct the attention of honorable senators, and that is the cost which would be involved in equipping our polling booths with these voting machines. I take it that at the larger centres one machine would not be found sufficient, and it must be remembered that we have something like 4,500 polling booths throughout the Commonwealth, and the tendency is for them to increase rather than to diminish. </para>

                                <para>- There are now 1,575 polling places in New. South Wales. But the tendency is rather for them to increase than to decrease throughout the Commonwealth. Applications are being constantly made for polling booths at centres where hitherto there have been none. If all these are to be equipped with voting machines considerable cost will be involved. I do not know whether that expense will bs saved, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> assures us it has been in the case of Buffalo and other towns in the United States, but .there they have this advantage over us, that the area in which the machines are in operation is probably much more compact, and  their centres much more accessible than would be the case in Australia. It has been suggested that the machines might only be required at some of the larger centres, while the present system could be retained at others. I am not in a position to offer what might be regarded as a considered opinion on the subject, but I am afraid that to have a dual system in operation throughout the Commonwealth might lead to very serious complications in the counting of votes. There are many polling booths in Australia very far removed from one another, and possibly the machines would have to be transported long distances. If they were to be kept at small and remote polling places they would remain there out of use for a considerable time, because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> interjected, elections do not come very frequently. The machines would be out of commission for an average period of three years, and this would necessitate regular inspection to maintain their efficiency. </para>

                                <para>- Even then there would be long intervals during which the machines would not be used at all, and a considerable amount of expenditure would be necessitated for inspection. If they were not left at those remote centres, but transported to and from them as required, there- would always be a danger of their mechanism being largely affected. These are considerations that I am offering to honorable senators in connexion with the system generally. Of course, we are not voting now on a motion for its adoption. </para>

                                <para>- I understand that that inventor has been retired from public life. Although it has been represented that with the use of the machines there would be an absence of informal voting, that the opportunities for briber)' and corruption would be removed, and that the machines could not possibly lie, still a contrivance of this kind, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> suggested, is liable to be manipulated. If individuals have that guilty intent which would lead them to practice bribery and corruption at elections under existing conditions, they would not be in the least loth to tamper with or injure or detrimentally affect a voting machine if they thought it was to their advantage to do so. In that respect the apparatus may not produce all the reliable results already referred to. Another aspect is the expense entailed in making investigations about these machines. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that he thought the Department should bear all the expense of making tests. If the Department was bound down by a hard-and-fast resolution to bear all the expenses incidental to testing machines of this kind, it might be inundated with a number of .perfectly valueless inventions, and individuals might thereby cause the Department a considerable amount of expense, which would be productive of very little good result. One honorable senator interjected something about " inventive cranks," while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was speaking on this phase of the subject. Whilst I do not wish for a moment to deprecate! the efforts put forward by so many in the community to perfect different mechanical devices, honorable senators can accept my assurance that, in ordinary circumstances, apart altogether from voting machines, there is hardly a Minister of the Crown in Australia who is not constantly approached by individuals with all kinds of reforms destined in the minds of their advocates to accomplish most wonderful results. We might have machines thrust upon us from distant centres, and individuals might come long distances to Melbourne at great expense to submit something which was of no value whatever,, and which might be condemned at sight. I. am mentioning these considerations to show that there should not be a hard-and-fast obligation on the Department to pay the expenses, in every detail, of everybody who chooses to come along with a request that a .machine should be inspected and tested. As I said last session, I certainly regard the time as opportune for testing the efficacy and value of the voting machines now before the world, and so far as the Department is concerned, I can assure honorable senators that I shall see that proper tests are made of the machines that may be presented for our consideration. I shall endeavour to get a list of the different contrivances as early as possible. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> hinted. I cannot rely wholly upon the recommendations that may be made by officers who, however skilled they may be in electoral administration, may have as little knowledge as I have myself of the mechanical details that would enable one to come to a correct conclusion as to the efficacy of art invention, and so I should necessarily have to travel outside the purely administrative officers in the matter. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that I shall be prepared to give the fullest consideration I possibly can through the officers at my disposal to any machines that may be presented, with a view to carrying out the object of the motion. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator SAYERS</inline>(Queensland) [q.ii"|.I agree with a great deal of what the Minister of Home Affairs has said. I have had a great deal to do with the conduct of many municipal, State, and Federal elections. It is very easy to test voting machines, because all polling booths are fitted up so that the voter comes in at one door and goes out at another. In fact, the presiding officer is compelled to see that that is done. Police are stationed at the front door, and no man is allowed' to go out the same way. He must go out by a door at the back. If he did not there would be endless confusion, and it would not be known whether a man had' voted once or several times. When there is a large number of voters, and the alphabet is divided, there are two doors for the voters to go out. I should like to see the machine tested against the returning officer. It could be seen whether the machine could check correctly the number of people who went out, because, of course, everybody who goes into a polling booth is supposed to be a voter. Nobody else is allowed in, except, perhaps, the candidates, who are permitted by courtesy to be present. Consequently, every person would have to go out through the machine, and. it could easily be seen how many went out. Then, when the votes were counted, that would be one of the best tests possible. It could be tried at some large polling place where 8.000 to 10,000 votes are recorded. There would be no large expense involved in such a test. As the Minister said, in our vast territories there are fairly large polling places long distances from the railway, and if machines were left there for three years they might be found to be out of order when next brought into use. I remember many instances of that sort in connexion with ballot-boxes. They are generally stored away in a room of the court-house. They are under the eye of the officials, but they are not taken out until the day before the election, when the booth has to be fitted up. I have seen them, although they were in first-class order when put away, brought out again in such a state through the heat, especially in Queensland, that it was impossible to lock them. That would not be discovered until the eve of the election. If through some inadvertence or through the machine going out of order, it was found to be unworkable just before the election, a staff would have to be hurriedly got together to conduct the poll under the old system. There is a good deal to be said in favour of this motion, but I hope the Minister will have a thorough test made before he attempts to bring the machines into use. </para>

                            <para>- I have grave doubts whether they would be efficacious, because I have heard of totalizators, which cost a great deal of money, going out of order. I have read of cases where the machine registered far more than was actually put in. In another instance there were more tickets sold than the machine registered. These things are generally run by fairly smart business men. who know their way about ; yet, with all their cleverness, the machine can be tampered with, and made to do the exact opposite to what it is intended to do. If we get a voting machine, and it is tried at election time, I believe that there will be found men clever enough, if they want to tamper with the election, to tamper with the voting machine also. No matter what system we may adopt, it will be open to abuse. The last Federal election was the worst one I have ever seen. In Brisbane, hundreds of persons were turned away from the principal polling place. The reporters visited the polling place, and in the next issue of their newspapers they published some comments on the proceedings. From the absent voters' tables a great many persons went away ; they had waited for hours for an opportunity to record their votes, but that did not occur. All that, however, can be remedied. With all due deference to the Minister and the officials, I maintain that proper men were not employed on that occasion. They were mostly State officers, and a great many of them did not want to do the work. We all know that when a man is forced into a position, he is' not a willing worker. Again, in nearly every instance the pay was reduced. In the North of Queensland men were called upon to work for fifteen or sixteen hours a day for 15s., which is equal to about one shilling per hour. They were all supposed to be capable men; but it is not possible to get such men to do the work properly for that remuneration. They were paid at exactly the same rate as a navvy or a street sweeper. Taking all the circumstances into consideration it would be far better for the Government to display a little more generosity. I hope that the Minister will see his way to have a thoroughly good test made of voting; machines, and to take care that the Commonwealth shall not be imposed upon by any spurious machine. </para>

We have nothing to do with the question of whether Federal officers have paid their income tax in Victoria or any other State. We have no means of finding out whether they have done so or not. Of course, sir, I reserve to myself the right to speak if my point of order is not sustained. </para>

At one .time, in Victoria, the exemption was ^125, and, perhaps, it is ,£150 now. It would be very easy, I take it, and also very proper, too, for the Commonwealth Government to ascertain how many Federal officers in Victoria have had a salary that has been equal to or above the taxable amount. </para>

                        <para>-I did not rise for the purpose of quibbling. My honorable friend knows very well that this is a subject of conflicting jurisdiction. According to the decision of the High Court, Federal officers in Victoria are not liable to income tax, but according to the decision of the Privy Council, in certain circumstances, they are liable. I am anxious to assist my honorable friend ; but I would point out to him that it would be a mistake for the Senate to pass a motion demanding that the State Government shall supply certain information. They could snap their fingers at us. On the other hand, if, in view of my assurance, he will withdraw the motion, I shall be only too glad to endeavour to secure the information. </para>

The Bill in which he sought to insert a provision of that kind is not yet out of the possession of the Senate, and he desires to get this information to strengthen his hands, perhaps with a view to take further action. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to know why the Senate should pass an inquisitorial motion - one which makes an invidious distinction between those officers who have generously donated to the Victorian Government the amount of the income tax for which they were not legally liable, and those who have stood on their legal rights and said, " No, you have no legal authority  to demand the tax from us, and, therefore, have no right to get it." .Why should we ask for an inquisitorial return of this kind ? Simply for the benefit of those individuals in the State Government and the State .who desire, not only to make Federal officers pay the income tax, which this Parliament seems to be inclined to make a legal charge upon them, but also to compel them to pay, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> wants to do, income tax for the last six years when they have not been legally- liable. If he does not mean that, what is the good of his motion ? Does he wish to hold up to public approbation, those who have paid income tax, and to public execration those who have not paid it? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator wishes to find out the number, but if the motion is agreed to, it may be followed up with a request for a list of the names. Probably he will be able to get that information from the State Government. We do not -know what action will be taken. I, for one, am not willing to open the door to any inquiry of that kind. Public officers who have not paid income tax have been quite within their rights, and we ought not to take any action which would express either approval dr disapproval. It is a matter which we should treat with the utmost indifference. </para>

Why has all this cry been raised in Victoria? It is because a curious concatenation of circumstances has occurred since the establishment of "Federation, and for which I believe the Senate is not responsible. The seat of the Parliament and of - the Government has remained in Melbourne for an unduly long period. Members of Parliament are congregated in Victoria, -most of them against their will. They would like to be in a' more" congenial climate. As a further consequence of the temporary capital being in Melbourne, all the heads of Departments, and all the administrative officers are here, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> and those who think with him could get their way, they, would all be made subject to income tax. Those Federal servants are not here willingly, but because they have to discharge their duties at the Seat of Government. And because of that accident the Victorian Government has been trying to bleed them. </para>

                        <para>- I like to .receive a compliment from such a genial gentleman as my honorable friend. The motion is inquisitorial. It is intended to pry into the private affairs of individuals, and it ought not to be tolerated for a moment. The question whether particular officers have paid income tax or not is their private affair. Those who have paid have simply donated the amount to the Victorian Government; because the payment of a sum which is not legally due to some one else can only be called a donation. There was no moral obligation for the payment of income tax ora the part of any Federal servants resident in Victoria; besides, there was no payment due to the Victorian Government. </para>

Are we to appoint some officer to go round and interview every public servant who may be supposed to be under a liability to the Victorian Government, asking them whether they have paid their income tax or not? If any officer came to me and made such an inquiry, words fail to describe the indignation with which I should receive him. I am quite certain that other Members of Parliament and public servants who have stood on their rights while the Seat of Government has been located in Melbourne, would simply tell such an officer to mind his own business. I. am very sorry that a gentleman like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGoll,</inline> who ought to have an intellect above such petty things, should submit such a motion, and if it is pressed to a division, I trust that it will be negatived.

But when we summoned the Commissioner of Taxes or his  deputy,  or any officer of his Department, we found that we could get no information. The Royal Commission decided to meet at Parliament House, and when we summoned the Commissioner he told us that he could give us no information unless we went to the Taxation Office.

                    <para>. - As a representative of Victoria I should like to enter my emphatic protest against the Commonwealth of Australia being asked to become a detective for a State Government. In the first place, the motion seeks to obtain information from the State as to the amount supposed to be due. from Federal servants. That presupposes that the State Government is able to estimate the amount due. I quite sympathize with the demand that has generally been made in this State that Federal officers should pay the income tax. But the fact remains that many officers have been under the impression that they are not legally liable. It might be possible to furnish information as to the number of persons who have paid the tax, but surely it would be a reflection upon the State Parliament for the Senate to ask for such information. What business is it of ours ? Then, again, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> wishes to know, " How many of such persons have not paid; and the total amount unpaid?" Why ask such a question with regard to Victoria only ? Why not inquire how many public servants in other States have not paid income tax? The honorable senator makes it appear that the Victorian Federal servants are the only ones who have been anxious to hide themselves behind the decision of the High Court. I believe that to be a reflection upon Victorian Federal officers. A considerable number of officers have paid the tax, believing that they were morally responsible, although protesting that there was no legal obligation upon them to pay. I am not one of those . who laid great stress on the legal point. Had I been in receipt of a salary from the Federal Government I should certainly have paid my income tax in Victoria. But that is no reason why others who refused to pay on legal grounds should be hounded down for insisting that under the Constitution they were not liable. Again, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> wishes to know " How many of such persons have not paid?" does he mean to insinuate, that they have tried to rob the State of what is due to it? As the High Court of Australia has determined that Federal officers are not liable, the answer to such . a question would have to be that there are no </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Federal officers who have not paid any tax to which they are legally subject. It appears to me that the real intention of the motion is to gratify a section of people in Victoria who are always clamouring against the Commonwealth, and who axe ever eager for information which they unfairly use for the purpose of damaging the Federal Government and its officers. I should be very sorry to think that the Commonwealth had deteriorated to such a level as to become a private detective for any State Government. . The States are quite capable of managing their own business. I hope that the motion will be rejected if it is pressed to a division; but I strongly urge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> to withdraw it. When the Commonwealth Salaries Bill is passed I trust that there will be no Federal servant who will seek to avoid discharging the dutv imposed upon him. I believe that the Federal public servants, not only iri Victoria, but in every other State, are perfectly willing to pay every penny which they are required to pay under the law, and no one should be compelled to pay any more. To carry such a morion would cast a slur on our public servants, and I hope that in their interests it will be withdrawn. If it is not withdrawn, I hope that the Senate will unanimously reject it, and that its rejection will be considered in the light of a compliment to the Federal servants. </para>

The honorable senator's speech contained the strongest condemnation that has been passed upon them in the Senate. I have not said anything against them. If the motion I have submitted is wrong, then the Bill introduced by the Government to compel these people to pay income tax is also wrong, and should never have been introduced. If I ought not to ask for an item of information connected with the Bill, the Government should never have brought it in. If it is a disgrace that I should ask for the names of those who have not paid a tax which I think they are morally bound to pay, it must be equally a disgrace that the Government should ask Parliament to pass a Bill to compel them to pay the tax.
