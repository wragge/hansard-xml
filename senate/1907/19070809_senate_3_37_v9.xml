It will occasion a very large amount of work to honorable senators if they have to search out the old duties. It will simplify the consideration of the Tariff very much here if the honorable gentleman can accede to my request. </para>

What I ask can easily be done. It is merely a question of the Government arranging to have the reports published in that form and distributed. </para>

                <para class="block">It seems that the regulations have never been rescinded. Last night I received a telegram from Charters Towers, which I handed over to the Minister of Home Affairs, asking why the charges were still being made there. One would have thought that since my questions were asked on the 2nd August there had been ample time for the Department to act. The last telegram I received before I brought the matter before the Senate reached me on the 31st July. One would almost fancy that there is no telegraphic communication with Queensland, because, in the meantime, I have been able to send a letter to Charters Towers and get a reply, while the Department has not seen its way to do anything. It places me and also the Minister of Home Affairs in a very peculiar position. This is the only way in which I can make it known that I have done my duty. If I did not move the adjournment of the Senate I should have to write to every individual, and then my correspondents would probably say, " We had his letters before, but there could have been no truth in them, because nothing was done."  1  am now giving an opportunity to the Minister to explain matters. I contend that the answers to my questions were misleading. I was misled, and I believe that the honorable senator must have been misled. On the answers I acted, and later on, after I had received a second memorandum, I sent a telegram and then wrote a letter giving full particulars of what the Minister had told me. But my correspondents a week later wire that they are still being overcharged. The Minister has said that the regulations have not been cancelled, but, as a matter of fact, they were cancelled in Melbourne on the day of issue. Since the  26th  of July the Department has had ample time to act. It has been open to the Department to send to the head of the Department in Queensland a telegram to this effect, " These instructions have been cancelled here, cancel them in Queensland." It is possible that these illegal charges are still being made in other parts of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I am not sure of. I was not aware until I received a communication from the Charters Towers Chamber of Commerce that any of these regulations were in force at all. They are fairly smart business men up there, and when they found that they were being overcharged they wired to me, and I interviewed certain gentlemen down here. I found that it was an overcharge, that the Department had been wrong, that they had cancelled the regulation the same evening in Melbourne, and had refunded the money. There seems to have been some lapse. In this Chamber, if we desire information from the Postmaster-General or any other member of the Government, we are in the position of having to put the question through the Minister representing him here. I simply want to know from the Government, in order to set myself right with the people for whom I am acting, what steps have actually been taken to right the wrong, or whether things are going to continue as they have been. </para>

The honorable senator brought to me yesterday afternoon a telegram which he had received from Charters Towers, stating that there had been no alteration in the charges in connexion with cypher messages. All I can say is that the original complaint to the Postal Department came from Melbourne. The matter was immediately rectified, and it was ordered that those who had been- overcharged should be refunded the amount of the overcharge. Correspondingly with that, as stated in this memorandum, " the instruction of the 27th ultimo was sent to all the States." If it had been discovered that even after the instruction of the 27th had gone to Queensland, and to all the other States, the original instruction was still being misinterpreted, further steps would immediately have been taken by the Postal Department to rectify the errors that were occurring. I draw the attention of the honorable senator to the fact that his questions do not indicate that there is any differential treatment of Queensland as' compared with Victoria. As the answer showed, the only complaint made to the Postal Department was that the instructions of the 13th were misinterpreted in Melbourne to the prejudice of certain persons using the Post-office, and immediate steps were taken to issue further instructions to prevent misinterpretation here, and concurrently with that the Department set out those further instructions on the 27th to all the States. Apparently, in spite of that action, the errors in charging have still been continued in the part of Queensland mentioned by the honorable senator, although they do not appear to have occurred elsewhere. But in all the circumstances the </para>

I told him last night after the Senate adjourned, that a further communication had been sent to Queensland since he showed me his telegram yesterday, and the honorable senator then courteously informed me that he would take an opportunity during to-day's sitting to bring the matter forward, in order that those who were interested in Queensland, and who were moving him in the matter, should see that he had not been neglectful of his duty. I think the honorable senator has now achieved what he desired, and it will be clear that whatever has occurred has been through a misinterpretation of the instructions of the 13th July, for which certain officers of the Postal Department are responsible, and which has still continued, notwithstanding the attempt made on the 27th July to prevent the continuance of that misinterpretation. </para>

                    <para>- The matter does not seem quite clear now, except that the instructions sent by the Government were so vague that their officers did not understand them, or that those officers were so obtuse that they could not do so. Does the Minister intend to have clear instructions sent out, so that his officers may understand and act on them? It seems very necessary to do so. </para>

                        <para>- - Before this Bill becomes an Act I should like to make a few remarks upon it. Although this is the fourth time the measure has been before the Senate, I am to-day addressing myself to it in the Senate for the first time. I should like to clear up a few misapprehensions that have arisen before we see the end of it. When I say that there have been misapprehensions connected with the Bill, I am referring particularly to the attitude of the two Ministers representing the Government in the Senate, both of whom I am very glad to see are at present in the Chamber, because I propose to make some remarks concerning their action. I do not care which of them I take first in order, whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating;</inline> but I shall, I hope, deal perfectly fairly with them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> is the latest convert. </para>

I suppose we have got to believe the honorable senator. </para>

I am merely stating for myself that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> tells the Senate solemnly that his change of attitude with regard to this Bill, at such a time, was a mere coincidence, and had no relation whatever to the fact that he had accepted office, I, and I  hope every other member of the Senate, believe the 'honorable senator just as fully as we did believe him when, on the occasion to which I referred- </para>

We are compelled by our parliamentary forms to believe the statement of any member of the Senate, and I should like to know if I am forbidden to say this : " I believe that honorable senator just as I did on such-and-such an occasion, and just as the parliamentary forms compel me to believe him?"

I can say, if I like, that I accept the truth of what he says, just as I accepted it then. But does that necessarily imply that I mean to say that he did not tell the truth on either occasion ? </para>

                            <para>- But he said so. It was his main point throughout Tasmania at the last election, when he spoke with regard to this question, that the one and only occasion on which he had directly or indirectly referred to it, was in the  Address-in-Reply  debate at the opening of the first Parliament. He invited the members of the public of Tasmania to look up <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 1901, where they would find that he then said that he was not opposed to this Bill, and that if there was anything in his speech on the Address-in-Reply that could be taken as showing an inclination one way or the other, it was an inclination in favour of the measure. He went on to say, as he had said before in the Senate, that his then attitude represented no change of front with regard to it - that he had  always  been in favour of it, in fact. Now,_ I have to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> whether he will answer one question. This Bill has been before the Senate four times. On the last occasion it was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> as Attorney-General in the Reid-McLean Ministry. As every honorable senator present knows perfectly well, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> was then as determined in his opposition to it as myself, or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> or any other senator. </para>

Let honorable senators search the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and they will find that that is so. But we all know what his attitude was. It was commonly said at the  time that he was very reluctant to vote against the senators from his own State, and was at the same time reluctant to vote against his own Ministry. Therefore, . he chose the middle course, and walked out of the chamber when the division took place. We all knew at the time why he did that. It was said as an excuse for him that he was out in an awkward position. </para>

                            <para>- There is no doubt that the honorable senator endeavoured to hide his tracks. He said nothing. But there are the facts. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> then in his effort to go as far as he could to support his own side - to support those who had been working with him - decided that he would not vote for the proposal introduced by his own Ministry,' but walked out of the chamber. He chose that as a middle course. Yet, having done that, he told the electors of Tasmania - and told this Senate also - that he had always been in favour of the Bill. Of course, he has a perfect right to vote as he likes. But, sir, I have nothing but contempt for a man who has not the pluck to say decisively one way or the other, " I have changed my opinion " - by Ministerial obligation or anything else - who is not man enough to acknowledge why he has altered his attitude in regard to a question of this kind. I object to the man who would endeavour to induce the electors of his State, and his fellow-members, to believe that, in such circumstances, his action represents no change of front whatever. It is a shock to every honorable senator to hear such explanations as we have had put forward as having some pretence to truth. </para>

I will tell him what my conscience is. The Bill was introduced for the first time in the Senate by a Ministry which I was supporting. Not only was I supporting that Government, but I was its official whip. Yet, being its official whip, I worked my hardest against the measure, and did my best to kill it. </para>

But, really, whether he understands my point or not is a matter of so little importance that it is not worth while to trouble about, it. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> desires to make any answer to what I have said, I hope he will explain why, when the Ministry of which he was a member introduced this Bill, he himself declined to vote for it. If he can explain that away I shall be glad to hear him. With regard to the Bill itself, I have this to say: It represents, I am perfectly certain, the opinion of merely a minority of the Senate. I say that for this reason : I have no doubt that the ^20,000 will be spent upon the survey, but if ever a. proposition for the construction of the railway is brought forward, and the Senate is constituted as it is now, I do not believe that a single senator has the faintest hope that it will be carried. I said in Committee the other day that the position in regard to South Australia and Western Australia is practically this - that no matter what the survey may disclose, the senators from Western Australia will vote for the construction of the railway, and that those from South Australia will not do so. I do not blame either of them. No matter how good the survey may be, two at least of the senators from South Australia, and probably more, will undoubtedly vote against the railway in all circumstances. </para>

                            <para>- That is hardly correct. At the recent elections I reminded the electors of the attitude I took up when I first asked for their suffrages. One of the principal planks in my platform, in which I believed, and have ever since believed, and which no other Tasmanian candidate for a seat in either House of this Parliament has advocated, was that the perfecting of the means of communication between the outlying States and what might be called the more popular and central States, was a matter of Federal concern. I stated from every platform in Tasmania, and in an address which was republished from a hostile newspaper - the <inline font-style="italic">Launceston Examiner</inline> - and circulated to the extent of 10,000 or 12,000 copies among the electors, that I, if returned, would endeavour to give effect to that principle by asking the Federal Government to take up the question of communication between Tasmania and the mainland. I said that that was a matter of Federal concern, because Tasmania was isolated and could not participate to the fullest extent in the benefits of union unless the Federal Government took a step of that kind. Quite recently, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said that I had spoken against this Bill, I interjected that I had never spoken on this Bill, but that whenever I had spoken on the subject in the Senate I had expressed myself as in favour of it. He asked me if 1" had advocated this measure when I was before the electors in Tasmania. I said that such a concrete proposal was not before the electors, but I certainly claimed, and I think I can claim honestly and successfully, that I made the question of the perfecting of the means of communication with outlying States- a matter of Federal concern. The first opportunity I had of speaking here with' regard to Western Australia's request for better communication with the other States, was in the debate on the first Address-in-Reply. My speech was delivered, I think I may be pardoned for saying, in somewhat signal circumstances. It was the first debate in the Senate, and I had the honour and privilege of seconding the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. The Governor-General's Speech contained a reference to this matter, and I shirked no responsibility in that regard. The speech I delivered was republished in full in several Tasmanian newspapers, and a considerably greater amount of interest was then devoted to the utterances of Federal members than has been devoted to them since, because the Federal Parliament was novel then. I shall now read what I said when I was breaking ground ; when I had come, so to speak, fresh and hot from the first elections. On page 47 of the first volume of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> I am reported to have spoken, on the 21st May,1901, as follows: - </para>

There are two or three other matters to which I wish to refer before sitting down, and one of them is the contemplated - I can scarcely call it contemplated - railway to Western Australia. It does not appear, from  His  Excellency's remarks, whether Ministers intend to submit that with any great degree of confidence to the Legislature. The speech says :  - " The question of the construction of a railway connecting with these eastern communities the vast and hitherto isolated State of Western Australia has been under consideration. Examinations of the country intervening between the railways systems of South and Western Australia are now in progress, together with other inquiries. It is hoped that they may result in showing that the undertaking is justifiable." </para>

The question of the construction of a railway to the Northern Territory also appears to be under consideration. Other things being equal, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I should be inclined to prefer the construction of that line to the building of a railway to Western Australia, because it would shorten the route to the old country. It would bring us into closer communication with the other nations of the world than we could hope to expect from the construction of a railway along the southern coast to Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>What is this union ? It is, as has been expressed in this chamber and elsewhere, nothing more nor less 'than a partnership - a partnership for business purposes. While each of the States preserves its identity and its individuality in general, all have combined for certain common purposes, which are laid down in specific terms in the Constitution. Among those common purposes are three of very great importance. One is the all-important subject of defence, another is the matter of postal and telegraphic communication, and another we are having due regard to, is the possibility of the Commonwealth taking over, subject to certain conditions, the railways of the various States. So far as we in Tasmania are concerned, owing to circumstances to which I have already referred, we feel that unless a motion of this character is given effect to we cannot participate to the fullest extent, or to the extent we consider we are entitled to participate, in the advantages which will accrue from the amalgamation of the State Departments of communication. We cannot fully participate unless something is done of a practical character to draw the State of Tasmania into closer communication with the mainland States. </para>

                        <para>I ask the Government to appoint a Royal Commission to make inquiries and to report the result to Parliament. So far as the transcontinental railway inquiry is concerned, I do not. care whether those who are making the inquiry were appointed by the Commonwealth or not, and if Western Australians have not thought it desirable to ask Parliament to institute an inquiry, I presume they are satisfied that those who are investigating the matter are competent lo do so, and that the result of their labours will be of some value in the future. I think I can fairly claim the sympathy of the representatives of Western Australia in this matter. I am not asking Parliament to commit itself to anything beyond having the matter fully inquired into. </para>

Although Parliament only met in May, 1901, yet on the 26th July, 1901, the Senate agreed to the inquiry I had asked for. </para>

That being the case, I consider that he is in order in replying to the attack as he is doing, and that his speech is in order in connexion with the third reading of the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- There were reasons why the Government could not immediately give effect to my request. The matter had to be deferred for some time. I had stated publicly in Tasmania, as a principle, that the question of communication between the outer States and the central States was a matter of Federal concern. I had stated it in this Senate, and I was prepared to see that principle applied properly all round. When this Bil' first came into the Senate, when I was a member of the Government - and this is what I told the electors of Tasmania what I had contended for in respect of Tasmania had not been achieved. I wanted to see the two things brought about together, so that the principle would be applied correctly, not in regard to one particular State, but concurrently in regard to all those States that were in the same position. </para>

                            <para>- I do not blame them. But the Government were not in a position! to give effect to what I desired. I refrained from voting on that occasion, because I wanted the two matters to Le dealt with on the same common principle. That may not appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> but I stated it from every platform in Tasmania when I addressed the -electors on the last occasion. Then the Bill came up again last year, on the eve of the elections. The Government had come down with a proposal, which was set out in connexion with the Budget, that the .£7,000 of the Tasmanian subsidy should be debited to the Commonwealth, and had also made provision for the other principle, for which I had repeatedly contended on the floor of this Chamber and iri correspondence with the Department - the removal of any anomaly in telegraphic communication between Tasmania and the mainland. Those things were carried out together, so far as the Government were concerned, and, on the second occasion of the introduction of the Bill, seeing that the Government were giving effect to the principle I had advocated with regard to Tasmania at. a cost to the Commonwealth of £12,600 a year, I voted here last year for the survey. I ask honorable senators, in face of the imputation that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> would level at me when he speaks of having contempt for those who have not the pluck to do so-and-so, which was the more plucky thing lo do - to vote for this survey, which my colleagues from Tasmania told me was most unpopular, on the eve of an election, or to vote for it the year before? I went straight to the electors, and told them iwy position, saying, " I am representing you there as your business representative. I went in determined to do the best I could for you consistently with the interests of the Common wealth. I am not .there to represent you and you alone. I have to represent you and the Commonwealth, and in doing so I endeavoured to get and succeeded in getting what I consider to be a very good thing for Tasmania." That seemed to satisfy the electors. </para>

                            <para>- I am very proud to have received the votes I did in Tasmania from all classes of the community, both in the last election and the one before. After telling the electors of Tasmania from various platforms what I had said here on the Address-in-Reply, after reading to them what I had said at Launceston and every other centre in Tasmania in 1901 - I had had those speeches circulated amongst the electors - and after reading to them what I had said in the Senate when moving for the Select Committee, I asked them at every centre I addressed, " What would you have had me do in the circumstance's? Would you have had me go back on those words ?" I never intended at any time to vote against what Western Australia desired in the same direction as  1  desired for Tasmania, even if I did not vote for it. I selected my time to vote for it in connexion! with what I considered to be the best interests of Western Australia, Tasmania, and the Commonwealth. In these circumstances, I am very glad to have had this opportunity of replying to some of the aspersions that have been cast at me. It may be said that I preserved a silence on the subject. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has said so before. Quite so, but why should we conceal from ourselves, or endeavour to conceal from the public, the fact that there was an attempt, on each occasion on which the Bill has been before the Senate, to draw different senators to their feet for the purpose of prolonging the debate? Often and often I have had to sit here, when I should have liked to speak. But that was what the very opponents of the Government wanted. They wanted the debate carried on to a period when they thought it would be more advantageous to them to go to a division. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know why there should toe any objection to my speaking now. I am one of the very few senators who did not get an opportunity of speaking on the second reading. On that occasion, I adhered to the compact entered into, that the division should betaken last Friday afternoon at a certain, hour, and, therefore, refrained from speaking. When! <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> rosethis morning, and referred to making explanations, I expected him to give much fuller explanations than he did give. We know that there are many things that have not yet been even touched upon, in the way of explanation, and I certainly expected' the honorable senator to deal with them. He briefly referred to one matter, but left a great many others untouched. He made some reference fo <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best.</inline> I wonder why he stopped there. Why did he not go on to deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> attitude on the same question? If it is necessary to offer explanations, there is plenty of opportunity quite apart from that incident.. I thought we might hear some reference to the pairing incidents that have taken place from time to time, but not a word came from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> I thought when dirty linen was introduced, knowing; the enormous bundle of it that there was over here, that we were going to have a. nice treat this morning, but that bundle is still carefully concealed. I have a duty to perform here this morning. Statements have been made during the debate on this Bill, as to which I feel that I should not be doing my duty to the electors of Western Australia if I did not give them a contradiction before the Bill passes its final stage. I recognise that I am one of the very few in this Chamber, if not the only one, directly in a position to give those statements a flat contradiction. If that flat contradiction is not given to them now, harm may eventuate to my State in regard? to this railway construction later on,' because I am satisfied that we are far from the end in connexion with this matter. I am sorry <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is not in his place this morning. I should have preferred that he should be present to hear what I ann about to say, but if he chooses to be out of the Chamber when business is being done, that is his look out. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know whether he has gone from the State or not, but he has made statements on this question that I feel impelled to contradict. He has stated that Western Australia did not come into the Federation on any promise whatever in connexion with this railway, and his statement has been bandied about by the opponents of the, measure time and again. In order to substantiate it, he said that he was intimately acquainted with the movement on the gold-fields prior to Federation j that he was consulted by the Separation Committee on the gold-fields, and knew exactly what the intentions and wishes of the gold-fields men were at that time. I myself took a very prominent part in affairs on the gold-fields on that occasion. I must qualify the statement that I am the only man in this Chamber who knows these facts intimately, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> was also on the gold-fields at the time, although, perhaps, he was not so prominently identified with the movement as I was. I was a member of the Separation League Committee, and also at the head of the largest organization of men on the gold-fields, occupying at the time perhaps the most representative position of any single individual there. Therefore, when I am contradicting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> statements, I wish it to be understood that I know what I am speaking of, and the exact position of affairs on the gold-fields in those days. As a matter of fact, not only did the people of the gold-fields come into the Federation with the true Federal spirit, in order that Australia might be a united country, recognising that if one-third of the Continent stood out of the Federation it would be a very one-sided and far from complete union, but, whilst they were imbued with that true Federal spirit, they also had regard to the material advantages that they hoped to get from Federation. I remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> came to Kalgoorlie at that time and addressed us in the Wesley an Church. I heard him speak then, and I also heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> speak on another occasion. This particular railway was promised to the men of the gold-fields so clearly and explicitly by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that I am astonished that at this date, some seven or eight years afterwards, he should have the audacity to rise in his place in this Chamber and say that the men of the goldfields had nothing of the kind in their minds. </para>

I give that statement also a flat contradiction. How could the honorable senator believe that the men on the gold-fields were such blockheads as to imagine that they could get a railway to Esperance by coming into the Federation when they knew that that would be a railway within the State, and not ah InterState railway, such as that now under consideration ? </para>

                            <para>- I have risen to contradict certain statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> and I shall be as brief as possible. That honorable and learned senator has said that this is " a railway in the clouds," but he did not say that in 1899. He did not say it when he went to Western Australia to offer every inducement to the people of that State to join the Federation. He dwelt then upon the material advantages which the people of Western Australia would gain from the construction of the line if they entered the Federation, and he pointed out the risk they would run of losing those advantages if they did not join the Federation. The honorable senator not only said that there was a possibility of the construction of the line, but that if was certain to be constructed in the near future. ' Here we are seven or eight years afterwards fighting for a mere survey of the line, and we are now told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that it is a "railway in the clouds." I wish again to place on record the statement made by the honorable and. learned senator in his letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> James - </para>

                        <para>There are immense material advantages to Western Australia in coming into the Union now which will be imperilled should she postpone the auspicious day. Amongst these advantages you should not overlook the following :  - First, Federation must inevitably give to Western Australia at an early date a transcontinental railway - not a railway in the clouds. that will be one outward and visible link <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> join Western Australia with the rest of the federating Colonies. In my belief, the acceptance of the Commonwealth Bill by Western Australia will mean the speedy acceptance of that work by the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para class="block">That apparently was a case of " Come into my parlour said the spider to the fly," because eight years after he wrote that statement we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> declaring on the floor of this chamber that there is no need to bother about the railway at present because it is a matter that is still in the clouds. If the honorable and learned senator had made that statement to the people of Western Australia eight years ago they would have been able to appreciate it better than they can do to-day. As the honorable senator has made these statements over and over again, I am satisfied that I have done my duty in giving them a flat contradiction, knowing, as I do, the position of affairs in the gold-fields in those days. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel NEILD</inline>(New South Wales) [12.7].- The honorable senator who has just addressed the Senate has, perhaps, hardly dealt fairly with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> I do not know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> would thank me for saying anything on his behalf, but in the interest of fair play, and in the absence of that honorable and learned senator, I feel that I am justified in pointing out that the attitude assumed by him has been one of favour to the railway survey, with the condition precedent of the consent of the South Australian Parliament being obtained. Whatever value may attach to the speeches of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> the honorable senator's vote has certainly gone in the direction I have indicated - approval of the Bill, coupled with the consent of the South Australian Parliament. I do not know enough of South Australian politics to be able to say what value the people of that State would attach to the amendment carried in Committee, but as honorably safeguarding the funds at the disposal of the Commonwealth Parliament it meets my view of what is a fair and square deal. If, as has been suggested, the amendment will result in delay, it must be patent that it will be due to the fact that the conditions are not equal. The Parliament of South Australia is in session at the present time, and if it represents public opinion in the State on this question there should be no difficulty whatever in carrying the legal provision . which the amendment indicates as necessary. </para>

                            <para>- It has been a Government question every time, and with every Government, and it goes without saying that when a Government makes a question a Government question, it becomes a party question. I have been in  Western Australia a couple' of times within the last  twelve or fourteen months, and while there I endeavoured to obtain as much information about the line as I possibly could, because I wished to get the "hang" of the thing. I was assured over and over again that the supporters of the line were merely " a John Forrest cult." I do not think I shall be doing any harm in repeating the representations made to me in different parts of the State. It is well known that the people of the gold-fields desire a line to Esperance Bay, and do not want this line. When that statement was made to me I said, "If the people of the gold-fields do not want the line how is it that the representatives of Western Australia, who all belong to the Labour party, are supporting it?" This was the answer I got in more places than one, and from more than one person : " You see, the Labour members have the full support of the gold-fields vote, and what they want to get is the vote of the metropolitan area first, and the adjoining area of Fremantle. They have already booked the gold-fields vote; they want the coastal vote, which is now a conservative vote, and they think they can get that by supporting the railway." It appeared that they thought that by making friends of the mammon of unrighteousness they could obtain the coastal vote. </para>

                            <para>- I never went to the gold-fields. I was quite satisfied with the fine panoramic photographs of them which I obtained. If the honorable senator wants to know my experience, I shall be delighted to tell him how I fared in what was called a dining-car, but which I regarded as the most efficient churn that human ingenuity ever designed. Now the line from Coolgardie to Esperance Bay - which is a very decent natural harbor - will  cover a little over  100  miles. From Esperance Bay to Adelaide, by water, the distance is  800  miles. Therefore the whole distance by water and rail from Adelaide to the gold-fields is less than  1,000  miles. The distance by the proposed railway from Adelaide to Kalgoorlie would be  1,500  miles by land, as against  800  miles of sea carriage - practically a two and a half days' trip on steamers which are quickening their rates of transit every day. Now, let me ask my honorable friend whether there is any railway line in the world that does not pay on its goods traffic rather than on its passenger traffic? Every one knows that that rule applies not only to railways, but also lo shipping. It is the goods that the mail steamers carry which enable them to pay their way. The money paid by passengers merely represents the occupancy of the upper portions of the ship where cargo cannot be stored. I am in a position to state positively, because the. information was given to me very recently, that the cost of running a mail steamer between England and Australia is not less than  £40,000  per round trip. </para>

                            <para>- My authority for that statement is the Superintendent of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, who gave it to me from his own note-book. The profit is made out of goods, not out of passenger fares. Now, is it to be contended that a line  1,500  miles in length from Adelaide to Kalgoorlie will be likely to carry goods at a profit, as against a journey of  800  miles by sea, and a run by rail of about  100  miles from Esperance Bay ? It stands to reason that the goods must always go by water rather than by the overland route. </para>

                            <para>- The question before us is undoubtedly that of the survey of a line between certain points. But, during the whole of the debate, the question has arisen whether the survey is desirable in view of the fact that in the opinion of some honorable senators it is not wise to construct such a railway, in any event. That being the case, I consider that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is in order in pointing out the difficulties that will probably occur should  the railway be built. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has not understood my point. What I desire to make clear is that in addition to the  1,100  miles of railway between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta, there is the distance between Port Augusta and Adelaide that has to be considered; and that the question of water carriage and railway carriage inevitably arises. I have been endeavouring to show that from the point of view of goods traffic, a journey of  1,500  miles cannot compare with a sea journey to Esperance Bay, and a short railway run from Esperance to Coolgardie. My whole object is to show that if the proposed line were built, it "would never be used for goods. For instance, it would be impossible to send butter by the line, because, for every pound of butter sent  1  cwt. of ice would be required to keep it sweet in going through a heated country, where the rainfall, according to official publications, is only  5  inches per annum. The evaporation would be phenomenal - far greater than even on the west coast of Western Australia, where the evaporation is so great that, on <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest's splendid water scheme from Mandeering weir to the gold-fields, absolutely less water is supplied to the people than' is lost by evaporation <inline font-style="italic">en route.</inline> That fact is shown by official publications  handed to me a few weeks ago by the U0vernment of Western Australia. When even in the Perth district, where the evaporation is nothing like so great as it is over the route of the railway, and where the rainfall is  36  inches per annum, the evaporation is so great, what must it be in a district where the rainfall is only  5  inches per annum? On the great water scheme, it is positively a fact that a larger number of gallons of water evaporate than are pumped for the service of the people. </para>

If there be such a gigantic evaporation in a district which has vast agricultural areas, and a large rainfall, what will the evaporation be where there is an exceedingly small rainfall ? In the circumstances, it is evident that if the railway were built, it would Le the most costly to run and maintain of any railway, certainly in Australia, perhaps in the world. I have now said what I have <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> say in opposition to the Bill. I do not, however, wish to delay the final stages of it. I shall vote against the third reading without offering any factious opposition merely discharging what I believe. to be my duty to those who have sent me here, and to the taxpayers of Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - I propose to' say a few words, lest my silence should be misunderstood. I very much regret the personal recriminations which have taken place this morning, and cannot help feeling conscientiously that so far as the attack which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has made applies to myself it is unwarranted. The honorable senator went so far as to doubt my veracity. He would not, I think, attempt to do so in private life, and why he should do so in connexion with political matters is more than I can understand. Let rae point out what has happened in connexion with this matter. Ora the several occasions on which this Bill lias been introduced in the Senate, it has been in charge of senators who have distinctly and firmly stated that they were not in favour of the construction of the line, at least until they got further information. On the first occasion, when it was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> it is perfectly true that I offered strenuous opposition to the measure. But there are many honorable senators present who know why I was incensed. They know that it was really because of the procedure adopted, and the introduction of the Bill in the very expiring moments of the session. </para>

                            <para>- I told several honorable senators that I would be no party whatever to blocking the measure. I said, " I will pair " - which I did, if I remember rightly, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> - and I took no further part in the proceedings. It was while that was going on that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> and I had the conversation to which I have recently referred. My honorable friend happened to be sitting in the Senate when I was making the statement at the outset. He has verified what I said, although I feel that it is most humiliating to have to 'ask for any such verification from another honorable senator. If it were necessary, it could be verified from several sources. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has told the Senate that he has a perfect recollection of the conversation which occurred. Then it was that, after consulting together, we recognised that the Bill had been passed by the other House on several occasions, and by large majorities. We recognised that, after all, it was but a Survey Bill, and we both stated that it was not our intention on any other occasion to vote against it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,-</inline> I am given to understand, spoke on that occasion, and he told what we two had decided to do. </para>

                            <para>- I had already intimated that it was not my intention to speak. Undoubtedly, if I had spoken, I should have followed the same course as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> did. But if honorable senators cast any doubt or reflection on my statement, 1" fear that I have lived eighteen years in public life utterly in vain. I cannot understand why, at this period, any statements I' have made, which happen by accident to be verified, should be doubted. I regret what has taken place. I am in the same position as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> He frankly told the Senate, as I did, that he was not in favour of the construction of the line until he had obtained further information. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> said so also. I have honestly and frankly told the Senate the same thing. </para>

I am anxious that the best information should be obtained. I look upon the proposed survey as a means of obtaining such information. Moreover, I feel that it is necessary that it should be obtained in order to enable the Parliament to decide when the line should be constructed. That it will be constructed at some time I have not the slightest doubt. </para>

                            <para>- I was desirous that the information should be obtained in order that Parliament should be able to decide as to when the line should be constructed. I have made this explanation, because I thought that silence on my part might have been misunderstood. I regret that heat has been introduced in the debate. I hope that after my statement honorable senators will see that I have acted <inline font-style="italic">bond fide.</inline> Even if I had not been called upon incidentally to make the explanation, honorable senators with great parliamentary experience know that on many matters, particularly such a small matter as this, involving a very limited sum, a Minister, when he takes office, is bound to yield to the general policy of the Government. So Tar, every Government of the Commonwealth have made the survey of a route for this line part and parcel of their policy. </para>

It is a complementary measure to the Judiciary Bill, which has been forwarded to the other' House. It has been discussed exhaustively, and I do not think that there can be any serious objection to its being read a third time to-day, and transmitted to the other House. I shall be very glad if my honorable friends on the other side will give the necessary consent. </para>

States of certain obligations which they are now meeting. There is no provision at present for the Commonwealth to do anything of the kind. </para>

                        <para>- We are dealing with the subject as it has been dealt with in every one of the States and the United Kingdom. No provision is made for the imposition of taxation in the Acts of the States, or of the United Kingdom, corresponding to this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> asked me specifically, last night, whether if we negatived sub-clause 2 of this clause we should also have to negative sub-clause 1. I replied that sub-clause 1 had reference only to Acts dealing with bills of exchange and corresponding Acts similar to this Bill, which made provision with regard to the general features of bills of exchange, but imposed no taxation on them. The taxation imposable on bills of exchange in the United Kingdom and the Australian States is the subject-matter of separate legislation. Until we are prepared, like the States and the United Kingdom, to bring down a comprehensive Stamp Duties Bill, we should not consider any proposition to take away from the States revenue which they at present enjoy. The amendment, if carried, would mean very serious financial loss to the States. Why should we do that, I might almost say, wantonly ? </para>

                        <para>- Not at all. I do not think that Federation was ever established for the purpose of depriving the States of revenue unless it was absolutely obligatory on the Commonwealth in the fulfilment of its functions to do so. I have already pointed out that our information shows that to carry the amendment would mean an annual loss to Tasmania alone of £10,600 a year. I assume that there would be a corresponding, if not a greater, loss to each of the other States. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no intention to argue this question from its constitutional aspect. I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that we have the power to do what he proposes, and I know he is actuated by the very best motives, but I also agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that the time is not yet ripe for us to exercise our power. We ought to be very careful in exercising all the powers we have under the Constitution. We are essentially a States' House, and, although I do not desire to carry that idea to any extreme length, still this is one of the instances where we might very well take a stand to protect the States revenues. I shall vote against the amendment, because, if carried, it would rob Western Australia of, or, rather, reduce the revenue of Western Australia by, £20,000. When I see a State endeavouring to meet its liabilities by imposing certain taxation, I do not like to interfere to deprive it of the right to do so. The taxation in the various States on these instruments has been imposed by men elected to the popular Houses on as broad a franchise as we ourselves have been elected on, with the exception, perhaps, of Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot help the retrogressive tendencies of the State which the honorable senator represents.. This tax was imposed- in Western Australia by a Legislative Assembly elected on a popular franchise. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has stated that he will oppose the imposition of land taxation by this Parliament, but I am prepared to exercise all the powers the Constitution gives us to impose a tax on land values, because all the States are not doing their duty in that direction. Western Australia has made an honest attempt to impose a tax 'on land values, and is about to make another. It will not be wise at this juncture to exercise the exclusive powers which the Constitution has given us in the subject now under discussion. In view of the fact that it would cripple Western Australia at the present time, to lose £20,000 of revenue, I could not honestly, Federalist though I am, and desirous as I am of voting on all occasions for. the exercise of all our powers, vote for this amendment in justice to my State at the present juncture. I urge the honorable senator to withdraw the amendment, because it would, if carried, vitally affect the revenue of all the States. If he presses the amendment to a vote, as he has the right to do, I shall certainly resist it to the last. </para>

                    <para>. - I join with other honorable senators in urging <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to withdraw the amendment. Queensland would lose very heavily in revenue by it. One of the honorable senator's arguments was that it would be better to have taxation imposed on some other basis, but a provision to alter the basis of taxation does not come within the scope of a Bill of this sort, which is merely a code law. It will always be possible later on to deal with this matter, when the whole question of the imposition of taxation is brought before us. This does not seem to be the place to discuss it, as it involves a big principle in the method of taxation. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> not to force us to vote against him, as. we shall be compelled to do if the amendment goes to a division. </para>

But the clause as it stands will, if passed, do that, and so I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> will be with me in opposing sub-clause  2.  It will affect to a considerable extent the revenues of the various States. It is a great mistake, in a Bill of this sort, to interfere with the taxation schemes of the States. To do so will not help to promote that harmonious feeling which we are all desirous of maintaining. It is a kind of capricious interference, without much to warrant it. The only justification it can have is the desire for uniformity which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has advocated. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Bill has been in the possession of honorable senators since the 7 th August, when it was received from another place. I think I am fairly correct in assuming that the materials of the Bill are not in any sense of the word novel to honorable senators. During the last session of the last Parliament a somewhat similar Bill was submitted, and after passing another place, was received in the Senate. If my recollection serves me rightly, that Bill passed its second reading in the Senate, but there was a considerable amount of disfavour shown by individual members of the Senate to certain proposals contained in it. It was then, I think, suggested that the Government might have taken an opportunity to consult experts from the different States with a view to ascertaining what particular industries could best be assisted by means of the bounty system. The Government had not taken that .course previously to the introduction of the Bill of 1906, but a Committee of the Cabinet had gone as carefully as possible into the whole question, and a" report by the Committee had been circulated amongst members of both Houses. During the recess that has intervened, the Government, acting upon the suggestion put forward in the Senate,, asked the States Governments to nominate certain representatives to sit together, and in consultation and conference consider the whole scheme of assisting new industries into being in the Commonwealth, and of stimulating already established industries by means of bounties. That Conference met in Melbourne in April last. All the States were represented with the exception of Queensland and Tasmania. However, the Government of Queensland subsequently furnished, through one of their expert officers, very valuable information in the nature of a report and suggestion on the proposals contained in the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Different officers, attended to different details, but the information was received through the one channel. For all diplomatic purposes, if I may so call them, we can regard the Queensland information as coming from one officer, although I understand that the State Government called to their aid the experience and advice of officers engaged in different parts of Queensland in connexion with various industries. So far as Parliament is concerned it has to be remembered that we have under the Constitution the exclusive legislative jurisdiction in relation to bounties. After the imposition of uniform duties of Customs and Excise, which has already taken place, as honorable senators are aware, the Constitution provides that the Commonwealth Parliament shall .have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to. the granting of bounties upon the production and export of goods. In these circumstances the Government necessarily had to consider whether it was a correct time to call upon Parliament to exercise its legislative powers in this regard, and to what extent. As to whether this is a correct time, first of all, I should like to point out to honorable senators that I believe there is a general consensus of opinion amongst all parties that it is desirable that Australia should, as soon as possible, be more extensively populated by a thriving and industrious people, preferably of our own race; at any rate, of our own colour, who will work in harmony with those already in the Commonwealth, not merely in developing the resources of the continent, but also in defending these fair States against any foreign aggression. It is necessary, therefore, for the Parliament, in order to secure an increased population of a desirable character, to find so far as it can legitimately, in the exercise of its ordinary legislative functions, as many  avenues for profitable occupation as possible. We have already a very extensive territory. It is not necessary for me to enter into details with which honorable senators are acquainted as to the area, bounddaries, length, or breadth of that territory, lt is sufficient to say that it embraces a number of diverse climates, and that it is constituted of areas and of soils very diverse in their capabilities for production. It has been said more than once, and in many places, that there is hardly a human requirement that some part or other of the Commonwealth is not capable of producing. I do not think that a proposition of that kind would be seriously disputed by anybody. But it might be argued that in the instance of some forms of production the conditions usually applicable to the work involved are such as would not favorably appeal to the people of this community. In the circumstances it has been necessary for the Government to make their inquiries as exhaustive as possible ; to see . what industries that do not already exist in the Commonwealth might be brought into being by the stimulus of bounties, and what industries that are already established, and give no hope of permanent expansion, without assistance, might by such means be encouraged. The Conference of State officers that was called together during the present year had submitted to it the principles upon which the Government wished to proceed in their desire to increase the productivity of the Commonwealth, and to open further avenues of profitable employment to people here, or to the people of our own colour who might be induced to settle here. </para>

                            <para>- The matters to which I have referred were submitted to the Conference. There was the general principle that it was desirable, in the view of the Government, that further opportunities or inducements should be given to persons to embark in the cultivation of products that have not yet found a place among our primary industries, whilst we also desired the encouragement of industries already entered upon with practically only a small measure of success, owing to the competition of better, because longer established, production in other countries. The members of the Conference were also supplied with the Bounties Bill, introduced in the last session of the last Parliament. Their report has been circulated, and honorable senators will have observed that in dealing with many of the items to which they specifically refer, mention is made of the proposals contained in that Bill. Speaking generally, most of the items contained in this Bill were contained in the former Bill. Some of the items in the latter measure were, however, struck out. </para>

In addition, there have been some additional items inserted in this Bill, and as I have been reminded, some of the proposals it contained, as originally submitted to Parliament, have in another place failed to meet with the acceptance of the majority of honorable members there. The general principle of this Bill is this : - That a sum of £412,500, as a maximum, shall be expended under a system of bounties for the promotion and encouragement of industries in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Its expenditure is to be spread over a period of fifteen years, commencing from the 1st July last. The Bill sets out in a schedule the goods in respect of which the bounties will be payable, and specifies the period during which the bounties will be claimable in respect thereof. It also sets out the rates at which the bounties will be payable, and the annual maximum, which must in no case be exceeded. Honorable senators will find that in the second schedule there appears a table setting forth the maximum amounts which may be expended for the whole purposes of the Bill up to certain dates. For instance, it is shown that up to the 30th June, 1908, the total amount which may' be expended is £60,000. Up to the 30th June, 1909, no more than £118,000 may be expended, and so on up to the 30th June, 1922, the  total amount that may be expended being given. In the first schedule there is a provision as to the maximum amount which may be paid in any one year. Provision is also made in a clause, to which I shall hereafter refer, for regulations to prescribe the method of distributing the bounties where the goods, in respect of which they are claimed are of such value that, if bounties were paid in respect of them all, the maximum amount prescribed for the year would be exceeded. Meanwhile, as far as the text of the Bill is concerned, apart from the schedules, the conditions under which the bounties may be claimed and become payable are specified. The first essential to the establishment of a claim is that the goods must be the product of the Commonwealth. To that general principle there is one exception, to which I invite the attention of honorable senators. I refer to fish. It is provided that, inasmuch as the bounty is to be given for the preserving of fish as prescribed, the fish itself need not necessarily be the product of Commonwealth waters in the generally accepted meaning of "the term. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly ; the fish may be caught in waters which, territorially speaking, are not the waters of the Commonwealth so long as the preserving operations upon which the claim for a bounty is grounded take place within Australia, and under the conditions prescribed. Another condition is that in regard to goods which are manufactured from raw materials in respect of which bounties may be claimed, the materials themselves must be Australian. Those conditions, in themselves, would be insufficient, and it is therefore further provided that the goods in respect of which the bounties are claimed must be of a merchantable quality in the ordinary sense of the term. It is also provided, in respect of food products that they must be of a prescribed quality. Another condition is that the goods must be produced, not in infinitesimal quantities, but in reasonable quantities. Regulations may be made prescribing the minimum quantities in respect of the several classes of goods, in order to enable claims for the bounties to be sustained. The next condition to which I will refer is that the goods must be produced by white labour only, except in circumstances such as those that apply to the sugar bounty. That is to say, where an aboriginal native of Australia is employed in connexion with the production of any of them, it will not' disqualify a claimant for. the bounty. Further, if a person has been born in Australia, and one of his parents is a coloured person, his or her employment will not disqualify a claimant for a bounty. It is also provided that it shall be a condition to the granting of a bounty that the standard rate of wages in the district have been paid to the labour employed. That condition applies, of course, only to the payment for labour outside the family of the person engaged in the producing of the goods. It will be seen, I trust, that the conditions attached to the granting of these bounties are reasonable, and in accordance with the declared policy of the Commonwealth. </para>

I did not intend, in introducing the measure, to enter into details as to particular items contained in the schedule. It was rather my purpose to indicate the general scope of the Bill. There are honorable senators who are far better qualified than I can claim to be to give reasons for the granting of a bounty for the production of any particular article. </para>

                            <para>- And also to stimulate industries already in existence. When we deal with the items in the schedule in Committee, no doubt honorable senators will be able to furnish information to show the extent to which particular industries ar: carried on. For instance, the first item pf the schedule relates to cotton ginned. That is not an entirely new industry in Australia. The cotton industry was established as far back as the time of the American Civil War, and bounties were paid for its encouragement. After the termination of the war - -probably owing to that and other causes - the industry practically  went out of existence. Subsequently it was revived on a comparatively small scale, and during the last six or eight years it has had a variety of ups and downs.  Coffee growing, also, is established to a small extent in at least one State. </para>

Another point to which I wish to draw attention is that generally speaking the bounties are to be payable to the growers or the producers of the articles in question. But there are some exceptions. Such an exception applies to fish. The bounty is not to be paid to the fishermen who catch the. fish, but to the persons responsible for its preserving and canning. </para>

If if were to be paid for the catching of the fish it might have no effect whatever from the point of view of the industry which we desire to promote, because the fish might be thrown into the water as soon as the bounty was paid. </para>

                            <para>- We have a similar position in regard to fruits dried or candied. It is not proposed that the bounty shall be paid to the grower of the fruit, but in respect of what may be called the manufacturing industry that will spring up in association with the growing. The 'bounty is to be paid to the manufacturer - that is, the person who carries on the process of drying or candying. In some instances, I understand, the manufacturer is hardly a middleman, because the persons who grow the fruit: carry on drying and preserving operations for themselves. The same principle applies to combed wool or tops. The bounty in that case is to operate from the 1st July next. It is at the rate of  1½d.  per lb., and is to be paid not to the grower of the wool, but to the manufacturer, who, bv putting up his plant, and establishing the process in Australia, combs the wool, and makes the tops for export. Very little work of this kind is done at present in Australia, but we are assured that the conditions are such that if the combing of wool were carried out extensively in Australia, Australian wool in that form would occupy an even higher position than it does under present circumstances. </para>

Although we have produced tops only to a small extent in the past, it is considered that in the interests of our own- wool industry, it will be advisable to increase their manufacture, in order that our wool in that form may command even a higher respect in the world's market than it does, to-day.

                            <para>- This Bill provides for a bounty on . the production of these articles for export. The only other features to which I wish to draw attention are features which are common to Bills of a like character, and to very many measures  which we have passed. In clause 7 the Bill provides for the punishment of persons who, by false or fraudulent means, endeavour to obtain the benefit of its provisions. In clause 8, it makes adequate provision for the punishment of persons who aid and abet the commission of offences. Some features of the administration of the Bill will have to find their place in regulations, and clause 9 enables the Governor-General to make regulations in respect of various matters which are therein set out. I do not think that there is anything else of a general character which I need now indicate or invite attention to. </para>

                            <para>- That, I think, is a view on which my honorable friend will lay due' stress at the proper time. In the Tariff the duty on some of the items contained in the schedule has been increased. For instance, the duty on tobacco leaf for the manufacture of cigars has been raised. The duty on preserved fish has been increased from id. to ijd. per lb. And the duty on dates has been increased from icl. to 2d. per lb. </para>

                            <para>- Because dates are already grown in the Commonwealth. A good many dates are being imported. It would be very advantageous if much of the central lands of Australia were planted with date trees. Although it takes a considerable time - from five to eight years, I. think - for date trees to come into bearing, yet once, they do bear they last for a very long time. I believe it is on record that date trees have been yielding fruit for 1 80 years. </para>

                            <para>- I do not expect the Queenslanders to oppose the proposal. I hope that honorable senators will recognise that no particular State can claim a monopoly of the supply of any number of these products. The schedule includes many items which each State may be said to be equally adapted to produce. I hope that honorable senators will consider that the Bill is designed to meet the . requirements, not of a particular State, but of the Commonwealth as a whole. If it is thought by honorable senators that some of the industries which it is proposed to stimulate or encourage would better find a habitation in the north of Australia than in the south, I hope that they will also remember that it is eminently desirable that much' of the northern lands . of Australia should, as early as possible, be effectively occupied by people who will work harmoniously with us in developing the resources of the Commonwealth and defending it against aggression. </para>

                            <para>- My attention has been drawn to the fact, because I have received a circular asking me to go into an enterprise of that kind. Hie rubber plant  may be grown in Papua under conditions which we should not like to be associated with an industry in the Commonwealth. I am not familiar with the conditions, but it is known that rubber trees have to be planted for a considerable time before one can expect to get any return from them. My honorable friend will probably remember that Tasmania brought into existence the woollen industry - one of the best industries, I think, in the Commonwealth - by the stimulus of a bounty. I believe it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peter</inline> Bulman, who successfully claimed the bounty offered years previously by the Tasmanian Parliament. In every other State, no doubt, bounties have been offered, at some time, for the purpose of promoting new industries. Certainly a similar plan has been followed, and followed with signal success, in other countries. </para>

I believe that the schedule is as comprehensive as it can be made from a thoroughly Australian stand-point. It will promote the encouragement of industries for which the country is suited, and be one further means of effectively increasing the population, the productiveness, and the defence strength of the Commonwealth. </para>

As the members of both Houses are elected on the same franchise, I see no reason why the Senate should always be kept waiting for business to come from another place. The Government programme contains one or two measures which might very well be introduced here at the earliest possible moment, so as to keep us occupied for the next few weeks, until we get the Tariff and other business from the other House. </para>

                            <para>- I did not interrupt the honorable senator, and I hope that he will not interrupt me. A number of measures have been introduced here. What I object to is an adjournment for a day or for several days. When it is intended to have an adjournment, let us do the business which has been initiated here and received from another place, and then adjourn long enough to enable the senators from Queensland and Western Australia, if they wish, to visit their States. There are several honorable senators who remind me of sailors. If they are not kept with their noses to the grindstone all the time they will do nothing but growl. </para>

                        <para>. - I have always objected to finnicky adjournments. I think that when we are sitting we should be kept fully supplied with business, and that when there is a probability of business becoming slack we should get an adjournment long enough to enable honorable senators who live far away to visit their constituents. Anything less than  a month's adjournment is useless to me; it only compels me to walk about the streets of Melbourne with practically nothing to do. It takes me eight days <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> get to my home, and eight days to return. In order to do that, I must leave Melbourne on a particular day in the week, and at the other end I must do just the same. </para>

Honorable senators who come to Melbourne from distant States should, while they are here, be kept as fully supplied with business as possible, and when there is no prospect of a sufficient supply of work to keep them fully occupied, the Vice-President of the Executive Council should consent to a reasonable adjournment which will give them an opportunity of visiting their homes. </para>

Givens'</inline> statement that under present arrangements, we, w.ho come from distant States, only sit two and a half or three days a week, and have to hang round Melbourne for the remainder of that time. Honorable senators from States other than Queensland and Western Australia can go home every week end. We cannot afford lo visit the nearer States at week ends, as has been suggested, as we receive only a certain allowance, and, being poor, re compelled to remain in Melbourne, because it is cheaper to do so. Several honorable senators have been suffering from severe colds and influenza, and we might recover if we could only get away to a more genial climate for a few weeks. - I have been very unwell myself for the last ten days; and if I could have a little time to get properly warmed through, I should become convalescent much more quickly. I know half-a-dozen other honorable senators who are in poor health at the present time. </para>

If the former, the Vice-President of the Executive Council will be doing justice to us and to the country by refusing to listen to the request made. It is quite easy for the Government to arrange for us to have business to do, so inaugurating a system by which the Senate will have an increasingly larger and stronger hand in the initiation of legislation. That would be not  only good for the Senate, but beneficial to the whole of Australia. If much of the legislation now on the Statute Book' had been initiated in the Senate, there would have been a greater completeness and thought about it than has .been achieved by the reverse process. Before I became a senator I held, and I intend to hold it still more strongly here, that this Senate should be in Australia what the Senate is in America. It will not be my fault if it is not. The American Senate is the strongest Upper Chamber in the world. </para>

                        <para>. - I. have not at all overlooked the representations which have been made by honorable senators. We have been able, since the 3rd July, to keep hard at work without a solitary request for an adjournment. My anxiety has been to introduce the Navigation Bill very soon. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> tells me that the final report of the Navigation Commission will probably reach the Government on Wednesday or Thursday next. After that, the Bill, of course, must be prepared. It is in course of preparation now, but we found, as in the case of the Tariff, that we were not in a position to complete it until the final report of the Commission came to hand. From the very beginning of the session it has been my desire that we should get through as much legislative work as we could. We have had some high-class measures before us, which have been carefully analyzed and discussed. I am anxious that, if possible, we shall deal speedily with the Bounties Bill, the Quarantine Bill, and the Navigation Bill, and then adjourn for three weeks or a month, as honorable senators have suggested. That adjournment could take place between the conclusion of a part of our legislative work and the commencement of our Tariff work. That is what I have been aiming at all along, and I have been a little disappointed at not having been able to make progress with the Navigation Bill. That has not been through want of effort on my part, because I have been pushing it on as far as I could. Next week we shall go on with the Bounties' Bill. In fact, I gave honorable senators who were eager for work the opportunity if they had so desired to discuss it this afternoon. </para>

After the completion of the business I have outlined, I hope we shall receive the Quarantine Bill. If, then, there is an opportunity of going on with the Navigation Bill, I am anxious to do so.
