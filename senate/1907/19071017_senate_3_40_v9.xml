                    <para> - When I received a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof this morning, I learned that a very disgraceful accusation was made against me in the Senate last night by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in saying that I, as a member of the Disputed Returns and Qualifications Committee, prophesied what its report would be. Last night I did not hear the interjection properly, and so I take this opportunity of repudiating, in the most emphatic manner in which any living creature could repudiate such a charge, that I ever gave any justification for the accusation. Never at any time did I indicate in the remotest manner what the decision of the Committee would be. The words attributed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> are -</para>

My meaning was that the honorable senator was prophetic in that before the Committee had sat he had passed judgment. I have just been furnished by an honorable senator with a copy of the notice-paper for the  1 8th  July. On the  17th  July the honorable senator gave notice of his intention to move on the  25th  July the following motion -</para>

                        <para>. - There is an old saying that* "Fools rush in where angels fear to tread." It is not a pleasant task for me to speak on this motion, especially as it is considered to involve a question of law, or, as it has been called repeatedly, a question of " dry law." So far three members of the legal profession have addressed the Senate. I am not sure as to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> St. Ledger meant when he spoke, but the other two senators - Senators Symon and Best, who are leading luminaries in the profession - differed very considerably from each other. My intention is to treat the subject in a rather different way. I propose to enlighten the Senate, if I can, with reference to the history of this unfortunate election, in which I, like the leader of the Opposition and the mover of this motion, was concerned. </para>

                            <para>- I hope to obtain protection from you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> this afternoon. I admired the manner in which you managed the business of the Senate when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was speaking yesterday. I believe that if a mouse had crawled across the floor during the pauses in his speech, we should have heard it. Although some honorable senators may be familiar with the history of that election, I ask for the indulgence of the Senate while I refer to what transpired during the election. It was a party election from start to finish. The candidates were <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon, Mr. Vardon,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> M. Charleston, an ex-senator, who were run by the Conservative Party for all they were worth; ex-Senator Playford stood as the representative of the Government of the Commonwealth, and the other three candidates were Mr. Blundell!, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby,</inline> and myself. We had about three months of hard work over the election, travelling all over South Australia. I and my two comrades were supported by the Labour Party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was supported by the other side, and one of his comrades on that occasion was the petitioner. I do not say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> would do an unfair thing; but I put it to the Senate, if I had the honour of being elected to the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications, with four other senators from this side of the Chamber, do honorable senators think that the decision of the Committee would have been the same? Would the other side have been so well satisfied as they are today? I am afraid that they would not. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Symon</inline> to make my speech on this occasion. I am here to let the Senate know exactly where I stand as a representative of South Australia, and to defend the action taken by the Parliament of that State, because they were commanded to take it. I shall support the amendment moved by the leader of the Government in this Chamber. When the election took place, and the votes were counted, it was found that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and myself were ahead, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby,</inline> who unfortunately , has since died, was fourteen votes ahead of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon.</inline> The latter, who is the petitioner in this case, was the first to take action. He asked for and obtained a recount. It was discovered that a remarkable incident had occurred at Hindmarsh., whereby <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby</inline> had received some eighty votes which were meant for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Playford.</inline> When those were deducted from. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby's</inline> votes, and other figures rectified, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was declared to be thirty-four ahead. We were told yesterday that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon,</inline> never was elected, and therefore never was a senator. If it had not been for the Labour Party taking action to have a petition presented against his return, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> would have been sitting here to-day as a senator, unchallenged in any respect. It is therefore a matter of circumstances that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was bowled out, and his election proved invalid. After the recount, by which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was found to be thirty-four votes ahead, a petition from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blundell,</inline> who is now a member of the South Australian </para>

                    <para class="block">Parliament, was brought before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton, sitting as a Court of Disputed Returns. The fresh recount reduced <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon's</inline> majority from thirty-four to two, but a large number of informal votes were considered. It appeared that there had been a great deal of bad management in the election, and that some of the  deputy  returning officers either had not initialed the ballot-papers at all, or had initialed them on the wrong side. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton stated - I did not hear this quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> when he was speaking yesterday - that if those votes, which the electors gave in all honesty and straightforwardness, could have been counted, had they been properly initialed, and had the Court been able to accept them, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby</inline> would have been four votes ahead. </para>

I am not responsible for what the press said, and I do not apply that name to the proceedings of the Committee, but I know, and if allowed I could produce the statement that was actually made, that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin,</inline> a layman, rose to put his version of the case, in the presence of a legal adviser on the other side, he met with all manner of opposition from the  chairman  of the Committee. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw the statement. I had quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton's statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby</inline> would have been four votes ahead. Therefore, had those informal votes been allowable, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby</inline> would have been elected by the people. The Senate knows as well as I do what muddles took place in connexion with the election. There were not only those informal votes, which would in all probability have turned the election, but when the second re-count was being conducted an official stated on oath that a large parcel of ballot-papers had been burnt. It has since been discovered that they were not burnt. Without casting any reflection on the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications, I may say that the fact that those ballot-papers, which were alleged to have been burnt, had been discovered intact, became public property while the Committee were sitting. Seeing that the election was so closely contested,  I thought with the man in the street that it would have been a proper thing for the Committee te have taken some action to have those ballot-papers counted. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> knows all about it, but I am only a layman and am expressing the view which a lot of people took of the matter. The alleged burning of those ballot-papers was one of the grounds on which the election was upset, and seeing that there had been such a close contest I thought it would have been wise to have had those papers counted. On 'the declaration of the poll, three persons were declared elected as senators; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> myself, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon.</inline> Their election was duly certified. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> on that very day took the afternoon train from Melbourne in order to visit Queensland. There was no harm in his doing that, and I do not blame him. He was reaping the benefit of a free pass, and yet according to one of his colleagues he never was a senator. </para>

                            <para>- No, but it showed that he acted as a senator from the beginning. He occupied a seat in this Chamber and voted on the Conservative side on two or three occasions. He occupied a seat as a senator, and drew salary for nearly six months. I do not blame <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> for that, because in my opinion he was entitled to do so, since he had been elected a senator. Some persons have said that he should have returned the salary he received. I have heard it stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon,</inline> not being a. senator, should not have drawn six months' pay at the time. I am not one of those who hold that view, because I think it would be a cruel shame to expect <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> to refund the. money. I think that the Government should have borne some of the expense to which he was put through no fault of his own. He was declared by the Returning Officer to have been duly elected. We heard yesterday from the other side that that was illegal and improper, and from this side that it was quite legal and proper, and I must say that between the Vice-President of the Executive Council and the leader of the Opposition, I give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> the palm. I direct the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to the peculiar position taken by a constitutional lawyer like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> in suggesting that we should decide this matter in accordance with the view of the man in the street rather than according to  the  Constitution. I do not say that the honorable and learned senator was unfair, because it may have  Deen  his opinion, but he demanded that in dealing with this matter a lot of notice should be taken of the opinion of the man in the street. I have often heard something very different from Conservatives. I have heard the men in the street spoken of as "the mob," "the masses," "the dangerous classes that cannot be trusted." What has happened to bring about so great a change? What is behind it? Is it that a bird in the' hand is considered worth two in the bush ? Do honorable senators opposite hope that possibly a Labour senator may lose his seat and be replaced by a Conservative, and that thus the balance of power in the Senate might be wonderfully altered ? </para>

                            <para>- There is . a time for everything. There is a time for each individual to play his part. We have a grand Constitution, which was framed by fifty eminent gentlemen, thirty-five of whom were lawyers, and accepted by the people, and it is not to the man in the street that we should appeal for the opinion of a constitutional lawyer as to how that Constitution should be interpreted. Yet that was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> suggestion. As a representative of South Australia, I heartily indorse the action taken by the State Parliament in connexion with this matter. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> were advised that a vacancy had occurred. You communicated with the Governor of South Australia to that effect, and that steps should be taken to fill the position. The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, and some of the leading legal luminaries of Melbourne, were consulted on the constitutional question, and, as a result, the Commonwealth. Government decided that the vacancy was one which should be filled by the State Parliament of South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I am coming to that. We have a Labour Premier in South Australia, and, in dealing with this matter, the Labour Government of that State called in the advice of counsel. They consulted the Crown' Solicitor of the State, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> a member of another place, and another gentleman, of whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> spoke very highly yesterday. Three legal luminaries in South Australia were consulted by the Government of the State before they decided what steps should be taken. These lawyers were unanimous that, according to our grand democratic Constitution, there was no choice open to the Government in the matter. The South Australian Government then decided - to use what I hope is a legal expression - to carry out the mandate of  His Excellency  the Governor of the State. We know that things are only middling between the two Houses of the State Parliament of South Australia, but both were consulted in the matter. There were only two candidates, one, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> himself, who is now petitioning against the action of the State Parliament, and the other, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin.</inline> By a large majority of the members of the two Houses of the State Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> was declared elected. I can further say that the honorable senator never approached a single soul to secure nomination for the position, or to secure support at the election. I know that for a fact. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> was informed and had reason to believe that he was duly elected, and had a right to take his seat accordingly. The possession of that seat is at the present time of great importance both to labour and to conservatism. An appeal was made to the High Court which, however, did not decide the question, but said that it was one for the Senate itself to decide. It is, therefore, for us to say whether there was a vacancy or otherwise. It is true that there is an alternative. The existing law can be amended. Parliament has power to amend the provision of the Electoral Act relating to the method of deciding how a casual vacancy shall be filled up. The Senate therefore is responsible for a difficulty, and ought to grapple with it. It is said, " Why not trust the people? Why does not the Labour Party agree to have an election?" We are not afraid to have an election. We have not yet had a choice in the matter. The Parliament of South Australia received a command from  His Excellency  the Governor to do a certain thing. The course which we were directed to pursue was held to be the right one in the opinion of leading lawyers both in Victoria, the centre of the Commonwealth, and in South Australia. What else could South Australia do but fill the vacancy? But it is remarkable to see conservatism advocating that the people should be consulted. . I have referred to the various legal authorities who were consulted by the State Government. Those opinions are in print. They are surely worth something. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> yesterday virtually asked, " What are those opinions worth in comparison with mine " ? The honorable senator did not grapple with the arguments, but simply pooh-poohed them. </para>

                            <para>- Of course they differ, but when we find five leading luminaries on the one side, and another lawyer taking upon himself to pooh-pooh their opinions it seems to me to be egotistical. Reference has been frequently made during the debate to the position of South Australia. It has been said that she is not properly represented. Several honorable senators profess to he anxious about her interests. But in my belief South Australia is satisfied that the proper constitutional course has been followed. It is all very well for those honorable senators who may dislike labour politics and a labour Premier to express dissatisfaction with what has happened. But suppose the vacancy had occurred in little Tasmania, and that the two Houses of Parliament of that State acting together had selected a senator.  I  do not think that under those circumstances the same objection would have been taken. </para>

It seems strange to hear such sentiments coming from the High Priest of Conservatism.

                            <para>- I do not say that the honorable senator was prejudiced, but most men would consider that something of the kind was the case in view of the fact that he had expressed himself so strongly. Of course, I do not say that the honorable senator did not act according to his own judgment and ability, but if I had acted as he has done I do not think that honorable senators would allow me to escape blame. I hope that I have referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> in a respectful fashion. May I also say a word about my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> At the polls we fought on opposite sides. It was a case of labour <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> conservatism. He has since had the honour of acting as principal judge in this matter. I do not say that he has acted unfairly. Indeed, I dare not say that. But I do say that the result of adopting the Committee's report would be to give the party to which he belongs a very considerable advantage. I hope that the Senate will not overlook that consideration. I only hope that when the division is taken it will not be proven that it has been dealt with as a party question. When I looked at the benches opposite yesterday and saw that nearly every conservative was in his place I was reminded of a sermon to which I listened recently. Last Sunday night I heard Professor Rentoul say that he had attended the Federal Parliament once, and once only. He said he was disgusted they did no work, and that there were only eighteen present. If he had been there last night and seen so many present representing conservatism he might have come to the conclusion that Burns did when he wrote - </para>

When I looked up the records, I found that there was some justification for what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> put forward previously. I wish merely to state the facts. On the 4th July, I gave notice of a motion in connexion with the South Australian vacancy, and it was a vacancy at the time. On the following day, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> nominated the members of the Disputed Returns and Qualifications Committee. A reference to the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> shows that I was not present either on that day or during the following week, as I was ill in Sydney. I give you, sir, and the Senate, my assurance that for some length of time I did not know that I had been nominated on the Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> spoke to me later on, at a time when there seemed to be a prospect of the matter coming to the Senate, because, for some time after the appointment of the Committee, it was before the lawyers, and then drifted into the High Court. When, afterwards, there seemed to be a chance of the matter coming here, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> said to me, " Of course you will not go on with your motion." I replied, "Of course not;" and his next words to me, I think, were, " I thought that you would not; I thought you had respect for the proprieties of Parliament, and. would not go on with the motion." I think that is what the honorable senator said to me. </para>

I would point out, if I am in order, that if any exception is taken to my action on the Committee, the responsibility lies with the Senate, every member of which had the right to object to my nomination. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall not attempt to enter into the legal technicalities of the debate. I presume that if I did make such an attempt, the result would very probably be a miserable failure. In that respect, I think I would very much resemble a good many of our lawyers who, from time to time, give us the benefit of views, either well thought or manufactured for the occasion. What I want particularly to do is to indicate how the debate has appealed to the mind of a layman. We all recognise the importance and the delicacy of the question at issue. The layman finds that he. is called upon not only to  review  a very intricate issue, but also to give a sort of judicial decision, after he has reviewed it, on what may be termed the lines of commonsense. . Yesterday, we were treated to two very able speeches. In the first instance, we had an excellent speech from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> when submitting the motion. In coming to a conclusion, those two speeches have been . very helpful <inline font-style="italic">10</inline> rae. particularly the one delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> Undoubtedly it was an able speech, and from a layman's point of view, it showed that there was a decided weakness on the side for which the honorable senator was contending. He had no sooner entered into the preliminaries of 'his speech than he gave us to understand that all matters of law were absolutely foreign to the subject which he was handling, and that there was only one side of the Question. Can any one conceive of any force in a statement of that character, made in the presence of the report which he was advocating, and the decision which brought that report into our hands? Again, can any one conceive of the honorable senator abandoning once and for all the handling of intricate points of law ? </para>

First we had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> standing here and arguing for the motion for all he was worth, and next we had the leader of the Senate, in an equally forcible speech, and with undoubted evidence to prove his contention, telling us that the honorable and learned senator was altogether astray in his con-, clusions. We had two eminent lawyers face to face, one beginning on an altogether opposite premise to that of the other and each arriving at a diametrically opposite conclusion. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator sees what a simple case it is for a layman to adjudge after listening to the .conflict between the two legal luminaries I have mentioned. Then followed a speech from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger. I do not (know how high he stands in his profession,, but after he Had discussed the legal aspects of the case it struck me that he had made the issue as 'clear as mud. I have been led to the conclusion that I have come to by the conflicting opinions that have been given by men who may be termed , ,  notchers" in the legal profession. Not only has simplicity vanished entirely from the issue, but the discussion has shown clearly that there is a strong possibility of our inflicting an injustice unless we are most careful in arriving at our decision. That is why I ask that we should try,' as laymen, to. forget the speeches which the lawyers have made. Let those speeches stand in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as records for the curious of future ages to read, but let us not be influenced by them. No layman can honestly say that it would be wise, or conducive to an equitable decision, for us to be influenced at all by what those learned senators have said. There has been a great deal of argument about submitting the question to the people for their decision, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> certainly used that argument for all that it was worth. It warms one's heart to hear the Conservatives advocating that side of the question. I like to hear them arguing for giving effect to the will of the people. It will most likely be the last time that 'ever we shall hear them do so. I have, always trusted the people. </para>

                            <para>- He was elected, and he was declared elected. He took his seat in this Chamber with all the rights of a senator elected by the people. He took the oath at the table, having every reason to believe that he was elected, and that he had the stamp of the people's. authority which each and every one of us bears when we come here. In so doing he did exactly what any other man in his position had a right to do. It was only when it was discovered that gross blunders had -been made, and that even our present electoral system has so many, faults that the whole position ought to be viewed most seriously by us, that his return was petitioned against. Like scores of others whose  return has been petitioned against, he fell, but the fact that he fell does not weaken in the slightest the provisions of the Constitution, nor does it justify us in taking any other course than to support the amendment moved by the leader of the Senate. That is the position which I intend to take up. So far as concerns the suggestion to send the question to the High Court,I shall not have the slightest compunction in assisting to pass any legislation to refer all future cases of disputed returns to the High Court for decision. </para>

                            <para>- To make that legislation retrospective would be to inflict a decided injustice. Whatever we do in that direction, let us do it honestly, and like men of common-sense. Let us seek to amend the Constitution so as to provide once and for all that every senator who comes to this Chamber shall come in all circumstances with authority from the people themselves.I do not want any House of Parliament to have the power to elect a senator. That provision was the last straw to which the conservative element could cling in the framing of the Constitution. If honorable senators are honest in their arguments, if they are sincere in their advocacy of submitting these matters to the people, let them set about removing from the Constitution every provision that enables a State House of Parliament to fill a vacancy in the Senate. It is undemocratic and absolutely wrong. But if we cannot remove that provision now let us carry out the Constitution as it stands to the very letter, and apply to this case the provisions of section 15, which indisputably governs the issue beforeus. </para>

                        <para>. -I had not intended to take any part in this debate, but to-day several honorable senators have' begun by saying that they would consider the case from a layman's point of view, but have concluded by quoting the Constitution and dwelling upon the legal aspects of the matter. I do not believe that it was ever the intention of the Constitution to over-ride the people, but it is argued in this Chamber to-day that we should over-ride the people. If there is anything which we have it in our power to do, it is to refer the matter back to the people of South Australia. I should have liked to hear the arguments of honorable senators opposite if the boot had been on the other foot. They would have been the strongest opponents of the course which they are now adopting. They would have said, " Trust the people," but they are not prepared now to. trust the people, because they believe that they would meet with defeat. I have nothing to say against the gentleman who now occupies the seat. He has my good-will, but I said when the question first cropped up that, no matter what State was affected by a case of the kind, I should always be one to vote to refer the case back to the people if we possibly could. I believe that the Senate can do so, and therefore all the arguments that have been advanced from' the other side are only intended to prevent the case going before the people. Honorable senators opposite will trust the people so long as they think that they have a majority of the people behind them, but not a moment longer. No matter whether it affects a member on this side or on the other side of the Chamber, we should always trust the people. I am satisfied that the spirit of the Constitution, in spite of legal technicalities, is that the people should elect the members of the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- I take the intention of section 15 to be this : There might be five vacancies in any one State within the period of three years, through death or other causes, and it would be impossible to hold elections for the Senate every six months. It would lead to a vast amount of expense. It was contemplated that section 15 would apply to such cases. It has been stated that Mr. Vardon took his seat in this Chamber. I admit that he did, but that did not make him a senator if he took his seat here under a misapprehension, and if the returning officer, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton has decided, illegally declared him elected. I wonder at honorable senators opposite disputing the judgment of a Justice of the High Court. We have set up the High Court as the final arbiters of the law. </para>

I am surprised that honorable senators opposite should be so fond of interjecting when I am speaking - perhaps I am touching them on the raw. I am saying what I conscientiously believe to be true. No matter what honorable senators opposite may say, the people of Australia are on this matter with honorable senators on this side. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators opposite propose that in this case the people of South Australia should be ignored, and they contend that the Parliament of South Australia was right in electing a senator. There is no State Parliament constituted in the same way as the Federal Parliament. In two of the States Parliaments the Legislative Councils are nominee" Houses, and in the others are elected under a restricted franchise. I am surprised 'that honorable senators opposite should be content to allow such bodies to elect a member of the Senate. I have understood that liberals and democrats the world over have protested against power being given to such Houses. In this case, certain honorable senators propose to give a vote opposed to what has been their life-long practice. They have always denounced nominee Legislative Chambers. </para>

It is usual to accept the withdrawal of a statement unless it is accompanied by a further statement which is considered offensive. I am not aware that that is the case in the present instance. </para>

                            <para>- I have been doing my best so far. In Queensland and in New South Wales there are nominee Legislative Councils. In the other States the Legislative Councils are elected under a restricted franchise. In this case the Parliament of South Australia elected <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> when it should have been left to the people of that State to select <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> or any one else they might think fit as their senator, f have stated my objections to the amendment. If carried it will not settle the matter.. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> will have to go before the people at the next- Federal elections, and I maintain that we should send him to the people now. If he were sent back all cause of complaint would be removed. I have not the slightest personal objection to the honorable senator. I am doing what I believe to be my duty to the people who sent me here in insisting that the people and not the Parliament of any State should have the right to elect senators. I am satisfied that if the position were reversed a number of honorable senators who are supporting the amendment would insist that the matter should be referred to the people. I have been told that in the event of an election- in South Australia the Labour Party would be sure of the return of their nominee, and I have asked* honorable senators why in the circumstances they do not let the matter go to the people, and secure the return of a senator to support their party in Parliament. That is the course which they should adopt and then no one would have a word to say against them. But I think that there must be some doubt in the minds of honorable senators. </para>

                            <para>- It is wonderful how anxious some honorable senators occasionally are to keep down expenses. At other -times they are quite willing to vote ,£8,000 or <inline font-style="italic">j£i</inline> 0,000 without an examination of the reasons. I think that it would be better to spend a little money in order to have this matter . decided in what I believe to be a democratic manner. We should thus allow the people to have a say in the settlement -of the difficulty and should avoid an outcry which might arise if we settled it ourselves. This is not a matter that affects South Australia only. It affects the whole Commonwealth. What is a South Australian, case today might be a Queensland case tomorrow. I have done a good deal of electioneering in my time. The last elections were not a credit to those who had to do with their, management. I believe that the greatest scandals and informalities occurred in South Australia- But suppose, for the sake of argument, that cases arose in connexion with the whole of the senators elected at a general election, and that a Judge of the High Court held that they were all void. How would that pan out? Would honorable senators opposite argue that it would be right to allow the Parliaments of the States to elect the whole of the eighteen . senators ? Take the case of Western Australia. I honestly believe that there was no hope of any person except a Labour candidate being returned at the last Senate election. But if there had been some informality in the election, and the State Parliament had had to decide the matter, I doubt whether one Labour senator would have been returned. This case has been dealt with by the Disputed Returns and Qualifications Committee of the Senate. That Committee has reported.' Its report was unanimously adopted, although it is true that two members of the Committee - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> - have added an addendum. I do not object to that. But surely the Senate should support its Committee unless there is a good reason for doing the contrary. I presume that the Government approved of the composition of the Committee when it was appointed or some objection would have been made, to it. Had I been a member of the Committee I should have done my best to deal with the business brought before it, and if the Government had taken such action towards it as has been taken on the present occasion, mv resignation would have been in the hands of ±he  President"  within a few hours. If we appoint Committees, we ought to listen to their arguments. Personally I shall vote for the adoption of the report, but I am also prepared to support the addendum of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. If the report as a whole is not approved of, I agree that the matter should be referred to the High Court, which has been established for the purpose of interpreting the law. I do not profess to understand the technicalities of the law. Very few laymen do understand them. Indeed, I have seen three Judge's sitting to decide a case when two expressed an opinion on the one side and one on the other. If we cannot agree upon any other course, let us submit the matter to the High Court. </para>

                            <para>- I had not the slightest intention of reflecting upon any member of the Committee. All that' I say is that if we have no power to send the matter to the High Court, I do not see the use of the suggestion made in the addendum.. My principal desire is that justice shall be done to the people of South Australia. If the addendum is of no value, I should like. to hear a statement to that effect based on authority. But I presume that, the minority of the Committee having made such a suggestion, we have power to carry it  out. In the event of the Senate deciding to adopt the report of the Committee, I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> would be able to take the matter to the High Court, whose decision would be final. If the High Court said that a wrong course was taken by the Senate in relegating the matter to the people of South Australia, we should at any rate have a judicial decision as to what the true position is. That is the way in which I should like to see it go; but perhaps it is not likely that it will go in that way. If it is true, as honorable senators interject, that we have no power to refer the matter to the High Court, there is another way in which that can be done; and that is by adopting the report of the Committee, and leaving <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> to appeal to the High Court to say whether his view is right or wrong. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; and I believe that it has been equally evident in the case of some preceding speakers, but, of course, every man imagines that he is an authority. Despite the interjection from the other side, I believe that that course is still open. I consider that every citizen should have the right to  appeal  to the highest Court in the Commonwealth. Suppose that we did carry the motion, and thereby committed an illegal act, surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> must have a remedy. It is a poor business if it is a farce when it is done in one way, and if the person interested has no chance of appealing against the decision, of the Senate when it is done in another way. What conclusion will the electors draw from the remarks of honorable senators on the other side? They will think that we have laws, and that they can be interpreted in only one way, and that is the way which the Government, with a_ majority, may prefer. If that is the position of affairs, I hope that it will be remedied very soon. I support the motion. </para>

                        <para>.- Being a member of the Committee, my views are embodied in the report, but I de: sire to refer to the extraordinary  position  taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best.</inline> A delicate question was referred to the Committee for practically a judicial determination.- Prior to that reference, the Attorney-General gave a written opinion which, as every one knows, was adverse to the view taken by the Committee. The Vice-President of the Executive Council seems to think that it is his duty to back up the opinion of his learned colleague. If that view is correct, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> was not far wrong in pro-claiming  the whole of these proceedings to be an absolute farce. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> ought to have borne in mind that he was dealing with the report of a Committee which had unanimously found that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> did not legally hold the position of a senator, and had no right to' sit here or act in that capacity. Instead of acknowledging that fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> went out of his way to declare that in its report the Committee was not unanimous. It was unanimous' on the important point as to whether or not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> holds legally the seat of a senator. Having got off the track at the commencement of his speech, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> then tried to adduce some authorities to show that the report was wrong, but I am not aware that he successfully combated a single sentence or argument in the report. If, on such occasions, it is the duty of the leader of the Senate to back up the opinion of a legal colleague on a point, and the Government have a majority at their back, what is the use of our going through the farce of appointing a Committee to inquire and <inline font-style="italic">report to</inline> the Senate? What is the use of our pretending that we are engaged upon a delicate matter requiring judicial consideration ; that it is surrounded with no party feeling, and that the personal element must be excluded if the - Government, with a majority at their command, are to say!, "No. Our Attorney-General advises us in a certain way, and we. acting upon his advice, obtained the election of a senator who supports us. We intend to keep that senator in the Senate if we can." It is a great pity that the matter was ever referred to the Committee, but as it was referred to us, we had to do our duty, and to report in accordance with our convictions. Whatever honorable senators mav think, or however they may like to twist their conscience, I am very pleased to say that, in its finding, the Committee was unanimous. I have nothing to do with the addendum to the report. I understand that it will be dealt with by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Turley  if he moves the amendment foreshadowed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. . </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend has taken more interest in this matter than in almost any other matter which has arisen. He has been buzzing about between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> ever since the debate was started. He seems to be interjecting on every possible occasion, but I will not do him the injustice to suppose that he cannot read English. As I interjected the other day, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, when he tried to show that he was not a party to the report, hardly did justice to himself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has copied that bad example, and would have us believe that he cannot read English. The report was gone through paragraph by paragraph on two or three different occasions. Every paragraph was discussed, and when we came to consider the conclusion of the report, it was read and agreed to, as the <inline font-style="italic">Minutes of Proceedings</inline> show, the entry being " Paragraph 6 was read and agreed to." If my honorable friend has read the <inline font-style="italic">Minutes of Proceedings</inline> I cannot understand how he has fallen into the same error as the Minister, and can imagine for a moment that the Committee in its report is not unanimous. After sitting in the room and discussing the matter for an hour or two on different occasions, not a member of the Committee could pick a hole in the report or show where one argument it contained was wrong. The document was drawn so that the man in the street could read and understand it. It was drawn from a layman's point of view, having regard also to the constitutional points with which I admit it deals. But neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie nor <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> could point out where it was wrong. They both agreed to the draft with the rider, which says that in order to settle the matter definitely and for all time, it ought to be referred to the High Court ; but so far as this petition was concerned they concurred in the report. I am aware that honorable senators can change their opinion if they like. Some men can change their convictions when they change their coats. I am not going to follow the honorable senator, who sometimes is very specious, into any other arguments. I am simply dealing with a fact which I hope I shall not hear denied. </para>

Suppose that at an election hereafter we have a bungle and the election of one senator is declared void, and the Government of the day have a thumping big majority. Does the honorable senator imagine that if it suited their convenience they would feel bound by the decision in this case? My honorable friend is not so very innocent as he suggests.

Now, let me deal with the cases quoted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I ask honorable senators to dismiss from their minds all those technical authorities about a deed being void and a deed being voidable, because they do not bear on the point at issue. Let me deal with the case which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bestquoted</inline> to show that a mayor may hold an office <inline font-style="italic">de facto,</inline> and that holding the office <inline font-style="italic">de facto,</inline> as he says <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> did, when the election is declared void and he can not sit any longer there is a casual vacancy. One case which my honorable friend quoted was that of <inline font-style="italic">The Queen</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of Chester.</inline> In his judgment, Lord Coleridge said - </para>

                    <para>That is the case here. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was a senator, as a matter of fact, but not as a matter of law, because the election was declared void. Do honorable senators.  think for a moment that because a man is a senator, as a matter of fact, that carries with it the same responsibility, weight, and consequence as if he was a senator, as a matter of law? As one of the counsel said in that case - </para>

                        <para class="block">I undertake to say that that sentence, although uttered by a counsel, is right and correct. Before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> can possibly bring this case within section 15 of the Constitution, and declare it to be a casual vacancy, he has to prove that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was a senator, not only <inline font-style="italic">de facto,</inline> butalso <inline font-style="italic">de jure.</inline> That, however, he cannot do. How can a man possibly be a senator by right and by law when his election has been declared invalid? I am astonished at honorable senators pretending that they are confused over a simple matter of this kind. When a writ is issued, and an election is held, the writ is a return, and the return being good the senator takes his seat. But when a petition is filed within the period of forty days allowed by law every one knows that his office is challenged. He still acts and sits as a senator <inline font-style="italic">de facto,</inline> but under the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Wightman he is not a senator according to law until the petition has been decided. Everybody knows that he has no title to the office until the petition has been adjudicated upon. When in this case the petition was adjudicated upon, the whole election was declared void. If the election was declared void, how could there be a vacancy ? </para>

                            <para>- No. If the returning officer declares that a certain person has been duly elected, that person can vote, draw his salary, and act as a senator, but, when a petition is lodged against him, he is not a senator as a. matter of law until the petition has been decided in his favour. This matter was fought out before the Court of Disputed Returns, from which there is no appeal, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton declared that there never was an election. Therefore, the return went, and the senator's seat went with it. How in that case could there be a casual vacancy and an election by the State Parliament to fill the seat for the remainder of the term of six years? </para>

They would help to carry on the business of the country and join in the work of legislation as <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> legislators, but there could not be a vacancy under section 15 unless they were legally elected, and, therefore, <inline font-style="italic">de jure</inline> senators. The Vice-President of the Executive Council made what he seems to regard as a most wonderful point, that if the forty days had gone by without a petition having been lodged, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> would be legally sitting here. </para>

                            <para>- If those interested had refused to take advantage of the law and file a petition, SenatorO'Loghlin would have been sitting here legally, but that does not carry us one inch further. A petition was filed, and we know the result. Whenever a man is a senator <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">de jure,</inline> the moment he goes out, no matter how he goes out, there is a casual vacancy. In that case, the Constitution has been carried out ; the people have elected ; the senator has taken his seat as a matter of fact and as a matter of law and right, and when there is a vacancy, it is a casual vacancy under section 15. But when the people have not elected, when there has been no election, how. can if be said that a man was a senator <inline font-style="italic">de jure</inline> as well as <inline font-style="italic">de facto,</inline> simply because he sat here in accordance with our practice of believing him to be a senator until he is proved to be the contrary? We believe him to be a senator on the return of the writ, and allow him to act with us, so that his State may not be disfranchised. But after the matter has. been inquired into, and we know that the election was . no election at all, and that the return was a nullity, he can sit here by no authority whatever. Supposing a man succeeded in being returned as a senator by buying an election, spending fifty sovereigns in bribing fifty men. That has often been done. There were frightful cases of bribery in the last general elections in England, and two or three men were unseated. Suppose in such a case a man took his seat. He would sit here, although he had got here corruptly - because he could hold the office as a matter of fact, although not as a matter of right and law - until the petition against him had been adjudicated upon. In such a case, would we find the Vice-President of the Executive Council pretending that, although that man bought his way in, and acted as a senator <inline font-style="italic">de facto,</inline> there was therefore on his being unseated a. casual vacancy, and that the whole election was to be taken out of the hands of the people, although the man only won by a few votes, and only because fifty of his votes had been corruptly obtained ? Would the Vice-President of the Executive Council tell the people that under the Constitution they had no right to make another choice? The idea is monstrous. The people's right cannot be taken away under the Constitution. If our report were adopted, everything would go on smoothly ; and the people would get their right in having to exercise their franchise over again. On the other hand, if a man elected by them were to die or resign his seat, there would be a casual vacancy, and then the South Australian Parliament would have jurisdiction. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has never attempted to answer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> forcible argument as to what would be done if all three of the senators from South Australia had been told that their election was void, and that none of them could sit. Would the people then, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> asked, be absolutely deprived of their franchise? If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> interjected, the whole of the senators of the six States, through some terrible informality, had not been legally elected, would every State Parliament claim that these were casual vacancies? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> talked about the right of the people, but the people would rise up and drop him into the muddy Yarra if he attempted to say that their franchise should be taken away from them. Those arguments cannot be answered. Let me tell honorable senators how the matter has presented itself to my mind. I. read in the newspapers time and again that there would have to be a new election. The articles seemed to carry conviction .to my mind, but then I found' that the Attorney-General had given, an opinion, in which he said - </para>

                            <para>- The- Attorney-General's opinion is based upon a fallacy. If the Attorney-General's view - that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon,</inline> before the decision of the Court, was <inline font-style="italic">de jure</inline> as well as <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> a senator - is right, there is an end of the case, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> has a perfect right to sit here. But it is not a fact, and so I say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom</inline> has based his opinion upon a fallacy. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in order to gain his case justly, must prove that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was a senator <inline font-style="italic">de jure.</inline> That he cannot prove. When I first read them, I believed that the opinions of those great lawyers must be right, and that the question ought to go to the High Court. But when I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piper's</inline> argument, and got into my head the difference between a senator sitting here as a matter of fact while a petition was pending, and a senator sitting here as a matter of right and law, and when I read other decisions in which it is shown that the moment it is proved that a man's election is void, all his rights as a senator go, I . saw that it was only twisting the Constitution to say that this was a casual vacancy under section 15. The interpretation which the Committee give would make everything run smoothly, but the interpretation given by the Vice-President of the Executive Council absolutely twists the Constitution and deprives the people of their right. If a senator is here as a matter of fact and as a matter of law, then if he dies or resigns there is a casual vacancy. Is not that reading the Constitution properly? There are sure to be scores of casual vacancies, -Because when old and bald-headed gentlemen like myself are elected for six years ft is more than probable that some of us will " hop the twig" before our term expires, so causing casual vacancies within the meaning of the ' </para>

But will the Vice-President of the Executive Council consider the case I have put of a man who bought himself into the Senate by bribery. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> who suggested that the provision for dealing with casual vacancies was inserted in the Constitution in order to save expense. ' That is only half the truth. It was inserted to provide for the case of a casual vacancy caused by the death or retirement through ill health or for any other good reason, of a man who had been returned, and, as a matter of right and of law, had acted as a senator. It was pointed out that whilst a man who was elected as a senator might die in the first year of his term of office, another might die just before the close of his term of office, and a new election, at a cost of thousands of pounds, might be insisted upon even when it was known that a general election would have to take place very shortly afterwards. The question ot expense cannot arise if . the Constitution is . not complied with, and, until the  people of South Australia have had an opportunity to elect their third senator, it will not have been complied with. They have not exercised their privilege under the Constitution, and there can be no possible vacancy except by the retirement of a man who has been a member of. the Senate <inline font-style="italic">de jure</inline> as well as <inline font-style="italic">de facto.</inline> How the Vice-President of the Executive Council, with his legal knowledge, can dispute that I do not know. except that in these matters we all have to play the part of party politicians, and my honorable friend is no exception to the rule.

                    <para>Do honorable senators opposite contend that section 7 not having been complied with - the election having been void, and the people's choice having been ineffectual - is now to be ignored, and the people's rights taken away from them? Suppose it could be proved to demonstration that the terrible Tories to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has compared honorable senators on this side are in an undoubted majority in South Australia. It might be expected that the people of that State would elect a man holding certain views. We all know that there is a Labour Government in power in that State at the present time, and that, as a matter of  fact, the Parliament of South Australia elected a man holding the views of the Labour Party. The High Court has said that the choice of the people was not exercised or was ineffectual, that the election was absolutely void, and yet* honorable senators opposite are asking the Senate to give a decision which hands over to the Labour Government of South Australia the right to appoint a senator holding certain views, when they know that if the people of South Australia were appealed to they would elect a man holding opposite views. Could anything be more dreadful? I read in the newspapers, as I suppose every one else did, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton, took it for granted, and said that there would have to be another election held by the people. </para>

                                Barton, knowing the Constitution better, I suppose, than any other man living, looked upon the question as so simple that he took it for granted that there must be another election, and he said so. But when he saw that the Attorney-General and the Government absolutely differed from him, like a sensible man he struck those words out of has judgment.

It has not very much weight. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton had no doubt about the matter; he would not have gone out of his way to speak of a new election unless he felt pretty sure that that would be the course followed. As I have said, the matter presents no difficulty to my mind. The course proposed by the Committee would not affect the right of a Parliament of a State to act where a casual vacancy arises, but it would prevent the taking away of their undoubted rights from the people. </para>

                            <para>- With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl'</inline> s observation, there is only one term to apply to it. It was a most insulting expression - viz., that I am a partisan  Chairman.  Now, I wish the Senate to understand this - that if the price of my holding the position of  Chairman  of Committees is that I am to give up my opinions or forbear the expression of them, I shall not hold that office very long. I think we have a right to claim that if, upon this question, we do conscientiously differ; it is not remarkable. Because when we find legal gentlemen of such standing as the Vice-President of the Executive Council and the leader of the Opposition differing, it is evidence that there is ample room for difference of opinion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Savers</inline> has made a statement - which has also been made by others who are in favour of the adoption of the Committee's report - to the effect that he believes that the Senate is not the right body to decide this question, but that he will accept the verdict of the Senate if it is the verdict he wants, whilst if it is not the verdict he wants he will vote to send the question to be determined by another tribunal. </para>

Honorable senators who take up that attitude assume that if they cannot win here they are likely to win elsewhere. They will take the chance of winning here, and if they lose they will take' the chance of going elsewhere in the hope of winning there. </para>

Because, though their opinion is treated as an addendum, I find no provision in our Standing Orders for making an addendum to a report. The only provision made for the expression of the opinion of a minority on a Committee is that they may put in a dissentient report, I take it that that addendum means, if it means anything, " We do not feel that we arc in a position to challenge what has been laid down by the majority." They gave as a reason for that attitude that the question is one which is surrounded by legal difficulties, and that that leads them to recommend that it should be referred to the High Court. </para>

I must say that it makes me suspicious when two lawyers ask me to approach a question in which matters of law are certainly involved by putting aside all considerations as to the law. A lawyer will usually take to the law as eagerly as a duck takes to water. There must be some strong deterring influence when they both put up a danger signal, and ask us not to consider this matter as one of law at all, but solely as a question of politics. </para>

                            <para>- They were breaking new ground. This attitude certainly aroused my curiosity, and made me, for the time, a law student. I thought, " Now, if those honorable senators are so anxious that we shall not look into the law on this question, and that we shall adopt a purely political course, one may, by looking into the law, ascertain what is really the right course to adopt." Consequently I have devoted all the time I have had at my disposal to a study of the question from the legal point of view, so far as a layman can do so. I shall not, of course, attempt to give any cheap legal opinion on the question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> especially, appealed to us to put aside the legal aspect altogether, and deal with the political aspect only. Unfortunately, I believe that it is a legal question which we have to decide. Moreover, this is a legal tribunal. We must not lose sight of the fact that the Senate is., in this instance, a Court. It may be a very faulty kind of Court - it may be a Court afflicted by the evil of party bias - but nevertheless it is a Court. </para>

                            <para>- It is in this case even a, final Court. So far as I can see, it is the only Court at the present time that can deal with the matter before us. Therefore, we must not lose sight of the fact that the Senate, in dealing with this question, ceases to be a mere political body, and becomes a Court constituted as such. </para>

                            <para>- It is a question as to which our political training comes in, and drives us off from the strict legal path. This is one of the evils arising from the fact that a loop-hole has been left in our electoral machinery. We thought that we had made the fence strong enough, and had for ever cut ourselves off from the legal responsibilities attaching to decisions in cases of disputes over elections. We thought that we had acted under the terms of the Constitution, which lays down a certain machinery, until we otherwise provide. We thought that in otherwise providing we had made arrangements for all cases of the kind going before the High Court. But we find that we have not done so. There is a gap in the fence, and the fact which stares us in the face is that there is an election case before us. We have to deal with it, and therefore we cannot, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> have asked us to do, put aside the legal technicalities, nor can we shut our eyes to the legal position. </para>

                            <para>- That is a point with which I shall deal later on. We cannot take any cognizance of the political aspect of the question - that is to say, as to the effect upon the principle of whether  elections of this kind should be determined by the. people or by a State Parliament. That is purely' a political question. It is entirely a question, not as to the Constitution, but as to the advisableness or otherwise,, of a particular mode of election. This Senate is not now a Court for the purpose of altering the Constitution or considering the advisableness of altering it, but for the purpose of determining, under the Constitution as it stands, whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> is rightly here as a representative of South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- That is the question raised by the petition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> never was a senator as a matter of law, although he was one as a matter of fact. Now. I take it, that a senator cannot take his seat here by virtue of the provisions of the Constitution unless he is elected. He is elected by virtue of the Constitution and under the operation of electoral laws passed under the Constitution. The writ is returned in accordance with the law. Parliament is assembled by virtue of the Constitution ; the  Clerk  reads the GovernorGeneral's proclamation; the return of the writs is reported ; members present themselves, are sworn, and take their seats; the business of the country is declared by the Governor-General, and the session is opened. All that is done under the Constitution, or under the electoral law. But for forty days from the date of the election the seat of every, senator who has been recently . elected is voidable. Every one of them may be unseated on various charges which may be laid under the Electoral Act and the Constitution. So far as that point is concerned, eighteen senators, and perhaps more if there have been any extraordinary vacancies, are for forty days senators in fact and in law, although the seat of every one of them is voidable under the law. </para>

                            <para>- There may be very good reasons, or no reasons. At any rate, there is some diversity of opinion on this side. Let us now consider what is meant by holding a seat as a matter of law. It would be well, I think, first to make up our mind as to what is the meaning of the term used by the High Court, and further, as to whether any other term might have been used which would have had a more restricted meaning if it had wished to convey a more restricted meaning.

I take it that if we find a case where the Court' says that a thing is void, and it means not only that it is void' at that time, but that it is void right back so long as the circumstances governing the case existed, we get a parallel case. Of course a thing is either voir! or riot void, so that the word " absolutely " in the phrase !' absolutely' void " means little or nothing. </para>

Must not it be because the law recognises that there was a legal right to the money, but that he had not a legal right to recover? Surely it means that if it means anything. Otherwise the law is recognising an illegality. It is allowing an illegal' detention of money. Here is another case which bears on this point, as reported in  Q.B.D.,  Vol. 2, 1893: - </para>

                        <para>On the whole, I have come to the conclusion that the word "void" in section- 47 of the Bankruptcy Act 1883 means " voidable," and that consequently any one who claims, under a settlement affected by this section, as a purchaser for valuable consideration without notice, has a good title as against the trustee, in bankruptcy. It is quite plain that the word "void" may mean "voidable," and there are several reasons why it should receive that construction in this Act. </para>

I do not regard it as a document which must not be breathed upon. We have the fullest right to inquire into it to see if it can stand the test of criticism.

                            <para>- It is the only part that could be used to bolster up the view  put forward from the other side. I come now to paragraph 4 of the report, in which the Committee say - "On the11th July, 1907, there being a vacancy, the Houses of Parliament of South Australia assuming it to be a vacancy within the meaning of section 15 of the Constitution - " </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">I am not sure that the Houses of Parliament of South Australia took any such restricted view. It is quite possible that they assumed it to be a vacancy within the meaning of section 1 5 and other sections of the Constitution. Section 21 gives the form in which vacancies are to be notified, and I assume that the Government of South Australia, which is the Executive of the Parliament of that State, received a notification in the terms of section 21 that a vacancy had occurred, and the South Australian Parliament, acting under sections 15 and 21, took the action they did. There is a very peculiar phrase used in the second section of paragraph 4 of the report, which reads - " It appears from the correspondence set out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> in the petition that he was nominated though under protest from himself to the State Parliament." </para>
                    <para class="block">I propose to read that alleged protest. It appears in the petition, and will be found on page 4 of the report in this form - " That on the 10th day of July, 1907, your petitioner wrote to the Honorable Richard Butler, a member of the. House of Assembly in the Parliament of the said State, a letter, in the words and figures following, that is to say :  - </para>
                    <para> Adelaide, 10th July, 1907. </para>

                    <para> In answer to your inquiry, my position in regard to the Senate election is this - </para>
                    <para>I am willing to act as a senator if duly and properly elected as one.' " </para>
                    <para class="block">Of course, this was after he had been unseated. He evidently thought that he could act as a senator, and that, when the election was over, and he was declared elected, he was duly elected as a senator. He writes further- " I am advised that the proper course is a new popular election. </para>
                    <para>I must leave the responsibility of acting or not acting on your wish to nominate me in Parliament entirely to yourself. If you do so and the result is that I am lawfully made a senator, I will act accordingly. </para>

                            <para>- Now I come to deal with section C of paragraph 5, and it will be found that we have a Committee, amongst the members of which Senators Symon and Dobson were legal gentlemen, putting this proposal forward - " Choice by the people appears to your Committee to be the basis of the Constitution of the Senate, and until the people have had an opportunity to exercise and have effectively exercised their choice no other mode of choice or appointment can come into play. There can apparently be no casual or accidental vacancies until there is first an effective election by the people." " If, for instance, there had been no election by the people before the 1st January last for want of nomination, or owing to the Governor having omitted to issue his writ, or because the State Executive thought it politically or otherwise inexpedient to hold the election, then no one could say that the representation of the State in the Senate could in that case be filled by the Parliament, or it might be by the Governor, with the advice of his Executive. The antecedent condition to the right of either to appoint a senator is first an effectual choice by the people entitling the person to hold for the full term of service and the subsequent happening of a vacancy." </para>

                            <para>- I direct the attention of the Senate to the fact that in all the cases the Committee were compelled to fall back upon, what is suggested must happen before the people can have any choice at all. In trying to discover an analogy, the Committee had to fall back upon a condition of things which must  occur before ever the people are asked to elect. They say, in the next paragraph of this section -  "Your Committee do not think section  15  comes into operation at all, except in the case of a senator who holds an unchallenged seat as the choice of the people, or it may be of a person appointed under section  15  itself to hold the place of a senator so chosen by the people." </para>

Does the honorable senator mean to say that meetings of the Labour Party in South Australia to consider whether they could raise the money to challenge <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> constituted a challenge of his position? Surely it is straining the law to bring in mere newspaper paragraphs and to say that because there were meetings of the Labour Party for the purpose of " raising the wind," <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon's</inline> seat was challenged. Suppose that whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> sat in the Senate, and before the petition had been lodged - because he sat here before the petition was lodged- </para>

                            <para>- Therefore there was a time when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> held an unchallenged position as a senator chosen by the people. That, in my opinion, is sufficient to show that not only did the Committee act upon the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> in putting legal technicalities aside, but they have also put law and common sense aside; and in putting in their report the test which I have mentioned they invite us to trample on the Constitution, and put it entirely out of consideration. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> held an unchallenged seat as the choice of the people for a time, I say that he was truly a senator for the time when he held it. When he took the oath, his name was subscribed upon the roll of senators. </para>

                    <para>Your Committee think that the Houses of Parliament of the State of South Australia were not entitled under section 15 to fill the vacancy in relation to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> unless he was rightfully a senator by virtue of the direct choice of the people. He did not, according to the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton, fulfil that condition. </para>
                    <para class="block">Now, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton never said anything of the kind. Honorable senators opposite cannot produce any statement in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was not at any time rightfully a senator by virtue of the choice of the people. I think that this is an unjustifiable construction to' put upon the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton. There is no such passage in it. Further on, in paragraph G the Committee say - </para>
                    <para>If, as we have already pointed out, section 15 pre-supposes an original or antecedent choice, of a senator otherwise than under that section, such original or antecedent choice can only, according to section 7, be " directly by the people " - not a mere form of choice but an effective choice, and, obviously, a supposed choice cannot be effective in the case of a person declared by the appointed tribunal not to have been " chosen by the people " - a person to whom the " attempted choice " was void. It was not the place or seat occupied in fact by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> which was declared void, but the election of 12th December, 1906, by virtue of which he claimed to take and hold the seat. A man is either a senator or not, and under the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> never was a senator or held the place of a senator. </para>
                    <para>That is the construction which the Committee put upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> . Barton's judgment. But let us look at what his judgment was. After dealing with the whole question of the admissibility or otherwise of certain ballot papers,  His  Honour said - </para>
                    <para>As it is, having regard to section 205, subsection111, I must declare the election of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> to have been absolutely void. </para>
                    <para>Leaving out the word " absolutely " as of no consequence, what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton held was that the election of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> was void. He did not say, as the Committee make him say, " I declare the election of the 12th December as to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> void." I am, therefore, justified in saying that I think the Committee have put a very strained interpretation on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton's judgment. Paragraph H of the Committee's report says - </para>
                    <para>Section 15 is further limited to the case of a senator whose place becomes vacant " before the expiration of his term of service." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon's</inline> term of service was either six years or nothing. It could only be for six years by virtue of the people's choice. </para>
                    <para class="block">Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> tells us that if we give the people the right of choice now, the term of service of the senator chosen will be only five years. </para>

Do I understand honorable senators opposite to say that if three senators were elected and a petition was lodged within forty days against one of them for bribery, and he was convicted, that would not create a casual vacancy, supposing the High Court to impose as one of the penalties that the seat should be vacated? </para>

Suppose that after the period of forty days has elapsed a senator's seat should become vacant by reason of his absence from the Senate for two months, his term, I take it, would end on the day when his seat was declared vacant. The same result would occur in the case of a senator becoming disqualified by bankruptcy.

As a matter of fact, the words were used by the High Court in the mandamus proceedings, and were applied, not to the question of whether there was a choice of senator or not, but to the question of whether a mandamus could lie against the State Governor. Yet they are used in this paragraph to make us believe that they were uttered by the Court which was deciding the legality of' the election. We have just cause to complain of the use of the words in that fashion. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- It seems to me to be an involved piece of reasoning. It is equivalent to saying that a man had and yet had not a seal'. That is the only meaning I can attach to the paragraph. Put alongside that paragraph the facts that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> did legally attend the sittings of the Senate, that up to the decision of the Court he continued to attend, and that but for that decision he would be here to-day. </para>

Whether that is the best means to adopt or not is, in view of all the circumstances, quite beside the question. The Senate has really no option ; it has to obey the law as it is.

If, on the other hand, in section 15 they are to be taken to refer merely to the seat occupied by a person claiming to be a senator, but whose claim is disputed and petitioned against, then it was submitted they would mean the same in section 19, with the result that such a person might, by resigning, not only defeat the petition, but the claim of some one else to the seat, and throw the choice into the hands of the State Houses of Parliament, or it might be the Governor with the advice of his Executive Council. </para>

The Committee say that sub-section 3 of that section provides that "in the case of an election being declared void there shall be a new election." I can imagine the virtuous indignation with which the Committee sheltered themselves behind sub-section 3 when challenged with not having taken the right course, and said, " We have no option but to declare for a new election."' </para><interjection>

I say that applying the tests laid down by the Committee, I am unable to accept their report as bearing out their contentions. What authority have I for forming a contrary opinion? Certainly not my own legal knowledge. I fall back upon the opinions which have been given by various eminent lawyers. I find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dashwood</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray,</inline> of South Australia, give this opinion - </para>

                        <para>In my opinion, therefore, the " procedure to  be adopted in view of the judgment referred to in order to secure the proper representation of this State in the Senate " is that prescribed by section 15 of the Constitution. The two Houses of Parliament sitting and voting together should choose a person to hold the vacant place until the expiration of the term or until the election of a successor at the next general election for the House of Representatives, or the next election of senators for the State, whichever shall first happen. </para>
                    </quote><para>It appears to me, therefore, that the course which has been adopted is in accordance with the Constitution, and I am prepared to indorse it. Now, as to referring the case to the High Court, I wish to say that I regret that when we dealt with the Electoral Act we did not, as we thought we had done, close up all the loop-holes. As to the future, I hope we shall have legislation by which all cases of disputed returns, from any. cause whatsoever, shall go automatically to the High Court. In this connexion, what I say with respect to this case is not to be regarded as expressing my final opinion. My present feeling is that, whether rightly or wrongly, by the action of the man who feels aggrieved, the man who has lost the seat, the Senate has been selected as. the Court to try this case. It was not selected by those who are supporting the contention that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> is legally here, but by the very man who has been displaced by the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton. The question of the fitness of this tribunal should have been weighed by him and by his legal advisers. The  Chairman  of the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications has said that, in his opinion, this is the proper and, indeed, the only tribunal to settle the question. He has declared that it could not be referred to the High Court. A little time ago we were dealing with the Judiciary Bill, to prevent certain classes of cases from going in future to the Privy Council. What would have been said if, at that time, we had proposed to take a case that was pending, and in connexion with which leave to appeal to the Privy Council had been given, away from the Privy Council, 'and handed it over to the High Court ? A more appropriate example would be a proposition to take a case from the Privy Council itself, if we had the power, and transfer it to the High Court. That would be analogous to a proposal to take this case from the Senate at this stage and transfer it to the High Court. </para><interjection>

                        <para>. -I enter upon this discussion with a certain amount of diffidence, recognising the legal technicalities that have been introduced during the debate. I listened with a great deal of attention to the speeches that have been made. First we had a speech from the  Chairman  of the Committee that presented the report with which we are dealing. The honorable and learned senator certainly made what might be termed a really good speech. He put his case fairly and well. I also listened to the speech in reply by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, another legal gentleman, perhaps just as eminent as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> Then we had an address from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, giving the views of the two honorable senators who signed the addendum to the report. We have had several speeches since, chiefly from honorable senators of some legal attainment. Amongst them was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, and, though I listened carefully to what the honorable senator said, he did not make the issue any more clear to me than it was before he rose to address the Senate. We have just now had an address from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who has very lucidly dealt with almost every paragraph in the report presented by the Committee. It appears to me that the key-note of the report is the excellence of the principle of popular election. Regardless for the moment of legal technicalities and the sections of the Constitution, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and his colleagues in framing the report of the Committee laid particular stress on the necessity of electing men to representative positions by the voice of the people. It has been very refreshing indeed to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and his colleagues advocating this great principle. I should like to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> or his colleagues whether they are prepared to extend that principle of popular choice to the election of every representative assembly in Australia. I am sure that they are not, and, in my opinion, they are simply using this lever of the excellence of popular election in order to buttress a report which has been torn to shreds by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline></para>

                            <para>- I do not attribute motives to any honorable senator. I would be the last member of the Senate to deny to the people the right of choosing their own representatives. But I have to consider what is the expressed will of the people. The people of Australia were consulted before pur Constitution was adopted. In every part of this island continent, the question was put to them whether they were in favour of the adoption of the Constitution. Therefore, we may regard it as an expression of the people's will. In exercising our rights under ,it, we are not in the slightest degree attempting to frustrate the expression of the people's will. Did any member of the Convention anticipate that such a question as this would come up for consideration? Reading over the debates of the Conventions, I find no reference to the likelihood of such a case, and in conversation with gentlemen who were members of the Convention it has been candidly- admitted to me that such a. position was not foreseen. We must, therefore, be guided by the exact letter of the Constitution. </para>

                    <para class="block">Therefore, notwithstanding section 192 of the Electoral Act, we have full power to deal with the matter before us. We have the opinion of the Committee appointed by the  President  of the Senate, the opinion of the High Court in. the application for a mandamus against the Governor of South Australia, and the opinion's of three eminent lawyers of South Australia, Messrs. McMahon Glynn, Murray and Dashwood. On the other side, we have the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator '</inline> Symon, admittedly an eminent legal luminary. I have carefully read the whole of the opinions formulated, and the report of the Committee over which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> presided. I likewise read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton's judgment in presiding over the Court of Disputed Returns. I am asked to come to a decision as a senator. I must say that the weight of evidence is decidedly against the report presented to us. There is one paragraph in that report upon which I had intended to comment, but  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator' Pearce</inline> has anticipated me. I refer to paragraph I. in which the words, "the attempted choice" are used. Those words are placed in inverted commas. When I first read them, I naturally concluded that they were the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton. But, in looking at the report of his remarks, I can find no such words. I was naturally anxious to know why the words were placed in inverted commas in the Committee's report. I will not say that they were intentionally so treated, but they are certainly misleading. If those words were riot used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton, they ought not to be placed in inverted commas. We have a right to expect, in a report of a Committee sitting in a judicial capacity, that everything shall be straightforward and plain. I do not think that any honorable senator will question my argument when I say that an error was made in placing those words in inverted commas. They were riot, perhaps, intended to mislead, but a wrong construction ' might easily be placed on them. My study of the question leads me to the conclusion that a casual vacancy occurred, and that the only way of filling it -was by election by both Houses of the State Parliament. Hitherto, there has been an absence of heat in the debate, nor has there been any suggestion that any senator is acting from party motives. I should refuse to consider the question in any such light. I am actuated in my decision by a careful reading of the judicial : opinions, and the opinions of eminent counsel. Ex-Senator Vardon certainly took his seat in the Senate. He subscribed the oath of allegiance, I believe, on the same day on which I did so. He also voted as a senator. He must, therefore, have been a senator for a specific period. A close analysis of the Committee's report shows that one or two paragraphs in it contradict each other. In voting, as I intend to do, for the amendment submitted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, I do not think that I .am denying the people of South Australia the right to choose their representatives. Even if I were disposed to be actuated bv party bias, there is no need for such a disposition on this occasion, because I do not think there is a State in the Union to which the party to which I belong could appeal with a greater certainty of success than South Australia. But there is no necessity. We are here under the Constitution, and if we carry out the letter of the Constitution, we shall be' doing our duty. In no way are we denying the people their right to elect their own representative. </para>

                            <para>- The question is. What is the correct interpretation to put upon the Constitution? By passing a Bill we should admit that the Constitution is wrongly interpreted or is not' in accordance with the people's wishes. I do not think any honorable senator is desirous of passing a measure which would have a retrospective, effect. Therefore, whilst I shall welcome any measure which would be the means of preventing such a discussion here in the future, still I consider that we ought to deal- with this case on its merits, as presented to us. During the course of this debate there have been certain allusions made to party bias. . Taunts have been hurled from one side of the Chamber to the other. I feel confident that throughout the proceedings of the Committee <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has been a most impartial  Chairman.  But had I been in his position I would have refused to preside over its deliberations. Knowing that he had toured South Australia under the same political auspices as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon,</inline> and had advanced the same political propaganda, he ought not to have accepted a position in which any person could impugn his impartiality or unbiased judgment. We are called upon to choose between the motion and the amendment. I do not know whether the amendment will ultimately decide the question, but it will receive my support in preference to the motion, because I think that in taking that course we shall be simply carrying out the provisions of section 47 of the Constitution. Those who have supported the adoption of the report have said, almost in the same breath, that the Senate cannot decide the question. But if the report is adopted the Senate will have practically decided the question. Either we have the right to consider the question or we have not. The wording of section 47 proves conclusively, even to the lay mind, that we have the power to act. I have no intention to refrain from exercising any power which the people have conferred upon me. I shall support the amendment, and. if it can be proved afterwards that the machinery of the Constitution is not effective in dealing with what may be called complex situations, I shall welcome the introduction of a Bill' which will provide the requisite machinery to put an end to them once and for all: </para>

                        <para>. - I rise to explain how I intend to vote, because I feel that an explanation is necessary. Before the report of the Committee was submitted to the Senate- and I have not- read it yet - I had come to the same conclusion with regard to this case as I came to, many sessions ngo, when the question of disputed returns, was before the Senate. At that time every senator thought that in amending the Electoral Act as we did we had for ever avoided the possibility of the Senate having to decide such a difficult question. I venture to say that there is no senator, sitting on either side of the Chamber, who did not welcome that opportunity of getting rid of such a difficulty as has cropped up at the present time. I admit that so far as the amendment of the law is faulty - and apparently it is - I, in common with every other senator who was here when it was passed, must take my share of the blame. But I also recognise that it is probable that in the future we may have an exact repetition of the present case. To me it is a matter, of wonder that when we were amending the law we did not provide for such a contingency. My position in that respect has not changed. I shall not vote for the Senate to decide this question one way or the other. I cannot vote for the adoption of the report, nor can I vote for the amendment. With me the question is not so much whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Loghlin</inline> shall get the seat, as whether the Senate itself is on its trial. I can conceive of nothing more disastrous than that the Senate, when it has the opportunity to remit this very difficult question to a Court, should attempt the solution of it. That being so, I cannot and will not vote for the motion, because the report of the Committee attempts to settle the question. I certainly cannot support the amendment, because that equally attempts to settle the question. During this debate, which has lasted a long time, I have heard certain interjections which have indicated that their authors have some doubt as to what we can do if we do not decide the point. I have the exact text of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton's judgment, from which I wish to quote only one sentence - </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to do it at once. I will do it at any time when I discover that we have not invested the High Court with sufficient authority. The time to act is now, since the defect in the law was not discovered earlier. Seeing that we can find a proper tribunal to deal with the question, there ought to be no hesitation on the part of any senator to avail himself of this opportunity. So far as I understand the position, Parliament may, under section 47 of the Constitution, pass a very short Bill to amend section 197 of the Electoral Act. I hope that in order to extricate the Senate from a most invidious position the Government will at once bring in such a measure. We ought, I think, to look at this question from the stand-point of fair play. I do not accuse <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Loghlin</inline> of desiring to take advantage one of the other, but an appeal to the authority which sent us here is, after all, the one which we ought to prefer. If we do not, I do not know what the result may be. I shall welcome the man chosen, whether he is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Loghlin</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon,</inline> or any one else, so long as he is returned as the rest of us were. Stupid blundering on the part of an official has been, I suppose, the cause of the whole trouble. Following upon that, there has been a vote in the State Parliament, and now the matter is before the Senate, and we have to try to divest ourselves of all party feeling. </para>

In every Parliament in the world it is now recognised as most undesirable that a disputed return should be settled by persons who are interested in the result. We are practically asked to constitute ourselves a kind of enlarged Full Court. It is not thinkable that a Judge of any Court where the English language is spoken would consent to try a case in which he was personally interested. </para>

That is the very foundation and strength of our Courts of Justice. We are invited to adjudicate in a case in which we are personally interested. We have to admit, first of all, that we are not competent to decide the question; and, secondly, that we are prejudiced and biased, and that we have personal interests. All that tends to bar us from attempting to decide the case. I will agree to no report by which the Senate itself attempts to decide this question, and, therefore, I shall have to wait for some honorable senator to move in a direction that will enable me to vote to refer it to the High Court. </para>

                            <para>- The further the case went before the Committee the more I, as a layman, and, I believe, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, realized that, in the conflict of opinion on the part of men who had made a study of the law, there was a very poor chance of our being able to "arrive at a decision which would settle the whole question from the stand-point not only of this one case, but of all other similar cases. What we desire is that all such cases shall be decided by the High Court, and so taken out of the hands of Parliament altogether. If that position is brought about, the Houses will from that time forward know exactly the position in which they stand in relation to disputed returns. I, as one of the Committee, 'saw nothing of party bias in its proceedings. To contend that party bias existed because the report was drawn up by the  chairman  and was supported in nearly every instance by all the members of the Committee, is to cast a reflection on the ability of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and myself to dissect the report and draft it in a different way, or alter its whole complexion., I was present during the whole time that the Committee sat, and I must say - and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie can bear me out in this - that we saw practically no evidence of party bias. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that the honorable senator had the right to make the statement. He was given the opportunity and expressed himself as being satisfied. As the inquiry went  on  we realized that there was a tribunal which would be better able to sift the opinions given by legal luminaries, and would at the same time be in a position to interpret any section of the Constitution referred to during the inquiry. When we were considering the Electoral Bill I believe that honorable senators were all of the opinion that we were remitting every case that might arise in connexion with elections to the High Court. It appears that there was a defect in the law we passed at the time. Members of the Senate were prepared to take those questions out of the hands of Parliament and put them into the hands of the final authority on the Constitution. It seems to me that, now that a question of the kind has come up for consideration, we  should  be prepared to carry out what we intended in dealing with the Electoral Bill. If it were not possible to submit this matter to the High Court, I should have no option but to vote for the amendment moved by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. If I were to do anything else, I should be expressing the opinion that the action of the South Australian Parliament in this matter was absolutely wrong. I am sure that on the advice tendered by the law officers of the Federal. Parliament, and the law officers of the State of South Australia, the Parliament of that State acted in good faith in attempting to fill the vacancy which had occurred. But when there is an opportunity to have the matter decided by a more authoritative opinion than that of the law officers of the Commonwealth or of any State, we should take advantage of that opportunity. Some honorable senators have said that while they are agreed that all these questions should in future be dealt with by the High Court, they do not think it right that the High Court should deal with this particular case. I have no hesitation in saying that I think the Senate is not a fair tribunal to deal with any of these questions. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has said, we are all more or less biased in dealing with such matters by party considerations. I acknowledge that I am influenced by party bias in such matters, just as other honorable senators are, and when we realize that the Senate is not a fitting tribunal to deal with these questions we should, I think, adopt the only course that will be satisfactory to the Parliament and the people. It would be in no sense derogatory to the Government to accept my amendment. It is better that the Senate should be unanimous in a matter of this sort, and I have not heard any reason why the case should not be dealt with by the High Court. Although the Vice-President of the Executive Council has moved an amendment on the original motion, I think that, in view of the way in which the issue has been clouded by contrary opinions from legal members on either side and by a report which, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> is wrong and inconsistent, the best thing the honorable senator could do even now would be to accept the amendment I have moved. </para>

                        <para>. - I very, gladly accept the amendment which has. been submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> recognising as I do that it is strictly in accordance with the spirit of our electoral, legislation, and recognising, moreover, that, whether consciously or unconsciously, the Senate might have great difficulty in coming to a decision in the strictly impartial spirit with which judicial tribunals should deal with matters of this character. In the  circumstances, I think that the Senate will be consulting its own dignity and doing full justice by agreeing to refer this somewhat difficult and complicated question to a tribunal whose impartial judgment on a pure question of law will form a precedent for our guidance, seeing that that tribunal is eminently qualified, and was specially constituted, to deal with such questions. I willingly accept the suggestion which the amendment contains, that the necessary legislation should be introduced for the purpose of giving it effect. In all the circumstances, I think the Senate can congratulate itself upon having reached a happy compromise, and I strongly urge that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley's</inline> amendment should be unanimously accepted. </para>

I wish to say that I am very glad , that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has spoken in the way he has done, and has accepted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley's</inline> amendment.

I hope we can interpret <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> remarks as meaning that the Government recognise the urgency of the position, and will as soon as possible introduce the necessary legislation so that in the course of perhaps a week or two this matter can be referred, as we all desire, for the final decision of the High Court. </para>

In consequence of a ruling given by the  President  on a subsequent item, it appears that we have amended the item Coffee in a way that was not competent for us. That is why I propose to ask honorable senators to restore the item to its original form. </para>

                    (New South Wales) [9.32]. - I am astonished that my honorable friends opposite have, in their wisdom, but with a mercilessness which is hardly characteristic of them, thrown over the poor old Angora goat. There is to be mercy for copra and for raw coffee, as well as for tobacco leaf, but the Angora is to go. He is shot overboard, and there is no more of him. There is no place for the goat in this Bill. I have risen, however, particularly to draw attention to the rather odd position in which we are placed by our Standing Orders. As they have been under the consideration of the Standing Orders Committee for three months, I hope that the Committee will take into consideration the eccentricity of genius under which the present proceedings are taking place, because I take it that this particular outrage on parliamentary custom is a remnant that has escaped from some niche in the records of the South Australian Parliament. I do not think that it could have come from any other source.

                        <para>- Yes, I am, if it comes to that. Twenty-five years' experience in parliamentary proceedings are, perhaps, worth rather more than five years' acquaintance with them. The present practice is really absurd, and I am quite sure that the Standing Orders Committee will take it into consideration with a view of making a correction. After the ruling which you, sir, gave the other day, I do not think that there is any need for an alteration to be made in respect to coffee. Your ruling was confirmatory of a decision given by me as Temporary  Chairman  of Committees. My honorable friend Clemons laughs.  His  laugh is like the "crackling of thorns under a pot," as Solomon says. </para>

                        <para>- That sort of laugh is what Solomon refers to as having relation to " a fool and his folly." I am speaking, of course, from memory with respect to the schedule, but my recollection is that the amendment as to which the ruling was given would have involved a diversion of the grant originating in another place. In this particular case, there does not appear to have been any diversion. The amendment made was rather a limitation than an extension. But I am not sure whether I am not making a mistake as to what happened. I did not know that the matter was coming up now. Had I known that the Government intended to proceed with this business to-night I should not have consented to postpone the private business standing in my name. As to the tobacco item, I shall vote with the Government, but as to copra, I am against a recommittal. . We need not worry about spending money in growing copra in Australia, because we can get all we want from Papua. </para>

                    <para>. - When the Bill was previously before the Senate I suggested an amendment in sub-clause 2 of clause 3, with a view of enabling part of the bounty on account of jute to be given for the production of what is known as native jute. A great deal was said about the importance of producing jute in Australia. There was said to be a shortage of supply and a great demand for the article. I pointed out that there is in Queensland a native jute, which is really a wild hybiscus, growing over immense tracts of country, and that from it there is a chance of producing an article of commerce which can be successfully placed upon the market. I have a great deal of information on the subject. </para>

                        <para>- It is, but at present it costs 23s. a cwt. to get the fibre, whilst the price is only 20s. If the industry were developed, the price would be brought down, and the industry could be made profitable. At any rate, a bounty should meet the views of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> and others, who point out the necessity for a greater supply of jute than we have now. The amendment which I desired to move was upon the provision that the bounty shall be payable to growers or producers. Seeing that native jute grows in a state of nature, it is impossible to pay the bounty to the grower. Nature is the grower. If a bounty is to be paid it is necessary to amend the clause so as to enable it to be paid to those who produce fibre from the native hybiscus, just as the Bill enables the bounty to be paid to those who preserve or dry fish and fruits, and those who manufacture combed wool or tops. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall be very much surprised if the Senate agrees to the motion. The schedule to this Bill received, perhaps, closer attention than any matter that has ever come before the Senate has done. Practically, we spent a day on each item in the first schedule, and yet the Government come down to the Senate and say, "The only item on which we think you have passed an opinion which is worth anything is that of goats. You are a judge of goats, but of nothing else; We ask you to swallow your opinion on every subject except that of goats." If, after spending seventeen days on the Bill, the Senate is prepared to swallow its opinions and its votes, except in one instance, it will deserve not to be considered as a parliamentary institution. The Minister has given no reasons why any of these items should be reconsidered, except the item of coffee. In that case, the Senate is asked to assume that the  President,  if appealed to, would have ruled that the item could not be amended in that direction. That is, I think, placing the  President  in an unfair position, because he has not ruled on that item. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> pointed out, it is questionable whether the same arguments can be applied to that case as were applied to the case in which the  President  ruled that we could not amend. There is a further point on which I do not think the  President  has given a definite ruling, and that is whether, if we cannot amend, we can request an amendment. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has given good reasons why an alteration should be made. If we find that we cannot amend the item, it may be possible to request an amendment. At any rate, the Government have given no reason why we should reverse our vote on copra or tobacco leaf. The only reason I have heard with regard to tobacco leaf is that some senators lingered too long over their dinner, and, therefore, missed a division. Because of that occurrence, the Senate is asked, not only to reconsider that item, but also items in respect of which that excuse is not urged. I appeal to the Senate not to allow itself to be treated in that fashion. If ever a Bill received full and fair consideration this Bill did. After having recorded our opinions on the items in the schedule, it is paying a very poor compliment to the Senate when the Government come down and say that the only item on which they are prepared to accept our judgment is that of goats. </para>

                        <para>- The Government have accepted a modification of the item of combed wool or tops, but it is the same bounty, though expressed in a different way. Practically, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has accepted no decision of the Committee except in regard to mohair. The wonder is that that item ever came before us. It was doomed before it was reached. This course was not taken by the Government elsewhere. When the other House struck out certain items, the vote was regarded as final, but here we are asked to reverse our votes. I shall be much surprised indeed if the Senate accepts the amendment. If the other House thinks that we have invaded their constitutional right by making an amendment, let it acquaint us with the fact. We do not want to fight on a false constitutional issue, and the Senate will, I feel sure, be prepared to back down if it finds that if has taken up a wrong position. But the Government are not right in saying that you, sir, have ruled on that point because, so far as I can recollect, you were careful not to express an opinion when you were ruling on the other point. It has not been proved that there is any similarity between the two cases. I, therefore, urge the Senate to vote against the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I ask you, sir, if possible, to divide the motion, because it seems evident that, whilst several senators will agree to recommit one or two items in the schedule, it is not likely that the whole Bill will be recommitted. I cannot agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> with regard to the item of coffee. I admit with him that you have not yet given a ruling that it is analogous to the item of tobacco. But if it is, I think we must all agree that it is most undesirable that the Senate should send down to another place a Bill containing an item which it refused to alter because it regarded such an alteration as outside its power, while it contains an item which represents a violation of its rights. It is desirable that we should recommit the Bill with regard to the item of coffee. It maybe that you, sir, when it is recommitted, will rule that the item, as printed now, is in order, but I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will agree with me that if you rule that it is not in order it is very desirable that the Senate should effect that change rather than that it should be told to do so by another place. I think it is desirable to recommit the Bill for that purpose, but I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> view with regard to the other items. Surely a Bill has never been threshed out at greater length than has this Bill. I believe it is literally true that we spent a day on each item. Surely the Government ought to 'be satisfied with that consideration, especially as they will have another opportunity of submitting their views. If the other House does not accept our alterations, we may reconsider the position when the Bill is returned. Personally, I hope that we shall adhere to our position. Surely it is more desirable to adopt that course than to ask the Senate to turn a somersault. One could understand the Government asking us to reverse our decision, because of a debate which had taken place elsewhere, but when nothing fresh has transpired the Government take a poor course when they come here and say. " We have no additional reasons to give, but we simply ask some of you to vote in a different direction." It does not conduce to the dignity of the Senate to be asked to turn topsy-turvy so often. For the reasons I have given, I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> to modify his motion for a recommittal, and allow the Senate to put itself in' order with regard to coffee, if that ought to be done. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the result will be just the same if a vote is taken again. If, however, the Ministry think that our. decision ought to be altered, let them ask the other House to make the necessary amendment, and afterwards we can take a vole on the item. I point out to the Minister that to move for a recommittal of the Bill on a Thursday night, at nearly  10  o'clock, is not quite fair to the members of the Senate. I suggest that under these circumstances he should hesitate before he asks the Senate to recommit the Bill. In this matter the hour is important, because it is not usual to ask the Senate to recommit a Bill and to reverse a decision, at  10  o'clock, when, I venture to say, not a single senator expected that the business would be brought on. I urge the Minister to withdraw the motion for the present. </para>

                    <para>. -  The Government have no desire to' place honorable senators in a false position or in a difficulty in regard to particular items. In this case the usual course has been taken of asking for a reconsideration of several items, ft will be remembered that there are several features which justify such a reconsideration. Take, for instance, the item of tobacco. It has been complained by several senators that although they were in the vicinity of the building they had no opportunity of voting on that item. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator should not say that. Is it usual to have a fuller attendance than we have at the present moment? Is the Government asking anything which is unreasonable? I endeavour to meet honorable senators in every reasonable way I can, but would we have been justified in asking the Senate to adjourn at twenty minutes past  9  o'clock when there was other business on the notice-paper? I think that honorable senators might well agree to recommit the Bill and allow us to deal with the items. </para>

                    <para>. -I know the circumstances in connexion with the division that was taken upon the item " Tobacco, leaf." The question was about to be put before the suspension of the sitting for lunch on a Friday, and actually was put a few minutes after the resumption of the sitting at  2  o'clock, when some honorable senators might not have had time to get back. There is, therefore, some reason for affording them an opportunity to deal with the matter again, but if that opportunity is to be afforded to them the whole Senate should be given notice of it. An alternative course has been suggested to the Government. We are not dealing with the Bill finally now. If we send it back to another place in the form in which it now stands, and another place disagrees with what we have done, we shall have another opportunity of considering it. The Senate appears to be generally agreeable to recommitting one item. Why not recommit that one to-night, and deal with the other items to-morrow ? </para>

                    <para>- The honorable senator will not be in order on the motion before the Senate in debating the Bill. The only questions he can consider are - Whether the Bill shall be printed ; and whether the second reading of the Bill shall stand an Order of the Day for tomorrow. He can, if he pleases, give reasons for or against the adoption of the course proposed in the motion. </para>

                        <para>- I was anxious to state that this Bill has a strong relationship to a Bill which was introduced in the Senate in the last Parliament, and in which I was successful in having embodied certain labour conditions. </para>

                        <para>- Order ! I point out to the honorable senator that he will not be in order in debating the Bill at all at the present time. He is at liberty to advance reasons pertinent to the questions as to the printing of the Bill and the date on which it shall be considered, but I cannot allow any debate on the merits of the Bill at this stage. </para>
